                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Approximately 33% of people who contracted COVID-19 still experience symptoms 12 weeks after infection onset. This persistence of symptoms is now considered a syndrome itself called ‘long COVID’. Evidence regarding long COVID and its cognitive and physical impacts is growing, but the literature is currently lacking objectively measured data to guide towards adapted healthcare trajectories. The objectives are to describe the physical and cognitive impairments experienced by individuals living with long COVID using self-reported and clinical objective measures, and to compare the evolution over time of the physical and cognitive state between adults living with long COVID (at least one physical or cognitive COVID-19 symptom for more than 12 weeks following infection; long COVID group), people who developed COVID-19 but did not experience persistent symptoms (short COVID group) and people who did not develop COVID-19 (control group).</p>

                  <p>In this longitudinal cohort study, 120 participants will be recruited in each group. Variables will be collected through three evaluation sessions over 6 months (baseline, 3 months, 6 months). Variables include self-administered questionnaires on health-related quality of life, comorbidity, sleep, pain, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and cognitive function, as well as objective measures of cognitive (attention, memory, executive functioning) and physical (grip strength, balance, gait speed, gait endurance, VO2, frailty) functions. Activity, heart rate and sleep will be monitored with a fitness tracker watch for 7 days following evaluation sessions. Maximum-likelihood analyses of variance (ANOVAs) will be used to compare data at baseline between groups. Repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to compare the longitudinal performance variations across groups of the self-reported and clinical variables.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving daily with the ongoing vaccination efforts and the new variants emerging. As of April 2022, over 500 000 000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> One-third of people infected by COVID-19 self-declare still experiencing symptoms 12 weeks after their primary infection.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> People who have signs and symptoms that developed during or after a COVID-19 infection and that have continued for more than 12 weeks are understood to suffer from long COVID (also known as post-COVID syndrome).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Multiple definitions of long COVID currently exist, and the absence of a consensual and universal nomenclature makes the understanding of this phenomenon and its prevalence challenging.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) refers to long COVID when an individual experiences symptoms for more than 4 weeks and defines more precisely the persistence of symptoms beyond 12 weeks as ‘post-COVID-19 syndrome’.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, the National Institute for Health Research defines long COVID as symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which is the definition adopted for the current project.</p>
              <p>Commonly reported symptoms that persist in long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle weakness, joint pain, headache, cognitive dysfunction, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep-related difficulties.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 6</xref> Some individuals also experience post-traumatic stress disorder.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> The spectrum of reported symptoms in those experiencing long COVID has been so large that it is assumed that after COVID-19, a patient may develop persisting dysfunction of almost any organ system.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In addition to being highly heterogeneous,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> symptoms vary in time, with some people experiencing constant symptoms, and others, intermittent symptoms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, evidence is only emerging regarding who will develop long COVID. For example, women seem more likely to develop long COVID.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Other findings show that individuals who were hospitalised and more severely ill during hospitalisation seem to present more severe persistent symptoms.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Although evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is growing exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the duration and importance of the physical and cognitive symptoms experienced over time are not well understood.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Results of studies to date have predominantly been based on self-reported symptoms, answers to self-reported questionnaires, retrospective data from hospital medical charts or on fundamental research. For example, studies using self-reported questionnaires showed that the median frequency of self-reported dyspnoea is 36%, of self-reported fatigue is 40.0%, of self-reported depression and anxiety are 15% and 22%, and of self-reported cognitive deficits is 17.6%.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Although self-reported symptoms have high value to understand the symptoms experienced,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> current evidence does not provide sufficient prospective objectively measured data on the physical and cognitive impairments experienced by people with long COVID.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Among the studies that have looked at these impairments, a cross-sectional study showed an increased prevalence of muscle weakness in long COVID patients, with muscle weakness up to 86% compared with the predicted normal values.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Another study showed long COVID sequalae involving the cardiovascular system, as demonstrated by imaging analysis, which may be related to symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnoea and fatigue.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Imaging analysis has also shown hypometabolism in some regions of the brain in long COVID patients. These abnormalities could explain cognitive impairments, pain and insomnia.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies that quantified prospectively the severity and evolution of those symptoms with objective clinical tests.</p>
              <p>Prospective studies on long COVID have so far focused on previously hospitalised patients who experienced a critical form of COVID-19.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For example, a prospective study with this population reported a desaturation under 88% in 7% of participants by the end of a 6 min walk test, 3 months after symptom onset.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In another study, 14% of participants had a Short Physical Performance Battery score ≤10 at 3–6 months after hospital discharge, which shows an overall impaired physical function.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Still, there is a lack of data regarding those who were not critically ill in the first place, but who still experience long COVID.</p>
              <p>In light of the increasing burden of COVID-19, gaining a greater understanding of the physical and cognitive state and level of functioning of persons with long COVID will help better define healthcare needs of these persons and guide the development of appropriate medical and rehabilitation interventions and healthcare trajectories. Hence, the objectives of this study are (1) to describe the physical and cognitive impairments and functional limitations experienced by individuals with long COVID using self-reported and objective clinical measures, and (2) to compare the evolution over time of the physical and cognitive state and level of functioning between: (A) people with long COVID, (B) people who developed COVID-19 but did not experience persistent symptoms and (C) people who did not develop COVID-19.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>One hundred and twenty adults with long COVID symptoms (long COVID group), 120 age-matched adults who developed COVID-19 but did not experience persistent symptoms (short COVID group) and 120 age-matched adults who did not develop COVID-19 (control group) will be recruited. All eligible participants will be 18 years of age or older and be able to participate in three in-lab evaluation sessions within 6 months. Participants assigned to the COVID groups will have received a positive result from COVID PCR or rapid antigen testing at least 12 weeks prior to inclusion. Participants assigned to the long COVID group will present at least one physical or cognitive long COVID-19 self-reported symptom for more than 12 weeks following the infection such as fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle weakness, joint pain, headache, cognitive dysfunction or sleep-related difficulties, as defined by NICE.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Participants assigned to the short COVID group will not have experienced any persistent symptom for more than 4 weeks after having developed COVID-19.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Participants assigned to the control group will not have received a diagnosis of COVID-19 and will not have experienced any COVID-19 symptoms since February 2020 such as fever, sudden loss of smell, dyspnoea, great fatigue, muscle or body aches or shortness of breath.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> No antibody or serology tests will be performed to determine if participants in the control group have been in contact with COVID but have not developed or experienced COVID symptoms.</p>
                <p>Participants will be recruited through medical clinics in Quebec City and Montreal (eg, family medicine groups and long COVID Clinics), electronic mailing lists of students, employees and retired employees at Université Laval, and social media (Facebook). As more than 78 095 individuals in the Quebec City area and 287 035 in the Montreal area have developed COVID-19 as of March 2022 and that up to 33% are known to develop persistent symptoms,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 20</xref> we are confident in being able to recruit the targeted number of participants. Pilot testing began in summer 2021. All participants are expected to be enrolled by winter 2023 with final follow-up assessments finalised by fall 2023.</p>

                <p>Two patient partners were recruited among healthcare professionals from the province of Quebec (Canada) who developed COVID-19 during the first wave (spring 2020). Our aim was to have one patient partner who had persistent symptoms of COVID-19 (long COVID) and one who developed COVID-19 but did not have symptoms for more than 4 weeks (short COVID). Patient partners were involved in the selection of outcomes and in the decision process regarding the in-lab evaluations modalities, to ensure an optimal balance between outcome collection and potential exacerbation of symptoms in the long COVID group. They also participated in reviewing the study protocol.</p>

                <p>Eligibility criteria will first be confirmed during a screening call with a research associate. After screening, all included participants will receive an email with a link to the online informed consent form. Once the consent form will have been electronically signed, they will be asked to complete the baseline web-based self-administered questionnaires (hosted on the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform) evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQoL), comorbidity, sleep quality, pain and pain-related disabilities, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and cognitive function. These questionnaires have been selected to address the most commonly reported symptoms by individuals with COVID.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 6</xref> The long COVID group will also complete a questionnaire on frequent COVID-19-related symptoms. Participants will have the possibility to complete the web-based questionnaires over a period of 5 days, in case they experience fatigue or cognitive impairments, or by phone if they do not have internet access. As some participants may start filling out the questionnaires, pause and forget to finalise them, the evaluator will verify on REDCap that all questionnaires have been completed before the in-lab evaluation. If they are not, participants will be asked to complete them during the in-lab evaluation.</p>
                <p>Within 1 week of inclusion, all participants will complete the in-lab baseline evaluation at the Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche en réadaptation et en intégration sociale (Cirris) in Quebec City or at the Centre de recherche de l’Hôpital Maisonneuve- Rosemont (CRHMR) in Montreal. During this in-lab evaluation, participants will answer questions on sociodemographics (eg, age, sex, gender, ethnicity, smoking, income, education, employment, residential postal code), medications used and vaccination status. Weight and height will also be measured. Participants in the COVID groups will also answer questions on COVID-19 medical history (onset, variant, hospitalisation, intensive care, treatments received, number of episodes) and on COVID symptoms they have experienced since onset (nature, frequency, duration). Then, objective clinical tests will be performed on all participants to assess cognitive (attention, memory, executive functioning) and physical (grip strength, balance, gait speed, gait endurance, VO2 and frailty) functions. Finally, all participants will be asked to wear a fitness tracker watch (Garmin Forerunner 35) for 7 days to monitor heart rate, physical activity and sleep in their real-life environments. Evaluators will not be blind to which group the participants are in. Since individuals with long COVID can fatigue quickly, evaluators need to be aware which participants have long COVID in order to ascertain their condition and avoid deterioration of their condition.</p>
                <p>Three and 6 months after the baseline evaluation, all participants will be asked to complete the follow-up web-based self-administered questionnaires on REDCap (same questionnaires as baseline) and to take part in the in-lab follow-up evaluations at Cirris and CRHMR. During the in-lab follow-up evaluations, participants will first be questioned on sociodemographics that may have changed since baseline, on any COVID symptoms experienced, and on any interventions received since the previous evaluation. Then the same cognitive and physical clinical tests will be performed and they will again be asked to wear a fitness tracker for 7 days to monitor the same parameters as in baseline.</p>

Participants assigned to the control group could get infected with COVID-19 during their participation to the project.

Notably, a sociodemographic and COVID history profile of the long COVID group will be presented according to sex, gender, hospitalisation, time since onset and number of comorbidities. Scores at baseline on self-reported and clinical variables will also be described and compared with the short COVID and control groups via a three-group one-way ANOVA. The type of ANOVA will depend on data distribution. The first choice is a maximum-likelihood ANOVA (SPSS, proc GENLIN). If not possible (eg, data not normally distributed, ordinal variables), the package rankFD of the R statistical software, a rank-based non-parametric equivalent with multivariate capacities, will be used.</p>
                  <p>For objective 2, repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the divergence in longitudinal performance variations across groups in the self-reported and clinical variables up to the 6-month follow-up (3 groups × 3 times). The first option is a generalised ANOVA for repeated measures (GEE), a maximum-likelihood technique. If not possible (eg, unstable distribution across groups or time), a rank-based non-parametric equivalent is offered by the nparLD package of the statistical R software. Both ANOVAs may work with non-normal distributions and unstructured covariance matrices between repeated measures. With these ANOVAs, missing data do not require to withdraw participants or impute data.</p>
