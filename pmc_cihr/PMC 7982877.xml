                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a well-established strategy for the prevention of infectious diseases, in which recently exposed people take a short course of medication to prevent infection. The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r 800/200 mg twice daily for 14 days (intervention arm) versus no intervention (control arm), using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged &gt; 6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, assuming the secondary attack rate in ring members (<italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>) = 15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>, ICC, and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Participants who test positive at baseline will be excluded from the primary analysis but will be maintained for additional analyses to examine the impact of LPV/r on early treatment.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par25">The lack of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2, potential for pauci-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, basic reproductive number of roughly 2.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], case fatality estimates of up to 7.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and lack of evidence-based therapies mean that the prevention of new COVID-19 cases is critical to controlling the pandemic. Encouragingly, highly effective preventive vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in settings worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the high transmissibility of the pathogen and the many implementation challenges in achieving high vaccine coverage mean that combination approaches to COVID-19 prevention will remain important in the future. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a well-established strategy for the prevention of infectious diseases such as HIV, in which recently exposed people take a short course of medication to prevent infection. COVID-19 PEP has been identified early as a research priority by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">Several lines of evidence suggest that the antiretroviral lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r, marketed in Canada as Kaletra™) is one drug that may have meaningful antiviral activity against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Molecular data show that LPV/r has activity against the SARS-CoV protease M<sup>pro</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while in vitro and animal data show that it has activity against the closely related Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A small observational study in South Korea suggested that LPV/r PEP decreased the risk of infection in healthcare workers exposed to MERS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">An initial clinical trial in China found no definite treatment benefit of LPV/r in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but was underpowered for the primary endpoint of mortality, and initiation of LPV/r was late in the course of COVID-19 disease. There was also a potential for imbalance in baseline characteristics (higher viral load, later presentation, more severe illness in the LPV/r arm) to influence the outcomes. Secondary endpoints hinted at potential benefit (numerically lower mortality, shorter ICU/hospital stay) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As noted by many observers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the results underscore the need for more LPV/r trials. While subsequent results from the SOLIDARITY and RECOVERY trials showed no impact of treatment with LPV/r on mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], data are lacking on the impact of this drug when used for prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The safety of LPV/r is already well-established, since it has been widely used in HIV treatment and PEP for over 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While it can cause temporary gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], discontinuation due to side effects was uncommon in HIV PEP trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Drug interactions are well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], although the large number of potential interacting agents can pose clinical challenges. LPV/r is safe in pregnancy, liver disease and at all levels of renal function including dialysis and is available in liquid form to facilitate use in children and adults who cannot take pills/tablets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is also available worldwide, including in resource-limited settings. Thus, the feasibility of LPV/r as COVID-19 PEP is high if shown to be effective, and it is critical to develop evidence regarding its use.</p>
                <p id="Par29">This trial will examine the efficacy and safety of a 14-day course of LPV/r as PEP in close contacts of individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. All items in the WHO trial registry data set can be found in the protocol (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par45">The COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention trial with Lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is an open-label, cluster-randomized trial of lopinavir/ritonavir versus no intervention for preventing microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The CORIPREV trial will use an adaptive approach to the selection of study drug, with consideration of switching to an alternative promising agent after interim analyses are completed and/or considering external data.</p>
                <p id="Par46">The trial will use a ring-based approach to delivering these preventive strategies, adapting a novel cluster trial design recently used in the 2013–16 West African Ebola epidemic in the <italic>Ebola ça suffit</italic>! trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The approach is to define a ‘ring’ of exposed contacts around COVID-19 cases, and to randomize rings (i.e., clusters) to study drug or control (no study drug) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This design maximizes statistical power by recruiting those at highest risk. It also has the potential to create a buffer of protected people around cases, such that if the drug works for prevention, the trial itself may limit transmission. Further, some COVID-19 cases may lead to “super-spreading” events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; this variability is taken into account by defining index cases, rather than exposed contacts, as the unit of randomization. Ring vaccination has been a key part of the successful eradication of other highly transmissible infectious diseases such as smallpox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par72">The intervention is a 14-day course of LPV/r 400/100 mg (administered as two 200/50 mg tablets) orally twice daily, to be initiated as soon as possible and no later than 8 days after the latest exposure to the index case. Individuals 6 months of age and older who are unable to swallow tablets will be administered the liquid formulation of LPV/r, at equivalent weight-based dosing according to the product monograph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The 14-day duration is based on COVID-19’s estimated incubation period of 6.4 days (95% credible interval = 5.6–7.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], with a maximum expected incubation period similar to SARS/MERS at 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par73">This dosing regimen was selected based on extensive clinical experience in the setting of HIV treatment and prevention. Of note, in the setting of HIV treatment, an alternative dosing strategy of 800/200 mg once daily has been evaluated and shown to be non-inferior to twice daily dosing for that indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, because the pharmacodynamics for LPV/r’s potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood, this trial will recommend twice daily dosing.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                <p id="Par74">There are no protocol-defined criteria for discontinuing or modifying the study interventions. However, a special circumstance may arise if one individual is identified as part of more than one ring, either sequentially or simultaneously. The approach taken in these situations will be based on the temporal sequence in which study staff make contact with the individual (not the timing of the person’s exposure to the relevant index cases).</p>
                <p id="Par75">If notification of this situation to the participant occurs sequentially, and the participant’s initial ring had already been randomized to the control situation (no intervention), then for ethical reasons, the participant should be given the choice of whether to re-enroll in the second ring, since this re-enrollment may provide the opportunity to be randomized to the study drug. The decision regarding re-enrollment in the second ring must be made prior to randomization of that second ring; once randomization has occurred the participant cannot switch their ring affiliation. If the participant is already taking study drug at the time they are notified about membership in a second ring, then they are not eligible to re-enroll in the second ring. If the participant is not currently taking study drug at the time of notification, they may be eligible to re-enroll if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.</p>
                <p id="Par76">If a participant is simultaneously notified about membership in two or more rings, the participant should be offered the choice of which ring they wish to be affiliated with. This decision must be made prior to randomization of either ring. It is anticipated that such decisions may be based purely on convenience considerations (e.g., a participant may wish to be affiliated with the same ring as other family members).</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par77">Participants in the active arm of the trial will receive a few doses of dimenhydrinate 50 mg (for management of nausea) and loperamide 2 mg (for diarrhea) in their study kits, in order to help manage potential gastrointestinal side effects of the study drug.</p>
                <p id="Par78">Of note, the study team considered a loading dose of LPV/r at baseline (400/100 mg four times on day 1, followed by twice daily to complete 14 days total) in order to optimize the pharmacokinetics of this drug against SARS-CoV-2. However, this strategy was not selected due to concern that it may be associated with an increased risk of side effects that could compromise further adherence with the study drug.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Adherence will be monitored in two ways. First, participants in the active arm will be asked to complete a daily electronic symptom diary which asks whether each dose was early, on time (within 3 h), late, or forgotten/missed. Second, a random ~ 30% subset of participants in the active arm will have a self-collected dried blood spot collected at day 14 for testing of plasma lopinavir levels as a biomarker of adherence and to assess for a pharmacokinetic correlate of protection. Because these levels can be affected by hematocrit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], this subset of participants will also undergo a complete blood count at the day 35 in-person visit, together with the routine blood draw for serology.</p>

                <p id="Par80">Use of LPV/r together with medications cleared through cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A) can lead to elevated plasma concentrations of the concomitant medication. LPV/r also induces glucuronidation which may affect the exposure of some drugs. Medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease serum concentrations of LPV/r, respectively. These drug-drug interactions may lead to adverse reactions, loss of therapeutic effect of the concomitant medication, and/or loss of antiviral activity of LPV/r.</p>
                <p id="Par81">Site investigators must therefore review concomitant medications at the time of enrollment. A full list of contraindicated medications appears in the study protocol in Appendix A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the use of any of these products that cannot be substituted during the study dosing period is an exclusion criterion for the study. For other medications and/or supplements that are not on the list of contraindicated medications, site investigators must assess the risk of drug-drug interactions, and adjust medication doses accordingly. Study pharmacists with extensive experience with LPV/r use will provide advice to investigators regarding the management of drug-drug interactions as needed, via email or telephone consultation.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Co-enrollment into other regulated clinical trials of COVID-19 prevention is permitted, but details of the co-intervention must be documented under the concomitant medication section or other suitable part of the database.</p>

                <p id="Par109">At baseline, study staff will conduct interviews to capture baseline characteristics of the study sample, including demographics; exposure assessment (relationship with case patient; timing/intensity/frequency of contact; protective measures taken during contact); medical history (comorbidities, medications, smoking) and symptoms.</p>
                <p id="Par110">To obtain specimens for viral RNA testing (primary outcome), participants will be instructed on self-collection of oropharyngeal/nasal swabs as in prior work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], for RT-PCR testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Specifically, participants are asked to swab the back of their tongue, followed by the throat, before inserting the swab up to 4 cm into each nostril and rotating at least twice. These instructions are also provided in a short instructional video. Specimens will be collected at baseline, day 7, day 14 and within 24 h of new symptoms. In participants who are asymptomatic, a second self-collected swab will also be collected at day 14 and combined in the same specimen vial, or a saliva specimen will be collected if swabs are not available, since having two respiratory specimens tends to increase sensitivity for the detection of respiratory viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. (If a participant has an earlier swab that is PCR positive then only one swab/saliva specimen needs to be collected at day 14.) Nasopharyngeal swabs and deep respiratory samples (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage/endotracheal tube aspirates) already done for clinical care purposes will also be collected, with biobanking of specimens not tested in real-time for future analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par111">Follow-up interviews will be conducted at days 7, 14, 35, and 90 to assess for adverse events and clinical outcomes (hospitalizations, mechanical ventilation, mortality). Symptom data will be collected using daily electronic questionnaires that will be emailed daily for days 1–14. Participants will also be provided with a thermometer with which to record their temperature daily on days 1–14.</p>
                <p id="Par112">Methods for serologic testing of COVID-19 are still in development at the time of writing, but are rapidly emerging. At the baseline visit, participants in the active arm will self-collect dried blood spots for future testing for SARS-CoV-2 serology. These specimens will only be collected for the active arm since these participants will already be obtaining a finger-prick blood sample for HIV testing. All participants will undergo venipuncture at day 35 for batch testing of SARS-CoV-2 serology at the conclusion of the study. Self-collected saliva samples at days 1, 7, and 14 will also be used for antibody detection.</p>
                <p id="Par113">At day 14, participants will be asked to complete the K10, a short ten-item scale to measure non-specific psychological distress, as part of their electronic questionnaire.

                <p id="Par141">The DSMC is an independent group of four individuals with expertise in clinical trials, infectious diseases, and biostatistics, appointed by and advisory to the Steering Committee. The DSMC will remain standing until the end of trial accrual. All DSMC members are expected to remain free from perceived or actual conflict of interest throughout their involvement in the trial and will be asked to complete a conflict of interest form at the start of their involvement in the DSMC. The DSMC Charter is posted at the study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.optionslab.ca/projects/coriprev">www.optionslab.ca/projects/coriprev</ext-link>) and is a living document that may be revised at regular intervals if needed.</p>
                <p id="Par142">Of note, the World Health Organization has established a process to promote data-sharing between individual clinical trials of COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis, PEP, and treatment globally. After each review meeting, the CORIPREV-LR DSMB will confidentially share its closed report with DSMCs monitoring other, closely related clinical trials; the DSMCs for these other trials will do the same. This process will enhance the ability of each DSMC to provide optimal oversight to the individual trials regarding safety and efficacy without jeopardizing the integrity of each trial.</p>

                <p id="Par143">An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant, administered a study medication/intervention, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) study medication/intervention, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) study medication/intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par144">During each follow-up visit with the participant, information on AEs will be gathered by study coordinators using open-ended questions about any untoward medical occurrences and documented accordingly. AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adverse Events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and assessed for causality as probably related, possibly related, unlikely to be related or not related to the study drug (investigational arm only). Data will be reported on AEs of any grade, whether expected or unexpected, regardless of causality assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par145">Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as AEs that are life-threatening; result in death, hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hospitalization; or result in significant disability or a congenital anomaly, with the exception of developing COVID-19, which will be captured as an outcome instead. SAEs must be reported to the Project Manager within 24 h of the site becoming aware of the event; the Project Manager will ensure prompt reporting to regulatory authorities.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par149">The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced an urgent need for rigorous clinical trials. There is a particularly pressing need for novel prevention tools. Worldwide, society remains in various states of strict isolation in large part because our primary prevention modalities include physical distancing and the use of barrier precautions such as face masks. Importantly, a variety of vaccines have now been demonstrated to have high efficacy in preventing COVID-19. However, vaccine coverage is likely to remain insufficient to control the pandemic in most global settings for many months or years. Key implementation challenges include manufacturing delays, distribution challenges, vaccine hesitancy, and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Hence, ongoing research into alternative prevention modalities is still warranted, including the use of chemoprophylaxis. The CORIPREV-LR trial will generate high-quality evidence on whether a safe, existing drug prevents COVID-19 in close contacts of individuals with confirmed infection. If results are positive, LPV/r could immediately be deployed for this purpose, including in low-, middle- and high-income settings. Even if negative, the global availability of LPV/r means trial results will be impactful, by limiting off-label use.</p>
              <p id="Par150">An important consideration in the conduct of COVID-19 prevention trials is the need for vigilant infection control measures to limit the risk of onward transmission. To overcome this concern, this trial and others like it will conduct the majority of study interactions with participants remotely. While a minority of study visits may only be feasible through a telephone connection, the widespread availability of video-enabled smartphones and of secure platforms for online videoconferencing will allow most visits to be conducted through video-link. These measures will help to protect study personnel from potential exposure and facilitate participant observance of self-isolation directives, while still allowing study staff to visually ensure compliance with critical research procedures. In particular, the remote trial format also necessitates the use of specimen self-collection, including oropharyngeal/nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing and dried blood spots for serologic and pharmacokinetic assays. Our trial incorporates only a single in-person visit, at day 35, for the collection of venous blood samples for serologic testing.</p>
              <p id="Par151">To date, several clinical trials of COVID-19 PEP have already been completed and reported. An initial team of American and Canadian investigators randomized 821 asymptomatic adults who reported a household or occupational exposure to someone with COVID-19 within the preceding 4 days, to receive either hydroxychloroquine or placebo, and noted no statistically significant difference in the incidence or either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a compatible illness over the subsequent 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. A shortcoming of this trial was that the availability of microbiologic testing for outcome ascertainment was limited, such that infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in only 14% of participants with symptomatic disease. Our trial will overcome this limitation by using specimen self-collection, and testing of these samples within 24 h for SARS-CoV-2. Two subsequent trials of hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 PEP have similarly shown no impact of that drug on acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using microbiologically confirmed infection by PCR as the primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par152">Another novel feature of our trial design is our inclusion of baseline testing for COVID-19 in all participants. This approach will further allow us to explore the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir in the early treatment of COVID-19, since those who test positive at baseline will continue all study activities. Despite high-quality trials demonstrating that lopinavir/ritonavir is not effective as treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, questions about its efficacy in early-stage treatment and prophylaxis remain unanswered. Only one other clinical trial is examining the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir as COVID-19 PEP, using an individual-randomized design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].</p>
