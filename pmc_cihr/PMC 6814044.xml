                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Recent estimates suggest an 11% prevalence of current late-life depression (LLD) and a lifetime prevalence of 16–20%. LLD leads to cognitive disturbance as well as a nearly two to three times increased risk of dementia. We conducted a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) which demonstrated that <italic>Sahaj Samadhi</italic> meditation (SSM), an easy-to-implement, meditation-based augmentation strategy, led to higher rates of symptom remission when compared to treatment as usual (40.0 vs 16.3%; odds ratio, 3.36; 95% CI 1.06–10.64; <italic>p</italic> = 0.040). Here we present a protocol describing a two-site, blinded, RCT, comparing an SSM arm to an active-control arm – a Health Enhancement Program (HEP) intervention – in their ability to reduce depressive symptoms and improve executive functioning, among several other exploratory outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">One hundred and ninety-two (<italic>n</italic> = 192) participants with LLD will be recruited at two sites (London, ON, Canada, and Montreal, QC, Canada). Participants will undergo stratified randomization with regards to site and the presence of treatment-resistant-LLD (TR-LLD) or not, to either SSM or HEP. We will assess change in (1) depression severity using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), (2) executive functioning, and (3) other exploratory physiological and mood-based measures, at baseline (0 weeks), post intervention (12 weeks), and 26 weeks after baseline. Raters, clinicians, and care providers will be blinded to group allocation while participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This study should more definitively assess whether SSM can be used as an augmentation strategy in routine clinical care for patients suffering from LLD and TR-LLD. If the effects of SSM are significantly better than HEP, it will offer support for the routine use of this intervention to manage LLD/TR-LLD and comorbid declines in executive dysfunction. The results of this study could also inform whether SSM can improve/prevent cognitive decline in LLD.</p>

                <title>Late-life depression</title>
                <p id="Par50">The older adult population is growing worldwide with those aged 60 years and older to comprise over 22% of the global demography by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In some regions of the world, such as North America, this shift is predicted to occur within the next 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An estimated 15% of individuals within this age group are currently living with a mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Late-life depression (LLD), specifically, has been found to have a current prevalence of 11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and a lifetime prevalence of 16–20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Direct healthcare costs incurred through treatment of LLD patients are approximately 33% higher than for their non-depressed counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and have been reported to be as high as CAD$5 billion per year in Canada, alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indirect costs (e.g., informal caregiving; suicide) have been reported to be as high as CAD$1.8 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These considerable costs could be reduced by the successful treatment of LLD and its treatment-resistant variant (TR-LLD).</p>
                <p id="Par51">The standard treatment for LLD is the use of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and/or psychotherapy. These current treatments, however, have significant limitations. Patients are frequently not able to tolerate adequate doses and, as such, there is often poor compliance with pharmaceutical-based treatment plans. In addition, the monoamine theory of depression does not seem to address other psychosocial circumstances which have been implicated in the precipitation and maintenance of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given the above, it is no surprise that treatment resistance (TR) is prevalent in up to 60% of patients with LLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also, it has also been shown that as many as 30% of patients with LLD discontinue their antidepressants within 6 months of initiation due to drug-related adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par52">Alternatives to pharmaceutical management of LLD include various psychotherapy interventions. Such evidence-based interventions include problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite the efficacy of these therapies there is often a lack of trained professionals, inability to access this care, or, in patients where therapy is available, a wait time of up to 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The prevalence of LLD, associated costs, lack of response to pharmacotherapies, and difficulty accessing conventional psychotherapies and pharmacotherapy consultations raises the need to find novel, cost-effective, and scalable interventions for this important mental health disorder.</p>

                <title>Depression, dementia, and other related risks/illnesses</title>
                <p id="Par53">A depressive episode has been found to nearly double a person’s chance of developing dementia as shown by previous meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Studies also have demonstrated that 30–50% of LLD patients show impairments in cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, patients with LLD report impairments in memory, attention, information processing, and executive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Executive functioning, in particular, has been found to be directly associated with LLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This executive dysfunction persists and significantly interferes with treatment responsiveness in LLD and has been implicated as one of the most important markers for conversion to dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the United States alone, the healthcare costs associated with managing dementia have been calculated to be as high as USD$215 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Even though there are effective care models established for dementia, its irreversible nature highlights the importance of investigating the preventive potential of various non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise- and meditation-based therapies.</p>
                <p id="Par54">LLD and TR-LLD are also associated with a multitude of health comorbidities. These include: stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], anxiety, suicidal ideation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], lower quality of life, increased medical comorbidity, and higher mortality rates compared to age-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Attempts have been made to understand the neurobiology of LLD and TR-LLD and, so far, a host of brain and other systems have been implicated including cortisol dysregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], cardiovascular autonomic impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], gait disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], increased presence of inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], as well as structural and functional brain changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is hence important to assess changes, if any, in these pathophysiological pathways. It is possible that any new treatment strategy for LLD and/or TR-LLD could lead to reversal of these changes.</p>

                <title><italic>Sahaj Samadhi</italic> meditation</title>
                <p id="Par55">Recent research has shown benefits of some mind-body (e.g., yoga, <italic>tai chi</italic>, mindfulness) interventions in reducing depressive symptoms across the age span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. <italic>Sahaj Samadhi</italic> meditation (SSM) is a less-investigated meditation intervention which differs from others as it lets the practitioner attain a deep state of relaxation aided by the use of a personalized mantra, which is to be used only when needed, during the meditation practice. It does not require focus on one’s thoughts or environment, on mindfulness or on frequently repeating a mantra as in focus-based meditation techniques.</p>
                <p id="Par56">The authors conducted a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) on SSM in LLD compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) arm. It was observed that those in the SSM arm had a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms compared to the TAU arm (mean point-change difference − 2.66; 95% CI − 5.05 to − 0.26; <italic>p</italic> = 0.030), with 40% of SSM participants entering remission compared to 16.3% in the TAU arm (odds ratio of 3.36; 95% CI 1.06 to 10.64; <italic>p</italic> = 0.040) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There were no reported side effects associated with SSM. Additionally, participants’ qualitative feedback included remarks stating that SSM is easily learned and can be practiced as part of a daily routine. The observed practical benefits of SSM included relative affordability, the ability to be taught in a group setting, and easy transferal to community/clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. SSM may additionally ameliorate the cognitive impairments associated with LLD and TR-LLD as other transcendental meditation techniques – practiced twice a day, 2 days per week, for 12 weeks (as in the present study) – have shown improvements in this domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, there is some pilot data to suggest that the category of meditation to which SSM belongs, namely automatic self-transcendental meditation (ASTM), positively affects immune responses to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par57">For the purpose of further exploration of the beneficial effects of SSM we plan to conduct a study with the primary hypothesis that SSM, compared to an active control, will lead to a significant improvement of depressive symptoms in participants with LLD at 12 weeks and that this effect will persist at 26 weeks. We will also examine a secondary hypothesis that SSM leads to an improvement in other variables including executive function. Exploratory outcomes will be changes in anxiety, quality of life, gait, and central as well as peripheral immune function.</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p id="Par58">The objective of this study is to compare the effects of <italic>Sahaj Samadhi</italic> meditation (SSM) on related psychological and biological outcomes against an active control, the Health Enhancement Program (HEP).</p>
                <p id="Par59">Primary outcome: the primary outcome measure will be change in depression scores in the SSM arm compared to HEP at 12 weeks. We will also assess the percentage of SSM participants who will meet the clinical criteria for remission compared to HEP at 12 weeks. Lastly, we will assess whether participants in the SSM arm will continue to have reduced depression scores at the 26-week follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par60">Secondary outcome: the secondary outcome measure will be a neuropsychological battery for assessing executive function with an emphasis on planning and organization ability, at the primary endpoint of 12 weeks.</p>

Participants will attend three assessment sessions (baseline/0 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks) in a research-hospital setting.</p>
                <p id="Par63">Participants will attend either SSM or HEP for four consecutive days of training for 2 h per day. Following the 4 days of initial training, participants will attend 1-h weekly follow-up sessions of HEP or SSM for 11 subsequent weeks. See Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for an outline of the study assessments and the intervention schedule. A subset of participants will be recruited in an exploratory sub-study examining neurobiological brain changes associated with depression and any changes in depressive symptoms, with magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning to take place at the 0-week and 12-week time points. Patients will also be offered the opportunity to participate in sub-studies designed to assess the effects of SSM versus HEP on (1) gait as measured by a standardized gait mat, (2) peripheral inflammatory markers, (3) sleep as measured by a proprietary Actigraph, and (4) change in level of mindfulness, awareness as well as shifts in level of consciousness.

The order in which the copied/recalled image is drawn composes the planning score. For example, participants who start with larger, identifiable features (i.e., “configural elements”) score more points than participants who begin their drawing with the details (i.e., “clusters”). The continuity of pen strokes on copied/recalled image drawings creates the fragmentation score. For example, is a line drawn with a single pen stroke or did the participant have to extend the line? The fragmentation and planning scores will be then combined to generate an organization score. Age-scaled norms will be used to create scaled scores for each of these outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

                  <p id="Par74">The CVLT-II is a tool used to assess verbal learning and memory that has a built-in measure of semantic organization (clustering). Participants are read to and asked to repeat a list of nine words four times aloud. Following a brief distraction task (counting backwards from 100 by 1’s for 30 s), participants will be asked to recall the list with no cue. After a 10-min delay, participants will be once again asked to recall the list of nine words. They will then be asked to recall which items in the list are fruits, then clothing, then tools. Additionally, participants will read a separate list of words that contains items from the original nine items and items that were not. Participants may answer “yes” if the word is from the original nine and “no” if it is not. Following another 5-min break, participants will read nine pairs of words and will have to identify which of the two words was on the original list of nine words. Scores will be determined by recording correct and incorrect responses on each task as well as semantic clustering during free-recall trials. Raw scores will be used to assess overall performance on the CVLT-II, with higher correct responses and lower incorrect responses indicating good acquisition and retention of verbally encoded information and higher semantic clustering scores indicating greater use of inherent semantic organization within the word list as an indicator of executive functioning. Age- and education-level-scaled norms will be used to create scaled scores for each of these outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>

In the second task the participant will be instructed to recite a series of numbers in backward order. For the final task, the rater will ask participants to re-order the numbers in mind, from lowest to highest. Participants will score points for accurately reciting number series. Two lists of equal length (e.g., three numbers) will compose a “trial.” Participants will always attempt both number series within a trial but need only one correct response to proceed to the next trial. Correctly reciting one list is 1 point, with a total of 2 points per trial. Each task has as many as eight trials. The task is ended when participants fail a trial (e.g., two incorrect responses) and the rater then moves onto the next task. Scaled scores are generated for the total score achieved on each task (that is, forward, backward, sequencing) and the longest digit span (LDS) for each task (e.g., how many numbers are in the longest series they correctly responded to). We are also are generating a reliable digit span (RDS) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which uses the number of digits read in the last trial for which they received a perfect score (both lists correctly recited: e.g., if there were four numbers in the last perfect trial, their RDS = 4).

The first subtest, letter fluency, asks participants to name as many words as possible that begin with a certain letter in 60 s. Participants perform this task three separate times for three separate letters: “F,” “A,” and “S” (names, numbers, place names, and variations of the same word are not accepted as correct responses). The category fluency subtest asks participants to list as many items they can think of within a category in 60 s. Participants perform this task twice for two separate categories: “animals” and “boys’ names.” The final subtest is the category-switching task in which participants are asked to switch between naming fruits and naming furniture. Participants, once again, have 60 s to complete this task. Participants are given points for correctly provided responses and lose points for repetitions or set-loss errors (i.e., not adhering to the rules of the subtest). In the category-switching subtest participants are additionally scored on every successful “switch” they make from fruits to furniture. A scaled contrast score will be generated which compares letter fluency (total correct) and category fluency (total correct).</p>

The third task asks participants to read a sheet with words on it printed in colored ink (“red,” “green,” or “blue”; “inhibition” task), and instructs participants to only name the ink color in which the words are printed (red, green, or blue) and not read the word; the ink color differs from the color names. Three raw scores are taken from each task: time to complete the task, incorrect responses, and corrected responses (e.g., if a participant says the wrong color or word but immediately corrects). Scaled scores will be generated for the completion times of the color-naming, word-reading, and inhibition tasks. Scaled scores for cumulative errors made by participants during the inhibition task will also be generated. We will be using scores generated from the inhibition task in our analysis.</p>

                  <p id="Par93">A 7-Tesla MRI machine, located at RRI in London, ON, will be used to gather magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional, and structural data of the hippocampi and the posterior cingulate cortices (PCCs), as well as fronto-striatal connectivity at the resting state. During the scanning session, instructions will be presented to the participant through MRI-compatible headphones. The scanning session will include: a three-dimensional Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) scan for structural measurements; 8 min of a T2 (echo planar imaging (EPI))-sequence during the eyes-open resting state; and a MRS from the hippocampal and PCC voxels collecting using simplified localization by adiabatic selecting refocusing (semi-LASER), in line with a previously established MRS protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. MRS will be used to measure levels of glutathione (GSH). Given the time for equipment set-up and scanning, scanning procedures are expected to take close to 1 h for completion.</p>

Participants will be asked to walk along the walkway and perform various tasks in a single length of the device: (1) complete a normal walk down the walkway; (2) count backwards from 100 by 1; (3) name as many animals as possible; (4) count backwards from 100 by 7; and (5) walk as fast as possible without running down the walkway. A normal walking pace will be gathered using the device prior to the above tasks. This task will be completed at the London (ON, “Canada”) site only and will be conducted in the Brain and Gait laboratory of Dr. Manuel Montero-Odasso, located at the Parkwood Institute in London, ON, Canada.</p>

Additionally, participants will be stratified to the presence of treatment resistance (TR) or not. Stratification and randomization will be conducted by an independent statistician based in London, ON. An independent member from administrative staff at the London site will receive the list of randomization and save it on a secure electronic database with access available to the principal investigator (PI) only if the code needs to be broken in an emergency. This process will ensure that group allocation remains concealed from raters, clinicians and care providers. Due to the nature of the intervention being behavioral in nature, it is not possible to blind participants to study arm assignment.</p>

Both interventions will require the attendance of 2-h training sessions over four consecutive days. Participants will also attend 1-h follow-up sessions once per week for the remaining 11 weeks and be asked to practice the trained technique at home for 40 min per day. “Practice logs” will be provided to participants to record their daily practice of the trained technique.</p>

                <p id="Par101">This is the experimental arm of the study. It will be delivered at both sites by trained, certified non-clinician instructors available from our collaborative partner, The Art of Living Foundation. During the first day of training, participants will learn the nature of meditation and then have a personal, guided meditation using a mantra, to be brought into their awareness, if the need arises. On days 2–4, there will be a focus on understanding the nature of the mind and the thoughts arising from it, additional guided meditation by the instructor(s), and a discussion of correct/incorrect meditation practices. The first 4 days of training will be 2 h each. Weekly follow-up sessions (1 h) will include 20 min of guided meditation practice. Participants will be trained and be able to discuss with instructors how to respond to the experiences that arise during meditation, what enhances or detracts from effective meditation, and review methods to support meditation at home. The uniqueness of SSM arises from the ultimate goal of quieting the mind until an individual is “aware of awareness.” The goal of SSM is to attain a state of automatic self-transcendence. All SSM participants will be asked to practice SSM at their own homes, twice a day, for the duration of the study. Compliance with this request will be reviewed through assessment of daily practice logs given to all participants.</p>

This intervention will allow us to control for several non-specific factors found in a meditation group intervention such as group support/morale, behavioral activation, reduction of stigma, facilitator attention, treatment duration, and time spent on at-home practice. Additionally, we will ensure that HEP matches the time commitment of SSM. The HEP modules will include information sessions on health promotion, healthy diet, self-care, music, and exercise. However, participants will not learn any breathing techniques or meditation. All HEP participants will also be asked to complete daily practice logs. Time commitments to the HEP are identical to those for SSM: 4 days of 2-h training sessions followed by 1-h follow-up sessions for 11 weeks, coupled with 40 min of daily at-home practice.</p>

                <p id="Par104">Recruitment is expected to occur over a 26- to 36-month period at a rate of two participants per week (total of <italic>n</italic> = 192). See Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for a schematic diagram. It is estimated that a sample of 192 participants will offer sufficient power for the primary outcome (HRSD-17). This sample size calculation is based on an estimated effect size from our pilot data from participants with LLD undergoing SSM or treatment as usual (TAU). Over the 12-week intervention, participants in the SSM group had significant change in HRSD-17 scores when compared to the TAU group (2.66 (95% CI 0.26 to 5.05) point greater reduction; Cohen’s D = 0.61, <italic>p</italic> = .030). Assuming an average cluster size of 4–10 participants and a 1:1 allocation between the SSM and HEP groups, 192 participants will allow us to observe a 2.6-point difference in HRSD-17 scores between the two groups at a two-tailed α = 0.05 and 1 − β = 0.80. A 2.5-point difference is considered to be clinically significant among consensus expert reports and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it a minimum standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. A 16% rate of attrition for this study is a conservative estimate based on our previously observed 13% attrition rate in the SSM versus the TAU study. As such, it is predicted that approximately 160 of the planned 192 recruited participants will complete the study and we will still have adequate statistical power.</p>

This approach will account for the clustering of observations, since both SSM and HEP will be delivered in a group setting. Next, we will evaluate whether a greater proportion of participants assigned to SSM, compared to HEP, achieve depression remission (defined as a HRSD-17 score ≤ 7 at the 12-week follow-up) using generalized linear mixed models (hypothesis 1B).</p>

For assessments that are self-rated, participants will complete a REDCap-generated survey. Collected data will be continually reviewed by the research staff to ensure accuracy of completion. All changes in REDCap will be automatically logged to ensure the fidelity and integrity of the study data.

                <p id="Par108">Exit interviews will be conducted at week 12 for all withdrawn participants willing to attend. These exit interviews will include all week 12 study procedures. Study participants will be remunerated at a rate of CAD$20 per assessment visit for the main study and CAD$80 per visit if participating in the MRI sub-study. To prevent undue burden, participants will be offered regular breaks during study assessment procedures as well as flexibility of attending these procedures either over one whole day or two consecutive half days, based on their personal preference. It is expected that the baseline assessment procedure will need 6–8 h of participant time while follow-up assessments at 12 and 26 weeks will each be 4–6 h long. If a participant chooses to withdraw at any time during the study, they will be allowed to do so. However, the research staff will try and ascertain from the participant the reason for withdrawal and document these reasons. If a participant is unable to adhere completely with this study protocol, all reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate their needs and requests. If there is significant deviation (greater than 1 week from an expected assessment point), they will be considered as a withdrawal from the study. All such withdrawals and deviations will be recorded on REDCap.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par112">The current protocol describes a newly funded research project which will assess the efficacy of SSM compared to HEP in reducing depressive symptoms, improving neuropsychological symptoms as well as inform key neurobiological mechanisms of action. This study builds on our previous RCT of SSM compared to TAU which found that SSM had three times higher remission rates (40.0% vs 16.3%; odds ratio, 3.36; 95% CI 1.06–10.64; <italic>p</italic> = 0.040), as an augmentation strategy compared to TAU alone, in patients with LLD. Additionally, SSM was found to be easy to learn, can be taught to a group, and is scalable. As such, SSM can, therefore, be positioned to be offered as an augmentation therapy to TAU for individuals with LLD and TR-LLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par113">This study protocol describes the use of an active-control group, rater blinding, and validated tools to collect depression-related data, executive function scores, as well as a number of exploratory outcome measures. Our study protocol should allow us to collect this data reliably and with a high degree of fidelity. This protocol offers a brief outline of the planned study procedures. We hope to not only assess the effects of SSM through a rigorously designed RCT including an active-control group, but also to collect crucial initial data (e.g., neuroimaging and serum biomarkers) regarding the mechanisms of action of this intervention. If we find positive effects of SSM, it will offer a better understanding of the extent of response with SSM and/or an active-control intervention, HEP.</p>
              <p id="Par114">Our extensive battery of assessments will allow us to measure neuropsychological changes associated with the effects of SSM and/or HEP. In addition, we will be able to assess the effects on other key pathophysiological variables, including the planning and organization components of executive function, gait, sleep, mindfulness, consciousness, structural, functional, and MRS imaging (details available on request), as well as measurement of anti-inflammatory markers.</p>
              <p id="Par115">Our battery of neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging of brain regions associated with executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] may aid future studies in better understanding the potential benefits of SSM and/or HEP on these processes and systems. Our selection of key executive function tasks is inclusive and gives adequate priority to the assessment of planning and organization, key cognitive domains affected in LLD and TR-LLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our study protocol will also allow us to correlate changes, if any, in GSH, with simultaneous changes in brain volume and functional imaging in the hippocampi and the PCCs. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuroimaging battery is being offered in patients with LLD and/or TR-LLD receiving a meditation-based intervention. Findings from this study could hence potentially lead to a better understanding of the link between neuroinflammation and brain changes associated with LLD.</p>
              <p id="Par116">By examining other physiological outcomes, such as gait, consciousness, sleep, and blood inflammatory markers, we will be building on our understanding of how LLD affects a number of key central and peripheral organ functions.</p>
              <p id="Par117">Overall, if the planned study is successful, there would be evidence to support SSM as an augmentation to TAU among older adults with LLD and/or TR-LLD. The other main benefits of this study would be to offer valuable insight into the potential applicability as well as mechanism of action of SSM in routine clinical practice. Future studies could examine the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.</p>

Additionally, our neuropsychological, neurobiological, and physiological outcomes could help inform our understandings of the mechanisms and comorbidities of LLD, as well as its biological basis.</p>
