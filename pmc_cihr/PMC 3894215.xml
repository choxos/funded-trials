                <p>Carriage of the genetic combination encoding a high expression inhibitory Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR)3DL1 with its ligand, HLA-B*57 (<italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic>) is associated with slower time to AIDS and better HIV viral load control than being a <italic>Bw6</italic> homozygote (<italic>Bw6hmz</italic>). Natural Killer (NK) cells from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> carriers receive potent educational signals through HLA-B*57 KIR3DL1 ligation leading to high functional potential. NK cells from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> are not educated through KIR3DL1 because Bw6 antigens do not interact with this inhibitory receptor. To better understand the impact of KIR/HLA combinations on NK cell mediated anti-viral activity we measured NK cell mediated inhibition of HIV replication in autologous infected CD4 (iCD4) cells by assessing the frequency of p24 positive CD4 targets and supernatant levels of HIV p24 longitudinally in the presence versus absence of NK cells. Forty-seven HIV uninfected subjects were studied, including carriers of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic>, a low expression <italic>KIR3DL1</italic> genotype with <italic>HLA-B*57</italic> termed <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic>, a genotype designated <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic> and <italic>Bw6hmz</italic>. NK cells from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> carriers, like those from <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic> subjects, inhibited HIV replication in autologous iCD4 cells better than those from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> and <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers. Cell contact between NK and iCD4 cells activated NK cells to inhibit viral replication in a non-contact dependent fashion through secretion of CC-chemokines. iCD4 stimulated NK cells from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> and <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic> carriers produced higher levels of CC-chemokines than those from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> or <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers. Higher levels of CC-chemokines were produced by KIR3DL1<sup>+</sup> than KIR3DL1<sup>‚àí</sup> NK cells. We conclude that NK-mediated inhibition of viral replication in autologous iCD4 cells is partially due to a block at the level of HIV entry into new targets by secreted CC-chemokines.</p>

                <p>Natural Killer (NK) cells function in anti-tumor and anti-viral defenses, including those directed against HIV. HIV infected cells can activate NK cells, which, once activated, inhibit HIV replication in infected targets. NK cell activation levels depend on the interaction of cell surface receptors on NK cells with the molecules (or ligands) they recognize on neighboring target cells. One receptor-ligand combination has been identified to have a strong effect on slowing time to AIDS, HIV viral load control and NK cell activation potential. We compared anti-HIV NK cell responses in individuals with this NK receptor-ligand combination to those from subjects having NK receptor-ligand combinations associated a neutral effect on time to AIDS. NK cells inhibited HIV replication in autologous infected cells more potently when they came from individuals with NK receptor-ligand (KIR/HLA) gene combinations associated with slow versus typical time to AIDS. Inhibition of HIV replication was due to secretion of factors (chemokines) that bind and block the co-receptor HIV uses to enter susceptible target cells. NK cells from subjects with KIR/HLA combinations associated with potent NK cell anti-HIV activity secreted more chemokines than those from subjects with KIR/HLA combinations associated with weak anti-HIV NK cell activity.</p>

              <p>NK cells function in innate immune responses to transformed and virally infected cells. They can exert their anti-viral effects soon after encountering infected targets without prior sensitization <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Stetson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. NK cell function is determined by signals from activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors, which include Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Lanier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Among these are inhibitory KIR3DL1 (3DL1) and activating KIR3DS1 (3DS1) receptors, which are encoded by alleles at the same <italic>KIR3DL1/S1</italic> locus <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Bashirova1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. 3DL1 receptors can be classified into those expressed on NK cell surfaces at high levels (*h) low levels (*l) or *004, which is only transiently expressed <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Pando1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="ppat.1003867-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. 3DL1 homozygous genotypes can be dichotomized into <italic>*h/*y</italic> and <italic>*l/*x</italic> groups where <italic>*h/*y</italic> genotypes encode receptors expressed on the NK cell surface at higher levels than those encoded by <italic>*l/*x</italic> genotypes <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Yawata1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Epidemiological studies have found that several 3DL1 homozygous genotypes co-carried with a subset of <italic>HLA-B</italic> and <italic>‚ÄìA</italic> alleles belonging to the <italic>HLA-Bw4</italic> group are associated with slower time to AIDS and viral load (VL) control <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. HLA-Bw4 antigens differ from the remaining HLA-Bw6 (Bw6) antigens by amino acids at positions 77‚Äì83 <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The genotype combinations that confers the highest degree of protection in terms of time to AIDS and VL control is <italic>3DL1*h/*y</italic> co-carried with <italic>HLA-B*57</italic> (<italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic>) <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Subjects with this combined genotype are more frequent among HIV Exposed Seronegative (HESN) than HIV susceptible individuals, implicating carriage of this genotype combination in reducing HIV infection risk <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Boulet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. NK cells from carriers of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> have more potent NK cell functional potential as defined by HLA-null cell induced secretion of IFN-Œ≥ and TNF-Œ± and expression of CD107a, a marker for degranulation, than those from carriers of the receptor or ligand alone, including those from carriers of the <italic>*l/*x+B*57 KIR/HLA</italic> genotype and <italic>Bw6</italic> homozygotes (<italic>Bw6hmz</italic>) <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Boulet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kamya1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Bw6 antigens do not interact with 3DL1 receptors and are thus unable to educate NK cells through this inhibitory NK receptor <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Gumperz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. NK cell education is an ontological process that depends on the interaction of inhibitory NK receptors, such as 3DL1, with their MHC class I (MHC-1) ligands. The strength of educational signals received during NK cell development determines NK cell functional potential <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Anfossi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, NK cells from <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers may be less functional than those from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> positive subjects since the former express less 3DL1 than the later and thus receive lower level educational signals upon interaction with the same ligand <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Yawata1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kamya1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Boulet2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The KIR/HLA combination 3DS1 co-expressed with a Bw4 antigen having an isoleucine at position 80 of the HLA heavy chain (3DS1+*80I) is also associated with slower time to AIDS and VL control <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Martin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. NK cells from carriers of the <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic> genotype inhibit viral replication in autologous HIV-infected CD4 (iCD4) T cells more potently than those from individuals carrying the receptor or ligand alone, or neither <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Alter1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Together, these functional studies suggest that the association of certain <italic>KIR/HLA</italic> genotypes with either protection from HIV infection in HESN subjects or slow time to AIDS and VL control in those who are HIV infected, is linked to NK cell function.</p>
              <p>How NK cells inhibit viral replication in autologous CD4 T cells is not completely understood.</p>
              <p>One possibility is through the secretion of the CC-chemokines CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 upon activation following recognition of autologous HIV iCD4 cells. These chemokines can suppress HIV replication by competing with the virus for binding the CCR5 co-receptor and blocking HIV entry into CD4 cells <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Cocchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Oliva1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this report we investigated whether NK cells from individuals carrying <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> inhibited HIV replication in autologous HIV iCD4 cells better than those from <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers and <italic>Bw6hmz</italic>. The cell contact requirement for inhibition of viral replication was assessed. We also measured the production of CC-chemokines by NK cells stimulated with autologous HIV iCD4 cells. We determined whether CC-chemokine secretion levels differed based on the <italic>KIR/HLA</italic> genotype and evaluated the effect of CC-chemokine neutralization on NK cell mediated inhibition of HIV replication.</p>

                <p>CD4 cells from 17 individuals were infected with HIV and co-cultured with or without autologous NK cells at an NK‚à∂iCD4 ratio of 10‚à∂1 and 1‚à∂1. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003867.s001">Fig. S1</xref> shows that NK cells inhibited viral replication, at all times tested and at both NK‚à∂iCD4 ratios. For the 10‚à∂1 and 1‚à∂1 NK‚à∂iCD4 cell ratios there were no significant between time point differences in viral inhibition (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.15 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.42, Friedman test). Viral inhibition was significantly higher at days 7 and 10 for the 10‚à∂1 versus 1‚à∂1 NK‚à∂iCD4 ratio (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.51, 0.002 and 0.008 for days 3, 7 and 10, respectively, Mann-Whitney test). The higher viral inhibition levels seen in wells containing NK and iCD4 cells at a 10‚à∂1 ratio compared to a 1‚à∂1 ratio or for iCD4 cells cultured alone could have been due to differences in the number of cells in these culture conditions. For example, it was possible that higher cell numbers limited cell survival and this is what led to inhibition of HIV replication. To rule out this possibility we compared the number of live CD4 cells present at days 7 and 10 of culture between conditions where NK and iCD4 were cultured at 10‚à∂1 with those where iCD4 were cultured alone. No significant differences in CD4 numbers were found (not shown). Based on the 10‚à∂1 NK‚à∂iCD4 T cell ratio showing more potent inhibition of viral replication than the 1‚à∂1 ratio, we used the 10‚à∂1 ratio for subsequent experiments.</p>

                <title>NK-iCD4 cell contact contributes to NK cell mediated inhibition of HIV replication</title>
                <p>NK cell mediated inhibition of viral replication was assessed by measuring the frequency of intracellular HIV-Gag-p24 positive CD4 cells using anti-p24 specific KC57 monoclonal antibody (mAb). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003867.s002">Fig. S2</xref> shows the gating strategy used to assess the percent of p24 positive CD4 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003867-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> depicts flow cytometry plots showing the frequency of p24 positive CD4 cells at day 7 for several culture conditions for a single individual. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003867-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> shows longitudinal results for up to 12 subjects, 5 on day 3, 10 on day 7 and 12 on day 10. In the presence of NK cells (NK+iCD4) the frequency of p24 positive CD4 cells was lower than that in cultures of iCD4 cells alone (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.18, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.002 and p&lt;0.001 for day 3, 7 and 10, respectively, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). When NK and iCD4 cells were cultured in different transwell chambers (NK/iCD4 TW), which prevents NK and iCD4 cell contact, the frequency of p24 positive CD4 cells was significantly higher than in conditions where NK and iCD4 were cultured together either in regular wells or the same chamber of a transwell (NK+iCD4 or NK+iCD4 TW versus NK/iCD4 TW, p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons at days 7 and 10, Wilcoxon). However, the frequency of p24+ CD4 cells in the NK/iCD4 TW condition remained below that observed in iCD4 cells (p‚â§0.002 for comparisons at days 7 and 10). These results implicate NK iCD4 cell contact as a contributing factor in suppression of virus spread. However, since abrogating NK and iCD4 contact does not return the percent of p24 positive CD4 cells to levels seen in iCD4 cells cultured alone, non-contact dependent mechanisms are also likely involved in NK cell mediated inhibition of HIV replication.</p>

                <p>If iCD4 cells and co-cultures of NK and iCD4 cells are incubated in upper and lower transwell chambers, respectively, the frequency of p24 positive CD4 cells in the upper chamber (iCD4 TW) is lower than that seen when only NK cells are present in the lower chamber (NK/iCD4 TW) (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.007 and p‚Ää=‚Ää0.08 for days 7 and 10, Wilcoxon). These results suggest that contact between NK and autologous HIV iCD4 cells produces soluble factors that can then suppress HIV spread in the same well or cross a transwell membrane to suppress the spread of HIV in iCD4 cells physically separated from NK cells.</p>

                <p>We questioned whether autologous iCD4 cells could activate NK cells to secrete CC-chemokines. We reasoned that if this were the case, these soluble factors could be responsible for inhibiting HIV replication under conditions where iCD4 are either co-cultured with NK cells or in a separate transwell chamber from NK+iCD4 cultures.</p>
                <p>We assessed CC-chemokine secretion under several conditions at days 1, 2 and 3 of culture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003867-g002">Fig. 2A‚ÄìC</xref> show that PHA stimulated HIV iCD4 cells co-cultured with NK cells and recombinant human IL-2 (IL-2) (NK+iCD4+IL-2) produced CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 at higher levels than do either NK cells alone with IL-2 (NK+IL-2), NK cells cultured with uninfected CD4 cells and IL-2 (NK+CD4+IL-2) or iCD4 cells with IL-2 (iCD4+IL-2) (p&lt;0.05 for all CC-chemokines on each day tested, Kruskal-Wallis test). All pair-wise comparisons between CC-chemokine levels secreted in the NK+iCD4+IL-2 condition and those in each of the other 3 conditions were statistically significant, except for those between NK+iCD4+IL-2 and NK+CD4+IL-2 for CCL5 at days 1, 2 and 3 (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.07, 0.25 and 0.34, respectively, Dunn's post-test comparisons). NK cells cultured without IL-2 and CD4 cells, whether PHA stimulated or not, HIV infected or not and cultured with or without IL-2 produced low levels of the 3 CC-chemokines in the range of 200 pg/ml or lower (data not shown). Thus, NK cells stimulated by autologous HIV iCD4 cells and IL-2 are a source of secreted CC-chemokines and produce more CC-chemokines than NK cells or iCD4 cells alone culture media containing IL-2.</p>

Comparisons of percent inhibition of HIV replication between NK+iCD4+neutralizing Abs to all 3 CC-chemokines and NK+iCD4 with either no Abs or antibodies to single CC-chemokines were significant for all comparisons except one at days 3 and 7 (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon). The exception was the comparison of percent inhibition between NK+iCD4+neutralizing Abs to the 3 CC-chemokines and NK+iCD4 with no Abs (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.23, Wilcoxon). None of the comparisons for percent inhibition at day 10 achieved statistical significance. These results indicate that iCD4 stimulated NK cell secretion of CC-chemokines contributes to inhibition on HIV replication.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this report we showed that NK cells cultured with autologous iCD4 cells limit the spread of HIV resulting in a lower frequency of HIV iCD4 cells and lower levels of viral replication compared to iCD4 cells cultured alone. Contact between NK and iCD4 cells stimulates NK cells to produce soluble factors, which suppress HIV replication in a non-contact dependent fashion. NK cells activated by autologous iCD4 cells in the presence of IL-2 secrete CC-chemokines at higher levels than when only IL-2 is present. CC-chemokine secretion is responsible, at least in part, for the inhibitory effect of NK cells on viral replication. <italic>KIR/HLA</italic> genotype influences the potency of inhibition of viral replication. We showed that NK cells from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> and <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic> carriers, genotypes associated slower time to AIDS and VL control, inhibited HIV replication more potently than did those from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> and carriers of the <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic>genotype. NK cells, and in particular the 3DL1<sup>+</sup> subset of NK cells, from carriers of the <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> genotype secrete higher levels of CC-chemokines than those from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> and <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> subjects.</p>
              <p>The superior control of HIV replication in autologous iCD4 cells by NK cells from carriers of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> versus those from <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> and <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> subjects implicates NK cell education as a determinant of this anti-viral NK function. NK cell education is important for the development of self-tolerant NK cells and for endowing NK cells with the capacity to mediate cytokine/chemokine secretion and cytolysis upon encountering cells with reduced MHC-I cell surface expression such as occurs in the context of HIV infected targets <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The ligation of inhibitory NK receptors such as 3DL1 is required for NK education but the process is tuned by the set of signals received from all the NK cell surface activating and inhibitory receptors interacting with their ligands on neighboring target cells <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Brodin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="ppat.1003867-Fauriat1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The stronger the inhibitory signals received during NK cell education the broader and more potent the effector functions that NK cells will have against appropriate targets <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Brodin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The <italic>*h/*y+B*57 KIR/HLA</italic> combination appears to be a particularly potent one for NK cell education, since NK cells from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> carriers showed higher functionality when stimulated with HLA-null cells than those from carriers of <italic>3DL1*h/*y</italic> genotypes co-carried with other <italic>Bw4</italic> or <italic>*80I</italic> alleles, <italic>3DL1*l/*x</italic> genotypes co-carried with <italic>B*57</italic> or those from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003867-Kamya1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Boulet2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The difference in functional potential between NK cells from carriers of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> versus those from <italic>3DL1hmz</italic> who carry other <italic>Bw4</italic> alleles may reflect differences in the impact of HLA-B*57 versus other Bw4 antigens in providing educational signals to NK cells during development. Transgenic mice expressing single MHC-I alleles have been used to show that MHC-I antigens differ in their impact on NK cell education <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The strength of the inhibitory input during education, as determined by the strength of the interaction between inhibitory NK receptors and their ligands, is directly related to the functional responsiveness of individual NK cells <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Brodin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, it appears that B*57 differs from most other Bw4 molecules in the strength with which it interacts with 3DL1 to educate NK cells. NK cells from <italic>3DL1*h/*y</italic> positive subjects express higher levels of 3DL1 inhibitory receptors than those from <italic>3DL1*l/*x</italic> positive individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Yawata1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> The observation that NK cells from <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers secrete less CC-chemokines and inhibit HIV replication more poorly than those from <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> carriers may be related to less potent NK education due to lower levels of cell surface 3DL1 mediating lower inhibitory signals for NK cell education, even in the presence of the potent B*57 3DL1 ligand. A caveat to this interpretation is that while there is experimental evidence that B*57 binds 3DL1 it has not been demonstrated that the affinity of the interaction between these 2 molecules is greater than that between 3DL1 and other Bw4 molecules because different peptides influence 3DL1 Bw4 binding <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Fadda1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Vivian1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the presence of the same epitope and 3DL1 receptor HLA-Bw4*80T variants bind with about 60% of the affinity of B*57 <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Vivian1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The impact of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> on NK cell education and the relationship between NK education and NK cell responsiveness may underlie epidemiological findings that carriers of this genotype have a lower risk of HIV infection and in those who become infected have a slower time to AIDS and lower VL than carriers of other <italic>3DL1 hmz Bw4</italic> genotypes, including <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Boulet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The influence of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> on NK cell education may also play a role in the superior ability of NK cells from carriers of this <italic>KIR/HLA</italic> genotype to inhibit viral replication in autologous HIV infected cells compared to those from <italic>Bw6hmz</italic>.</p>
              <p>It is notable that the frequency of p24 positive CD4 cells in conditions where NK and iCD4 cells are in separate transwells is lower than that of iCD4 cells cultured alone but higher than that of iCD4 cells and NK cells cultured together. This implies that NK-CD4 cell contact contributes to NK cell activation and secretion of soluble factors that can inhibit HIV replication in a non-contact dependent manner. IL-2 by itself can also activate NK cells to secrete soluble factors such as CC-chemokines, though at lower levels than when iCD4 cells are also present. This may be why the percent of p24+ CD4 cells in conditions where iCD4 and NK cells are in separate transwell chambers is not as high as when iCD4 are cultured alone. It is not known whether these soluble factors are limited to CC-chemokines. Simultaneous neutralization of the CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 restored HIV replication measured at 3 and 7 days of culture to levels that were significantly higher than when NK and iCD4 cells were co-cultured in the absence of CC-chemokine neutralization. Neutralization of all 3 CC-chemokines was not sufficient to reduce NK cell mediated inhibition of HIV replication at day 10 of culture. The reason for this is unclear but may be due to the continued production of chemokines over and above the amounts that anti-CC-chemokine Abs are able to neutralize. High inter-subject variability precludes making a clear determination as to whether CC-chemokine neutralization is sufficient to reverse NK cell mediated inhibition. It is possible that iCD4 stimulate NK cells to inhibit HIV replication by other mechanisms in addition to CC-chemokine secretion. These activities could target other stages of the HIV replication cycle and may or may not be dependent on contact between NK and iCD4 cells.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that NK cells secrete CC-chemokines following stimulation through CD16 cross-linking and co-culture with iCD4 cells in the presence of IL-2 <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Oliva1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Here we report for the first time that a KIR/HLA genotype combination that influences the potency of NK cell education also determines the level of CC-chemokines that NK cells secrete in response to autologous iCD4 cells. CC-chemokines can bind CCR5, the HIV co-receptor, and prevent HIV from interacting with this receptor thus reducing HIV entry <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Cocchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Oliva1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Transwell experiments implicate cell contact as a factor in NK cell stimulation leading to CC-chemokine secretion.</p>
              <p>Pelak et al. reported that in carriers of <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic>, the copy number of 3DL1 alleles influenced NK cell mediated inhibition of HIV replication in autologous iCD4 T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003867-Pelak1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Copy number variation (CNV) is common at the <italic>3DL1/S1</italic> locus. Screening for CNV at this locus revealed no duplications or deletions at this locus among subjects having the 4 genotypes focused on in this study. Therefore, CNV at the <italic>3DL1/S1</italic> locus can be excluded as a factor influencing the experimental findings reported here.</p>
              <p>In summary, we show that NK cells from carriers of <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic> inhibit HIV viral replication in autologous iCD4 cells more effectively than those from <italic>*l/*x+B*57</italic> carriers and <italic>Bw6hmz</italic>. The level of anti-viral function of NK cells from carriers of this genotype is likely related to NK cell education arising from B*57 interactions with high expression inhibitory 3DL1 receptors. Anti-viral function is mediated at least in part by CC-chemokine secretion levels able to block HIV entry into CD4 cell targets. The higher level of CC-chemokine secretion by NK cells from carriers of protective versus non-protective KIR/HLA genotypes may underlie their superior ability to inhibit HIV replication in infected targets.</p>

Stimulated CD4 cells were then washed three times with cRPMI supplemented with 2% FBS (R2), and cultured in R10 with 100 IU IL-2 for 3 days. On day 4, CD4 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 with HIV-1<sub>JR CSF</sub> in R10 for 4 hrs and washed three times with R2. Equal numbers (3.0 to 4.0√ó10<sup>4</sup>) of these iCD4 cells were plated at NK‚à∂iCD4 ratios of 10‚à∂1, 1‚à∂1 or alone for 10 days in 300 ul of R10; 100 IU/ml IL-2. Supernatants were collected by removing supernatants and replenishing wells with 300 ul of fresh R10; 100 IU/ml IL-2 on days 3, 7 and 10 for assessment of p24 levels and on days 1, 2 and 3 for assessment of CC-chemokine levels.</p>
                <p>For some experiments CD4 cells were collected on days 3, 7 and 10 for intracellular Gag p24 staining. Cells were stained with an Aqua amine reactive fluorescent dye (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) to identify viable cells. Cell surface staining with anti-CD3 APC-eFluor 780 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and anti-CD4 PE (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada) were used to detect CD4 T cells. After fixation and permeabilization intracellular HIV Gag p24 positive cells were detected using the mAb KC57 (Beckman-Coulter, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Acquisition was done on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Between 50,000 and 200,000 events were acquired per sample.

NK cells from individuals with the following <italic>KIR/HLA</italic> genotypes were used for this figure: <italic>*h/*y+B*57</italic>(n‚Ää=‚Ää3), <italic>3DS1+*80I</italic> (n‚Ää=‚Ää2), <italic>Bw6hmz</italic> (n‚Ää=‚Ää4) and other <italic>KIR/HLA</italic> (n‚Ää=‚Ää8). Each point represents a separate individual. The lines and error bars through the scatter plots show the mean and standard error of the mean for that group. Lines linking groups indicate comparisons where means were significantly different. Friedman tests were used to compare the mean values at different time points for the same NK‚à∂iCD4 cell ratios. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used to compare different NK‚à∂iCD4 cell ratios at the same time point. ‚Äú*‚Äù‚Ää=‚Ääp&lt;0.05, ‚Äú**‚Äù‚Ää=‚Ääp&lt;0.01.</p>
