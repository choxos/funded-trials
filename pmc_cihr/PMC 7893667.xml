                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>In response to the burden of chronic disease among older adults, different chronic disease self-management tools have been created to optimise disease management. However, these seldom consider all aspects of disease management are not usually developed specifically for seniors or created for sustained use and are primarily focused on a single disease. We created an eHealth self-management application called â€˜KeepWellâ€™ that supports seniors with complex care needs in their homes. It incorporates the care for two or more chronic conditions from among the most prevalent high-burden chronic diseases.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will evaluate the effectiveness, cost and uptake of KeepWell in a 6-month, pragmatic, hybrid effectivenessâ€“implementation randomised controlled trial. Older adults age â‰¥65 years with one or more chronic conditions who are English speaking are able to consent and have access to a computer or tablet device, internet and an email address will be eligible. All consenting participants will be randomly assigned to KeepWell or control. The allocation sequence will be determined using a random number generator.</p>
                  <p>Primary outcome is perceived self-efficacy at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, health background/status, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity, caffeine, alcohol, smoking and bladder health), social engagement and connections, eHealth literacy; all collected via a Health Risk Questionnaire embedded within KeepWell (intervention) or a survey platform (control). Implementation outcomes will include reach, effectiveness, adoption, fidelity, implementation cost and sustainability.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The burden of chronic disease (long-term health condition that requires ongoing management for many years or even decades) is a global phenomenon, particularly among seniors<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> who are the largest growing proportion of the population. In Canada, seniors (age â‰¥65 years) in 2019 represented 17.5% of the total population<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> with projections that one in four Canadians will be older adults by 2031.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Ageing is an expensive process, as 10% of seniors who have the most complex health needs account for 60% of the total annual healthcare spending in many Canadian provinces.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As the disease burden grows in the global population, the associated healthcare costs will become unsustainable. Therefore, we need to adapt our current models of care to accommodate this shifting demand. Additionally, the impact of difficult situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery can compound the problem, highlighting the need to find alternative solutions to in-person care. In response, different chronic disease management strategies have been created with a central aim to facilitate ongoing, proactive and preventive support for optimal chronic disease management. Many of these are based on Wagnerâ€™s chronic care model, (CCM)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> which suggests that four elements need to be addressed to improve outcomes, including: self-management support across the community; as well as health system considerations focused on the delivery system, decision support and clinical information systems.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A systematic review of chronic disease management tools identified patient education and self-management are needed for optimised disease control.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Self-management has been defined as: â€˜the intrinsically controlled ability of an active, responsible, informed and autonomous individual to live with the medical, role and emotional consequences of his chronic condition(s) in partnership with his social network and the healthcare provider(s)â€™.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the context of multimorbidity, optimised healthcare delivery also requires a patient-centred approach whereby patient preferences are considered alongside clinician-driven treatment decisions. In fact, clinical practice guidelines on multimorbidity emphasise the importance of this approach.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A recent review found that top health-related patient preferences of older patients with multimorbidity are health outcome prioritisation and goal setting and self-management.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In recent years, self-management tools have been acknowledged as an effective way to optimise disease management because persons can â€˜function on their own behalf in health promotion, disease prevention and managementâ€™.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Self-management tools also have the potential to alleviate time and resource burdens on primary care healthcare professionals (eg, physicians, nurses, dietitians and pharmacists) who most often are left to address all aspects of disease management (ie, risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment). In particular, online self-management tools have potential because they can improve health outcomes effectively at a low cost,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 12â€“16</xref> are easily scalable and can reach a broader population of older people with chronic diseases.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In fact, online tools are particularly relevant for supporting older adults with complex care needs in their homes, particularly during difficult circumstances requiring isolation and distancing such as the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the last decade, the use of technology among older populations has grown significantly and is expected to continue expanding.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18â€“20</xref> Surveys of older adults indicate that they are interested in using the internet to access health information, are using the Internet or email and are accessing social networking sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18â€“22</xref></p>
              <p>While self-management tools have shown some success in promoting health, many have shown varying degrees of effectiveness.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 12</xref> Reasons may be that these tools do not consider all aspects of disease management or all elements of the CCM. Additionally, they are not usually developed specifically for seniors or created for sustained use and are primarily focused on a single disease.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Such a narrow focus, in particular, fails to address the growing number of seniors with multiple chronic conditions, which accounts for more than half of seniors aged 65 years and older who are managing at least two or more chronic conditions such as, diabetes, dementia, heart failure and depression.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> As our population ages, an increase in multiple chronic conditions translates to increased risk of functional limitations and possible admission to acute or long-term care facilities.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 12</xref> The projected health outcomes of seniors, therefore, continue to remain poor, and the quality and efficiency of care suboptimal, with only about 55% of patients receiving the recommended care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> To respond to these challenges, we created an eHealth self-management application called â€˜KeepWellâ€™ that supports seniors with complex care needs in their homes. KeepWell is a patient-centred (ie, driven by patients), self-management tool that incorporates the care for two or more chronic conditions from among the top 10 high-burden chronic diseases (ie, highly prevalent and associated with significant morbidity and mortality) of older adults in Canada. KeepWell was built on a strong evidentiary base including a systematic review alongside a realist review,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> which, respectively, investigated the effectiveness of tools addressing multiple chronic conditions,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and their underlying mechanisms and context.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Findings of these reviews and a codesign process involving input from our team of researchers and clinicians, a patient working group of 10 older adults and our technology partner (Quality of Care (QoC) Health) informed the design of the KeepWell responsive web application. Once the functional prototype of KeepWell was created, we conducted a usability and pilot evaluation with 20 older adults to optimise its use by older adults.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>The objective of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness, cost and uptake of KeepWell in a pragmatic, hybrid effectivenessâ€“implementation randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>

We will use the type 2 design, which facilitates the simultaneous investigation of the effectiveness of an intervention while rigorously testing the implementation strategy.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The implementation evaluation process will be guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and Proctor <italic>et al</italic>â€™s<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> frameworks.

For example, we engaged clinicians more frequently during the development of the evidence-based lifestyle recommendations, health services and KT researchers to help inform study design, and patient partners, who were engaged more frequently during the active development and pilot testing stages of the process.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>We have created a recruitment poster, which includes a phone number and email address dedicated to this research project as well as a website with information about eligibility criteria and the consent process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental appendix A</xref>). This poster will be distributed according to the following strategies: (i) via an email listserv from RTO with a membership of more than 80 000 older adults across Canada; (ii) directly to older adults by our family physician and geriatrician partners during an in-person, phone or virtual patient visit (eg, using a web-conferencing application) or through their clinic staff and (iii) via advertisements on social media sites (eg, Facebook and Twitter) or online classified advertising services (eg, Kijiji and Craigslist). Potential participants will self-refer after reviewing the poster or a full-length study information page from the NYGH website by contacting the research coordinator via email or phone. This will trigger an enrolment phone call with the potential participant and the study coordinator involving the assessment of their study eligibility, consenting ability, as well as verbal consent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplemental appendix B</xref>). Non-consenting respondents will be asked to provide a reason for their decision. Recruitment will be performed on a rolling basis starting in December 2020.</p>

                <p>All consenting participants will be randomly assigned to a unique identification number and KeepWell password linked to a particular randomisation sequence (intervention or control) during the enrolment phone call using a 1:1 ratio. The allocation sequence will be determined using a random number generator by the study coordinator; participants will be the unit of randomisation. At the conclusion of the enrolment phone call by two study coordinators, consenting participants will receive an email with a link to KeepWell (intervention condition) or to a link to an online survey (via SurveyMonkey) to complete a health risk assessment questionnaire (control condition). The research coordinator will have the master list of the allocation sequence and logins. Allocation will, therefore, be concealed because this list will not be shared with the research team. To protect against sources of bias, investigators, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to the randomisation sequence. Blinding of older adults will not be possible given that the intervention is a standalone, web-based application and the control condition is usual care (no access to KeepWell).</p>

Depending on the results of the HRQ, the person may see the picture of one, two, three or all six of the lifestyle areas that KeepWell addresses (alcohol intake, caffeine intake, diet, physical activity, smoking and bladder health). KeepWell users are prompted to select a maximum of two lifestyle areas to work on at any given time, and to think about those that they consider important and feel ready to tackle right now. It can be overwhelming for anyone to attempt to work on all lifestyle areas at once. The complexity of multiple lifestyle advice can hinder self-management in older adults with multimorbidity. The avatar health coach advises that itâ€™s a good idea to start small by selecting only one or two areas, which will make it easier for them to manage and therefore a better chance for success in the long term. Furthermore, tool users can always come back later to select other lifestyle areas to work on once they have a handle on the first two that they selected.</td>

Next, the tool user can set their food goals for up to three food types using dropdown menus, and for each food type, they can select the number of servings for that food.

Tracking is a great way to stay motivated, and it has been proven to help people achieve goals. Once a participant sets a goal for a lifestyle area, they can track their activities daily or weekly. Tracking is set up similarly for each types of lifestyle area. For example, for caffeine, alcohol and smoking, tracking involves selecting the amount that was consumed using dropdown menus. For bladder health, itâ€™s to track the number of Kegel exercises they had performed. For physical activity, users can select from among a wide range of pictures to select the type of activity (including whether this was a light, moderate or vigorous activity) and then the number of minutes they spent doing each activity using dropdown menus. For diet, people can track what they ate that day by clicking on the number of servings for each of the foods they set a goal for using a dropdown menu. To make it more fun, each food type that is tracked flies onto a plate so that users can see everything they ate that particular day. There is also a tracker for weight, but this is an optional feature in KeepWell. The idea is that tracking weight may help users see how their body is changing as a result of their new lifestyle habits.</td>

When users open up the progress viewing tool, they will see their tracking history for a particular week. Users can toggle between each of their two lifestyle areas to see their tracking history. For example, if diet was one of the lifestyle areas they tracked, the user will see a green circle for tracked days and an open-circle for days that they did not track. The idea is that users get rewarded for tracking rather than goal attainment which helps maintain motivation and minimise disappointment.

                <p>The KeepWell application was informed by: (i) knowledge syntheses: a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of complex multimorbidity interventions for older adults<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; and a realist review to unpack their underlying mechanisms<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; (ii) evidence-based clinical practice guidelines across 11 high-burden chronic conditions (eg, diabetes, heart disease, dementia and COPD) and (iii) an iterative codesign process.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The codesign process involved engaging a working group of 10 older adults with one or more chronic conditions and a multisectoral team of experts in multimorbidity, eHealth, informatics, human factors engineering and health services/KT research to be involved at all stages of KeepWellâ€™s design, content and functionality. The older adult working group were recruited from the NYGH Patient and Family Advisory Council (Toronto, Ontario) and the St. Michaelâ€™s hospital volunteer organisation (Toronto, Ontario) between 2016 and 2017. The KeepWell prototype design and functionality evolved through a series of discussion groups with the patient working group to explore end-user needs (chronic disease management), to determine the â€˜look and feelâ€™ (design, features, functionality and flow) and to review and make key decisions about its content, language and flow. Our clinician partners (geriatricians, family physicians, dietitian and physical activity researcher) helped create the lifestyle recommendations using clinical practice guidelines and focus group discussions 2017â€“2018. Our e-Health technology partner (QoC Health) used results of a requirements analysis (ie, technical and functional specifications) to develop the software to iteratively programme alpha and beta versions of KeepWell (between 2017 and 2019). The prototype was pilot tested in a usability study between 2018 and 2019 with 20 older adults to ensure that it meets the principles of good interaction<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42â€“45</xref> and user-centred design.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> This involved observation of participants as they interacted with the KeepWell prototype, and iteratively addressing errors (after two to three participants) to address errors and to ensure optimised functioning, navigation, content and flow of the tool for older adults.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

In a previous interrupted time series study, an osteoporosis self-management tool housed in a touch-screen laptop computer was implemented across three primary care practices for 12 months, with a total of 350 patients who completed the risk assessment questionnaire,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> so our proposed sample size of 440 patients is feasible, given our patient organisation, hospital and primary care partnerships.</p>

                <p>All participant data from the KeepWell web-based application will be downloaded and stored on a secure cloud-based server of QoC Health, which adheres to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) security standards; data will be accessible via Amazon Web Services. Data will be collected at baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-up with an interim analysis planned at the midpoint of the trial (3-month follow-up). We will provide descriptive statistics, where we will summarise binary and categorical outcomes using frequency and percentages. Means and SD or median and IQRs will be used to summarise continuous outcomes. We will use the Ï‡<sup>2</sup> or Fisherâ€™s exact test to compare binary outcomes and independent two sample t-tests for continuous outcomes. For the primary outcome, a general linear model will be fit to investigate differences between groups in self-efficacy at 6 months. We will adjust for potential confounders (including baseline self-efficacy) and perform subgroup analyses (patient chronic conditions, risk factors, age group (65â€“74, 75â€“84, 85+ years), sex and gender). We will perform visual investigation (eg, through scatter plot displays) and analytical outcomes along with logistic regression analyses to determine whether unique patient characteristics predict thresholds of use for different KeepWell components. To examine the change in self-efficacy over time (secondary outcome) between groups (incorporating self-efficacy scores at baseline, 3 and 6 months), we will use a linear mixed-effects model.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57 58</xref></p>
                <p>For the cost description analysis, we will estimate the cost to implement and deliver KeepWell from the public healthcare payer perspective, including an exploration resource costs required (eg, online data collection/analysis, web system testing/hosting). The KeepWell platform collects user data for these measures, so we will be able to track them longitudinally to observe how the solution impacts on outcomes. The findings from the cost description analysis will represent the cost of KeepWell to the healthcare system. All clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-up and assessed according to intention to treat. All statistical analyses will be carried out using the R statistical software.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p>

They were also part of our larger stakeholder team (ie, our IKT team) consisting of researchers and clinicians to design and plan our trial and to prepare this protocol. We discussed the objectives and plans for the KeepWell tool development as well as its evaluation via quarterly virtual meetings, phone calls and email. The patient codesign team will continue to be involved in the conduct of the trial including data analysis and interpretation of our results at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. They will also take an active role in helping to develop optimised strategies to disseminate our results to patients and the public at the conclusion of the study.</p>

This will include publications and presentations of our trial results to researchers and clinicians, creating plain language infographics for older adults, the public and community organisations. We will also work with our team to develop more active strategies for disseminating of our findings such as an end-of-grant meeting to discuss results, implications and next steps. In all these strategies, we will ensure that the messages will be clear, simple and tailored to the needs of each audience group, whether these are individuals (physicians, patients, caregivers, policy-makers and researchers) or organisations (eg, the RTO, hospitals), including how they prefer to receive this information.</p>
