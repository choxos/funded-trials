                <p>Rectal use of a 1% tenofovir (TFV) gel is currently being evaluated for HIV prevention. While careful assessment of mucosal safety of candidate microbicides is a primary concern, tools to assess mucosal toxicity are limited. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a sensitive and high-throughput technique that can provide in-depth information on inflammation processes in biological systems. In this study, we utilized a proteomics approach to characterize mucosal responses in study participants involved in a phase 1 clinical trial of a rectal TFV-based gel. Project Gel was a phase 1 randomized (1:1), double-blind, multisite, placebo-controlled trial in which 24 participants received rectal TFV or a universal placebo [hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)] over a course of 8 daily doses. Rectal mucosal swabs were collected after 0, 1, and 8 doses and were analyzed by label-free tandem mass spectrometry. Differential protein expression was evaluated using a combination of paired (time-effects) and unpaired (across study arm) <italic>t</italic>-tests, and multivariate [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)] modeling. Within the TFV arm, 7% (17/249, <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.05) and 10% (25/249, <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.05) of total proteins changed after 1 and 8 daily applications of TFV gel, respectively, compared to 3% (7/249, <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.05) and 6% (16/249, <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.05) in the HEC arm. Biofunctional analysis associated TFV use with a decrease in epidermal barrier proteins (adj. <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.21‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí10</sup>). Multivariate modeling identified 13 proteins that confidently separated TFV gel users (100% calibration and 96% cross-validation accuracy), including the epithelial integrity factors (FLMNB, CRNN, CALM), serpins (SPB13, SPB5), and cytoskeletal proteins (VILI, VIME, WRD1). This study suggested that daily rectal applications of a 1% TFV gel may be associated with mucosal proteome changes involving epidermal development. Further assessment of more extended use of TFV-gel is recommended to validate these initial associations.</p>

              <p>M<sc>icrobicides are a topical</sc> prevention strategy against mucosal transmission of HIV. The CAPRISA-004 trial demonstrated that a 1% tenofovir (TFV) gel was partially effective against vaginal transmission of HIV-1; since then, alternative TFV gel formulations have been explored as a prevention option for other high-risk groups. This includes rectal-specific formulations for individuals practicing condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI), who have some of the highest rates of HIV acquisition.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Ideally, rectal microbicides (RMs) will function similar to lubricants, which are already widely used by MSM or transgender women (TGW) practicing CRAI.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2‚Äì4</xref></sup> They are therefore a promising alternative to oral TFV disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine, which has recently been approved for use in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but may be limited in efficacy by low levels of adherence among some PrEP users as demonstrated in the VOICE<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and FACTS 001<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> trials.</p>
              <p>One of the key priorities in microbicide development is to exclude products that have the potential to cause mucosal injury. This might reduce product acceptability, and perhaps more importantly, diminish product efficacy. In the worst case scenario, a microbicide might increase the risk of HIV acquisition. The necessity for better evaluation of mucosal toxicity is exemplified by results of the early microbicide candidate Nonoxynol-9 (N-9), which although presumed nontoxic by prior safety assessments, nevertheless resulted in genital lesions, increased inflammation and epithelial toxicity, which were detrimental to its efficacy.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Indeed, epithelial barrier disruption and inflammatory events within mucosal tissues have repeatedly been linked to poor protection against HIV transmission.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9‚Äì11</xref></sup> Although a vaginal 1% TFV gel exhibited a good safety profile and minimal side effects in the CAPRISA-004 trial,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> data on rectal safety are limited. Preliminary evaluation of the vaginal formulation of 1% TFV gel used in the CAPRISA-004 trial for rectal use was associated with gastrointestinal intolerance (RMP-02/MTN-006),<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and adverse events (AEs) were attributed to a hyperosmolarity that was incompatible with the colorectal mucosal environment.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A reduced glycerin vaginal formulation (RGVF) of a 1% TFV gel with lower osmolality has shown improved rectal safety and acceptability in the MTN-007 phase 1 study based on measurements of epithelial sloughing, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokine levels, and cellular immune markers.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, these safety assessments may not capture all mucosal side effects. A systems biology analysis in the MTN-007 study associated TFV usage with mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cell proliferation pathways,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> which may indicate that existing assays for microbial toxicity are insufficient. Therefore, application of new technologies to evaluate the impact of rectal 1% TFV usage is warranted to provide a deeper insight into potential TFV or gel-mediated effects on rectal mucosa.</p>
              <p>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a high-throughput and sensitive technique.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18‚Äì20</xref></sup> Label-free methods are rapidly advancing in their ability to detect an increasing proportion of the proteome and have the added benefits of a reduced cost per sample relative to labeled methods, which make them ideal for analyzing large clinical cohorts. Indeed, their utility in assessing mucosal inflammation and other immune pathways makes them a useful addition to mucosal safety and toxicity monitoring studies.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In this study, we evaluated this technique to assess mucosal proteome alterations of participants enrolled in the Project Gel: a phase 1 randomized, double-blind, multisite, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and acceptability of RGVF TFV gel in young men.</p>

                <p>Project Gel was completed in three stages, the first of which included baseline medical evaluations of 236 young MSM, 15 of which were sex workers (SW) and 8 were TGW (Stage 1A). Participants who were diagnosed with anorectal infections (including chlamydia, gonorrhea, active HSV lesions, chancroid, genital ulcers, or genital warts), syphilis, Hepatitis B, or HIV infection were excluded from this study. Individuals who engaged in or planned to engage in CRAI with an HIV-infected partner were excluded from the trial. A subset of 124 MSM, including 10 SW and 6 TGW from Stage 1A, who met the aforementioned criteria and who reported at least one occasion of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (RAI) 3 months before enrollment were instructed to apply the universal hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) placebo gel before each CRAI act over a 3-month period (Stage 1B). The first 24 eligible participants, who completed this phase with high adherence, were selected for a safety study, where they were randomized 1:1 to receive either 1% TFV or HEC placebo gel (Stage 2). The TFV gel used was modified from the RGVF with increased propylparaben content to improve gel stability.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A baseline rectal sponge sample was taken 0‚Äì30 days before the first gel application (Visit 6, Dose 0). Participants returned to the clinic where a single dose of study gel was administered by a clinician, and a rectal sponge (#405101; Merocel Sponges; Beaver Visitec) was taken by anoscopy ‚àº30‚Äâmin after (Visit 7, Dose 1). After a 1-week recovery period, participants, who did not experience AEs related to gel use, self-administered a once-daily outpatient dose for seven consecutive days and returned to the clinic for a final rectal sponge sampling (Visit 10, Dose 8).

                <title>Proteome alterations with TFV gel usage associate with structural activity and epidermal development functions</title>
                <p>Functional enrichment analysis was performed on proteins significantly differentially expressed in the TFV arm (<italic>p</italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.05) to identify any biological changes that may be associated with TFV use. A parallel analysis of factors significantly altered with HEC usage was performed to differentiate biological pathway alterations associated with TFV use from potential effects related to gel use in general. Enrichment analysis identified greater than 40 unique biological and molecular functions represented across study arms with the top 6 enriched functions in each arm displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). TFV-associated factors demonstrated enrichment in a diversity of molecular functions, including immune activity (peroxidases, heat shock proteins, antigen binding proteins), catalytic activity (lyases, cysteine/aspartic peptidases, transferase proteins), and structural components (cytoskeletal protein binding, structural molecules). Nine proteins significantly altered with TFV usage demonstrated a significant enrichment in structural proteins (adjusted <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.21‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí10</sup>; <italic>KRT10</italic>, <italic>AFM</italic>, <italic>KRT1</italic>, <italic>KRT9</italic>, <italic>KRT6A</italic>, <italic>KRT13</italic>, <italic>TUBB4B</italic>, <italic>KRT5</italic>, <italic>IVL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), which was not mirrored in the HEC study arm (adjusted <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ.31). Furthermore, 12 TFV-associated factors were enriched for cell growth and/or maintenance functions (adjusted <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí8</sup>; <italic>FN1</italic>, <italic>KRT10</italic>, <italic>AFM</italic>, <italic>FLNB</italic>, <italic>KRT1</italic>, <italic>KRT9</italic>, <italic>KRT6A</italic>, <italic>KRT13</italic>, <italic>TUBB4B</italic>, <italic>KRT19</italic>, <italic>KRT5</italic>, <italic>IVL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

                <title>Multivariate (LASSO) modeling identifies a signature of epidermal barrier proteins associated with TFV use at the rectal mucosa</title>
                <p>Multivariate modeling techniques were applied to the proteomic data to determine the minimum number of biomarkers needed to discriminate gel use in either the TFV or HEC arm based on covariance between proteins. The LASSO method has demonstrated increased sensitivity to detect significant protein changes between classes over alternative statistical methods<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and therefore is an appropriate addition to traditional univariate biomarker discovery. A minimum signature of 13 proteins was found to best distinguish the proteomic profile associated with 8 rectal applications of TFV (TFV Dose 8) relative to a baseline sample (TFV Dose 0). The model provided reliable classification of groups, with a calibration accuracy of 100% and 96% cross-validation accuracy. Latent variable 1 (LV1) was able to differentiate all baseline samples (negative scores on LV1) from those taken after repeated rectal TFV applications (positive scores on LV1), with minimal separation on LV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The majority of proteins (9/13) were negatively loaded on LV1, and were therefore positively associated with baseline protein expression and negatively associated with TFV, while four factors scored positively on LV1, indicating positive associations with TFV use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the model selected four factors that were identified as differentially abundant (<italic>p</italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.05) in the univariate analysis (<italic>FLNB</italic>, <italic>CALM</italic>, <italic>CRNN</italic>, <italic>WDR7</italic>), providing additional support for these factors as protein markers associated with TFV gel usage at the rectal mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). To determine if biomarkers were specific to TFV usage, parallel modeling experiments were performed on HEC rectal data. A total of 10 LASSO factors were identified, and PLSDA validation determined 100% calibration accuracy and 93% cross-validation accuracy. Two predictive HEC factors overlapped with the univariate analysis (<italic>A1AG1</italic>, <italic>K2C4</italic>); however, none of the TFV-associated factors were identified in the parallel HEC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D‚ÄìF</xref>).</p>

                    <p>A multivariate model accurately selects biomarkers of TFV-specific use within rectal mucosa, independent of HEC gel use. Multivariate modeling was performed using LASSO-selected biomarkers and PLSDA validation techniques to identify the minimal protein signature needed to classify repeated TFV usage within rectal mucosal fluid samples. LASSO-selected mucosal proteins were able to predict TFV usage with 100% calibration accuracy and 96% cross-validation accuracy. The first two latent variables accounted for 46.1% of the total protein variance, with latent variable 1 showing accurate separation of baseline samples (<italic>white</italic>) from TFV samples (<italic>gray</italic>) <bold>(A)</bold>. The scores plot demonstrates complete separation of samples collected during baseline (negative values on LV1) and those collected after eight daily TFV applications (positive values on LV1) based on the features selected by LASSO <bold>(B)</bold>. The TFV-based LASSO model identified 13 biomarkers that could distinguish repeated TFV use from baseline. Four features positively associated with repeated TFV use, while nine were negatively associated. <bold>(C)</bold>. Parallel modeling was performed on longitudinal HEC samples to determine if any TFV-associated factors could be attributed to general microbicide use. The HEC LASSO model demonstrated 100% calibration and 93% cross-validation accuracy with samples positively loaded on LV 1 associated with repeated HEC use (<italic>gray</italic>), and negatively loaded samples associated with a baseline sample (<italic>white</italic>) <bold>(D)</bold>. Of the 10 LASSO-selected features, 5 were negatively loaded, associating with the baseline sample, while the remaining 5 were associated with samples taken after 8 applications of HEC <bold>(E)</bold>. Two LASSO factors identified in the HEC model overlapped with univariate analysis <bold>(F)</bold>. PLSDA, partial least squares discriminant analysis.</p>

                <p>LASSO biomarkers that varied within the TFV arm were largely cytoskeletal components or organization proteins (<italic>VILI</italic>, <italic>VIME</italic>, <italic>FLNB</italic>, <italic>SPB13</italic>, <italic>SPB5</italic>, <italic>WDR1</italic>), with some having additional roles in epidermal development (<italic>CRNN</italic>, <italic>CALM</italic>, <italic>FLNB</italic>, <italic>SPB13</italic>, <italic>SPB5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Proteins identified in the HEC arm held functions in cellular metabolism (<italic>FAMD3</italic>, <italic>ARF3</italic>, <italic>KCRB</italic>, <italic>GDIR1</italic>, <italic>SIAS</italic>), while some factors held known functions in mucosal immunity (<italic>MUC2</italic>, <italic>MUC5AC</italic>, <italic>A1AG1</italic>); although most proteins and functions identified in the HEC arm were unique from TFV-associated biomarkers, one factor (<italic>SBN</italic>) had an overlapping function in epidermal development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Functional enrichment analysis suggests that proteins that vary in expression with multiple TFV applications may be associated with changes in structure of the colorectal epidermis, beyond the changes what we would expect to see with microbicide use alone.</p>

                <p>As a signal associated with a loss of epidermal barrier integrity was observed with TFV gel use, we sought to determine if this disruption was due to an increase in receptive anal intercourse in the TFV arm, as mechanical abrasions or exposure to semen have the potential to drive our signature independent of gel use. The frequency of RAI or CRAI was compared across arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). The total number of RAI events in the TFV arm were higher than those using the placebo gel; however, there was no significant difference in the median sex acts reported between groups (<italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ.95). Only three instances of CRAI were reported during the trial, with no difference in the number of events between arms (<italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ.99). Therefore, our evidence did not associate any prospective damage at the rectal mucosa with a skewed frequency of sexual activity across study arms.</p>

No gel-related AEs were reported in the HEC arm; however, three events were reported across two individuals using the TFV gel.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This pilot analysis of samples from an RM phase I trial was performed to evaluate the effects of TFV gel usage on the host mucosal proteome, as well as develop the proteomic platform as a tool for mucosal toxicity monitoring within the context of a clinical trial. This study investigated mucosal proteome changes both longitudinally and cross-sectionally across study arms. In this analysis, we were able to identify greater than 250 proteins with more than 40 unique biofunctions represented in rectal sponge samples, highlighting the utility of this method to give an in-depth description of the colorectal mucosal environment. The largest changes to the proteome were observed after 8 daily rectal applications of 1% TFV gel in all comparisons. Multivariate modeling identified a protein signature that was consistent with TFV use, and proteins identified had known functions relating to the structural integrity of the epidermal barrier. These results suggest that exposure to TFV-based microbicides may impact epidermal function, an outcome which may have been undetected using conventional toxicity monitoring assays.</p>
              <p>This analysis incorporated both univariate and multivariate analytical techniques to determine TFV-associated changes in rectal protein expression. Functional analysis showed an enrichment of structural molecules and cell growth/maintenance factors in the subset of significantly differentially expressed proteins after eight applications of TFV gel, which was independent of any factors associated with placebo gel use. The multivariate LASSO model identified 13 factors associated with TFV gel usage that could distinguish groups with 100% accuracy. Many of these biomarkers (filamin-B, cornulin, calmodulin, and WD-containing protein 1) were also identified in the univariate analysis. These proteins are components of the extracellular matrix of the mucosal epithelium and play important roles in tissue remodeling, epidermal growth and differentiation, cellular stress response pathways, and tight junction protein assembly.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24‚Äì29</xref></sup> Several cytoskeletal components (villin-1 and vimentin) were also identified in this model, as well as serine antiproteases (serpin B13 and B5) that have been shown to regulate the breakdown of the extracellular matrix through protease inhibition.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We recently identified alterations of several of these proteins within mucosal secretions from women with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the female genital tract<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>; thus, variance in these biological factors may suggest potential inflammatory effects of TFV gel upon the rectal epithelium. As this study identified an epidermal signature of interest, an important future direction may be to assess the degree of change in epithelial proteins relative to the time since last gel application, which may account for the rapid<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and dynamic<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33‚Äì35</xref></sup> cell turnover rate of the colorectal epithelium. Furthermore, our findings add to the emerging evidence of side effects of TFV-gel usage, such as that from the MTN-007 trial, observing effects to mitochondrial function, epithelial cell proliferation, and alterations of cell differentiation pathways.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It is important to note that although an investigation of the HEC placebo gel was not the focus of this study, mild changes in protein expression at the rectal mucosa were associated with its use. Recently, Smith-McCune <italic>et al.</italic> observed unexpected inflammatory events within the female genital tract of women using HEC gel, which were similar to effects observed in women using N-9 (a product known to damage mucosal epithelial tissue).<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Our LASSO model identified covariance of immune proteins (mucin-2 and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1), as well as variation in expression of the wound healing Rho ATPases (ADP-ribosylation factor 3 and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1) as predictors of HEC gel usage,<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and may suggest an association with altered mucosal immune pathways. Although the HEC gel has generally been considered safe for mucosal use, it has not been assessed in depth using omics platforms; therefore, our findings of subtle changes in immune protein levels with HEC gel use would be important to monitor in future clinical trials. However, in the absence of a positive control arm, such as nonoxynol-9, we are unable to assess how these alterations proteome relate to known sources of mucosal damage.</p>
              <p>This study also provided useful information for the optimization of the proteomic platform in the context of a clinical trial. Our initial assessment of total protein content showed high variability across samples, many of which included baseline time points, which precluded those participants from being included in downstream analysis. This may be due to the nature of rectal mucosal samples, given the presence of fecal and other components from the GI tract, which may make normalization of total protein content before MS analysis challenging. Our variance subanalysis highlights the necessity of taking multiple samples at each study point, which is particularly important for those at baseline as elimination of the reference sample severely limits the interpretation of later collection points and reduced the overall power of this study. Additional wash-out steps of the colorectal lumen before sponge sampling may help alleviate this variability. Furthermore, independent high-powered assessments of the rectal fluid proteome and factors associating with its variability are needed to improve normalization techniques for these samples. The variability of rectal secretions notwithstanding, the analysis of mucosal fluid provides critical information on mucosal immune processes associated with HIV prevention therapy, with samples that are relatively noninvasive, making the approach an ideal addition to the repertoire of assays used to monitor mucosal safety in phase 1 clinical trials.</p>
              <p>This study provides further evidence that TFV-based gels have effects on the rectal mucosal proteome. The changes in epidermal factors observed may reflect alterations to the primary mucosal barrier, which may have consequences for mucosal barrier functionality. Furthermore, it is unknown what long-term effects, if any, may be associated with these alterations. Future proteomic studies targeted at monitoring molecular changes that influence mucosal epithelial integrity may be warranted to fully determine the impact of TFV on mucosal safety.</p>
