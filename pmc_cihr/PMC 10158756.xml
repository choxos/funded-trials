                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ) is a collaborative quality improvement method adopted by the Canadian Neonatal Network that led to decreased mortality and morbidity in very preterm neonates. The Alberta Collaborative Quality Improvement Strategies to Improve Outcomes of Moderate and Late Preterm Infants (ABC-QI) Trial aims to evaluate the impact of EPIQ collaborative quality improvement strategies in moderate and late preterm neonates in Alberta, Canada.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>In a 4-year, multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial involving 12 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), we will collect baseline data with the current practices in the first year (all NICUs in the control arm). Four NICUs will transition to the intervention arm at the end of each year, with 1 year of follow-up after the last group transitions to the intervention arm. Neonates born at 32 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation with primary admission to NICUs or postpartum units will be included. The intervention includes implementation of respiratory and nutritional care bundles using EPIQ strategies, including quality improvement team building, quality improvement education, bundle implementation, quality improvement mentoring and collaborative networking. The primary outcome is length of hospital stay; secondary outcomes include health care costs and short-term clinical outcomes. Neonatal intensive care unit staff will complete a survey in the first year to assess quality improvement culture in each unit, and a sample will be interviewed 1 year after implementation in each unit to evaluate the implementation process.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation:</title>
                  <p>The ABC-QI Trial will assess whether collaborative quality improvement strategies affect length of stay in moderate and late preterm neonates. It will provide detailed population-based data to support future research, benchmarking and quality improvement. </p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This study is a multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial that involves 12 NICUs across the province of Alberta. There are 14 NICUs in Alberta: 10 level II units, where generally admission criteria include gestational age 32 weeks or greater; 2 perinatal level III units (Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton); 1 level III surgical NICU at Alberta Children’s Hospital; and 1 level IV NICU at Stollery Children’s Hospital. The latter 2 NICUs will not participate in the study as most patients admitted require surgical interventions. See Appendix 1, available at <ext-link xlink:href="www.cmajopen.ca/content/11/3/E397/suppl/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">www.cmajopen.ca/content/11/3/E397/suppl/DC1</ext-link>, for details of Alberta NICUs. Each of the 12 participating NICUs is considered a cluster and will be randomized individually to transition from the control arm (current practice) to the intervention arm (collaborative quality improvement strategies) at 3 time points while stratifying by location, urban versus regional, and level of care (<xref rid="f2-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Randomization will be conducted 9 months after initiation of data collection.</p>

                <p>The anticipated sample size is 9500 neonates over 4 years. Power calculations account for the design effect that is determined by the number of sites and steps, the size of the clusters within each period and the intracluster correlation coefficient. <xref rid="b35-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="b38-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Calculations account for the relative efficiency imposed by unequal cluster sizes.<xref rid="b39-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Using historic length of stay data from 2018 and 2019, we obtained an observed intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.034 from a negative binomial model with random intercepts for sites with a corresponding design effect of 3.41. At an α level of 0.05, this provides power of greater than 99% to detect a 1-day reduction in length of stay (historic mean length of stay = 14 d). In the historic data, 81% of neonates were singletons. Sample size calculations accounting for multiple births resulted in similar power. Our sample size will ensure we have adequate power for assessments of some of the secondary outcomes that are in common with the Alberta FICare trial.<xref rid="b10-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Anticipated rates of intravenous fluid use and respiratory support will be similar to those of neonates with a gestational age of 34 weeks in the Alberta FICare data (both about 50%). Applying the same methods to power calculations for binary outcomes, we will have 80% power to detect a 10.2% relative reduction in event rates if the baseline rate is 50%, and 80% power to detect a relative reduction of 19.7% if the baseline event rate is 20%. Calculations are for a cross-sectional stepped-wedge design and were programmed using R 4.0.2, and lme4 function for generalized linear mixed effect models.<xref rid="b40-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p>

Linear mixed models will be used for continuous secondary outcomes and generalized linear mixed models for binary outcomes. As per the model for the primary outcome, these models will have random intercepts for sites and fixed effects for period and intervention. In addition, we will use QIIS-II scores of organizational culture as an effect modifier when modelling the effect of EPIQ on outcomes. Post-implementation interviews will be coded and analyzed using thematic analysis<xref rid="b42-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> to identify barriers and facilitators for EPIQ implementation. We will use the CIHI Patient Cost Estimator<xref rid="b33-cmajo.20220177" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> to calculate the daily cost based on the Case Mix Groups for gestational age and birth weight and conduct an economic analysis using data collected in the trial and administrative data repositories in Alberta using a public health care payer perspective. Costs will include costs associated with health services as defined above over the study period. The outcome of the economic analysis is the incremental cost of the intervention compared with usual care. We will analyze the total cost variable as a dependent variable, using a linear mixed-effects regression model, to estimate the difference in expected health care cost between the 2 groups. The regression model will adjust for potential confounding variables such as gestational age, multiple births, delivery mode and urban versus regional sites.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome will be analyzed at the end of the trial to preserve the α. Planned interim analyses of secondary outcomes that are considered quality improvement outcomes related to the care bundles will be reported for each unit every quarter using statistical process control charts.

                <p>Planned subgroup analyses include NICU geographical location; gestational age subgroups, 32–34 weeks and 35–36 weeks, as admission and discharge criteria and length of stay vary between these groups; and singleton and multiple births.</p>
