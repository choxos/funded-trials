              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">In order to improve rates of successful extubation in extremely preterm infants, some form of non-invasive respiratory support must be provided after disconnection from the ventilator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is the most commonly used support<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> since it promotes upper airway splinting, improves functional residual capacity and thoraco-abdominal synchrony, and decreases work of breathing (WOB).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par6">Over the past years, heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy has emerged as another mode of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Although some degree of positive distending pressure can be generated, its main mechanism of action is through washout of the nasopharyngeal dead space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> A few studies comparing NCPAP and HFNC after extubation found little to no differences in lung mechanics and breathing patterns (PATT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> However, these infants were older and were studied a few days after extubation. Therefore, these findings cannot be extrapolated to extremely preterm infants during the critical period shortly after extubation. Furthermore, analysis of breathing PATTs was performed manually and in a selected number of breaths. Indeed, clinical evidence of HFNC safety and efficacy in this population is lacking, as a small number of extremely preterm infants were included in randomized trials comparing NCPAP and HFNC after extubation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Thus, a better understanding of the physiological effects of these modes of support following extubation is necessary in this population.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In recent years, we have developed automated tools to objectively analyze cardiorespiratory signals and define breathing PATTs in preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Thus, in this randomized crossover study, we used these tools to describe and compare the cardiorespiratory behavior of extremely preterm infants while receiving NCPAP and HFNC shortly after extubation. Given the differences in mechanisms of action of both modes, we hypothesized that a higher incidence of respiratory pauses (PAUs), asynchronous breathing (ASB), and bradycardias (BDYs) will be observed during HFNC therapy.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="Par8">A prospective, unblinded, randomized crossover study was performed in the neonatal intensive care units at the Royal Victoria Hospital and Montreal Children’s Hospital (McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Canada) from October 2013 to August 2015. Inclusion criteria were intubated infants with a birth weight (BW) ≤1250 g undergoing their first elective extubation. Infants with major congenital anomalies, neuromuscular disease, or clinical instability in the immediate period following extubation were excluded. The institutional review board at each institution approved the study, and written parental consent was obtained. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03649282), and randomization was performed prior to extubation using a computer-generated blocked randomization sequence.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Clinical decisions pertaining to weaning from mechanical ventilation, time of extubation, and type of respiratory support used after extubation (aside from the study recording period) were made by the medical team. Also, all infants received caffeine 24 h prior to extubation.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Instrumentation and recordings</title>
                <p id="Par10">Prior to extubation, three electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes were placed on the infant’s chest and limbs at least 1 cm apart from the existing leads to prevent interference (Vermed, Buffalo, NY, USA, © 2010). Respiratory movements were measured using two respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) bands: around the infant’s ribcage (RCG) at the level of the nipple line, and around the abdomen (ABD) 0.5 cm above the umbilicus (Viasys® Healthcare, Conshohocken, PA, USA). Oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was recorded using a pulse oximeter (Masimo Radical®, Irvine, CA, USA).</p>
                <p id="Par11">Following extubation, a short period of approximately 30 min was allowed before the infants were switched to the mode determined by the randomization (NCPAP or HFNC) and recordings were initiated. Infants were kept in a supine position and received 45 min of each mode. NCPAP was applied at a pressure level of 5–6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, delivered either by the bubble CPAP system or by the ventilator (Babylog 8000 or VN500, Dräger Medical Inc., Telford, PA, USA). As per standard of care, all efforts were made to minimize leaks by using the appropriate size of bi-nasal prongs (Hudson RCI, Wayne, PA, USA), applying the Cannulaide® (Salter Labs, Lake Forest, IL, USA), and using a chinstrap. HFNC therapy was delivered using the Optiflow system (Fisher &amp; Paykel®, Auckland, New Zealand) at flow rates of 5–6 L/min using a cannula/nostril diameter ratio between 0.5 and 0.8.</p>
                <p id="Par12">During recordings, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), NCPAP pressure, or HFNC flow rate could be adjusted if necessary. The SpO<sub>2</sub> target range was between 88 and 92%, and any adjustment was recorded. The study could be interrupted if the infant exhibited significant episodes of desaturations (DSTs) and/or PAUs refractory to these adjustments, in which case the infant would be excluded. At the end, infants were placed on the type of non-invasive support decided a priori by the medical team.</p>

                <title>Cardiorespiratory signal acquisition</title>
                <p id="Par13">Cardiorespiratory signals (RCG, ABD, PPG, and SpO<sub>2</sub>) were continuously acquired using the PowerLab 16/30 analog-digital data acquisition system (ADInstruments, Australia, © 2009). Signals were anti-alias filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 1000 Hz with a 16-bit analog-to-digital resolution. ECG was recorded using an FE132 bioamplifier (ADInstruments, Australia, © 2009) connected to the PowerLab. All signals were stored on a research computer. Changes in FiO<sub>2</sub> and any interventions were recorded in real time as text comments in the LabChart software (ADInstruments, Australia, © 2009). Each LabChart file was then converted to MATLAB<sup>TM</sup> format for subsequent signal analysis (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).</p>

                <title>Clinical data</title>
                <p id="Par14">The following clinical data were prospectively collected: baseline demographics (gestational age, sex, Apgar scores, weight, day of life at extubation, and postmenstrual age at extubation), pre-extubation blood gases (pH, <italic>P</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate, and base excess), and use of postnatal steroids prior to extubation. Non-invasive respiratory support settings were recorded at the beginning and throughout the study when a change from baseline occurred (NCPAP pressure, HFNC flow rate, FiO<sub>2</sub>). Extubation failure was defined as the need for reintubation within 7 days of extubation, and the primary reason for reintubation was recorded.</p>

              <p id="Par45">In this study, we describe the cardiorespiratory behavior of extremely preterm infants shortly after extubation while receiving NCPAP and HFNC. By using an automated and objective analysis of cardiorespiratory signals several features were evaluated. Interestingly, even though infants were exposed to NCPAP and HFNC for a short period of time, this analysis was able to demonstrate longer durations of respiratory pauses and higher FiO<sub>2</sub> requirements during HFNC. Therefore, these findings provide further understanding on the physiological effects of NCPAP and HFNC in extremely preterm infants during the critical period shortly after extubation.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Few studies have investigated the respiratory behavior of preterm infants receiving NCPAP or HFNC following extubation. In a crossover study, Saslow et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> evaluated lung mechanics in 18 infants using RIP signals analysis. No differences in WOB were noted between NCPAP and HFNC. More recently, De Jongh et al. studied 20 infants extubated for ≥48 h and on non-invasive respiratory support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Using a crossover random design, WOB indices were evaluated from uncalibrated RIP signal recordings of 2 to 4 min during four different modes: NCPAP at 5 and 6cmH<sub>2</sub>O and HFNC at flow rates of 3 and 5 lpm. Although statistically significant differences on WOB indices were noted between NCPAP and HFNC, they were not clinically meaningful, as suggested by the large overlap of the 95% confidence intervals. Differently from our study, infants were more mature and with higher weights at the time of recordings. Furthermore, analysis of the RIP signals was done in a selected number of breaths (over a shorter time frame) and did not provide information on respiratory pauses. In the present study, by using an automated and objective method, we were able to analyze all breaths. In another trial, Campbell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> studied 40 preterm infants with GA of 27.5 weeks extubated around the second day of life to either NCPAP or HFNC. APN was defined based on nurses’ notes as a pause in breathing for &gt;20 s and BDY as HR &lt;80 bpm for &gt;10 s, over a period of 7 days of treatment. Extubation failure was significantly higher in the HFNC group (60% vs. 15%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and all infants were reintubated due to severe APN or increased frequency of APNs. The duration of the APN events was not reported. Due to the study protocol, we included a relatively more stable population, as 90% of the infants were successfully extubated. This selection bias could be the reason for the lack of differences in SYB and ASB breaths (WOB) or MVT (agitation and/or distortion) between the modes. Nevertheless, longer respiratory pauses were noted during HFNC therapy. Although small, such differences in respiratory pauses in combination with higher FiO<sub>2</sub> requirements may reflect some instability of the cardiorespiratory system during HFNC therapy after only 45 min of exposure and 30 min of analysis. As APNs and increased FiO<sub>2</sub> are the most common causes of extubation failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> our findings raise concerns about the widespread use of HFNC therapy in this immature population as a mode of post-extubation support.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> have also investigated for differences in FiO<sub>2</sub> requirements between NCPAP and HFNC. Changes were calculated as the difference between the FiO<sub>2</sub> over the 7 days post extubation and up to 12 h pre-extubation; a significantly higher FiO<sub>2</sub> change (4.7% vs. 1.0%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.025) was observed in infants receiving HFNC. These results are similar to our findings, despite the fact that we studied patients during a much shorter period of exposure to both modes.</p>
              <p id="Par48">The present study has some limitations. Recordings and changes of respiratory therapies shortly after extubation are difficult to perform due to patient instability, which limited our protocol to 45 min. We recognize that longer periods would provide better evaluations of cardiorespiratory behavior. Nonetheless, the study has several strengths. We performed a randomized crossover trial where each infant was exposed to both modes of support in a random order. Signals were analyzed using a unique, automated, unsupervised, and objective system with the ability to perform timely classification of breathing PATTs on a sample-by-sample basis for over 100,000 breaths, even in high noise conditions. This new approach allowed computation of a large number of features to describe cardiorespiratory behavior in 30 infants.</p>
              <p id="Par49">In summary, extremely preterm infants studied shortly after extubation exhibited significantly longer respiratory pauses and higher FiO<sub>2</sub> requirements while receiving HFNC when compared to NCPAP. These findings raise concerns on the use of HFNC after extubation in this population and future studies, including a larger number of infants are necessary.</p>
