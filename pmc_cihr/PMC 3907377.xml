                <p>Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), some HIV-infected persons maintain lower than normal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts in peripheral blood and in the gut mucosa. This incomplete immune restoration is associated with higher levels of immune activation manifested by high systemic levels of biomarkers, including sCD14 and D-dimer, that are independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in HIV infection. In this 12-week, single-arm, open-label study, we tested the efficacy of IL-7 adjunctive therapy on T-cell reconstitution in peripheral blood and gut mucosa in 23 ART suppressed HIV-infected patients with incomplete CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell recovery, using one cycle (consisting of three subcutaneous injections) of recombinant human IL-7 (r-hIL-7) at 20 µg/kg. IL-7 administration led to increases of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in peripheral blood, and importantly an expansion of T-cells expressing the gut homing integrin α4β7. Participants who underwent rectosigmoid biopsies at study baseline and after treatment had T-cell increases in the gut mucosa measured by both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. IL-7 therapy also resulted in apparent improvement in gut barrier integrity as measured by decreased neutrophil infiltration in the rectosigmoid lamina propria 12 weeks after IL-7 administration. This was also accompanied by decreased TNF and increased FOXP3 expression in the lamina propria. Plasma levels of sCD14 and D-dimer, indicative of systemic inflammation, decreased after r-hIL-7. Increases of colonic mucosal T-cells correlated strongly with the decreased systemic levels of sCD14, the LPS coreceptor - a marker of monocyte activation. Furthermore, the proportion of inflammatory monocytes expressing CCR2 was decreased, as was the basal IL-1β production of peripheral blood monocytes. These data suggest that administration of r-hIL-7 improves the gut mucosal abnormalities of chronic HIV infection and attenuates the systemic inflammatory and coagulation abnormalities that have been linked to it.</p>

                <p>HIV infected people who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain at higher risk of non-infectious complications such as cardiovascular disease. This risk is linked to persistent inflammation and immune activation and is higher in those with lower circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts. IL-7 therapy can increase CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts in peripheral blood, but its effects on gut mucosal T cell restoration was unknown. We gave 3 doses of interleukin (IL)-7 to HIV<sup>+</sup> persons receiving ART and performed gut biopsies before and after therapy. IL-7 therapy increased T-cell numbers in the periphery including T-cells that express the α4β7 integrin, a molecule that promotes trafficking to the gut. Gut mucosa studies showed significant increases of T-cells and significant decreases in local inflammation as reflected by expression of myeloperoxidase and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, plasma levels of inflammatory markers that are linked to mortality in HIV infection decreased significantly as did some inflammatory monocyte markers. We conclude that IL-7 administration can improve gut mucosal abnormalities in chronic treated HIV infection and as a result, also may decrease both gut and systemic inflammation.</p>

              <p>Mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion in the gut is a hallmark of HIV pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Brenchley1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells residing in the gut mucosa are predominantly of memory phenotype and are frequently activated due to constant antigenic exposure. They typically express CCR5, the major HIV co-receptor, and α4β7, an integrin that assists gut homing of T-cells and can also facilitate HIV transmission <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Arthos1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Wacleche1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion in the gut has been implicated in the pathogenesis and persistence of immune activation in untreated and chronically treated HIV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Brenchley2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Guadalupe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The loss of epithelial integrity that accompanies the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell loss leads to continuous activation of the innate system. Evidence of increased microbial translocation as reflected by increased systemic levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 16S DNA <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Brenchley2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> has not been directly linked to clinical events in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). On the other hand, biomarkers associated with monocyte activation (sCD14) as well as inflammation (IL-6) and coagulation (D-dimer) have been consistently found to be independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in this patient population <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Sandler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003890-Kuller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Administration of ART can repair to a significant degree the HIV-inflicted gut mucosal injury <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Macal1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Ciccone1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> but studies suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the lamina propria (LP) may not be fully restored to the levels observed in uninfected controls. Recent evidence also suggests that defective T-cell trafficking, regulated by chemokines and their respective receptors, may be responsible for the altered T-cell homeostasis in the gut mucosa of HIV-infected persons after ART <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Mavigner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Kunkel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Prolonged ART has dramatically improved the survival of HIV infected patients and has shifted the morbidity of the epidemic from infectious opportunistic diseases to non-infectious events that include cardiovascular, hepatic and renal disease and non-AIDS malignancies <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Guaraldi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Guihot1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Immunologic non-responders (patients who maintain a lower peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts despite sustained suppression of plasma HIV viremia) remain at higher risk for both AIDS and non-AIDS clinical events <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Lapadula1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Immune-based therapies are thus still pursued in chronic HIV disease with the goal of improving both CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell restoration and overall immune competence of HIV-infected individuals, thereby reducing chronic immune activation and the associated risk of non-infectious chronic complications in ART-treated patients.</p>
              <p>Interleukin 2 (IL-2) had been studied earlier in the past as an ART adjuvant and despite successful CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell expansions in peripheral blood, failed to confer any clinical benefit in large adequately powered phase III clinical trials <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Abrams1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. IL-2 had expanded predominantly CD25<sup>+</sup> T-cells sharing features of Treg and did not restore gut mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Sereti1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition during IL-2 administration, there was evidence of transient increased inflammation and activation of the coagulation cascade with elevated levels of IL-6 and D-dimer <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Grade IV thrombotic events were reported during the phase III studies in the IL-2 arm suggesting a possible clinical correlate of the biomarker observations <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Abrams1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
              <p>IL-7 has emerged as a candidate immune-based therapy that could succeed in expanding T-cells without a predilection for Treg cell expansion and without significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines during administration <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although phase I studies have addressed the safety profile and biologic activity of recombinant human IL-7 (r-hIL-7) by demonstrating T-cell cycling and T-cell expansions <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Levy2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Sereti2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the potential impact of r-hIL-7 on mucosal T-cell restoration has not been addressed to date. It was recently demonstrated that IL-7 induces expression of α4β7 in human T-cells both in vitro and in vivo, a phenomenon that can lead to homing of naïve T-cells to the gut in both murine and nonhuman primate models <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Beq1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Cimbro1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Based on these observations we designed a clinical trial of r-hIL-7 administration in HIV-infected patients who were receiving ART, maintained a plasma HIV level &lt;50 copies/mL and had inadequate immunologic restoration with circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells of 101–400/µL. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the T-cell changes both in the peripheral blood and the gut mucosa and to measure biomarkers that have been associated with clinical events in treated HIV infection. We report here that one cycle of r-hIL-7, consisting of three subcutaneous injections, was well tolerated and led to significant and sustained CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell expansions in peripheral blood. In addition, gut mucosal T-cells increased and gut mucosal inflammation decreased with decreased neutrophil infiltration and expression of TNF. Systemic levels of biomarkers (sCD14 and D-dimers) that have both been strongly linked to mortality in ART-treated persons also diminished.</p>

                <p>As was seen in earlier studies, administration of one cycle of r-hIL-7 consisting of 3 subcutaneous injections of 20 µg/kg each given once weekly, led to significant and sustained expansion of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells at week 12. Circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells increased from 260 to 645 cells/µL and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells increased from 650 to 1390 cells/µL at week 12, both highly significant, P&lt;0.001 in paired comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003890-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Further phenotypic analysis showed that both naïve and memory peripheral T-cells expanded consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003890.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). In agreement with the previous study <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Levy3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells with a Treg phenotype (FOXP3<sup>+</sup> and expressing high levels of CD25) decreased as a proportion of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells while their absolute number increased (data not shown). As the main objective of this study was to evaluate effects of r-hIL-7 on the colonic mucosa, expression of α4β7was also evaluated in peripheral blood T-cells. The proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing α4β7 increased from 15.4% at baseline to 26.2% at day 14 and 17.7% at week 12 (both at P&lt;0.001). The proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing α4β7 also increased from 17.3% at baseline to 34.3% at day 14 and to 29.6% at week 12 (both at P&lt;0.001). This led to an overall increase in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing α4β7 from 32 cells/µL at baseline to 211 cells/µL at day 14 and to 103 cells/µL at week 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003890-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, P = 0.001).

              <p>In this study, the effects of in vivo administration of r-hIL-7 on the colonic mucosa were evaluated. Peripheral blood T-cell expansions were observed as previously reported <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, including an expansion of T-cells expressing the gut homing integrin α4β7. Rectosigmoid biopsies showed that peripheral T-cell expansions were accompanied by T-cell increases in the colonic mucosa. Importantly, we also observed a decrease in lamina propria neutrophil infiltration and TNF staining as well as a decrease in plasma levels of sCD14 and D-dimer, biomarkers that have been linked to morbidity and mortality in HIV infection. These findings suggest a potential role for r-hIL-7 in restoring mucosal integrity and decreasing local and systemic inflammation in patients with HIV infection on ART.</p>
              <p>Peripheral T-cell expansions were seen in earlier studies of r-hIL-7 in humans with HIV or cancer <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Levy2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Sereti2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Sportes1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells are severely depleted in HIV infection and are not always fully restored in the lamina propria with ART <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Mehandru1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We had previously shown that IL-2 administration did not affect gut mucosal T-cell numbers despite significant expansions in the peripheral blood that did not confer clinical benefit. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice and macaques have shown that IL-7 may increase homing of T-cells to the gut and local cycling <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Beq1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Cimbro1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Testing this hypothesis in humans, we indeed confirmed an increase of T-cells in the gut by both flow cytometry and IHC. Interestingly, the increases of mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells correlated strongly with the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>α4β7<sup>+</sup> T-cells in peripheral blood while this was not observed for mucosal CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells that were strongly associated with local CD8 cycling. These data support recent observations that trafficking and T cell dynamics in the gut mucosa may differ significantly between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Mavigner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and could also represent functional differences that were not addressed in our study.</p>
              <p>A subset of participants who underwent rectosigmoid biopsies had tissue evaluated by both flow cytometry and IHC with strong correlation of CD3<sup>+</sup> measurements between the two methods. Flow cytometry showed more dramatic CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell increases in the mucosa and relative normalization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers, while IHC showed increases of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the LP suggesting that the expansion or trafficking of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells may have been more prominent in the lymphoid follicles (inductive sites) than within the LP. This may not be surprising as the mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell expansion after IL-7 administration was more pronounced among naïve subsets driven by enhanced homing while CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell expansion may have been driven by local cycling. Another possibility is that the threshold of CD4 intensity used to identify CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by IHC may have been less sensitive compared to flow cytometry using both CD3 and CD4 antibodies. Our study was limited by the fact that the material available for IHC was not sufficient to allow evaluation of lymphoid follicles to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
              <p>Regardless, neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, which was higher in patients than among controls at baseline, decreased significantly after r-hIL-7, albeit not to normal levels. Similar dramatic decreases after r-hIL7 administration were found in TNF surface staining in the lamina propria, which was significantly higher in HIV+ patients compared to controls. In contrast, intracellular FOXP3 surface staining was much lower in HIV+ participants than among controls and increased after IL-7 treatment probably as a consequence of a higher number of mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. It is known from animal models of colitis that regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells can both prevent and ameliorate inflammatory colitis <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Chaudhry1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In addition, in ulcerative colitis in humans, lamina propria TNF, originating from T-cells and macrophages, strongly correlates with grade of inflammation <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Although the source of TNF in our study was unclear and could represent T-cells, monocytes, macrophages or neutrophils, our findings point to a significant repair of the mucosal injury and decrease in the local inflammation that persists in chronic ART-treated HIV infection.</p>
              <p>Exploratory evaluation revealed increases in mRNA of certain chemokines, chemokine receptors and cytokines (IL-17) that favor both gut trafficking of T-cells and improved epithelial integrity <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Kunkel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> which could be a direct effect of IL-7 or a secondary effect of the increased T-cells in the colonic mucosa. CCRL1 (chemokine receptor like 1) can bind CCL19, CCL20 and CCL25 and may have a role in epithelial integrity, homing to gut tissue and response to enteric bacterial pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Comerford1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003890-Meurens1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Similarly, TNFSF14 or LIGHT has critical roles in lymph node homing, inflammation and wound healing <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Petreaca1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our study had limited availability of tissue for additional experiments studying the role of these pathways but these preliminary findings suggest that r-hIL-7 may have affected trafficking of T cells in the colonic mucosa and may have promoted local tissue repair. Timing of biopsies closer to administration would have been more revealing with respect to induction of chemokine and chemokine receptor alterations as shown in animal studies <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Beq1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Cimbro1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> but could have significantly increased inconvenience and hindered study participation.</p>
              <p>The design of this study was not to address possible implications of r-hIL-7 in tissue or cell reservoirs, which is a complex issue. Earlier studies have suggested a role for IL-7 in maintaining a reservoir of latently integrated virus within central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Chomont1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Since there was a significant increase of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the gut mucosa (presumably mostly in lymphoid follicles), total proviral gut DNA was evaluated in gut tissue specimens of study participants at baseline and week 12 after r-hIL7. There were no significant changes noted and importantly, one participant without detectable proviral DNA at baseline had no detection of proviral DNA after r-hIL7. These results would suggest a lack of dramatic perturbation in the gut reservoir although studies focusing on this specific question could be more revealing.</p>
              <p>Despite the significant correlation of indices of microbial translocation with T-cell activation and immune restoration, levels of microbial products in circulation have not been linked to clinical events. In contrast, markers of monocyte activation, typically in response to LPS (sCD14), and coagulation markers (D-dimer) have been found to be strong independent predictors of clinical events in patients treated successfully with ART <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Neuhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Kuller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Sandler2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Evaluation of these biomarkers in this study showed a small yet statistically significant decline at week 12. The changes in plasma sCD14 were strongly associated with the changes in T-cells in mucosa by both used methods, establishing a tight link between alterations in mucosal T-cells and systemic inflammation. Based on these findings and recent recognition of the role of monocytes in chronic inflammation with HIV <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Hearps1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, we also found decreases in inflammatory monocytes and a decrease in their basal (unstimulated) IL-1β expression, one of the main proinflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes. Interestingly, both IL-1β and TNF play a prominent role in extra-intestinal thrombosis in animal models of colitis <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Yoshida2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These findings highlight r-hIL-7 effects beyond T-cells that warrant further investigation in future studies.</p>
              <p>In summary, administration of r-hIL-7 expands peripheral T-cells expressing α4β7 and leads to increased colonic mucosal T-cells. This increase of T-cells in the mucosa is associated with a significant increase in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells and a decrease in gut neutrophil infiltration and local TNF production, and is strongly linked to decreases in levels of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers. The clinical implications of these observations remain uncertain but strongly suggest a potential role for r-hIL-7 in repairing the mucosal injury and innate system activation that persist in chronic treated HIV infection.</p>

For peripheral blood T-cell staining, labeled cells were acquired on a CyanADP cytometer and analyzed using Summit software. T-cell subsets were defined using the following antibodies: Live/dead-PO, CD3-PB (Clone:SP34-2), CD4− PerCP-Cy5.5 (Clone:L200), CD8-APC, CD45RA-PE or CD45RA-APC (Clone:HI100), CCR7-PE-Cy7 (Clone:3D12), Integrin β7 FITC R&amp;D (Clone:FAB4669F), CD49d (α4) PE (Clone:L25 BD), FOXP3-Alexa488 (Clone:259D/C7) and CD25-APC (Clone:2A3) from BD Biosciences. Immunophenotyping assessments were performed at D0, D28 and week 12. Monocyte phenotyping, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cytokine quantification were also performed on cryopreserved PBMCs. Cells were thawed and stimulated for 6 h with 1 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of 1 µL/mL of brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent cytokine release. Cells were washed in RPMI media containing 10% heat-inactivated human serum and then stained with a Live/Dead fixable blue dead cell stain (Invitrogen).

                <p>Biopsies were performed between 1 to 3 weeks prior to any drug administration (referred as “baseline” in figures) and at week 12. All biopsy specimens were processed in the same laboratory at intramural NIAID. Gut (rectosigmoid) random biopsies were performed during routine flexible sigmoidoscopy and processed as previously described <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Ciccone1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003890-Ciccone2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Briefly, approximately twenty-five to thirty biopsies were randomly extracted with 16–20 processed for flow cytometric analysis. In groups of five, the biopsies were weighed, placed in 500 µL of medium containing RPMI (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% human serum (Gemini BioProduct). Samples were then digested using 0.5 mg collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 250 U benzonase (Novagen) for 40 min at 37°C before being filtered through a 40 micron screen. After being washed twice with the 10% human serum medium, the resulting cell suspension was counted using a Beckman Coulter Counter to obtain the number of total viable cells. Absolute numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells per gram of gut tissue were calculated by dividing the viable cell count by the tissue weight. This number was then multiplied by percentages obtained from flow cytometric analysis (see below) to determine the absolute cell count of the T-cell subsets.</p>

                <title>Immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis</title>
                <p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in a subset of eight study participants who had sufficient tissue (two to three pieces from rectosigmoid biopsies) available for tissue fixation. A biotin-free polymer approach (Golden Bridge International, Inc.) was used on 5-µm tissue sections mounted on glass slides, which were dewaxed and rehydrated with double-distilled H2O. Heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed by heating sections in 0.01% citraconic anhydride containing 0.05% Tween-20 or 0.01M Tris-HCL pH 8.6 in a pressure cooker set at 122–125°C for 30 s. Slides were incubated with blocking buffer (TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.25% casein) for 10 min. For CD4 and CD8 IHC, slides were incubated with mouse anti-CD68 (1∶400; clone KP1, Dako), mouse anti-CD163 (1∶400; clone 10D6; Novocastra/Leica) and rabbit monoclonal anti-CD4 (1∶200; clone EPR6855; Epitomics, Inc.) or mouse anti-CD4 (1∶100; clone 1F6; Vector Laboratories) and rabbit monoclonal anti-CD8 (1∶50; clone SP16; Labvision/Thermo Scientific) diluted in blocking buffer over night at 4°C. Slides were washed in 1× TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and endogenous peroxidases blocked using 1.5% (v/v) H2O2 in TBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min. Slides were incubated with Mouse Polink-1 AP followed by Rabbit Polink-1 HRP or Mouse Polink-1 HRP followed by Rabbit Polink-1 AP for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were first incubated with Impact™ DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine; Vector Laboratories) to develop the CD4, washed and developed with Warp Red (Biocare Medical, Inc.) to either visualize the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells or mask the faint CD4 expressed on APCs to distinctly identify CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. For CD3, myeloperoxidase (MPO), TNF and FOXP3 IHC, after the HIER step slides were loaded on an IntelliPATH autostainer (Biocare Medical) and stained with optimal conditions determined empirically that consisted of a blocking step using blocking buffer (TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.25% casein) for 10 minutes and an endogenous peroxidase block using 1.5% (v/v) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in TBS (pH 7.4) for 10 minutes. Rabbit monoclonal anti-CD3 (1∶100; clone SP7; Labvision/Thermo Scientific), rabbit polyclonal anti-myeloperoxidase (1∶1,000; Dako), mouse monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (1∶1,000; clone P/T2; Abcam) and mouse monoclonal anti-FOXP3 antibody (1∶100; clone 236A/E7; Abcam) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were washed, and detected using the Rabbit Polink-1 HRP (CD3 and MPO), Mouse Polink-1 HRP (TNFα) or Mouse Polink-2 HRP (FOXP3) staining systems (Golden Bridge International, Inc) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Sections were developed with Impact DAB (Vector Laboratories). All slides were washed in ddH2O, counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific), and scanned at high magnification (×200) using the ScanScope CS System (Aperio Technologies) yielding high-resolution data from the entire tissue section. Representative regions of interest (ROIs; 500 µm<sup>2</sup>) were identified and high-resolution images extracted from these whole-tissue scans. The percent area of the lamina propria that stained for CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (excluding non T-cells), CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, myeloperoxidase<sup>+</sup>, TNF<sup>+</sup> and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells were quantified using Photoshop CS5 and Fovea tools.</p>
