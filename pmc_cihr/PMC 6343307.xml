                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Frequent users of emergency medical services for issues that could be more appropriately managed through non-urgent care deplete the limited resources of the health-care system. Community paramedicine is an emerging field that extends the role of paramedics beyond the traditional emergency response. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the impact of a community paramedicine home-visit intervention with frequent users on reducing ambulance calls, hospital visits, and admissions. The study will also provide a cross-sectional description of the characteristics of frequent users of emergency medical services.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">An open-label, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with parallel intervention and control groups will be conducted in four paramedic services in Ontario. The sample size has been calculated as 261 per group for a 25% reduction in ambulance calls. Eligible participants will be frequent callers (three or more calls in 6 months), individuals who call for at least one lift assist, or individuals referred to the program by a paramedic. Individuals will be randomly allocated to receive either the Community Paramedicine at Home (CP@home) program intervention or their usual care (control). Intervention participants will receive up to three visits from a community paramedic, who will conduct health risk assessments, provide health promotion and education, provide referrals to local resources, and fax reports back to the family physician. Data will be collected from administrative databases (e.g., paramedic services), a custom CP@home program database, participant surveys, and key informant interviews. An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, including descriptive statistics and multi-level modeling to find factors predictive of primary and secondary outcomes. A thematic analysis will be used to analyze the qualitative outcomes. An economic analysis will consider the cost-effectiveness of the program.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">CP@home has the potential to reduce the health-care system burden significantly by targeting current frequent users of emergency medical services. By targeting this population, CP@home aims to decrease ambulance calls and emergency department visits, reducing health-care costs and improving the quality of life of a vulnerable population. If successful, CP@home will inform the development of community paramedicine policies and the expanding role of paramedics in regions across Canada.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par16">Frequent 911 calls for emergency medical services (EMS) deplete limited health-care resources. A common, preventable EMS call is when an older adult needs a lift assist; that is, when the individual falls and is unable to pick themselves up due to limited mobility. Some older adults call EMS frequently for lift assists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other preventable calls are from individuals of all ages who repeatedly call EMS for problems that could be handled by more appropriate community and primary care resources, such as for chronic disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The average overall cost of the ambulance call and resultant emergency department (ED) visit in Ontario is CAD 1626 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Concurrently, health-care expenditures continue to grow. Therefore, simple interventions that manage common EMS issues related to mobility or pain and reduce risks related to poor mental health, chronic disease, and falls may reduce health-care system burden and provide potential savings.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Community paramedicine (CP) is a promising new extension to paramedicine in which paramedics apply their skills beyond emergency (911) calls to initiate preventative and rehabilitative health and social programs as part of an integrated health-care effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The broad goals of the Community Paramedicine at Home (CP@home) intervention are to decrease complications due to falls, chronic disease, and poor mental health and to improve mobility, quality of life, and health outcomes in vulnerable populations. In doing so, related and more specific goals are also to decrease calls to EMS and ED visits. It is expected that these changes will ultimately lead to more efficient use of health-care resources, improve access to health care, and improve health outcomes among frequent users of EMS.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Frequent EMS users</title>
                <p id="Par18">Frequent EMS users can be defined as having made four or more calls within 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], though definitions range from three to ten times per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This population falls primarily into two categories: (1) older adults and (2) individuals of all ages with complex health-care needs.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Studies have shown that older adults, those 65 years and older, account for more than a third of all EMS calls related to cardiopulmonary conditions, diabetes, and falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The data indicate that the most frequent users of EMS, hospital transports, and hospital admissions were residents over 65 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recent reports from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences identified that the level of health-care services used by older adults is driven mainly by the number of chronic conditions they have [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Older adults with high comorbidity (&gt;3 chronic conditions) report poorer health, take more prescription medications, and have the highest rate of health-care visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences recommends that health-care providers need to work actively with older adults to prevent new chronic conditions and manage existing conditions to avoid complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, the risk of falls in this population is substantial. It is estimated that one in three persons over the age of 65 is likely to fall at least once each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Studies in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that approximately 50% of individuals who call 911 for a lift assist (i.e., have had a fall) will call 911 again within 1 month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, reducing the risk of falls could have a substantial impact on the health-care system.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Research also indicates that older adults without family support networks have a higher utilization of hospital ED services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An increasing number of older adults are at risk of being socially isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This can be due to living alone, the death of family members or friends, retirement, and often, declining health. The World Health Organization reports that social isolation is related to “increased rates of premature death, lower general well-being, more depression, and a higher level of disability from chronic diseases” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. With a growing population of individuals over the age of 65 in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it is expected that this demand for ED services will increase.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The second category of frequent users of EMS are those with complex needs, who are often further categorized into sub-groups defined by chronic illnesses and mental health issues, including substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These are preventable and often non-emergent issues that could be handled by primary care. A systematic review by Scott and colleagues in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found no studies on the characteristics of frequent EMS users in Canada, a gap in the available literature. However, a 2015 study in the United Kingdom, which has a universal health-care system like that in Canada, found that frequent callers are a heterogenous group with complex needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Of the frequent callers, 55% were females and the mean age was 57.6 years, but with a large range (15–98 years) and standard deviation (21.4 years). The most common caller characteristics were frequent medical or clinical needs (64%), mental illness (40%), elderly (38%), unmet social or personal care needs (25%), substance abuse (24%), frequent faller (23%), and high anxiety (11%). The majority of callers had two or more of these characteristics. In this population, 83% required more than one intervention by a case manager and 30% required three or more interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this study, through appropriate interventions, they were able to reduce the median number of EMS calls per individual from five per month to zero per month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This suggests that by implementing interventions linking frequent callers with appropriate preventative and rehabilitative resources in primary care, there may be a beneficial impact on health and health resource utilization.</p>

                <p id="Par22">In 2012, a report by the leadership of Ontario’s Seniors Strategy highlighted the need to deliver innovative, community-based care with the dual goals of enabling older adults to live safely in their own homes and alleviating related pressures on more costly care settings such as acute care hospitals and long-term care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Current approaches being explored by governments include looking for programs that reallocate existing resources to decrease the unnecessary use of ED resources. The 2012 report recommended a team-based approach, including exploring the expansion of CP programs to support primary care access for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A survey of paramedic services in Ontario in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] showed that six regional services were planning to provide CP programing in the future, including chronic disease management services and in-home lifestyle and safety evaluations.

                  <p id="Par26">To address the first item, a population-based intervention, the McMaster Community Paramedicine Research Team developed the Community Health Assessment Program through Emergency Medical Services (CHAP-EMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which began as a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], was evaluated as a 1-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and is now being sustained by paramedic services under the name ‘Community Paramedicine at Clinic’ or CP@clinic. CP@clinic is a primary prevention community health promotion program that is targeted at seniors living in subsidized housing. The CP@clinic program is a free, weekly, one-on-one drop-in session held in a common area of the social housing and is open to all residents. It involves a cardiovascular disease risk assessment, blood pressure monitoring, and risk assessments for diabetes and falls. The results are sent to the participants’ family physicians. Paramedics also deliver tailored health promotion and disease prevention advice, linking residents to local community resources to assist them in changing their health behaviors and lifestyle. The RCT results for this program are showing promise in a number of different areas, including reductions in EMS calls based on participation rate, blood pressure reduction and monitoring, and improved aspects of health-related quality of life such as anxiety, depression, and mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Individual-focused intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par27">The research program of the McMaster CP Research Team is being expanded to a home-visit CP intervention, called CP@home, for individuals who call EMS for a lift assist or who frequently call EMS for other concerns. Briefly, the community paramedics will make home visits to those identified by the paramedic service, conduct risk assessments, refer the individual to appropriate resources to prevent future EMS utilization, and report back to their family physician. Details of this intervention and the RCT are provided in <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods/design</xref>.</p>
                  <p id="Par28">The use of paramedics is ideal for this intervention as it will deal with individuals who are frail, seriously ill, or potentially unstable, and who may require immediate assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Paramedics are an excellent fit to handle these emergent situations and also, with training, knowledgeable about health promotion and preventive medicine. Paramedics are also suited well for conducting risk assessments, since this is part of their basic training.</p>
                  <p id="Par29">This home-visit intervention will complement the work already being conducted by CP@clinic and it will build on the team’s contributions to community-based care and established collaborative relationships with paramedic services, primary care, social housing, public health, and other community services. We hypothesize that the intervention will lead to a significant reduction in repeat EMS calls and ED visits from high-use individuals. This anticipated decrease in EMS calls and ED visits may have implications in terms of health-care savings and increased health-care resource capacity. It is also expected that the intervention will improve the health behaviors of participants, which may contribute to their overall health outcomes. If the study demonstrates that CP@home is beneficial in reducing the number of EMS calls and ED visits (or not), this will inform decision makers when developing CP policies and expanding the role of paramedics in other regions. Furthermore, the study data will provide the required information for an expansion of CP@home and future research studies.</p>

Further program details are provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The aim of the CP@home intervention is to provide the participants with the appropriate resources they need based on the assessment findings and the participant’s own perceived needs. It is expected that the ongoing monitoring, identification, and introduction of community resources will improve their health and quality of life, and prevent future crises, thereby decreasing their EMS calls, ED visits, and hospital admissions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study enrolment, intervention, and assessments.

If urgent care is required, action will be taken to facilitate transport to an urgent care or emergency facility. Otherwise, based on the risk assessments, referrals will be made to the appropriate resources (e.g., primary care, legal aid clinic, social worker, or local wellness programs) or health education will be provided (e.g., health promotion and appropriate use of EMS).

                <title>Knowledge translation and implications</title>
                <p id="Par70">Involving key stakeholders and community partners (i.e., each region’s paramedic service, Public Health, McMaster University, and the Community Care Access Centre) in a knowledge translation and exchange process will provide opportunities to use the results when making decisions about future health programs, policies, and practices. This group of stakeholders will be involved in developing recommendations for the city council and the dissemination of the results. Dissemination includes the development of an online training tool for community paramedics regarding their expanded role in the community with an emphasis on the health promotion and non-urgent aspect of preventative health care. The educational tool developed by our team could be migrated to the platform used by the Centre for Paramedic Education and Research in Ontario. Paramedicine decision makers can share the new tool and the research results with their provincial and national EMS bodies to promote the CP@home program.</p>
                <p id="Par71">The results of this study will be presented in conferences and published in peer-reviewed and open-access journals to reach broad audiences to enhance research uptake. The potential audience to receive the results from McMaster University, paramedic services, and community partners could include decision makers, policy makers, funding bodies, and knowledge brokers. Ultimately, this program could be used to support a shift in the delivery of primary health care. Sustainability actions will involve working with relevant groups such as health-care professionals, service providers, community health support organizations focusing on older adults (e.g., Community Collaborative of the Local Health Integration Network), and decision makers from the municipal and provincial governments.</p>
                <p id="Par72">Though the setting of this study is Canada, its results could be used by other countries that are promoting CP, including members of the International Roundtable for Community Paramedicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The high frequency of EMS and ED use is a problem for many developed countries and CP has been advocated as one of the solutions to this problem.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par73">Very little is known about frequent users of EMS, especially in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but with increasing demands on the health-care system and limited resources, it is important to study this high-utilization group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The CP role has been developing and expanding in recent years, and a community-based RCT of a wellness clinic model in subsidized housing showed a significant impact on EMS calls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The current study will increase our understanding of the population of frequent EMS users, beyond those in subsidized housing, and the effectiveness of a home-visit CP program in reducing ambulance calls and other health-care utilization (e.g., ED visits and hospital admissions). A similar home-visit program using case managers was effective in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par74">There are some key challenges to consider when implementing a community-based, pragmatic RCT in a vulnerable population, including intervention fidelity, number of eligible participants, and loss to follow-up. Each of these challenges has been addressed to minimize its potential impact.</p>

                <title>Ensuring that CP@home is properly implemented</title>
                <p id="Par75">Training modules will be developed to ensure that implementers conduct the program properly. Fidelity checks will help in assessing the implementation of the program. Regular quality assurance assessments of the entered data will also be done to monitor the implementation of the program and data collection. To ensure the most accurate results, individuals living in long-term care facilities and individuals currently involved in a paramedic home-visit program or other paramedic-led frequent user intervention will be excluded from the analysis. Existing services and programs in the community during the duration of the CP@home study will be noted and accounted for in the analyses due to the possibility of co-intervention.</p>

                <title>Recruiting participants to the program</title>
                <p id="Par76">Hamilton Paramedic Service data indicate that about 1450 patients in a single year would have been eligible for CP@home, if it had existed. Therefore, we are confident that we could recruit enough people from the Hamilton site alone. There are no challenges anticipated with the other sites. We anticipate that identified potential participants will want to take part, as it will give them an opportunity to have a visit from a community paramedic up to three times, and may help to solve their hitherto unsolved health-related issues.</p>

              <sec id="Sec21">
                <title>Loss to follow-up</title>
                <p id="Par77">Loss to follow-up will be a primary concern for our control group as they are only receiving usual care; however, the primary outcome (ambulance calls) and other measures of health-care utilization will be collected from administrative data and are not dependent on individual contact.</p>
                <p id="Par78">CP@home has the potential to significantly reduce the burden on the health-care system and provide potential savings by targeting current frequent EMS users and individuals who call EMS for a lift assist. By targeting this population, CP@home aims to decrease ambulance calls and ED visits, thus health-care resources will be used more efficiently and access to care for the target populations will be improved. At the same time as reducing health-care costs, CP@home is expected to decrease complications due to falls, chronic disease, and poor mental health and to improve mobility, quality of life, and health outcomes in these vulnerable populations. If successful, CP@home will inform the development of CP policies and the expanding role of paramedics across Ontario and across Canada. This study will also inform the expansion of CP@home as a complement to the CP@clinic program.</p>
