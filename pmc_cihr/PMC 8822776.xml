                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Encouraging upper limb use and increasing intensity of practice in rehabilitation are two important goals for optimizing upper limb recovery post stroke. Feedback from novel wearable sensors may influence practice behaviour to promote achieving these goals. A wearable sensor can potentially be used in conjunction with a virtually monitored home program for greater patient convenience, or due to restrictions that preclude in-person visits, such as COVID-19. This trial aims to (1) determine the efficacy of a virtual behaviour change program that relies on feedback from a custom wearable sensor to increase use and function of the upper limb post stroke; and (2) explore the experiences and perceptions of using a program coupled with wearable sensors to increase arm use from the perspective of people with stroke.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This mixed-methods study will utilize a prospective controlled trial with random allocation to immediate or 3-week delayed entry to determine the efficacy of a 3-week behaviour change program with a nested qualitative description study. The intervention, the Virtual Arm Boot Camp (V-ABC) features feedback from a wearable device, which is intended to increase upper limb use post stroke, as well as 6 virtual sessions with a therapist. Sixty-four adults within 1-year post stroke onset will be recruited from seven rehabilitation centres. All outcomes will be collected virtually. The primary outcome measure is upper limb use measured by grasp counts over 3 days from the wearable sensor (TENZR) after the 3-week intervention. Secondary outcomes include upper limb function (Arm Capacity and Movement Test) and self-reported function (Hand Function and Strength subscale from the Stroke Impact Scale). Outcome data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 2 months retention. The qualitative component will explore the experiences and acceptability of using a home program with a wearable sensor for increasing arm use from the point of view of individuals with stroke. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants after they have experienced the intervention. Qualitative data will be analysed using content analysis.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability, with 40–60% resulting in upper limb hemiparesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This hemiparesis is inversely related to upper limb function, ability to use the arm and hand, and performance of activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Thousands of repetitions of reaching to grasp may be necessary to bring about upper limb functional recovery following a stroke, as suggested from animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Current upper limb movement practice during rehabilitation typically involves a total dose that is far below that recommended based on animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While intensive practice early in the recovery appears to lead to better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], high levels of practice can also result in meaningful improvements in arm function even in chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Encouraging daily upper limb use and increasing intensity of practice in rehabilitation are two important goals for optimizing upper limb recovery post stroke. However, motivating thousands of repetitions in scheduled practice, or over the day is challenging. Feedback from wearable sensors may be a novel way of achieving one or both of those goals. Feedback from accelerometers have been used to increase physical activity in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but few studies have used accelerometers to increase upper limb use. One pilot RCT used a wrist-worn accelerometer that vibrated when arm activity levels were low and showed the protocol was feasible; however, statistical analysis was not performed on the small sample (<italic>n</italic> = 33) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Wearable sensors can be used in the home and their data accessed by the therapist. Virtual online sessions are convenient for participants who do not need to travel to a rehab centre, thereby facilitating access to intervention for those living in remote and rural communities. Virtual sessions can avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="Par11">This mixed-methods trial has objectives to (1) determine the efficacy of a clinician directed virtual behaviour change program using an RCT where the intervention incorporates feedback from a custom wearable sensor to help increase upper limb use post stroke; and (2) explore the experiences and perceptions of using wearable sensors with a virtual program to increase arm use from the perspective of patients with stroke. This RCT uses a delayed-entry control group since we are recruiting at a point where patients are no longer receiving any formal therapy, and hence would have minimal changes without any intervention. It is hypothesized that a clinician directed virtual behaviour change program that incorporates feedback from a wearable sensor to progress the intervention will result in greater increase in arm use compared to usual care.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par12">This nested mixed-methods study will be comprised of a multi-centre, site-stratified, assessor blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled superiority trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio with an embedded qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The control group is a wait-list group who receive the intervention after the active treatment group which facilitates recruitment and retention of participants. The design is open label with only outcome assessors being blinded so unblinding of participants will not occur. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a flow diagram of the study procedures. The methods for the quantitative and qualitative components are described here separately. The intervention and evaluations will be virtual which will enable recruitment from a wider catchment, and the eventual application in local, as well as remote and rural communities.

                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p id="Par13">The RCT will recruit from 7 rehabilitation hospitals in Canada to maximize participant recruitment: GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre (Vancouver), Parkwood Institute (London), Foothills Hospital (Calgary), Riverview Health Centre (Winnipeg), Sunnybrook Health Centre (Toronto), Toronto Rehab Institute (Toronto) and Nova Scotia Rehabilitation and Arthritis Centre (Halifax). These sites are part of the Heart and Stroke Foundation Canadian Partnership for Stroke Recovery CanStroke Recovery Clinical Trials Platform. The coordinating centre will be the GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre led by Principal Investigator (Dr. Eng) and a central research team which will oversee the preparation of protocol and revisions, preparation of study documents (brochures, site training protocols, informed consent and data collection forms), publication of study reports, organization of steering committee meetings, data entry and analysis. The coordinating centre team will have access to the final data set. Individual sites will retain access to site-specific data as per contractual agreement between sites, and may request access to the final data set. The steering committee (authors of this paper) will provide agreement of the final protocol; oversee recruitment of participants at each site and liaise with study coordinator/principal investigator; review progress of study and agreeing (if necessary) on changes to the protocol to facilitate the progression and completion of study. The study team (site leads, investigators, staff coordinators) will meet at least every other week to provide trial oversight and review trial conduct, including recruitment efforts, protocol adherence and any adverse events.</p>

                  <title>Participant population</title>
                  <p id="Par14">Adults with stroke who have been discharged or about to be discharged from the stroke programs at each rehabilitation hospital will be screened for eligibility. Individuals will be included if they (1) are within 12 months of stroke onset (with confirmed ischaemic infarct or intracerebral haemorrhage); (2) have unilateral upper limb impairment; (3) live in the community; (4) have some ability to move their arm and hand (at least about 30° shoulder flexion or abduction and extend at least one finger and thumb from a flexed position); (5) are using their affected upper limb in a different way than prior to their stroke (Rating of Arm-use in the Community and Home (REACH) Scale &lt; 5) (12); (6) completed formal physical and occupational therapy rehabilitation for the upper limb; (7) have access to a tablet, computer, laptop or phone with internet and email access; and (8) are willing and able to wear an activity monitor safely for their waking hours. If the participant has a caregiver, they will be invited to assist in this study; however, a caregiver is not required for participating in the study unless the participant requires assistance to utilize the internet or with other aspects of the protocol.</p>
                  <p id="Par15">Individuals will be excluded from the study if they (1) have musculoskeletal/other neurological conditions that limit movement in their arm; (2) are unable to provide informed consent; (3) have another medical condition that would affect their ability to participate in the treatment protocol; (4) have persistent pain in their affected upper limb that affects their ability to use the limb; and (5) are unable to speak, understand, or read English. An exception for (5) will be made if the participant does not speak the English language but has another person (i.e. family member, caretaker or friend) who can be present and translate during evaluation/treatment sessions, and home activities related to the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par16">Consent will be attained by a site coordinator from each of the 7 sites. All data will be de-identified with a code prior to being transferred to the central site (University of British Columbia) where the final dataset will be stored. Initial screening will be checked from self-report over the phone. Following the screening, participants will complete an electronic consent form, facilitated by a site coordinator from each respective centre who will describe the study and answer questions about the study. Following consent, a second screening will take place with an online session to confirm the physical criteria and ensure that the videoconference software is working and the environment is appropriate for the assessment and treatment. There are no plans for collection of lab or biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in the current trial.</p>

                  <title>Randomization</title>
                  <p id="Par17">Participants will be randomized after their baseline assessment at a one-to-one ratio to either the Immediate Virtual Arm Boot Camp (V-ABC) group or Delayed V-ABC group using an online, third-party, randomization service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomize.net">www.randomize.net</ext-link>). Randomization will be in variable block sizes (to ensure allocation concealment) and stratified by site (to control for regional differences). Participants will also be stratified by the REACH score (&lt; 3 and ≥ 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A score of 3 separates those with mild versus moderately affected upper limbs.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par18">The intervention will be delivered by physical or occupational therapists who will be provided training over a 4-h online session. V-ABC is an intense program aimed at increasing affected upper limb movement practice delivered virtually. We define movement practice as a combination of traditional upper limb exercises (i.e. strengthening, fine motor and task-based practice) and incorporation of the affected upper limb into daily activities. The program consists of three major components: (1) Home version of the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (H-GRASP) to increase functional capacity of the affected arm (13); (2) feedback from a wrist-worn sensor (called TENZR by Biointeractive Technologies); (3) initial treatment and follow-up treatment sessions (total 6 virtual sessions over a 3-week intervention with the first session 1.5 h, and then 1 h). The Home GRASP protocol is a self-administered exercise program that consists of range of motion, strengthening and fine motor activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                  <sec id="FPar1">
                    <title>Initial session</title>
                    <p id="Par19">During the initial session, participants will be taught how to perform upper limb exercises from the Home GRASP protocol by a trained physical or occupational therapist over the Zoom software platform (Zoom Video Communications). The participants will be instructed to complete the prescribed exercises twice per day (or a minimum of 2 h/day). A binder containing verbal and pictorial instructions for each exercise and a kit with the equipment required to complete the exercises will be mailed to the participant. In addition, the TENZR and a tablet will be included in the mailed package. The TENZR does not have any visual display, and the hand counts and target (set by the therapist) are shown on an app on the tablet (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> of the TENZR and app). The participants will be provided with education around the importance of incorporating the affected upper limb into daily activities. The therapist will also discuss strategies for incorporating the affected upper limb into daily activities and will be provided with a checklist of example activities (e.g. open door) in which their upper limb can be used. Participants will be asked to wear the TENZR device during waking hours and to recharge the device overnight. Finally, the participants will be shown how to navigate the TENZR app on a tablet.

                  <sec id="FPar2">
                    <title>Follow-up sessions</title>
                    <p id="Par20">Participants will be asked to take part in five follow-up sessions virtually after the initial session to monitor their adherence to the exercise program, ability to meet daily movement targets and to progress their exercises and movement targets. At the second session, the therapist will set daily movement targets in collaboration with the participant based on the average daily hand counts captured by the TENZR based on the baseline counts, as well as counts since the initial session. See the “Evaluations” section for the definition of a hand count. The following suggested guidelines will be provided to therapists for setting daily movement targets. If the daily baseline hand counts are less than 1000, then a target for 1000 daily hand counts will be set. If the daily baseline hand counts are greater than 1000, an additional 20% will be added. A minimum of 1000 hand counts will be set. Therapists may modify the exercises and daily activities to accommodate fatigue and/or pain.</p>
                    <p id="Par21">The tablet will show the daily total GRASP counts and participants will then record these values in a 1-page summary sheet and review with their therapists at each session. Therapists will prompt participants to identify barriers to meeting movement targets and will assist participants to problem solve solutions to overcoming those barriers. The logging of the GRASP counts and discussion of strategies to increase GRASP counts will serve as a mechanism of accountability and adherence to the protocol. At the final session, the therapist will discuss recommendations for further arm activity.</p>
                    <p id="Par22">The components of the V-ABC were designed to address considerations outlined in the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour Model applied to affected upper limb use after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This is a model of behaviour described in the Behaviour Change Wheel Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The framework helps guide the development of behaviour change interventions.

                  <p id="Par27">Participants will be asked to wear the TENZR device on the affected upper limb for 3 days at each assessment time. Feedback from the TENZR device shown on the tablet will be inactivated during the assessment. The average daily hand counts from this 3-day assessment immediately following the 3-week intervention will be the primary outcome. This wrist-worn sensor is able to consistently capture functional reach to grasp repetitions in individuals with mild to moderate upper limb stroke impairment and has good validity, as well as good agreement over two test sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The device uses a multi-sensor sensing approach to detect reach-to-grasp activity. Force myography is used to detect the state of the hand by monitoring the surface forces on the wrist musculo-tendonous complex proximal to the hand. The system outputs one hand count when it detects a functional reach-to-grasp movement. This is defined as any finger/grip and wrist activity which is accompanied by inertial movements of the arm before or after the hand/wrist motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, turning a door knob results in 1–2 hand counts; one count on reaching forward, opening the hand and grasping the door knob, and a second count can occur if there is a distinct hand opening on letting go of the door knob and withdraw of the arm. The combination of an arm reaching movement and a hand grasping/releasing movement approximates the initial interaction with an object (i.e. reach and grasp) and/or final interaction with an object (i.e. release and arm move away).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par42">The integration of wearable sensors with rehabilitation programs is in its infancy. There have been some programs which utilize heart rate monitors and step counters to set targets to improve walking or physical activity after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the use of monitors for the upper limb treatment after stroke are less common. Sanders et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] used a grip sensor integrated with a musical computer game (MusicGlove) to encourage hand use after stroke. Da-Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] showed preliminary results on using a wrist-worn accelerometer which vibrated when arm activity levels were low. The integration of a sensor to monitor upper limb use may be ideal for home programs. When home programs are prescribed during rehabilitation, it is difficult for the therapist to determine how much practice is actually occurring. While a patient can document the minutes of practice, one person could practice 30 min with a few hundred repetitions, while another could do a thousand repetitions. Additionally, the use of a wearable sensor can provide valuable objective data with respect to incorporation of the affected upper limb into ADLs throughout the day, a critical piece to optimizing functional gains. As the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour Model illustrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], changing behaviour is complex. In our study, feedback from the sensor can provide accountability, as well as motivation for the number of repetitions that the patient is undertaking in their home program and in daily use. The proposed protocol is innovative in focusing on use as the primary outcome. Ultimately, the goal of rehabilitation is to improve use of their arm in everyday life, and not just in the clinic.</p>
              <p id="Par43">There are many reasons why the development of evidence-based virtual rehabilitation programs is needed. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the benefits of virtual care as hospital programs experienced restricted caseloads due to the risk of on-site COVID-19 transmission. A program like V-ABC can be delivered at home without risk to COVID-19. Many rehabilitation programs quarantined patients to their room for a period of time to reduce the potential for infection. Social distancing requirements reduced the space available to treat patients, and notably, permitted caseloads were reduced. We previously showed the feasibility of using a virtual arm and hand rehabilitation protocol in a small pretest-posttest study to improve arm function without any specialized equipment or technology except for the communication device itself (computer, tablet, smartphone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Beyond COVID-19, evidence-based virtual programs have appeal. They increase the reach of a program, especially to rural and remote locations. It has been documented that people living in rural regions have less chance of receiving physical therapy or occupational therapy after a stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Treatment in the home also provides a convenience to the patient. Lastly, there may be cost-savings in having a virtual program at the home of a patient. The patient does not need to travel to the hospital, nor does the therapist need to travel to provide home therapy, and caseloads are not restricted by space.</p>
              <p id="Par44">This study uses a mixed-methods approach to study the efficacy and acceptability of this program. It is important to understand the experience of the patient in utilizing a wrist-worn sensor, in conjunction with an exercise program. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to the protocol will facilitate implementation if the protocol demonstrates efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par45">This study has several limitations. We anticipate individuals with mild to moderate stroke severity to be eligible, while those with severe stroke who have little hand or arm movement would not be eligible.</p>
