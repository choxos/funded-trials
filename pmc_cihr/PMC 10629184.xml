                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy is a major cause of maternal morbidity and death. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), despite being the standard of care to prevent VTE, comes with some challenges. Shared decision-making (SDM) interventions are recommended to support patients and clinicians in making preference-sensitive decisions. The quality of the SDM process has been widely assessed with the decisional conflict scale (DCS). Our aim is to report participants’ perspectives of each of the components of an SDM intervention (DASH-TOP) in relation to the different subscales of the DCS.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Design: A convergent, parallel, mixed-methods design.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Participants: The sample consisted of 22 health care professionals, students of an Applied Clinical Research in Health Sciences (ICACS) master program.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Intervention: We randomly divided the participants in three groups: Group 1 received one component (evidence -based information), Group 2 received two components (first component and value elicitation exercises), and Group 3 received all three components (the first two and a decision analysis recommendation) of the SDM intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Analysis: For the quantitative strand, we used a non-parametric test to analyze the differences in the DCS subscales between the three groups. For the qualitative strand, we conducted a content analysis using the decisional conflict domains to deductively categorize the responses.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par6">Groups that received more intervention components experienced less conflict and better decision-making quality, although the differences between groups were not statistically significant. The decision analysis recommendation improved the efficacy with the decision-making process, however there are some challenges when implementing it in clinical practice. The uncertainty subscale showed a high decisional conflict for all three groups; contributing factors included low certainty of the evidence-based information provided and a perceived small effect of the drug to reduce the risk of a VTE event.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par7">The DASH-TOP intervention reduced decisional conflict in the decision -making process, with decision analysis being the most effective component to improve the quality of the decision. There is a need for more implementation research to improve the delivery of SDM interventions in the clinical encounter.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy causes approximately 1.5 to 2% of maternal deaths during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and is a major cause of maternal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The use of thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the standard of care in women who have a history of VTE that was unprovoked or was associated with a hormonal risk factor or a prior VTE associated with a nonhormonal temporary provoking risk factor and no other risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Prophylaxis reduces the risk of recurrent VTE by almost 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; it is safe for the fetus, compared to other alternatives, such as aspirin or unfractionated heparin. However, it is difficult to administer, may cause pain, is expensive, and the certainty of the available evidence of its efficacy is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, this treatment does not constitute the ‘single best option’ in at risk pregnant women, and clinical guidelines encourage clinicians to consider women’s preferences when assessing the trade-offs between alternatives (prophylaxis with daily injections of LMWH vs. no prophylaxis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Shared decision-making (SDM) is the gold-standard approach when dealing with preference sensitive decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) collaborative suggests the use of different techniques (e.g., provision of evidence-based information, improving healthcare professional communication, and value elicitation exercises to clarify patient preferences) to improve patient engagement in decision-making and to support the process of SDM in achieving a high-quality informed decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">The international collaborative group DASH-TOP (Decision Analysis Shared decision-making Thromboprophylasis Of Pregancy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], is developing a SDM intervention to support women and their clinicians in making decisions about the best strategy to prevent recurrent VTE during pregnancy. This SDM intervention contains three components: 1) evidence-based information about the risks and benefits of taking LMWH to prevent VTE; 2) values elicitation exercises to explore women’s preferences for each of the four health states relevant to this decision (i) inconvenience of using LMWH during pregnancy; (ii) major obstetrical bleed; (iii) Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) in pregnancy; and (iv) Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in pregnancy; and 3) a decision analysis (DA) model that presents which alternative has better <italic>expected value</italic> (i.e., quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) considering individualized data on the patient’s risks and preferences toward different health states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These components have been used successfully to support SDM resulting in improvements in the quality of the decision-making process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, despite decision analysis being a technique used in SDM, the process of decision-making while using this method is not yet fully understood, leading to a lag in implementation of this technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The DASH-TOP group tested the intervention, in a pilot sequential mixed-method study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with women who were planning pregnancy or pregnant at the time of the study, and were at risk of presenting a recurrent VTE event during their pregnancy. In parallel, with the aim of assessing how this SDM intervention can be implemented, we conducted the present study with health care professionals of different backgrounds that were enrolled in a master program to retrieve their thoughts on the feasibility of implementing a SDM intervention containing these three components. While different instruments have been used to evaluate SDM interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], there are still challenges in measuring the quality of the decision-making process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) is the instrument most commonly used for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The DCS contains different subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that assess different domains of the SDM process (informed, values clarity, support, uncertainty and effective decision-making) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The DCS is mostly used to assess the effectiveness of decision aids vs. usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, there is a scarcity of literature using the DCS to compare several SDM interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and using its subdomains to evaluate the process through which a decision-making support technique function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Our research question was: What are participants’ perspectives of each of the components of the DASH-TOP intervention in relation to the different subscales of the DCS?</p>

                <p id="Par15">The intervention was delivered as part of the master program’s module on “Values and Preferences” taught by two of the authors (ML-G, PA-C). It was conducted using a real-time video conferencing platform (Zoom) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants were presented with a case study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study case</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2023_2349_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par16">Participants were randomly divided (sorted alphabetically based on their last name) into three different virtual groups. We followed an incremental design with varying exposure to the different components: group 1 was exposed to the first component of the SDM intervention, group 2 to two components, and group 3 to all three components. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> represents the intervention components and group allocation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Allocation procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2023_2349_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                      <p id="Par19">Group 1: This group received only the evidence-based information component of the intervention. Participants were presented with scenarios for four clinical situations (health states): suffering DVT in pregnancy, suffering PE in pregnancy, suffering major obstetric bleeding (MOB), and the inconvenience of using LMWH in pregnancy; all of which had been previously validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

                      <p id="Par21">Group 3: This group received all three components of the intervention: evidence-based information, value elicitation exercises and a decision analysis recommendation. Their value ratings obtained from the VAS exercise were inputted into a decision analytic model. The decision analytic model is a Markov state transition model developed for the DASH-TOP intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] that examines the two treatment options under consideration: using LMWH prophylaxis versus no LMWH as prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent VTE during pregnancy. This mathematical model uses women’s age and risk of VTE, combined with their value ratings and probabilities of suffering each health state during pregnancy, to estimate the QALYs for each treatment option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The treatment with the greatest expected QALYs is presented as the decision analysis recommendation. Participants received the results and recommendation of their personalized decision analysis using a graphical representation, accompanied by a written explanation as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.</p>

This scale contains 16 items divided in five subscales: i) informed; ii) values clarity; iii) procedure support; iv) uncertainty; and v) effective decision. Scores for each item range from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with high scores indicating higher decisional conflict. Research in general health care has established cut-off points for scores that show no decisional conflict (DC) (&lt; 25), a low level of DC (&gt; 25-&lt;37.5) and a high level of DC (&gt; 37.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

One participant (14%) added that the low certainty of the evidence was confusing when carrying out the tradeoffs of the decision. In Group 2, the majority (57%) used the content of the health states to know what benefits and what risks matter most; some participants (43%) highlighted the use of the value elicitation exercises to help them weigh the pros and cons of each health state and clarify what was more important. In Group 3, there was a discrepancy between the quantitative and the qualitative data; while this group showed the highest conflict for this subscale (mean = 22.91; SD = 20.77) of all three groups, their qualitative perceptions were that it was clear to them what matters most, risks or benefits. In addition, half of the participants (50%) reported the decision analysis model was useful and helpful to resolve imbalances and make a final decision.</p>

                    <p id="Par41">In Group 1, the high level of conflict was attributed to high uncertainty regarding a perceived low efficacy of the drug and the low certainty of the evidence (71%). Also, some participants (57%) found it difficult to decide due to the adverse effects presented in their previous experience. Group 2 participants, except one (14%), expressed certainty about their choice, and they all reported that the value elicitation exercises eased the weighing of the benefits and drawbacks of each option. In addition, two participants (29%) noted the low quality of the evidence that was used to inform the outcomes as a basis for their uncertainty. Group 3 participants highlighted that the provided evidence-based information reduced their uncertainties with the decision, and it was clear what choice was best: for the majority (88%), this decision was not to take LMWH due to the low benefits in reducing the risk of a VTE event. Two participants reflected on the decision analysis component and gave discordant perspectives: while one thought that not having a clear recommendation on whether to take LMWH (recommendation shown in the yellow area) introduced uncertainty in the decision-making process (P11 with a high conflict &gt; 37,5), the other thought that this made it easier to confirm their decision, and that there was not a “correct option” (P10 with low conflict &gt; 25-&lt;37.5).</p>

                    <p id="Par43">Group 1 reported conflict on how effective the decision-process was mainly because the data was not adequately informed. For example, one participant explained that the low efficacy of the drug and low quality of the evidence hinder the process of decision-making and deciding what is most important. Group 2 showed a slightly higher level of conflict compared to Group 1 because some participants (29%) felt that the value elicitation exercises did not include aspects that were important in their decision-making (such as long-term effects). In Group 3, we found there was better satisfaction (no conflict &lt; 25) with the process compared to the other two groups (&gt; 25). Some participants (50%) highlighted the role of the value elicitation exercises to feel more involved in the decision-making process; however, other participants (25%) thought the exercises could be confusing (low conflict &gt; 25-&lt;37.5)), especially the VAS (for them, it is always important to be in ‘good health’). Although all participants from Group 3 responded that the decision analysis was useful to confirm their decision, half of the participants (50%) would not trust the decision analysis model alone to make the final decision; they would prioritize their own desires and would appreciate the support of their health professional.</p>

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p id="Par46">In this study, we aimed to report participant’s perspectives on using an SDM intervention to reduce decisional conflict of a preference-sensitive decision; the use of thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy. Our main finding is that all three components of the SDM intervention (evidence-based information, value elicitation exercises and decision analysis) reduce the overall decisional conflict. We found no decisional conflict (DCS &lt; 25) for the overall DCS score and the majority of the subscales, for all three groups; however, this trend was not statistically significant. We found a high level of decisional conflict (&gt; 37.5) for the uncertainty subscale due to the low certainty of the evidence, however value elicitation exercises showed to have the potential to reduce the uncertainty of the process.</p>
                <sec id="Sec29">
                  <title>Effect of the SDM intervention components on DCS</title>
                  <p id="Par47">Evidence-based information reduced conflict in the decision-making process. However, when the information is based on low quality evidence, uncertainty increases. A similar study conducted in Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], assessing a decision aid for breast cancer screening also noted the importance of providing evidence-based information to improve decision-making: women positively value receiving information regarding the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening. As in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we found that graphical representation of risks and benefits using pictograms showing the number of people experiencing an event with and without medication, reduces decisional conflict by clarifying the numerical information provided. Participants in our study also noted that patients’ health literacy should be assessed to ensure adequate understanding of the information. As shown by several authors who explored the relationship between health literacy and DCS, a better understanding of health information can significantly decrease decisional conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par48">Value elicitation exercises were useful to understand what is most important (risks or benefits) in a decision, thus supporting and facilitating the weighing activity (pros and cons) in the decision-making process. These exercises also reduced uncertainty in the decision-making process by helping participants better clarify (‘what choice is best for me’) their decision. This finding is consistent with IPDAS recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, exploring patients’ values and preferences contributes to patient engagement in the decision-making process, improving self-efficacy. Supportive of these findings, a recent cross-sectional study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] assessing factors contributing to a lower decisional conflict found that respondents, who reported higher ability to actively engage and participate in the decision-making process, had lower decisional conflict.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">The provision of a decision analysis recommendation decreased uncertainty (lowest level of decisional conflict for the uncertainty subscale) and improved self-efficacy with the decision process. It helped tip the balance of pros and cons, helping participants to be more confident with their decision. In addition, participants noted the need for health professionals when implementing the decision analysis technique in the clinical encounter, to support the cognitively-demanding activity of integrating the evidence with their preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. On this regard, Dumont and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] have referred to the use of decision analysis, as a decision support technique that promotes a meaningful dialogue between providers and patients on preferences, options, concerns, risks and benefits, leading to an informed and more satisfactory decision for both parties.</p>

                  <title>Decisional conflict scale as an instrument to assess the SDM process</title>
                  <p id="Par50">In the context of SDM, decisional conflict is one of the most frequently reported outcomes in studies assessing decision support interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and the DCS appears to be an optimal instrument to measure the quality of the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. All the subscale items are in line with other instruments used to measure the quality of SDM interventions, such as the widely used SDM-Q-9, MAPPIN’SDM, and OPTION [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, a review assessing the quality of the SDM process highlighted that their common usage does not imply that these measures have adequate congruence with the conceptualization of SDM used to develop the intervention, as they do not necessarily capture the effect of the interactions among the decision-makers (i.e. patients, clinicians, family) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As seen in our study, the support subscale (how supported do patients feel in the decision-making process) needs further attention, especially the role of health professionals to support the process. For example, the CollaboRATE scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] further explores the support from clinicians in decision-making with items like ‘how much the provider listened to them about their health issue’. The need for health professionals as decisional partners was also highlighted by Legaré and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] when developing a modified decisional conflict scale (D-DCS) with the aim of evaluating the decision-making process in SDM encounters, concluding that the patient-clinician relationship affects the quality of the decision. Furthermore, there is a need to understand the impact of peer pressure on decision-making. For example, in our decision context, some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] have reported that the opinions and support from the husband of a pregnant woman going through this decision, as well as experiences from other women who went through this same condition may be important to support them.</p>
                  <p id="Par51">The different DCS subscales have normally been compared in relation to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], less frequently when comparing SDM interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], or for decision analysis as an intervention for SDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] evaluating the DCS for measuring the quality of end-of-life decisions, authors found significant differences in DCS scores between usual care (higher DCS scores) and the intervention (containing an evidence-based component and value elicitation exercises), and these were due to factors contributing to uncertainty and the efficacy of their decisions. They highlight some of the factors contributing to high uncertainty; feeling uninformed, feeling unclear about personal values, and feeling unsupported. Our study also showed that the subscale showing high conflict between groups was the uncertainty subscale (how clear and sure do patients feel about what to choose) and was attributed to the low certainty of the evidence and the support from others (specially clinicians) in the decision-making process. Despite this, value elicitation exercises did help clarify personal values. Other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] have also reported on the contribution of decision analysis to support SDM and improve the uncertainty and effectiveness of the process; as Robinson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] explain: decision analysis was of value as it seeks to create a rational framework for evaluating complex medical decisions and to provide a systematic way of integrating potential outcomes with probabilistic information. However, our findings, as well as a scoping review on SDM containing decision analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] highlighted the difficulties on how to implement decision analysis recommendations in clinical decision-making. Our results reveal that some of these challenges are related to how to present recommendations in the clinical encounter, and to deliver the information in a timely manner.</p>

                <title>Limitations and strengths</title>
                <p id="Par52">Our sample consisted of students enrolled in a master program and, therefore, we cannot extrapolate our results to the target population of women with a previous VTE event. This limitation was partly due to the COVID-pandemic, which hindered the recruitment of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, we conducted this study in parallel to a study our team was developing with the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, our focus was to understand the quality of the decision-making process (i.e., how decisional conflict increased or decreased) with respect to each SDM intervention component. To this end, because our participants were active health professionals, they had helpful insights to understand the potential sources of conflict that may arise when implementing SDM interventions in a clinical context. The randomization method we used (sort alphabetically by last name) did not ensure having symmetrical groups and it would have been useful to have assessed the baseline knowledge on gynecology and obstetrics of our participants to ensure the comparability of the three groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, participants were invited to self-report to what extent their knowledge or experiences influenced their decision-making, and provided reflections about similar examples in their clinical practice where they deal with preference sensitive decisions. In addition, we acknowledge the small sample size of our study as well as the different specialties of the health professionals included in our study and not having target clinicians such as gynecologists, obstetricians or hematologists for the decision assessed. Despite this limitation, we observed trends that were consistent with the qualitative findings.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Using a mixed method approach, and presenting the data in a joint manner, are some of the main strengths of our study. As other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] have also reported, mixed-methods designs facilitate the understanding of complex phenomena and overcome the limitation that quantitative data have in understanding complex decision-making processes.</p>
