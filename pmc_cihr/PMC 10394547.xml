                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p><bold>Design</bold>: Prospective parallel randomised, open-label, blinded end-point trial.</p>
                  <p><bold>Participants</bold>: Hypertensive continuing care residents, in either long-term care or supportive living, who are free from glaucoma, and using â¥1 once daily antihypertensive.</p>
                  <p><bold>Setting</bold>: 16 volunteer continuing care facilities in Alberta, Canada, with eligible residents identified using electronic health claims data.</p>
                  <p><bold>Intervention</bold>: All non-opted out eligible residents are randomised centrally by the provincial health data steward to bedtime versus usual care (typically morning) administration of once daily antihypertensives. Timing changes are made (maximum one change per week) by usual care facility pharmacists.</p>
                  <p><bold>Follow-up</bold>: Via linked governmental healthcare databases tracking hospital, continuing care and community medical services.</p>
                  <p><bold>Primary outcome</bold>: Composite of all-cause death, or hospitalisation for myocardial infarction/acute-coronary syndrome, stroke, or congestive heart failure.</p>
                  <p><bold>Secondary outcomes</bold>: Each primary outcome element on its own, all-cause unplanned hospitalisation or emergency department visit, non-vertebral fracture and, as assessed roughly 135 days postrandomisation, fall in the last 30 days, deteriorated cognition, urinary incontinence, decubitus skin ulceration, inappropriate or disruptive behaviour a minimum of 4âdays per week, and receipt of antipsychotic medication or physical restraints in the last 7âdays.</p>
                  <p><bold>Process outcome</bold>: Proportion of blood pressure medication doses taken at bedtime (broken down monthly).</p>
                  <p><bold>Primary outcome analysis</bold>: Cox-Proportional Hazards Survival Analysis.</p>
                  <p><bold>Sample size</bold>: The trial will continue until a projected 368 primary outcome events have occurred.</p>
                  <p><bold>Current status</bold>: Enrolment is ongoing with 642 randomisations to date (75% female, mean age 88 years).</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Using electronic usual care health data, Alberta Health Services is identifying all eligible residents, randomising/allocating them to intervention or control, deriving baseline characteristics and outcomes, determining when sufficient events to stop the trial have occurred and performing all analyses.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Given a low observed opt-out rate (~6%), our findings should generalise well to continuing care settings.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Normal blood pressure (BP) has a circadian rhythm with relatively lower pressures overnight.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and congestive heart failure (CHF) correlate more strongly with BP when measured at night (ie, during sleep),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â5</xref> it is hypothetically possible that preferentially lowering bedtime BP, by switching morning antihypertensives to bedtime, could lower cardiovascular risk. In 2010, Spanish researchers were the first to report a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) exploring this antihypertensive timing change in hypertensive patients referred for ambulatory BP monitoring. This trial, MAPEC, reported a surprisingly large 61% relative reduction in MACE in favour of bedtime antihypertensives.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The same investigators followed this up in 2020 with another RCT in a hypertensive primary care population (âHygiaâ) reporting, PM versus AM, another large 45% MACE reduction.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> And yet, despite these favourable trials, hypertension guidelines have yet to embrace bedtime antihypertensive use.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8â11</xref> This presumably relates to (1) concern over irregularities in the reporting of MAPEC and Hygia which raise questions about their adherence to established RCT methodology<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12â17</xref> and (2) a more recent (late 2022) independent RCT, the UK-based TIME trial,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which reported neither benefit nor harm from bedtime antihypertensives in a hypertensive primary care population.</p>
              <p>Randomised trials of cardiovascular interventions often either exclude, or fail to recruit, individuals who are elderly, frail or medically complex.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19â21</xref> As such, trials in younger, healthier individuals are often generalised to the frail elderly without the intervention being explicitly studied in this population. This is problematic, given risks and benefits may differ meaningfully in those with greater frailty, or medical complexity. In particular, for bedtime antihypertensives, it is important to recognise that bedtime use is expected to lower what is already the lowest BP of the day (ie, achieve lower overnight BP troughs). Conceivably, more extreme BP lows, even if transient, could facilitate hypotensive or ischaemic adverse effects in those who are susceptible.</p>
              <p>In 2017, the âBedMed Initiativeâ was funded by Canadian governmental bodies to validate the findings of MAPEC in a Canadian population. These funds support two separate RCTs: (1) BedMed,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> which explores the benefit of bedtime vs morning antihypertensive administration in a community-dwelling primary care population and (2) BedMed-Frail (the subject of this protocol), which evaluates the same timing change in those who can no longer live independently, and who reside within one of 16 participating Alberta continuing care facilities. Specifically, BedMed-Frail randomises individual continuing care residents to take all existing once daily BP medication at bedtime, compared with no timing change (typically morning use), and tracks mortality and morbidity using linked electronic healthcare databases tracking hospital, community and continuing care services. Although the primary goal is to validate, in a population of frail older Canadians, the mortality/morbidity benefits described in MAPEC, we place equal importance on detecting potential harms. This protocol is prepared in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

                <p>An AHS data analyst identifies all non-opted out eligible residents, and randomises all these individuals centrally, at the patient level (computer-generated random number, no blocking or stratification), to either treatment or control. As this data analyst has no contact with patients or providers, allocation is fully concealed and irreversible. Once all existing eligible residents have been randomised, newly admitted eligible residents (informed of the trial during facility admission) are similarly randomised at monthly intervals throughout the trial.

                  <p>Participating facilities are volunteering to support our trial with no financial compensation, and âfitting it inâ with other work. For several facilities, COVID-19, other infectious outbreaks and implementation of other facility initiatives has led to long delays before the facility pharmacist was able to act on their allocation list. For a few facilities this delayed implementation by several months. Given (1) we are placing an equal emphasis on detecting harm, (2) long implementation delays make both groups look more similar and reduce the ability to detect harm and (3) no action of any kind was taken related to the facilityâs allocation list in this interval, we have adapted the trial to consider the date of each facilityâs initial randomisation to be the date the allocation list was actually acted on, and not the date it was generated. This date was determined by the AHS data analyst, using electronic pharmacy dispensing data, to be the day before the first switch of an eligible patientâs BP medications from morning to bedtime. Individuals who, on the date of implementation, were no longer resident in the facility, hospitalised, or without once daily BP meds, were excluded from the trial.</p>

                  <p>Facility pharmacists implement the intervention by changing once daily antihypertensives in the bedtime group (maximum one per week) to bedtime. This is accomplished by switching antihypertensives into the bedtime blister of the medication cards prepared by the pharmacy and shipped to the facility for nurses to use at the point of care. For facilities where bedtime antihypertensives would be logistically difficult due to limited staffing, or for residents for whom this would not be ideal for resident specific reasons, then dinnertime administration is used. If, at any point in the study, a prescriber wishes to change the medication back to morning for clinical reasons, no further attempts to alter medication timing are made. Antihypertensives which are administered more than once a day are not altered.</p>
                  <p>We will report timing compliance (ie, the percentage of BP meds at the allocated time), on a monthly basis, by examining the âdirections for useâ field in the pharmacy database to detect the timing of each medication for all participants throughout the period during which they can contribute events. As a back-up, given we did not know how readily available âdirections for useâ would be, we are also asking each pharmacy to enter into an excel spreadsheet the number and timing of antihypertensives for all participants who are still alive and resident 6âmonths following the date of that facilityâs initial randomisations.</p>

                <p>BedMed-Frail is event driven and will continue until 368 primary outcomes have been observed. This event target is the projected maximum number of events observable from a network our size, over 3âyears of observation. Assuming a conventional p value of 0.05, 368 events would provide 79% power to detect a true 25% risk difference between treatment groups and, assuming meaningful covariates, would allow observed risk ratio differences of ~15%âor larger to be declared statistically significant. To determine when this event target has been reached, an AHS analyst is tracking the total number of primary outcomes on a monthly basis. At the current rate of events and enrolment, BedMed-Frail should conduct an interim analysis in early 2023, and a final analysis in early 2024.</p>

                    <p>If participants change continuing care facilities within Alberta, we will no longer be able to control their medication timing, which is likely to default to morning use on entering a new facility. As such, we will censor residents who change facilities on the first day of residence in the new continuing care facility. However, we will not censor patients transferred to âinpatient LTCâ at a local hospital, as that is likely to represent an escalation in care due to acute illness, or diminished capacity. If such individuals improve, they may return to the original continuing care facility and we can continue to follow them. If not, the transfer to âinpatient LTCâ likely signals a deterioration of health that may precede adverse health outcomes that would be important to capture. If residents change their level of care, but remain in the same facility (ie, move to a different floor or wing, which has a different level of care), we will continue to follow them, as their medication timing is unlikely to change.</p>
