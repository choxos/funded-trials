              <abstract>
                <p>Compositional analysis of the intestinal microbiome in pre-schoolers is understudied. Effects of probiotics on the gut microbiota were evaluated in children under 4-years-old presenting to an emergency department with acute gastroenteritis. Included were 70 study participants (n=32 placebo, n=38 probiotics) with stool specimens at baseline (day 0), day 5, and after a washout period (day 28). Microbiota composition and deduced functions were profiled using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and predictive metagenomics, respectively. Probiotics were detected at day 5 of administration but otherwise had no discernable effects, whereas detection of bacterial infection (P&lt;0.001) and participant age (P&lt;0.001) had the largest effects on microbiota composition, microbial diversity, and deduced bacterial functions. Participants under 1 year had lower bacterial diversity than older aged pre-schoolers; compositional changes of individual bacterial taxa were associated with maturation of the gut microbiota. Advances in age were associated with differences in gut microbiota composition and deduced microbial functions, which have the potential to impact health later in life.</p>

              <p>Unless there is an insult to health, such as either an intercurrent gastrointestinal infection or exposure to antibiotics, the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome in adults is relatively stable over time (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, during the first few years of life, the diversity of the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota increases with increasing age. Multiple factors influence microbial colonization of mucosal surfaces following birth and during infancy. Such factors include the perinatal environment (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Selma-Royo et al., 2020</xref>), mode of delivery (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>), duration of exclusive human milk feedings (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Savage et al., 2018</xref>), exposure to antibiotics (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2019</xref>), and intercurrent acute intestinal infections (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Perturbation of the infant microbiota has been linked to the later development of asthma and atopic dermatitis (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Tun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Vu et al., 2021</xref>), which often persists into adulthood (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>Several studies have explored the use of probiotics as a sole or adjunctive treatment for varying gastrointestinal distresses in the pediatric population, with varying degrees of clinical success (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Perceval et al., 2019</xref>). However, many of these studies focus solely on clinical outcomes and occasionally perform microbial profiling after treatment to compare the effect of probiotic administration to a randomized control group (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Forster et al., 2021</xref>). This approach, while standard, often overlooks the gut microbiota heterogeneity of pediatric populations (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Roswall et al., 2021</xref>), and precludes investigators from evaluating individual responses to probiotic treatment. Understanding the effect of probiotic administration within participants and stratified by participant characteristics empowers investigators to determine underlying mechanisms and explore how probiotic administration may impact both gut microbiota composition and functions of these microorganisms.</p>
              <p>Analysis of the microbiome within the pediatric population highlights the importance of understanding how age influences microbial population dynamics in health (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Roswall et al., 2021</xref>) and disease (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dinleyici et al., 2018</xref>). Investigating disease-microbiome-functional pathways-chronological age and temporal associations in the pediatric population will provide a broader understanding of the dynamics of the microbiome during both health and disease.</p>
              <p>We took advantage of the availability of stool samples collected from children from 3 months to 48 months of age who were enrolled into a prospective randomized trial that compared the severity of an acute gastroenteritis episode between those who received a probiotic mixture, containing <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> and <italic>L. helveticus</italic>, to those who received a placebo (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Freedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Freedman et al., 2021b</xref>).</p>
              <p>In this study, sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of 16S rDNA was used to determine the bacterial composition and Picrust2 employed to then deduce bacterial functions in stool samples obtained at the time of acute gastroenteritis, after 5 days of receiving either the probiotic mixture or placebo, and after recovery from the acute illness at 28 days after entry into the study. Herein, in analysis of the primary outcome of the study we provide evidence that a five-day exposure to probiotics results in transient colonization of the gut, but does not induce detectable persisting changes in either the fecal microbiota composition or deduced bacterial functions. Rather, analyses of data for secondary outcomes showed that chronological age and evidence of an acute, intercurrent bacterial infection are determinants of bacterial diversity in the intestine of children under 4 years of age.</p>

                <title>DNA Extraction and 16S Ribosomal RNA Gene Sequencing</title>
                <p>To evaluate the effects of probiotic administration on gut microbiota composition, V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on stool specimens collected from participants at baseline (day 0), 5 days after administration of either probiotics or placebo administration (day 5), and after a washout period (corresponding to day 28 of the study). Sequences of the 16S rRNA gene variable 3–4 (V3–V4) regions were amplified using modifications previously described (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Whelan et al., 2014</xref>) and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego, California). Primer and adaptor sequences were trimmed from the resulting sequences using Cutadapt (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2011</xref>). DADA2 pipeline was used to filter and trim paired reads (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Callahan et al., 2016</xref>) DADA2 error correction was performed for each paired read, the de-noised reads merged, and any sequences identified as chimeric sequences were removed.</p>
                <p>Taxonomy was assigned to the resulting Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) using RDP classifier trained with the Silva v123 16S rRNA database (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Quast et al., 2013</xref>). ASVs not assigned to bacteria were removed, and alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed on a rarefied ASV table using Phyloseq and Vegan packages in R v3.5.6. The predicted metagenomic function of the gut microbiota composition was performed using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (Picrust2) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>Analysis of 16S rRNA data was performed in R v3.5.6. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were assessed using a rarified amplicon sequence table at 20,000 reads. Linear regression and repeated measure PERMANOVA (adonis2) were used to assess statistical significance between groups for alpha and beta diversity, respectively. Pairwise comparisons were assessed using the emmeans package in R and multiple comparisons were corrected with Tukey’s <italic>post-hoc</italic> adjustments. Differential relative abundance between treatment groups was assessed using a two-sided permutation t-test. Multiple comparisons were corrected using false discovery rate (FDR). Linear discriminant analysis (LefSE) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Segata et al., 2011</xref>) was used to compare microbiota composition between placebo and probiotic treated study groups after 5 days of intervention.</p>
                <p>Probiotic species monitoring was performed by extracting all ASV with taxonomy assigned to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> ASV counts were normalized by centre log ratio transformation and linear regression analysis was performed using Lmer package in R to identify <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> ASV associated with treatment; pairwise comparisons were performed using emmeans R package. ASV that were identified as significantly associated with treatment group and differential between probiotic and placebo-treated on day 5 were evaluated for strain level taxonomy using the complete ASV sequence compared to the 16S rRNA sequences for <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> R0011 (GenBank: AGKC00000000.1) and <italic>L. helevticus</italic> R0052 (NC_018528.1) using BLASTn alignment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul and Gish, 1996</xref>).</p>
                <p>A mixed model linear regression analysis on centre log transformed genus level ASV was employed to identify taxa associated with both participant age, as a categorical variable defined as infants under one year of age (&lt;1.0 yr), toddlers between one to two years of age (1.0 – 2.0 yrs) and pre-schoolers over 2 years of age (&gt;2.0 - &lt;4.0 yrs), and sampling day (days 0, 5 and 28 after entry into the study). Multiple comparisons were corrected using false discovery rate (FDR). The average centre log ratio normalized abundance was taken for each of the significant taxa across groups at the individual sampling time points (days 0, 5 and 28) and hierarchical clustering using complete linkage was employed to identify groups of taxa with similar abundances.</p>
                <p>The core microbiota was determined by evaluating taxa with &gt; 50% prevalence within each age group at both day 0 and day 28. Predicted microbial functional pathway abundance was normalized using centre log ratio. The mixed model linear regression analysis test with false discovery rate (FDR) used for multiple comparison correction was employed to assess changes in pathway abundance across both days in the trial and age groups.</p>
                <p>Principal coordinate analysis was performed using total sum scaled predicted functional pathways abundance in STAMP (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Parks et al., 2014</xref>). Differential abundance between age groups was determined by one-sided Welch’s t-test, with multiple comparisons corrected by FDR. Spearman correlation between predicted microbial pathways and participant age, measured in months after delivery, was performed using a centre log ratio transformed ASV extracted from study day 28 samples, and then corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR.</p>

                <p>Inference about relative abundance differences between probiotic- and placebo-treated participants after 5 days of intervention was investigated using linear discriminant effect size (LEfSe): a total of 13 bacterial taxa were identified as differential between the two study groups.

To account for baseline differences between participants and the repeat measures design, a mixed model analysis was performed on the top 50 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) across Day 0 and Day 5, with probiotic treatment and sampling time points set as fixed factors and participant identification as random. Only 3 ASV were found with a significant interaction between probiotic treatment and sampling day: two <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> and one <italic>Akkermansia</italic> ASV were increased in abundance with probiotic treatment.</p>

                <title>Chronological Age Is a Dominant Factor in Determining the Overall Diversity of the Gut Microbiota</title>
                <p>As shown in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>, the age of the participant was the most dominant significant factor affecting alpha diversity of the gut microbiome. For the purposes of this study, age was categorized into three distinct categories: &lt;1.0 yr), 1.0 – 2.0 years, and &gt;2.0 - &lt;4 years). An effect of participant age on fecal alpha diversity was found at entry into the study (day 0; P=0.006), with participants &gt;2.0 - &lt;4.0 years exhibiting the highest microbial diversity. The largest difference between age categories was found between participants &gt;2.0 - &lt;4.0 years of age and those &lt;1 year (P=0.005), although the difference between those &gt;2.0 - &lt;4.0 years and 1.0 - 2.0 years of age was also statistically significant (P=0.04).</p>
                <p>As measured by using the Shannon index, alpha diversity increased over the 28-day study period for participants over 1 year of age. By contrast, participants under 1 year of age had no detectable increase in alpha diversity across the study period. To investigate the effect of age in response to probiotic treatment, we evaluated alpha diversity between participants who received the probiotic versus placebo within the stratified age categories of &lt;1.0 year, 1.0 - 2.0 years of age, and &gt;2.0 - &lt;4.0 years old. There were no significant differences detected between the three age groups (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>Evaluating the effects of clinical and individual participant characteristics on beta diversity of the gut microbiota, participant age was also a dominant factor in determining differential gut microbiota composition at baseline (P=0.006; <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). By contrast, no significant effects related to the presence of enteric pathogens (either bacterial or viruses) were detected. Pairwise comparisons of Weighted Unifrac distances revealed that the largest difference was between infants &lt;1.0 year and children &gt;2.0 - &lt;4.0 years; however, all pairwise comparisons were significant at baseline (day 0). Similar to alpha diversity, differences in beta diversity among age groups were also identified at both days 5 and 28 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). We then evaluated differences in relative abundance for taxa at the genus level among the three age categories at day 0 and found significant differential abundances for <italic>Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, which all significantly decreased with age, while <italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Anareostipes</italic> were increased (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>).</p>

The average centre log normalized abundance was taken for each of the significant taxa across age groups at individual sampling time points and hierarchical clustering then used to identify groups of taxa with similar abundance.

                <title>Association of Fecal sIgA Levels With Chronological Age and Gut Microbiota Composition</title>
                <p>At baseline (day 0) during the acute gastroenteritis episode, there were no differences in sIgA levels among the three age groups. However, significant differences were observed among age groups at both study days 5 and 28 when compared to day 0 (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). Those &gt;2.0 – &lt;4.0 years of age had a lower sIgA on day 5 than at day 0 (P=0.04). The sIgA levels of the oldest group of participants was also lower than participants 1.0 – 2.0 years of age at the same time point (P=0.03). Secretory IgA levels were unchanged between days 5 and 28 for those &lt;1.0 year of age and those 2.0 – 4.0 years old. To determine whether bacterial diversity impacted sIgA levels in the gut, we performed a mixed model linear regression analysis. Alpha diversity as measured by Shannon index [β=0.322, (-0.170, 0.813) P= 0.2] and Chao1[β= -0.005, (-0.014, 0.004) P= 0.39] did not significantly impact sIgA levels.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>These findings demonstrate transient gut colonization of the probiotic strains employed in this prospective randomized trial reported previously (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Freedman et al., 2018</xref>). The absence of detectable probiotic strains found here at day 28, during the recovery phase of the study, provides evidence of colonization resistance mediated by the commensal colonic microflora. Such transient colonization of the intestine is reassuring that probiotics can be provided for short-term defined interventions without concerns arising from the impact of more protracted changes in the composition and functions of the gut microbiota (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rouanet et al., 2020</xref>). Transient gut colonization of preterm infants supplemented with the probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, strain DSM 17938 has been reported, but there was no detectable impact on gut microbial diversity at two years of age (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Marti et al., 2021</xref>). Of course, it is possible that the transient colonization still could have long-term impacts on the host, including local and systemic immune functions (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Vu et al., 2021</xref>), which were not evaluated as part of this study. It is also possible that compositional changes in the microbiota of the small intestine was also impacted, but this was not assessed as part of this study due to the relative invasiveness of the methods required to secure small bowel mucosa and luminal fluid for analyses.</p>
              <p>We also demonstrate that management of acute gastroenteritis with the probiotic strains <italic>L. helveticus</italic> and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> did not result in changes in the composition or deduced functions of the gut microbiome in children 3 to 48 months of age presenting to a hospital emergency department for medical care. The findings indicate that, after accounting for baseline differences between subjects, a 5-day course of treatment with the probiotic mixture of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic>, strain R0011 and <italic>L. helveticus</italic> R0052 had little impact on the gut microbiota composition. However, a measurable and dominant difference in gut microbiota composition was identified in relation to the age of the child. In addition to confirming several longitudinal cohort studies which also reported an association between bacterial diversity and increased age from infancy to 48 months (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bergstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Backhed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Roswall et al., 2021</xref>), we detected several linear relationships between changing abundance of microbial functional pathways and increasing chronological age up to 4 years of age. A time-series analysis of intestinal microbiota of 10 children who were between 36 and 48 months of age, had rotavirus-induced acute infectious diarrhea and who received a 5-day course of the yeast probiotic <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> demonstrated an age-related transition of microbial communities (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dinleyici et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>We found no association in gut microbiota composition or microbial diversity to clinical disease severity. However, a decrease in gut microbial diversity was identified in association with the detection of enteric bacterial pathogens; in particular, with the presence of <italic>C. difficile</italic> in stool samples. Asymptomatic carriage of <italic>C. difficile</italic> is common in infancy with several studies finding carriage in up to 80% of infants under 1 year of age (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jangi and Lamont, 2010</xref>). While carriage of <italic>C. difficile</italic> is common in infancy, the relationship between <italic>C. difficile</italic> carriage of microbiota diversity is not well characterized in children and infants (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jangi and Lamont, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rousseau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Drall et al., 2019</xref>), with one large cohort study finding significant association between <italic>C. difficile</italic> carriage and feeding modality in infant age 3-4 months. Our results, and those of other researchers (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hourigan et al., 2019</xref>), indicate a relationship between a low complexity community of microbiota and <italic>C. difficile</italic> carriage. It remains to be determined, however, whether the low diversity is a result of <italic>C. difficile</italic> symptomatic carriage (or infection) or a facilitator of bacterial colonization.</p>
              <p>Deduced microbial functional differences in the intestinal microbiome also changed with advancing chronological age and altered from the baseline, acute disease, state (day 0) indicating a potential functional association with acute gastroenteritis. During the acute stage of illness, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that children 1.0 – 2.0 years of age exhibited a more functionally immature gut microbiota, which is more comparable to that of a recovered (day 28) infant &lt;1.0 year. Notably, during the recovery stage (day 28) there were several differential functional pathways associated with participant’s age. Specifically, three functional pathways involving heme biosynthesis all dependant on oxygen and vitamin K biosynthesis were negatively correlated with age. Our observation of a transition from functionally more immature microbiota to a more mature intestinal microbiome parallels the transition from a microaerophilic to more strictly anaerobic gut luminal microenvironment. All three heme biosynthesis pathways require molecular oxygen (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Breckau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Frankenberg et al., 2003</xref>), indicating that a decline in these pathways correlated with increasing age and could be linked to a transition to a more strictly anaerobic luminal gut microenvironment. As observed previously (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Nilsen et al., 2020</xref>), we identified a correlation between chronological age and the abundance of metabolic pathways involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, by bacteria colonizing the intestinal tract.</p>
              <p>This study focused on the composition and deduced functions of bacteria colonizing the gut during the first four years of life. Future studies should capture the role of other microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteriophages, fungi, and protists, as these are also quite likely to have a biological role in human development in both in health and in the context of various disease states (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Milani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2021</xref>). While our previous work found no relationship between probiotic administration and secretory fecal IgA levels (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Freedman et al., 2021a</xref>), within the same cohort we found in the current study relationships between genus level abundance of <italic>Veillonella</italic>, <italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Alstipes</italic> and sIgA that were age specific. A previous study focused on the association of immunoglobulins and the infant gut microbiota identified an association between age and declining IgA levels, which was also linked to changes in gut microbiota diversity (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Janzon et al., 2019</xref>). Herein, we observed a negative correlation between <italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Alstipes</italic> and levels of sIgA in stool samples, which is in accordance with the recent finding that <italic>Blautia</italic> evades IgA coating (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Janzon et al., 2019</xref>) and is associated with a more adult like microbiome composition (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Radjabzadeh et al., 2020</xref>). These results indicate that a decrease of IgA abundance as well as a rise in the numbers of <italic>Blautia</italic> could provide an indication of increasing maturation of the gut microbiome.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The findings in this study suggest that for microbiome-based clinical trials, traditional randomization may not be sufficient in capturing individual variations in outcomes, unless substantially large cohorts are utilized. Therefore, studies focused on monitoring the effects of probiotic administration on the composition and the functions of an individual participant’s intestinal microbiome should include both baseline measurements as well as a focus on employing statistics that consider a repeated measure design. In addition to emphasizing the need for including baseline measurements, we also highlight the key subject characteristic of chronological age of the participants is a key factor to be considered when designing future microbiota-based intervention studies during the childhood years.</p>
