                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Indigenous youth are disproportionately represented in new HIV infection rates in Canada. Current and historical contexts of colonisation and racism, disconnection from culture and land, as well as intergenerational trauma resulting from the legacy of residential schools are social drivers that elevate exposure to HIV among Indigenous peoples. Peer-education and arts-based interventions are increasingly used for HIV prevention with youth. Yet limited studies have evaluated longitudinal effects of arts-based approaches to HIV prevention with youth. The authors present a rationale and study protocol for an arts-based HIV prevention intervention with Northern and Indigenous youth in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre non-randomised cohort pilot study using a pretest/post-test design with a 12-month follow-up. The target population is Northern and Indigenous youth in 18 communities in the NWT. The aim is to recruit 150 youth using venue-based sampling at secondary schools. Participants will be involved in an arts-based intervention, Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY). Participants will complete a pretest, post-test survey directly following the intervention, and a 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome is new or enhanced HIV knowledge, and secondary outcomes to include: new or enhanced sexually transmitted infections knowledge, and increased self-esteem, resilience, empowerment, safer sex self-efficacy and cultural connectedness. Mixed effects regression analyses will be conducted to evaluate pretest and post-test differences in outcome measurement scores.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Canada, Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted by HIV, with estimated new infection rates 3.6 times higher than among non-Indigenous persons.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> First Nations, Métis and Inuit comprise about 4.3% of the Canadian population but represent ∼12.2% of new HIV infections in Canada<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and new HIV cases tend to be among younger Indigenous peoples in comparison with non-Indigenous populations.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Rates among Indigenous youth are concerning, with individuals 15–29 years of age accounting for 31.6% of positive HIV test results among Indigenous people.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> HIV also disproportionately impacts Indigenous women in Canada: from 1998 to 2012 women represented 47.3% of all positive HIV test reports among Indigenous peoples compared to 20.1% of reports among non-Indigenous persons.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These statistics underscore the importance of addressing HIV vulnerabilities among young Indigenous people, in particular young women.</p>
              <p>There are staggering sexual health disparities in Canada's North in comparison with the rest of Canada.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In 2010 the Northwest Territories (NWT) had the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases in Canada.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the NWT are disproportionately high among youth,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> with STI rates 10 times the national average.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although having an STI is a known risk factor for HIV transmission<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the recorded HIV rates in the NWT are consistent with the rest of Canada. This may be due to the convergence of geographic isolation, stigma and reduced sexual healthcare access that contribute to low HIV testing rates, and under-reporting.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Yet, elevated STI rates are predicted to result in future increased HIV infection rates in Canada's North.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Sexual health programmes and HIV/STI prevention interventions with Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT are therefore important sites for prevention. There is limited rigorous evaluation of HIV prevention strategies tailored for Indigenous youth, in particular, in assessing long-term effects in reducing HIV exposure and promoting protective factors.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Social and structural factors impacting exposure to HIV among Indigenous youth</title>
                <p>The contexts that increase exposure to HIV acquisition and transmission among Indigenous peoples include, but are not limited to: geographic isolation, limited access to health services and information, poverty, drug use, sex work and gender-based violence.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> Yet, exposure to HIV among Indigenous peoples, in Canada and globally, must be situated within larger structural drivers, which include social, political and economic inequities<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> such as colonisation; racism; disconnection from language, culture and land; and intergenerational trauma due to forced attendance at residential schools.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
                <p>Limited healthcare in rural, remote and small communities creates a unique and significant determinant of sexual health in Northern Canada.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In particular, a shortage of family doctors and sexual health clinics in remote Northern communities creates barriers to healthcare access.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Moreover, inadequate services and a real or perceived lack of confidentiality in small, tight-knit communities further limit STI testing and treatment access.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> HIV-related stigma also continues to present an important barrier to accessing HIV prevention services.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref> Stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV persist globally,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

                <title>Intervention: Fostering Open eXpression among Youth</title>
                <p>This study will evaluate an arts-based HIV prevention programme, Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY) in the NWT, Canada that works with Northern and Indigenous youth to promote sexual health and reduce exposure to HIV/STI. FOXY explores sexual health, HIV/STIs, sexuality and healthy relationships with young women in the NWT. The programme's goal is to use arts-based methods and peers to facilitate education and foster more open expression and communication regarding sexual health and sexuality.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> FOXY uses arts-based approaches in programme delivery; for example, drama techniques are used to facilitate discussion and learning about healthy relationships and making positive choices in realistic sexual scenarios.</p>
                <p>Arts-based methodologies are rooted in social justice and control over the production and dissemination of knowledge, and have been associated with increases in the feeling of empowerment, especially around sexual health decision-making.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> As an arts-based HIV prevention programme, FOXY has integrated local knowledge and contextual resources from its inception. Arts-based approaches to HIV prevention engage, and are enjoyed by, youth<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> —yet there is little known about the long-term efficacy of arts-based and other approaches to reducing exposure to HIV. Specifically, there are gaps in knowledge regarding efficacy of arts-based HIV prevention including: (1) studies with quantitative measures often have insufficient sample sizes to make statistically robust predictions;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> (2) most studies have evaluated immediate effects of programme participation, resulting in a lack of knowledge regarding long-term effects of programme participation;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44–46</xref> and (3) scant research has evaluated arts-based HIV prevention programmes in Canada. We aim to address these gaps by conducting a longitudinal evaluation of FOXY, among Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT.</p>

                <p>The proposed study will evaluate whether, in comparison to preintervention, participants in the FOXY programme demonstrate capacities that reduce exposure to HIV and STI. We hypothesise that participants of the FOXY programme will report higher primary outcome (HIV knowledge) measurement scores, and higher secondary outcome (STI knowledge, self-esteem, empowerment, safer sex self-efficacy and cultural connectedness) measurement scores in a pre–post intervention comparison.</p>

Venue-based sampling will be implemented in grade 7 through 12 classes at secondary schools in 18 communities of the NWT (Yellowknife, Hay River, Inuvik, Fort Smith, N'Dilo, Norman Wells, Fort Providence, Behchoko, Tuktoyaktuk, Wha Ti, Fort Resolution, Aklavik, K'atlodeeche First Nation, Ulukhaktok, Fort Liard, Fort Simpson, Lutselk'e, Fort McPherson).</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Prior to the beginning of the study, FOXY staff will have communicated with each school and the students will be notified that there will be a series of workshops in which they can voluntarily participate. Reverse consent forms will be sent out to parents or guardians at least 1-week in advance of the workshop. Reverse consent forms work by assuming parental or guardian consent unless parents or guardians complete and submit the form indicating they do not want their child to participate. Only those workshop participants whose parents or guardians have not returned the reverse consent form will be asked to participate in the research component of this programme. On the initial day of the workshop, these programme participants will be asked if they would like to participate in the survey. At this point, prospective participants will be informed of all stages of data collection: baseline, postintervention and 12-month follow-up. If they indicate interest in participating, they will be presented with assent forms.</p>
                <p>Our research team opted to use a reverse consent process rather than mandating parental consent in order to reduce barriers to young women participating in the FOXY intervention and research process. Mandating parental consent might mean that youth who experience less parental engagement might be unable to participate in a programme that aims to facilitate important skills around sexual health communication and healthy relationships. Several studies have concluded that youth as young as 14 years of age are capable of making informed decisions about their participation in research.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47–50</xref> Along with receiving approval from our research ethics board, the reverse consent process was also approved through our research licensing process, which consulted community organisations, schools and Aboriginal governments in all communities that FOXY reaches before the NWT Research License is issued.</p>

                <title>FOXY group-based programme</title>
                <p>The FOXY intervention was developed through an iterative and intensive revision process that took place over a 2-year period. The first stage entailed the FOXY team working with youth peer leaders from various communities in the NWT to develop an initial intervention. The intervention was then focus tested across the NWT with youth who chose to participate. Following every workshop, the FOXY team considered and integrated feedback from youth who participated in the intervention which included multiple revisions of workshops.</p>
                <p>The FOXY intervention involves seven workshops that are 1–2 hours each. The complete intervention is conducted over 1–2 days in communities across the NWT. Each workshop will include ∼8–15 youth participants. FOXY Executive Director (Lys C), as well as other facilitators and adolescent peer leaders on staff at FOXY will conduct the intervention in schools where FOXY has been invited. All facilitators and peer leaders have expertise in sexual health education and arts-based HIV prevention. The content will be delivered using a variety of methods including small and large group discussions, theatre techniques such as, role playing and charades and other arts-based methods including body-mapping. Participants will receive gifts such as FOXY-branded materials for participating in the intervention and surveys.</p>
                <p>The content areas for each 1–2 hour session include:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Birds and the bees: Participants will work together in groups to create visual word maps related to sexual health topics.

A mixed-effects regression will be used to model each continuous outcome measure as a function of two time dummy variables, one for postintervention interview time point and one for 12-month follow-up.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There is little known about the efficacy of arts-based interventions in reducing exposure to HIV, particularly with a long-term follow-up—yet research highlights how youth enjoy and engage with arts-based approaches to HIV prevention.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The current study aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting longitudinal evaluation of FOXY, an arts-based HIV prevention programme that works with youth in the NWT. The central goal is to assess the efficacy of FOXY for improving primary knowledge (ie, HIV knowledge) and secondary outcomes (ie, empowerment). A potential limitation of this study is its non-randomised cohort design and the lack of a control group. However, as a pilot study, the goal is to also assess and enhance FOXY's capacity to engage future research and programme evaluations. Post-pilot study research could include more rigorous design, such as stepped wedge, where it would then be more feasible to incorporate a control group into the study design. In addition, future research could explore whether FOXY is feasible from a community context rather than the intervention being implemented strictly within a school context. If efficacious, this study could be adapted and tested with other Northern and Indigenous populations of youth.</p>

              <title>Ethical considerations and dissemination</title>
              <p>This study aims to evaluate an arts-based HIV prevention programme, and poses minimal risks to participants. The consent form will be read aloud to participants, and researchers will speak to each participant before the completion of surveys in order to ensure their understanding of the process. Participants will also be made aware of the purpose of the intervention and the measures in place to ensure their anonymity and confidentiality.</p>
              <p>Psychological and emotional risks might include participants feeling uncomfortable or vulnerable discussing their experience(s) regarding some of the topics addressed through the prevention programme, such as sexual practices and sexuality. In order to minimise these psychological/emotional risks, the researcher will ensure the following: (1) participants are aware that they may skip any questions if they feel uncomfortable or do not wish to answer; (2) participants are aware that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time or stage of the study without any adverse consequences; (3) participants will be reminded that their participation in the study will not affect their access to current and future programmes, workshops and other services in the community; and, (4) participants will be provided with information about community resources, such as sexual/reproductive health services, youth resource centres, mental health agencies and community health services. The team implementing this study have been trained in mental health first aid, have several years of experience conducting these workshops with young women across the NWT, have developed expertise in providing immediate emotional support and will refer participants who require it to support systems in their respective school.</p>
              <p>Participants might perceive social risks regarding loss of privacy and breaches of confidentiality regarding self-disclosed personal information in the survey. This risk will be minimised by informing participants that no identifying information, such as their name or address, will be collected on the survey and that only numerical codes will be used to identify data. Participants will also be asked to mark X on the consent form to indicate their consent, and the X will ensure confidentiality. There will be no paper copies of the surveys, as survey responses will be collected online and surveys will be conducted with tablet-based computers. Codebooks that include the names/contacts of participants and their ID codes, to match participants for follow-up surveys, will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the FOXY Executive Director's office and destroyed after the 12-month follow-up survey data are completely uploaded.</p>
