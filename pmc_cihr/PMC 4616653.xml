                <p>Failure to recognize the presence of competing risk or to account for it may result in misleading conclusions. We aimed to perform a competing risk analysis to assess the efficacy of the low molecular weight heparin dalteparin versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) in venous thromboembolism (VTE) in medical-surgical critically ill patients, taking death as a competing risk.</p>
                <p>This was a secondary analysis of a prospective randomized study of the Prophylaxis for Thromboembolism in Critical Care Trial (PROTECT) database. A total of 3746 medical-surgical critically ill patients from 67 intensive care units (ICUs) in 6 countries receiving either subcutaneous UFH 5000 IU twice daily (n‚Ää=‚Ää1873) or dalteparin 5000 IU once daily plus once-daily placebo (n‚Ää=‚Ää1873) were included for analysis.</p>
                <p>A total of 205 incident proximal leg deep vein thromboses (PLDVT) were reported during follow-up, among which 96 were in the dalteparin group and 109 were in the UFH group. No significant treatment effect of dalteparin on PLDVT compared with UFH was observed in either the competing risk analysis or standard survival analysis (also known as cause-specific analysis) using multivariable models adjusted for APACHE II score, history of VTE, need for vasopressors, and end-stage renal disease: sub-hazard ratio (SHR)‚Ää=‚Ää0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70‚Äì1.21, <italic>P</italic>-value‚Ää=‚Ää0.56 for the competing risk analysis; hazard ratio (HR)‚Ää=‚Ää0.92, 95% CI: 0.68‚Äì1.23, <italic>P</italic>-value‚Ää=‚Ää0.57 for cause-specific analysis. Dalteparin was associated with a significant reduction in risk of pulmonary embolism (PE): SHR‚Ää=‚Ää0.54, 95% CI: 0.31‚Äì0.94, <italic>P</italic>-value‚Ää=‚Ää0.02 for the competing risk analysis; HR‚Ää=‚Ää0.51, 95% CI: 0.30‚Äì0.88, <italic>P</italic>-value‚Ää=‚Ää0.01 for the cause-specific analysis. Two additional sensitivity analyses using the treatment variable as a time-dependent covariate and using as-treated and per-protocol approaches demonstrated similar findings.</p>
                <p>This competing risk analysis yields no significant treatment effect on PLDVT but a superior effect of dalteparin on PE compared with UFH in medical-surgical critically ill patients. The findings from the competing risk method are in accordance with results from the cause-specific analysis.</p>

              <p>A competing risk is defined as an event that either precludes another event under investigation or fundamentally alters the probability of the outcome of interest.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In health research, it is not uncommon for participants to experience a competing risk event such as death, which prevents observing the event of interest. Failure to recognize the presence of competing risk or to account for it may result in misleading conclusions in clinical trials or epidemiological research.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), because of their complex acute and chronic illnesses, analgesia and paralysis, immobility, and other interventions they may receive.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Until recently, there were insufficient data to adequately compare the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin (UFH) in preventing VTE in medical-surgical critically ill patients.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The multicenter international randomized controlled trial, PROTECT (Prophylaxis for Thromboembolism in Critical Care Trial), evaluated the efficacy of dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin) versus UFH in proximal leg deep vein thromboses (PLDVT), and other VTEs.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The trial reported no significant effect of dalteparin versus UFH on PLDVT, but a significantly superior treatment effect of dalteparin on PE using standard survival analysis (also known as cause-specific analysis).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, the mortality rate (23.3%) was much higher than the rate of PLDVT (5.5%) and PE (1.8%) during follow-up.</p>
              <p>Death prior to a VTE precludes the occurrence of subsequent PLDVT and PE, and therefore it can potentially affect the estimation of thromboprophylaxis efficacy.

Patients were enrolled in this trial if they were ‚â•18-years old, weighed ‚â•45‚Ääkg, and were expected to stay in the ICU for ‚â•3 days. Exclusion criteria were an admission diagnosis of trauma, orthopedic surgery, uncontrolled hypertension, or neurosurgery; major hemorrhage within the previous week; stroke, coagulopathy, or thrombocytopenia; pregnancy; or limitation of life-support. Patients with a need for anticoagulant therapy, with a contraindication to heparin or blood products, or who were already enrolled in a related trial, were also excluded.

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>Descriptive statistics for baseline characteristics of the patients were presented as means and standard deviations (SDs) or median and interquartile range (IQR) for data on continuous variables, and frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Because the percentage of missing data was small (&lt;5%),<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we imputed the missing data using the mean or median of the variable in its group when survival analysis was performed. All tests were 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05.</p>
                <p>The independence assumption of the time distribution between VTE and death may not be satisfied in survival analysis due to the competing risk of death, therefore the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method was not appropriate to estimate survival curves for VTE.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We used the cumulative incidence function (CIF, also known as the subdistribution), which was derived from the cause-specific hazard function and did not require the independence assumption, to estimate the marginal probability of VTE in the presence of competing risk.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Specifically, given a time point t, the CIF denoted the probability of experiencing a VTE by the time t when the patients could also die before they developed a VTE. We used the Pepe and Mori method to test whether the CIFs of VTE between the treatment groups (dalteparin versus UFH) were significantly different.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method was used to evaluate the CIF of death, and the log-rank test was performed to compare the CIFs between the treatment groups.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p>All the analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. We first performed univariate analyses for PLDVT and PE in the Fine and Gray model, and Cox regression for cause-specific analysis, respectively. Multivariable analyses were then employed, in which the analyses were adjusted for the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, history of personal or family VTE, need for vasopressors, and end-stage renal disease.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for the Fine and Gray model, while hazard ratios (HRs) were presented for cause-specific analysis. Both a statistical test and a graphical examination based on the Schoenfeld residuals were used to assess the proportional hazards assumption.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Two additional sensitivity analyses were conducted. Since there may be gaps in the treatment of participants during follow-up, we included the treatment as a time-dependent covariate in both cause-specific analysis and the Fine and Gray model, to investigate whether the estimated treatment effect was robust.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Another sensitivity analysis was performed by using as-treated and per-protocol analyses in PLDVT and PE.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this study based on data from the international PROTECT trial, we conducted a competing risk analysis to evaluate the effect of dalteparin versus UFH for the VTE prevention in medical-surgical critically ill patients, taking death as a competing risk. The competing risk analysis showed no significant effect of dalteparin compared with UFH on PLDVT, but a lower risk of PE. These findings were in agreement with results from the cause-specific analysis in the main report.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Similar results from additional sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of these findings.</p>
              <p>In both the competing risk analysis and cause-specific analysis, we observed a significant difference in PE while no difference in PLDVT for dalteparin compared with UFH. One hypothesis may be due to the difference in nonleg DVT.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in nonleg DVT between the dalteparin and UFH group.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>Another possible interpretation may rely on the fact that, unlike the PLDVT, the PE outcome was not screened twice-weekly.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, little was known whether the difference in the detection would lead to the difference in the PLDVT and PE outcomes in the PROTECT. More evidence is needed to further explore and clarify the difference in PE for dalteparin versus UFH in critically ill patients.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given the presence of competing risk of death, it may not be appropriate in general to simply censor patients who died before they had a chance to experience a VTE using a cause-specific analysis. Theoretically, the distribution of time-to-censorship may provide information about the distribution of time-to-event, and therefore the assumption of noninformative censoring may not be satisfied in standard survival analysis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Similarly, those patients who died without having developed a VTE may not be representative of the other patients who remained in the risk set, thereby violating the assumption of independence of survival times between VTE and death.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Ignoring the competing risk could result in incorrect estimation of the actual risk of VTE in the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and bias the benefit of interventions in trials or the associations between risk factors and outcomes in cohort studies using a cause-specific analysis.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In contrast, the Fine and Gray model modifies the risk sets such that patients experiencing the competing event are retained artificially in the cohort, with decreasing weight to account for the declining observability in the analyses, rather than being simple censored.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The Fine and Gray model could directly use the CIFs to calculate the hazards, and subsequently investigate the treatment effect expressed as a SHR.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Compared with the standard survival analysis, the Fine and Gray model had been supported by emerging evidence to account for competing risk, and the SHR had been justified as a better way to estimate the treatment effect than a HR in the Cox regression model.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, we observed a virtually identical treatment effect of dalteparin versus UFH on VTE in the competing risk analysis and the cause-specific method (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). One of the most important reasons was that the cumulative incidences of mortality between the dalteparin group and UFH group were very similar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), in which the 2 cumulative incidence curves overlapped substantially (<italic>P</italic>-value‚Ää=‚Ää0.23 for log-rank test). Therefore, the similar mortality between the 2 groups yielded analogous censoring in the cause-specific analysis that ignored competing risk. All these findings further supported a similar effect of dalteparin versus UFH on the development of PLDVT but a protective effect on PE in medical-surgical critically ill patients.</p>
              <p>There were 3 other trials investigating the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in DVT compared with UFH in medical-surgical critically ill patients,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> as summarized in a recent systematic review.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> No protective effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on DVT was found in these trials. However, none of them took the competing risk such as death into consideration, despite the high mortality during follow-up. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the competing events would influence the treatment effect reported in these trials.</p>
              <p>One study compared the efficacy of dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant therapy in the prevention of recurrent VTE in cancer patients using the standard survival analysis and the Fine and Gray model.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> These investigators reported a similar treatment effect of dalteparin from these 2 analyses, with a HR of 0.48 in the cause-specific method and a SHR of 0.47 in the competing risk analysis, respectively, and concluded that if the time distribution of competing risks was similar between the treatment groups, standard survival analysis and competing risk method would produce similar findings.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> If, however, the trial intervention had a different effect on the mortality and the censoring of a competing risk exerted a different influence on the probability of outcomes of interest, a cause-specific analysis ignoring competing risk would lead to misleading findings.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>For instance, in Pintilie example, he modified the data and assessed the effect of radiation versus chemotherapy on cardiac hospitalization in 689 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The cause-specific analysis yielded an effect of radiation versus chemotherapy on cardiac hospitalization that was not significant (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.71‚Äì1.63), while the Fine and Gray model found that radiation was significantly related with increased risk of cardiac hospitalization (SHR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.10‚Äì2.45). The interpretation relied on the fact that the treatment groups had different effect on the risk of death (HR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.31‚Äì0.47 for radiation versus chemotherapy). In other words, the time distribution of death in the chemotherapy group was different from the radiation group, and more patients died in the chemotherapy group before they could experience cardiac hospitalization than in the radiation group. Even though no clinical conclusion could be drawn due to the modification of the data,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> this example did show that the cause-specific method ignoring the difference of censoring of the competing risk would result in a biased finding. Therefore, in the presence of competing events, a competing risk analysis or a comparison between a competing risk and standard survival analysis would be recommended to minimize the potential impact of competing risks and avoid incorrect conclusions.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this study include a large sample size from a multicenter RCT and the use of optimally available statistical methods to investigate the efficacy of dalterparin versus UFH in VTE, taking into death as a competing risk account. Additional sensitivity analyses were also conducted to further assess and support the robustness of the original findings. However, we did not account for the transfer to a nontrial hospital as another potential competing event for VTE in this study. Given the limited data recorded in the database, no analysis could be performed to assess whether the competing risk of transfer to a non-trial hospital would impact the estimation of treatment effect on VTE. Furthermore, because this study focused on methodological analysis and aimed to assess the impact of competing risk, we did not have the data on serological tests and coagulation states for patients in this RCT. Therefore, for the phenomenon that there was significant difference in PE but no difference in PLDVT in the treatment groups, we could not use the serological or coagulation results to further illuminate the mechanism.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>In this competing risk analysis using data from an international critical care trial, no significant difference was found between dalteparin and UFH on PLDVT, but dalteparin significantly reduced the risk of PE in medical-surgical critically ill patients. All the findings from the competing risk method were in accordance with results from a cause-specific analysis, increasing the inferences from the original findings.</p>
