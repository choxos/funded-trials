                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is an essential component for TB elimination. In order to be successfully implemented on a large scale, TPT needs to be safe, affordable and widely available in all settings. Short TPT regimens, that are less burdensome than longer regimens, to patients and health systems, are needed. Doses of rifampin higher than the standard 10mg/kg/day were tolerated in studies to reduce duration of treatment for tuberculosis disease (TBD). The objective of this trial is to test the safety of high dose rifampin monotherapy to shorten the duration of the currently recommended TPT of 4 months rifampin.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a phase 2b, randomised, controlled, parallel group, superiority, partially-blind trial. Primary outcomes are completion of treatment (as a proxy measure of tolerability) and safety. The two experimental arms comprise 60 days of (i) 20mg/kg/day or (ii) 30mg/kg/day rifampin; the control arm comprises 120 days of 10mg/kg/day rifampin as TPT. Participants are adults and children 10 years or older, eligible for TPT. Completion is the primary outcome, measured by pill count and is defined as taking minimum of 80% of treatment in 120% of allowed time; it will be tested for superiority by logistic regression. Safety outcome comprises proportion of grade 3–5 adverse events and grade 1–2 rash, adjudicated related to study drug, and resulting in permanent drug discontinuation; compared for non-inferiority between each of the two high dose arms and the standard arm, using Poisson regression. A sample size of 1,359 participants will give 80% power to detect a 10% difference in completion rates and a 1% difference in the safety outcome. The study is conducted in Canada, Indonesia and Vietnam. Enrolment is ongoing at all sites.</p>

              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment (TPT) is a key component in achieving global TB elimination [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and it is reccomended for close contacts of people with TB, persons living with HIV, and persons with other immune-suppressing conditions at risk of TB infection (TBI) with <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To scale-up TPT in an effort to achieve TB elimination, we need safe and affordable regimens that are acceptable to people in a wide range of settings.</p>
              <p>Nine months of isoniazid monotherapy (9H) has demonstrated efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but its implementation is limited by its long duration and suboptimal safety profile [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Regimens with shorter duration, such as four months of daily rifampin (4R), 12 weeks of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid, or three months of daily rifampin and isoniazid have similar efficacy, better completion and lower health system costs than 9H [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, 4R has a better safety profile than 9H [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but 3–4 months of treatment remains suboptimal for large scale acceptability by people with TB infection and by health systems.</p>
              <p>Reducing the duration of TPT, while maintaining safety, tolerability, and efficacy could improve feasibility of utilization; and reduce the treatment burden for patients and health systems. In studies to reduce duration of treatment for TB disease (TBD), increasing the daily dose of rifampin showed promising results [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The standard weight-based dose of 10mg/kg rifampin has been increased to 15mg/kg, 20mg/kg and even 30mg/kg/day or more [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with good tolerability and higher proportion of sputum conversion at 8 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We postulate that, similar high doses of rifampin could be used to shorten rifampin monotherapy in TPT. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine which is the optimal dose that will achieve similar efficacy as 4R, without substantial increase in adverse events. In this randomised, phase 2b, controlled, parallel groups, superiority trial, we plan to verify that two months of 20mg/kg and 30mg/kg of rifampin monotherapy are safe and well tolerated, before testing for efficacy in a subsequent phase 3 study. An experimental study in an animal model is ongoing.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this trial is to both compare treatment completion and safety of 4R with two months of rifampin at double (20mg/kg) or triple (30mg/kg) the standard adult rifampin dose weight based. The secondary objective is to compare efficacy, defined as rate of TBD in 26 months following randomization.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This is a three-arm, phase 2b, partially blind, controlled randomized trial. The trial is powered to test superiority of completion and non-inferiority of safety. Randomization is individual and 1:1:1 in the three arms. Members of the same household are randomized to the same arm (i.e., cluster randomized), as long as they are enrolled within 14 days from the date of randomization of the first family member. The study is open label for duration and double blind for dosing of the two high dose arms (300 mg and 450 mg capsules appear identical). The trial has a pharmacokinetics (PK) component, described in more details below.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec011">
                <title>Rationale for design features</title>
                <p>We expect that completion would be superior in the intervention arms than the comparator arm, due to the shorter duration of therapy. We chose a superiority design, since the rationale to assess these high dose shorter regimens for efficacy would be weak if completion was not improved over 4R.</p>
                <p>Blinding in the two experimental arms lowers the risk of bias in reporting symptoms by participants, and in making decisions about drug discontinuation by the treating team. The study is open label for duration since duration is an important determinant of treatment completion.</p>
                <p>The randomization is clustered by households to avoid study medication administration errors between family members. The limit of 14 days from the first household member’s randomization is to avoid preferential enrollment.</p>
                <p>The PK component has been included to assess determinants of variability. There are a few data on PK of higher dose rifampin when used with other medications for treatment of TBD [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), but less is known on PK of high dose rifampin monotherapy, in persons with Tuberculosis infection (TBI) and in diverse populations (for age, sex, weight, and ethnicity). Higher doses of rifampin have not been used with rifampin monotherapy (for TPT). Therefore, intensive PK with sampling at 6 time points will be performed for 18 participants in each arm at a single study site; while a sparse sampling will be done at all sites for a larger number of participants (450), to ensure representation of diverse populations.</p>

                <title>Population and settings</title>
                <p>The study is enrolling in 10 TB clinics located in three countries: Indonesia (Bandung), Vietnam (Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City) and Canada (Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, and Vancouver). The list of clinics can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. The clinics are situated in academic hospitals (n = 7), community health centers (n = 2), and university research centers (n = 1).</p>
                <p>Participants are adults and children at least 10 years old who have an indication for TPT, according to WHO guidelines for Indonesia and Vietnam, or Canadian guidelines for Canadian sites. Eligible persons must weigh at least 25 kg, have either a positive tuberculin skin test (TST), with the threshold for a positive test defined as per National guidelines, or a positive interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), with TB disease excluded.</p>
                <p>Exclusion criteria are pregnancy, liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase) 3 times or more higher than upper limit of normal (ULN); grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in hematological tests; prior treatment for TBI or TBD; contraindications to rifampin–due to potential drug interactions that are considered not manageable by treating team or due to history of allergy/ hypersensitivity to rifamycins; and being household contacts of index TB patients with confirmed or presumed rifampin resistant TB. For contacts: index TB patients must have rifampin susceptible TB as per drug susceptibility testing (DST) or GeneXpert result predicting rifampin susceptibility. If neither DST nor GeneXpert are available, then the index TB patients must have no prior TB therapy.</p>
                <p>At each site, potential participants who would be recommended TPT by their treating team, are asked to meet the research staff if interested in the study.</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p>The treating team and research personnel at site (with exception of study pharmacist) are blinded to dose in the two high-dose arms. Rifampin for high dose arms have been prepared specifically for the study so that capsules of 300mg and 450mg appear identical. At each study site, once ready to randomize, research staff enter participant’s pre-randomization data (see “Data collection”) in the trial database, which returns duration of treatment (2 months or 4 months) and a randomization code (if participant is in high dose arms) or daily dose, if participant is in standard dose arm. Pharmacists prepare the bottles for research staff to give to participants in high dose arms with either 300mg or 450mg capsules, without indication of dose on the bottle. In both high dose arms, the daily number of capsules is the same by weight band (<xref rid="pone.0278087.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If blinding needs to be broken for safety reasons, the site contacts the coordinating center, who oversees the unblinding. Interim and final analyses are done by an analyst unaware of the trial-group assignments.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcomes are safety and tolerability. Regimen completion is considered a summary measure of tolerability, which combines a participant’s decision to stop due to symptoms, inconvenience, or other reasons and the treating teams’ decision to stop based on adverse events. Completion is defined as taking at least 80% of doses within 120% of allowed time (i.e. minimally 48 daily doses within 72 days for the high dose arms, and 96 doses within 144 days for the standard arm). The number of doses taken is calculated from the number of pills dispensed and remaining pills counted at each treatment phase follow-up visit.</p>
                <p>Safety is defined as the proportion of participants with grade 3 to 5 adverse events, or rash of any grade which resulted in permanent discontinuation of the study drug. If the treating team discontinued the study drug permanently because of concerns of a potential drug-related adverse event, these are evaluated by the adverse events panel. This panel is comprised of 3 members who judge the type, severity, and likely relationship to study drug for each event that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug. These judgements are made without knowledge of study arm (blinded), and without knowledge of the judgements of the treating team, nor of the other adverse event panel members. Grading is standardized using American Thoracic Society criteria for hepatotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and National Cancer Institute common criteria for all other types of events [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>The secondary outcome is efficacy, defined as incidence of TBD in the 26 months post-randomization. Surveillance for incident TB is undertaken actively during treatment phase follow-up visits, and every 3 months post-treatment, up to 26 months after randomization. The final diagnosis of TBD is established by an independent panel of three TB expert physicians, who review all clinical, radiographic, microbiologic and treatment information of persons with possible TB disease, blinded to study arm and independently from each other. TB disease will also be determined passively by each site sending the names of study participants to the local TB authorities to cross-check their list of all persons notified to have TBD during the follow-up period.</p>

                  <title>Primary analyses</title>
                  <p>The proportion completing treatment in each high dose arm will be compared against the standard arm, and tested for significance with logistic regression, using an identity link, and estimated via generalized estimating equations (GEE) -to account for clustering by household. An exchangeable correlation structure and empirical standard errors will be used. Analysis of treatment completion will be done as modified intention to treat (MITT), i.e., on all participants enrolled, with exclusion only of participants who were excluded post-randomization, for ineligibility, following procedures defined in the protocol for these exclusions.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of participants with grade 3–5 adverse events during treatment (and up to 30 days after treatment interruption for drug-drug interactions), or grade 1–2 rash with permanent treatment discontinuation adjudicated as possibly or probably related to the study treatment by the adverse events panel, will be compared between each of the two high dose arms and the standard arm. Adjustment for clustering will be done by Poisson regression (as these adverse events should be relatively rare outcomes), including an offset of log(person time), using GEE, with an exchangeable correlation structure and empirical standard errors. To assess non-inferiority of safety, we will use the 95% confidence interval approach, and compare the upper limit of the difference versus a margin of 4%. This margin was chosen as safety is essential for a TPT regimen. In previous trials, standard dose rifampin had 2% of these type of adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278087.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], therefore a maximum adverse events rate of 6% (4% higher) was seen as the maximum that would be acceptable to patients and providers. Analysis of safety will be done on all enrolled participants who took at least one dose of study treatment.</p>

                  <title>Secondary analyses</title>
                  <p>First, lab testing is done routinely at 2 weeks for the two high dose arms, and again at 4 weeks, whereas this testing is only done at 4 weeks for the standard arm, which may bias detection of adverse events. Hence, we plan a secondary analysis for completion and safety that will exclude treatment interruptions and adverse events which occurred only because of the routine lab testing done at 2 weeks in the high dose arms. Second, analysis of non-inferiority of treatment completion, with maximum allowable difference of 5% and one-sided significance level.</p>
                  <p>Last, the incidence of TBD (microbiologically confirmed and all forms) in the 26 months post-randomization per 100 person-years of follow-up, will be compared between all three arms. This analysis will be done as MITT and as per-protocol (i.e., in all participants enrolled and who completed treatment they were assigned to).</p>
                  <p>All these analyses will include adjustment for clustering by household. In stratified analysis, results will be presented by indication for TPT. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted whereby analysis are stratified by study centre and by country.</p>

                  <p>At each treatment phase visit participants are examined and questioned regarding symptoms of TBD and of possible adverse events. Pill counts are done by research personnel, and pills for the next interval dispensed. Routine blood tests include hemogram (hemoglobin, platelet counts, and leukocytes), liver transaminases, bilirubin, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. These are taken after 4 weeks of treatment in all arms, and also at 2 weeks for high dose arms only (<xref rid="pone.0278087.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), to ensure safety in the experimental arms. Additional visits and lab tests can be done if needed, as required by the site medical team.</p>
                  <p>For PK component: at week 4, a minimum of 450 participants (all arms combined), at all sites, have two blood samples collected at 2 and 4 hours after reported drug intake, and, in a subsample of 27 adults (≥18 years old) - 9 per arm- and 27 children (10 to &lt;18years old) -9 per arm- a series of venous blood samples are collected just before, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after witnessed drug intake, at one study site.</p>
                  <p>Due to required restrictions to reduce risk of COVID-19 infections during pandemic, some parts of pre-randomization and treatment-phase visits, including consent process, enrollment, pill count and symptoms questionnaires, may be done remotely, following procedures approved by local ethics committees at each site. Required lab tests and imaging recommendations remain unchanged during public health restrictions related to COVID-19. Where needed, study medications are dispensed by courier, after preparation by the site pharmacist, preserving blinding.</p>
                  <p>To minimize differences in the visit frequency and intensity of follow-up which may affect treatment completion, total number and approximate spacing of visits are the same for all arms. Participants who decide to stop therapy against medical advice are encouraged to restart and complete therapy by their treating team. Participants who maintain the decision to stop, are offered alternative TPT outside of the study or may decide not to take TPT.</p>

                  <title>Post-treatment phase</title>
                  <p>All participants who stop study treatment for any reason, have post treatment follow-up telephone calls every 3 months until 26 months post randomization. Every effort is made to minimize loss to follow-up. At each follow-up call, participants will be questioned regarding current symptoms of TBD, any intercurrent diagnoses of TBD, or hospitalization for any reason. If TBD is presumed (at any time), this is investigated and managed by treating team with assistance of research staff. All presumed TBD are reported to coordinating center, and evaluated by an independent panel of three expert TB clinicians (see above, in “Outcomes”).</p>

                <p>Data collected at all study timepoints are recorded in specifically designed paper case report forms (CRF), and then entered in the study website. Data verification of data for a random sample of participants is done by the coordinating center periodically throughout the study, against source documents at the sites for laboratory and imagining results reported, as well as for paper CRF completed at site versus data entered in website.

                <p>The study is conducted in compliance with this protocol and the International Conference on Harmonisation—Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) in all sites. In each site, regulatory requirements of the Country health authority (Health Canada for Canadian sites, National Agency of Drug and Food Control- Badan POM-, in Indonesia) and of the Ministry of Health in Vietnam, are followed.</p>
                <p>To ensure high quality data, all staff at participating sites receive initial and periodic training in the study protocol, procedures, and data requirements. Research staff have certification of training in Good Clinical Practice.</p>
                <p>Study sites receive monitoring visits every 6 months (or more often if needed) by the coordinating center (study PI and study coordinator/s) to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with protocol and to check for quality of data collected. When travel restrictions apply, monitoring visits are done remotely.</p>
                <p>During monitoring visits from the coordinating center, and if any visits occur for auditing, REB review and regulatory inspections, study site investigators provide direct access to all essential documents including source documents. Independent auditing may occur during study, by sponsor (RI-MUHC), funding agency (CIHR) or regulatory agency (HC).</p>

                  <title>Safety of intervention</title>
                  <p>Rifampin is a safe and well-known drug, used for more than 45 years. Minor adverse effects are explained to participants at enrollment. Serious adverse events, such as hepatitis, are rare and usually resolve once treatment is stopped. Visits and lab tests during treatment follow-up are in place to capture possible events and act upon them before they become severe. As rifampin can interact with other medications, monitoring of potential interactions is discussed with participants and done at follow-up visits. Alternatives to study treatment (including other TPT) are discussed with participants and offered by treating teams when study treatment is stopped.</p>

                  <title>Monitoring of safety</title>
                  <p>This trial has a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), which is composed by the three TB expert physicians (Dr. Mike Lauzardo; Dr. Rick O’Brien and Dr. Randall Reves). The DSMB is responsible to review the two planned interim safety analyses and to review on an ad-hoc and immediate basis any serious or grade 3–4 adverse events that are unexpected and considered treatment related, as well as any deaths that occur during treatment phase.</p>
                  <p>Unexpected serious adverse events related to study drug are reported to local research ethics board (REB), to Health Canada, and to all sites.</p>
                  <p>There are two planned interim analyses, after a total of 150 and 450 participants (i.e., 50 and 150 per arm respectively) have completed treatment phase. The DSMB review the results and give recommendation on trial continuation, need for modification or to stop enrolment if necessary. They also recommend if further interim analyses are needed.</p>
                  <p>Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to ongoing or future treatment from the treating team. Management of all participants who decide to withdraw from the study, is discussed and decided by participant and their treating team.</p>

The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) is described above. The Trial steering committee is composed of the study PI, one investigator per site, the study statistician, and the study coordinator. This committee reviews the recommendations of the DSMB and the SAC, as well the overall progress of the trial, and need for study amendments. It is responsible for all the decisions regarding stopping enrolment to any study arm, or the study. If such a decision is taken, the research ethics committees at all participating sites are notified.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Achieving the WHO TB elimination goals requires a short, safe and effective TPT regimen. In addition, for TPT to be implemented by health care systems in all settings, it needs to be widely available and inexpensive. Among the currently recommended drugs for TPT [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], rifampin is relatively safe, well known, affordable and accessible (as licensed in all countries). When used at the current standard dose though, while very safe, it still needs to be taken for 4 months.</p>
              <p>Higher doses (20mg/kg; 30mg/kg) of rifampin are safe and well tolerated when used in TBD treatment [<xref rid="pone.0278087.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278087.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278087.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278087.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and could be the way to reduce duration of TPT, while maintaining rifampin monotherapy safety profile. This study’s main goal is to demonstrate that high dose rifampin is safe and well tolerated when used for TBI. Doses for which this can be demonstrated, can then be studied in an efficacy trial.</p>
              <p>A shorter treatment with completion comparable or superior to current standard treatment, could have potential benefit because of fewer doses and less time to be in follow-up, which may be convenient for both patients and programs. A treatment with rifampin monotherapy, that can be self-administered with relatively few capsules (up to 4) per day for 60 days, can be of benefit to the large population of people at risk of TBD and to health systems in all settings.</p>

              <p>In Canadian sites: the cost of medications for the standard arm were covered by each Province (as 4R<sub>10</sub> is the standard of care in these sites). Alberta and British Columbia covered also the cost for high dose arms for their participants. For high dose arms, commercially available 300mg rifampin (Rofact) has been re-compounded by Pharmacie Linda Frayne (Montreal, Canada), into 300mg and 450mg capsules, looking the same. For Vietnam sites, 300mg and 450mg capsules made for the study for high dose arms were bought from Svizera Europe B.V. (the Netherlands), 150mg and 300mg rifampin capsules for standard arm were purchased from Mekopharm (Vietnam). For Indonesia, medications for all arms were bought from Indofarma (Indonesia). None of these companies have any role in study design or conduct, nor have they provided any funding or in kind support.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at </p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and </p>

              </p>
              <p>2. Please include a complete copy of PLOS’ questionnaire on inclusivity in global research in your revised manuscript. Our policy for research in this area aims to improve transparency in the reporting of research performed outside of researchers’ own country or community. The policy applies to researchers who have travelled to a different country to conduct research, research with Indigenous populations or their lands, and research on cultural artefacts. The questionnaire can also be requested at the journal’s discretion for any other submissions, even if these conditions are not met.  Please find more information on the policy and a link to download a blank copy of the questionnaire here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting</ext-link>. Please upload a completed version of your questionnaire as Supporting Information when you resubmit your manuscript.</p>
              <p>3. Please amend your list of authors on the manuscript to ensure that each author is linked to an affiliation. Authors’ affiliations should reflect the institution where the work was done (if authors moved subsequently, you can also list the new affiliation stating “current affiliation:….” as necessary).</p>
              <p>4. Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please delete it from any other section. </p>
              <p>5. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please see our Supporting Information guidelines for more information: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information. " ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information. </ext-link></p>
              <p>6. We note that the original protocol file you uploaded contains a confidentiality notice indicating that the protocol may not be shared publicly or be published. Please note, however, that the PLOS Editorial Policy requires that the original protocol be published alongside your manuscript in the event of acceptance. Please note that should your paper be accepted, all content including the protocol will be published under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license, which means that it will be freely available online, and any third party is permitted to access, download, copy, distribute, and use these materials in any way, even commercially, with proper attribution.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we ask that you please seek permission from the study sponsor or body imposing the restriction on sharing this document to publish this protocol under CC BY 4.0 if your work is accepted. We kindly ask that you upload a formal statement signed by an institutional representative clarifying whether you will be able to comply with this policy. Additionally, please upload a clean copy of the protocol with the confidentiality notice (and any copyrighted institutional logos or signatures) removed.</p>
              <p>7. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>

              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: Review: High dose rifampin for 2 months vs standard dose rifampin for 4 months, to treat TB infection: protocol of a 3-arm randomized trial (2R2).</p>
              <p>This manuscript is a protocol to evaluate the adherence to, and safety of, a shorter, high-dose rifampin regimen compared to a standard-dose rifampin tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) regimen, with a secondary aim to evaluate efficacy over a 26-month period. The protocol is well written and clear. The reviewer has a few comments. In addition, for publication purposes, the reviewer thinks that consistent terminology is important (see suggestions in comments), that all abbreviations should first be explained (and once abbreviated, used consistently).</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. The authors use “tuberculosis infection (TBI)” and “latent TB” interchangeably, as well as TB disease (TBD) and “active TB”. The reviewer thinks that for this manuscript it would be better to consistently use “TB infection (TBI)” and “TB disease” (with or without abbreviation “TBD”) throughout, as these refer to the same entities. (see e.g., line 188-189; suggest use “TBI or TBD”)</p>
              <p>2. Line 187: For the exclusion criteria of liver transaminases raised &gt;3 times normal – is this for any one (ALT or AST) or both together (supposedly the first option). Suggest add: “…liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase)…”</p>
              <p>3. Lines 210-211: The reviewer cannot see a reason for unblinding for safety reasons, as if there is a safety issue the patient is likely to discontinue rifampin and not be continued on another rifampin regimen in the trial? Unblinding always creates a risk for bias.</p>
              <p>4. Lines 307-308: What is the purpose of analysis of non-inferiority of treatment completion? Superiority is what is aimed for, as without superiority of treatment completion, there is no real purpose for the shorter regimen?</p>
              <p>5. Line 309: “Last, the incidence of active TB (microbiologically confirmed and all forms) in…” Suggest “TB disease”, but does this only refer to microbiologically confirmed TB – children are also included and in them it may be more difficult to microbiologically confirm TB? What does “all forms” refer to – pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB?</p>
              <p>6. Lines 321-322: Are patients not clinically examined to exclude extrapulmonary TB?</p>
              <p>7. Line 336: “two blood samples collected at 2 and 4 hours after reported drug intake,” Timing of sampling after drug intake is very important to compare concentrations (for PK) - how is the time of taking the medication going to be verified?</p>
              <p>8. Line 337: Suggest define age of children for PK study (10-&lt;18 years?)</p>
              <p>9. Lines 351-352: If participants opt out of the study and receive alternative TPT, do they remain in study follow up or are they excluded from further follow-up (as the other TPT regimen could bias outcome)?</p>
              <p>10: Line 393: Drug-drug interactions are a specific problem with rifampin and several antiretroviral medications, but no mention is made in the protocol regarding inclusion or exclusion of people living with HIV. Could the authors clarify?</p>
              <p>11: Lines 474-483: The different manufacturers of rifampicin and different formulations used may have an important effect on both safety and PK - how is this going to be evaluated?</p>
              <p>Minor comments/suggested corrections.</p>
              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p>- lines 58 and 72: Suggest start sentence with Upper case letter as in line 50 after “:”</p>
              <p>- line 61: delete “:” after “control arm”</p>
              <p>- line 67: To the reviewer’s knowledge, two connected words followed by a noun should be written with a hyphen: in this case “high-dose arm” and “standard-dose arm” – these terms should then consistently used throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>- line 75: “informed” (not “inform”)</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>- line 94: “4 months of” (add “s” to month)</p>
              <p>- Objectives: line 115: suggest add: “adult rifampin dose” to read “standard adult rifampin dose”, as it is higher in children</p>
              <p>- Funding: line 120: “…by the Canadian…” (can use “a”, but then need to add “grant” as part of the sentence in addition to the part in brackets)</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>- Table 1: In first column, both “bind” words should be “blind”. In addition, I think it would be good to add a footnote to the table explaining that the high-dose rifampin 300 and 450 mg capsules look the same. The reason is that this explanation only comes much later in the protocol, and the reviewer’s first thought was how can this be blinded if there are different strength formulations which in normal practice would not be the same.</p>
              <p>- line 143: Suggest change to: “…, described in more detail below.”</p>
              <p>- line 143: Suggest add in brackets: “…and double blind for dosing of the two high-dose arms (300 mg and 450 mg capsules look the same).” Same reason as above</p>
              <p>- line 153: should be “decisions”</p>
              <p>- line 157: should be: “…first household member’s randomization.” (apostrophe s moved)</p>
              <p>- lines 160-162: Pharmacokinetcs (PK) already abbreviated in line 160 therefore in lines 161 and 162 (and further) “PK” should be used (or alternatively do not abbreviate the word)</p>
              <p>- line 161: “rifampin” used throughout except here?</p>
              <p>- line 163: TBI has not been abbreviated before – write out in full</p>
              <p>- line 164: rifampin (lower case “r”)</p>
              <p>- line 171: suggest change “:” to “,”</p>
              <p>- line 191: The word “suspected” has fallen into disfavor regarding TB. Mostly replaced with “presumed”</p>
              <p>- line 192: The reviewer thinks that using “susceptible” and “susceptibility” is better than using “sensitive” and “sensitivity” (see line 193), because with statistics “sensitivity” is also used</p>
              <p>- Line 204: “at each study site” (not site study)</p>
              <p>- line 218: Change to “team’s”</p>
              <p>- line 224: “…as the proportion…”</p>
              <p>- line 227: “adverse events” have been used many times already, but here suddenly abbreviated without explanation – should be consistent in using abbreviations</p>
              <p>- lines 235, 238, 240, 242: suggest use “TB disease” (or TBD if abbreviated before) instead of “active TB”</p>
              <p>- line 262: Suggest add “for safety” to read: “…be sufficient to establish non-inferiority for safety,…” – same in line 266 at the end of the sentence (for the reader not to get confused)</p>
              <p>- line 263: “real adverse events” (multiple?)</p>
              <p>- Table 3: Explain abbreviations used in the footnote (ICC, HHC)</p>
              <p>- line 282: spaces “(GEE) – to account”</p>
              <p>- line 297: “these types of adverse events” – add “adverse”</p>
              <p>- line 333: lab tests (plural)</p>
              <p>- line 343: “ethics”</p>
              <p>- Lies 358, 359, 360: TB disease rather than active TB; replace “suspected” with “considered” or “presumed”</p>
              <p>- line 378: Write out “GCP”</p>
              <p>- line 390: Change “side effects” to “adverse effects”; Also: “Serious adverse events, such as…”</p>
              <p>- line 406: Should be “DSMB”</p>
              <p>- line 419: If it is at the end of the study, then this should be "developed TB disease"?</p>
              <p>- line 448: “analyses – to” (add spaces)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This is a very nice protocol of a study that is already registered and ongoing. It is well described, and the full protocol etc. look to be attached as supplementary material.</p>
              <p>Comments / questions from me are minor:</p>
              <p>1. Lines 92-97 outline current LTBI treatment regimens which are helpful background. Would it be good to mention the 1RpH regimen (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1806808" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1806808</ext-link>) which was published in NEJM in this list?</p>
              <p>2. One thing I pondered is why you needed to do this 'safety / tolerability' study before progressing to a full Phase III study of this dose of rifampicin for LTBI. The emergent data (now up to 40+mg/kg, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542056/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542056/</ext-link>) consistently suggest that 30mg/kg is well below the limit of tolerability for this drug and I wonder if you might just have proceeded to an efficacy trial, with embedded secondary safety endpoints, in order to find the answer to the main question that you really have more quickly? This, of course, is not a criticism - just a query and something I'd like to have seen more justification of. Will it even be possible to "roll on" into a full Phase III study, with extended follow-up of the patients you already have, if this study is successful?</p>
              <p>3. The superiority design is great, but do you really need to show anything more than non-inferiority here to justify the value of the new regimens? If taking less medicine is as easy and safe (and eventually effective) as more medicine that feels like reason enough not to give extra (unnecessary) pills). From a patient perspective non-inferiority would seem to be enough and I'm not sure if I really agree that "the rationale to</p>
              <p>assess these high dose shorter regimens for efficacy would be weak if completion was not</p>
              <p>improved over 4R". If everyone completed (irrespective of 2 vs 4 months) the 2 month regimen wouldn't be superior but it would still be worth shortening treatment for all because less medicine is enough. The reason this might matter is the possibility that, during a trial adherence and completion of therapy might be 'artificially' improved vs. routine practice (a Hawthorn type effect), and that this 'artificial' improvement might be exaggerated on the more difficult / control arm. Is there a risk that you are disappointed by, and discard, a useful approach to shorter LTBI therapy because you fail to find hard-to-prove superiority of the new regimen under trial conditions?</p>
              <p>4. The partial blind doesn't seem to allow any blinding between the control (10mg/kg) arm and the experimental arms (different number of tablets in the control arm). I can see the practical reasons for that, but wonder if it does slightly confound the main comparison with the control? I guess not, and lots of high-dose rifampicin studies are completely open label for similar reasons but did you consider any possible issues here?</p>
              <p>5. Spelling errors in row 3 and 4 of Table 1 (should be "blind" not "bind").</p>
              <p>These comments are really discussion points prompted by reading the manuscript - I have no doubt that this is a useful study, which the TB community will be interested to read about (and will eagerly await the results of).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Abstract, introduction :The objective of this trial is to test the safety of high dose rifampin monotherapy to shorten the duration of the currently recommended 4 months rifampin. Do you mean for prevention of TB?</p>
              <p>Line 87: typo in reccomeded</p>
              <p>Otherwise, good luck!</p>

              <p>Response to Reviewers’ and Editor’s requests for revisions </p>
              <p>2R2 Protocol manuscript - PONE-D-22-16478</p>
              <p>Part I: Response to Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Yes</p>
              <p>2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Yes</p>
              <p>3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Yes</p>
              <p>4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Yes</p>
              <p>A: We revised the sentence relative to data sharing and added information regarding where the data will be found. This revision is on page 22 of the manuscript with track changes and reads: “Full protocol will be made available at the same time of this manuscript publication, in the McGill International TB center website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.mcgill.ca/tb/projects" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.mcgill.ca/tb/projects</ext-link>); data generated from the study will be made publicly available at the time of publication of study results, in the same website.” We hope this has addressed this issue.</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Yes</p>
              <p>A: We have addressed all specific comments by the Reviewers below. Hopefully we have now addressed this concern.</p>
              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above and, if applicable, provide comments about issues authors must address before this protocol can be accepted for publication. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p>
              <p>You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: A clear and well presented manuscript. Clearly articulates study design and will be an important contribution to the field. No specific additional comments.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Review: High dose rifampin for 2 months vs standard dose rifampin for 4 months, to treat TB infection: protocol of a 3-arm randomized trial (2R2).</p>
              <p>This manuscript is a protocol to evaluate the adherence to, and safety of, a shorter, high-dose rifampin regimen compared to a standard-dose rifampin tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) regimen, with a secondary aim to evaluate efficacy over a 26-month period. The protocol is well written and clear. The reviewer has a few comments. In addition, for publication purposes, the reviewer thinks that consistent terminology is important (see suggestions in comments), that all abbreviations should first be explained (and once abbreviated, used consistently).</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. The authors use “tuberculosis infection (TBI)” and “latent TB” interchangeably, as well as TB disease (TBD) and “active TB”. The reviewer thinks that for this manuscript it would be better to consistently use “TB infection (TBI)” and “TB disease” (with or without abbreviation “TBD”) throughout, as these refer to the same entities. (see e.g., line 188-189; suggest use “TBI or TBD”)</p>
              <p>A: The terminology has been corrected to be TBI and TBD throughout.</p>
              <p>2. Line 187: For the exclusion criteria of liver transaminases raised &gt;3 times normal – is this for any one (ALT or AST) or both together (supposedly the first option). Suggest add: “…liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase)…”</p>
              <p>A: The reviewer is correct – our intention is to exclude if EITHER is abnormal. Now corrected, the exclusion criterion reads: […] liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase) 3 times or more higher than upper limit of normal (ULN); […]</p>
              <p>3. Lines 210-211: The reviewer cannot see a reason for unblinding for safety reasons, as if there is a safety issue the patient is likely to discontinue rifampin and not be continued on another rifampin regimen in the trial? Unblinding always creates a risk for bias.</p>
              <p>A: We agree that safety reasons for unblinding in this trial are very unlikely to present. The study medication in all arms is the same (i.e. rifampin), and even in the event of a suspected Adverse Drug Reaction, knowing the exact dosage is very unlikely to change the medical conduct (i.e. discontinuing the medication). Nevertheless, we were required to have a procedure for unblinding, in case needed, by the regulatory agency and ethics committee reviewers. </p>
              <p>4. Lines 307-308: What is the purpose of analysis of non-inferiority of treatment completion? Superiority is what is aimed for, as without superiority of treatment completion, there is no real purpose for the shorter regimen?</p>
              <p>A: See our response to a related question by Reviewer 3, who seems to have the opposite opinion about superiority vs non-inferiority. We believe that, even if a shorter treatment was not superior but “just” non-inferior to the standard treatment, there could be potential benefit for patients or programs of having fewer doses, and less time to be in follow-up. We also think it likely that TB programs would prefer shorter regimens, that are 'not worse’ then the standard one for completion, to reduce costs of follow-up. This point, since it seems more controversial than we first thought, has been added to the Discussion.</p>
              <p>5. Line 309: “Last, the incidence of active TB (microbiologically confirmed and all forms) in…” Suggest “TB disease”, but does this only refer to microbiologically confirmed TB – children are also included and in them it may be more difficult to microbiologically confirm TB? What does “all forms” refer to – pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB?</p>
              <p>A: All forms – will include extra-pulmonary and clinically diagnosed TB disease. As regards terminology, and as explained above: we have used now TB disease instead of active TB.</p>
              <p>6. Lines 321-322: Are patients not clinically examined to exclude extrapulmonary TB?</p>
              <p>A: Potential participants are evaluated for possible TB disease, including physical examination, by treating physicians. They decide on further investigations to exclude TB disease, based on participant’s medical history, and symptoms. The protocol requires chest-X ray, symptoms questionnaire and medical examination for all. This has been now specified on line 322.</p>
              <p>7. Line 336: “two blood samples collected at 2 and 4 hours after reported drug intake,” Timing of sampling after drug intake is very important to compare concentrations (for PK) - how is the time of taking the medication going to be verified?</p>
              <p>A: In this trial, all doses are self-administered, which we believe is an important feature of the design as it will make the regimen much more feasible for later implementation. At the time of PK sampling, participants are asked at what time they took study medication. This will be only two hours later, so we believe their recall should be accurate, and we cannot see any reason to think there will be bias in reporting, so any minor inaccuracies will represent “random misclassification”. Also, participants are called the day before the PK sampling to be reminded that they need to retain hour at which medication is taken. </p>
              <p>8. Line 337: Suggest define age of children for PK study (10-&lt;18 years?)</p>
              <p>A: this specification has been added, the line now reads: “… in a subsample of 27 adults (≥18 years old) - 9 per arm- and 27 children ( 10 to &lt;18years old) -9 per arm-...”</p>
              <p>9. Lines 351-352: If participants opt out of the study and receive alternative TPT, do they remain in study follow up or are they excluded from further follow-up (as the other TPT regimen could bias outcome)?</p>
              <p>A: All participants, regardless of completion of treatment (or alternate treatment), are in post-treatment follow-up, for up to 26 months from enrollment. Information about alternative TPT treatment and related outcomes (completion, non-completion, adverse events) are collected during post-treatment follow-up visits. Patients who take alternate treatment will be included in the intention to treat (per randomization) analysis but excluded from the efficacy (per protocol) analysis.</p>
              <p>10: Line 393: Drug-drug interactions are a specific problem with rifampin and several antiretroviral medications, but no mention is made in the protocol regarding inclusion or exclusion of people living with HIV. Could the authors clarify?</p>
              <p>A: People with HIV are included, as this group of patients have potential for large benefits of TPT. However, the antiretroviral therapy they are taking at enrollment must be compatible with concomitant use of rifampin, as is the case for other concomitant treatments. The study protocol includes a table with the most common interaction between antiretrovirals and rifampin.</p>
              <p>11: Lines 474-483: The different manufacturers of rifampicin and different formulations used may have an important effect on both safety and PK - how is this going to be evaluated?</p>
              <p>A: This is a valid point, which has been discussed during protocol development and trial implementation. A sample of medications used in all arms at each site will be collected and analysed for content of active ingredient by a centralized lab. This analysis is part of the Statistical Analysis Plan. </p>

              <p>A: Both corrected, thanks </p>
              <p>- line 67: To the reviewer’s knowledge, two connected words followed by a noun should be written with a hyphen: in this case “high-dose arm” and “standard-dose arm” – these terms should then consistently used throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>A: We are not experts in grammar but prefer to keep as separate words.</p>
              <p>- line 75: “informed” (not “inform”)</p>

              <p>A: corrected, thanks </p>
              <p>- Funding: line 120: “…by the Canadian…” (can use “a”, but then need to add “grant” as part of the sentence in addition to the part in brackets)</p>
              <p>A: corrected, thanks </p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>- Table 1: In first column, both “bind” words should be “blind”. In addition, I think it would be good to add a footnote to the table explaining that the high-dose rifampin 300 and 450 mg capsules look the same. The reason is that this explanation only comes much later in the protocol, and the reviewer’s first thought was how can this be blinded if there are different strength formulations which in normal practice would not be the same.</p>
              <p>A: The correction has been done and the following note added to Table 1: “300mg and 450mg rifampin capsules appear identical to maintain blinding.” </p>
              <p>- line 143: Suggest change to: “…, described in more detail below.”</p>
              <p>A: corrected, thanks </p>
              <p>- line 143: Suggest add in brackets: “…and double blind for dosing of the two high-dose arms (300 mg and 450 mg capsules look the same).” Same reason as above</p>
              <p>A: Explanation has been added.</p>
              <p>- line 153: should be “decisions”</p>
              <p>- line 157: should be: “…first household member’s randomization.” (apostrophe s moved)</p>
              <p>A: Both corrected, thanks </p>
              <p>- lines 160-162: Pharmacokinetcs (PK) already abbreviated in line 160 therefore in lines 161 and 162 (and further) “PK” should be used (or alternatively do not abbreviate the word)</p>
              <p>A: Change was made to use PK, thanks </p>
              <p>- line 161: “rifampin” used throughout except here?</p>
              <p>A: rifampicin corrected to be rifampin, for consistency</p>
              <p>- line 163: TBI has not been abbreviated before – write out in full</p>

              <p>- line 191: The word “suspected” has fallen into disfavor regarding TB. Mostly replaced with “presumed”</p>
              <p>A: Change made.</p>
              <p>- line 192: The reviewer thinks that using “susceptible” and “susceptibility” is better than using “sensitive” and “sensitivity” (see line 193), because with statistics “sensitivity” is also used</p>
              <p>A: Change made.</p>
              <p>- Line 204: “at each study site” (not site study)</p>
              <p>- line 218: Change to “team’s”</p>
              <p>- line 224: “…as the proportion…”</p>
              <p>A: The above three have been changed </p>
              <p>- line 227: “adverse events” have been used many times already, but here suddenly abbreviated without explanation – should be consistent in using abbreviations</p>
              <p>A: We have eliminated the AE abbreviation.</p>

              <p>- line 262: Suggest add “for safety” to read: “…be sufficient to establish non-inferiority for safety,…” – same in line 266 at the end of the sentence (for the reader not to get confused)</p>
              <p>A: “For safety” was added in both sentences. </p>
              <p>- line 263: “real adverse events” (multiple?)</p>
              <p>A: The word “real” has been removed to increase clarity. The sentence now reads: “If the adverse event in the higher dose arms is of 2% greater occurrence than standard arm (i.e. is 3% in high dose vs 1% in standard or 4% vs 2%) or if the rate in standard arm is 4%, then we would not have the number needed to conclude non-inferiority for safety.”</p>
              <p>- Table 3: Explain abbreviations used in the footnote (ICC, HHC)</p>

              <p>Reviewer #3: This is a very nice protocol of a study that is already registered and ongoing. It is well described, and the full protocol etc. look to be attached as supplementary material.</p>
              <p>Comments / questions from me are minor:</p>
              <p>1. Lines 92-97 outline current LTBI treatment regimens which are helpful background. Would it be good to mention the 1RpH regimen (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1806808" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1806808</ext-link>) which was published in NEJM in this list?</p>
              <p>A: At time of protocol development 1HP was not yet among recommended treatments, so it is not in the trial protocol. Up to now it this regimen has only been tested in HIV coinfected population, we opted to not include this in the paper. </p>
              <p>2. One thing I pondered is why you needed to do this 'safety / tolerability' study before progressing to a full Phase III study of this dose of rifampicin for LTBI. The emergent data (now up to 40+mg/kg, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542056/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542056/</ext-link>) consistently suggest that 30mg/kg is well below the limit of tolerability for this drug and I wonder if you might just have proceeded to an efficacy trial, with embedded secondary safety endpoints, in order to find the answer to the main question that you really have more quickly? This, of course, is not a criticism - just a query and something I'd like to have seen more justification of. Will it even be possible to "roll on" into a full Phase III study, with extended follow-up of the patients you already have, if this study is successful?</p>
              <p>A: We agree with reviewer there is data regarding tolerability of higher doses of rifampin, but in patients with TB disease. We think it is important to establish safety and tolerability of high doses in the population with TB infection. Tolerance for safety is different for preventive treatment, such as TPT, than for treatment of a life-threatening disease, such as TBD. Also, tolerability for adverse events (even minor), in the TBI population, with no symptoms and an otherwise healthy life, may differ from what has been reported in patients with TBD. Finally high doses of rifampin, in previous TBD studies has not been used as monotherapy, but in combination with other anti-TB medications, and this may have a role both on safety and tolerability. For these reasons we think a safety trial is necessary before a phase 3 trial. At the same time, since we plan to conduct a phase 3 trial, if this phase 2B trial is successful, we have followed participants for two years after end of TPT, for the secondary objective of efficacy. This will allow data from participants of this trial to be included in the future phase 3 trial, reducing the time and sample size needed to test efficacy. </p>
              <p>3. The superiority design is great, but do you really need to show anything more than non-inferiority here to justify the value of the new regimens? If taking less medicine is as easy and safe (and eventually effective) as more medicine that feels like reason enough not to give extra (unnecessary) pills). From a patient perspective non-inferiority would seem to be enough and I'm not sure if I really agree that "the rationale to assess these high dose shorter regimens for efficacy would be weak if completion was not improved over 4R". If everyone completed (irrespective of 2 vs 4 months) the 2 month regimen wouldn't be superior but it would still be worth shortening treatment for all because less medicine is enough. The reason this might matter is the possibility that, during a trial adherence and completion of therapy might be 'artificially' improved vs. routine practice (a Hawthorn type effect), and that this 'artificial' improvement might be exaggerated on the more difficult / control arm. Is there a risk that you are disappointed by, and discard, a useful approach to shorter LTBI therapy because you fail to find hard-to-prove superiority of the new regimen under trial conditions?</p>
              <p>A: See our response to Reviewer 1, who appears to have the opposite opinion. We have a secondary analysis which will look at non-inferiority of completion, and the overall results of primary and secondary analyses will be considered when discussion on a phase 3 trial will be held.</p>
              <p>4. The partial blind doesn't seem to allow any blinding between the control (10mg/kg) arm and the experimental arms (different number of tablets in the control arm). I can see the practical reasons for that, but wonder if it does slightly confound the main comparison with the control? I guess not, and lots of high-dose rifampicin studies are completely open label for similar reasons but did you consider any possible issues here?</p>
              <p>A: We agree that comparison with the standard arm could be biased given the open label design. This is why safety will be evaluated by an independent adverse event panel, which adjudicates the type, grade and relationship to study drug, while blinded to dose and also to duration. The final analysis will be conducted by a biostatistician who is blinded to all arms as well. </p>
              <p>5. Spelling errors in row 3 and 4 of Table 1 (should be "blind" not "bind").</p>
              <p>A: Corrected</p>
              <p>These comments are really discussion points prompted by reading the manuscript - I have no doubt that this is a useful study, which the TB community will be interested to read about (and will eagerly await the results of).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Abstract, introduction :The objective of this trial is to test the safety of high dose rifampin monotherapy to shorten the duration of the currently recommended 4 months rifampin. Do you mean for prevention of TB?</p>
              <p>A: We have modified the sentence to add clarity: “The objective of this trial is to test the safety of high dose rifampin monotherapy to shorten the duration of the currently recommended TPT of 4 months rifampin.” </p>
              <p>Line 87: typo in reccomeded</p>
              <p>A: Thanks for spotting this, it has been corrected. </p>
              <p>Otherwise, good luck!</p>
