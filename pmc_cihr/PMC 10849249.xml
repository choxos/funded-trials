                  <p>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a 3D deformity of the spine that affects 3% of the adolescent population. Conservative treatments like bracing aim to halt the progression of the curve to the surgical threshold. Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) methods for brace design and manufacturing are becoming increasingly used. Linked to CAD/CAM and 3D radiographic reconstruction techniques, we developed a finite element model (FEM) enabling to simulate the brace effectiveness before its fabrication, as well as a semi-automatic design processes. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to compare and validate such FEM semi-automatic algorithm used to design nighttime Providence-type braces.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Fifty-eight patients with AIS aged between 10 to 16-years and skeletally immature will be recruited. At the delivery stage, all patients will receive both a Providence-type brace optimized by the semi-automatic algorithm leveraging a patient-specific FEM (Test) and a conventional Providence-type brace (Control), both designed using CAD/CAM methods. Biplanar radiographs will be taken for each patient with both braces in a randomized crossover approach to evaluate immediate correction. Patients will then be randomized to keep either the Test or Control brace as prescribed with a renewal if necessary, and will be followed over two years. The primary outcome will be the change in Cobb angle of the main curve after two years. Secondary outcomes will be brace failure rate, quality of life (QoL) and immediate in-brace correction. This is a single-centre study, double-blinded (participant and outcome assessor) randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adolescent Idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a 3D deformity of the spine affecting the alignment of the spine in the coronal, sagittal and transverse planes. Treatments for AIS are usually separated into three main categories: observation, bracing and surgery [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bracing is the most common conservative treatment and is recommended for curves between 25 and 40 degrees in the coronal plane [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The aim of bracing is to halt or retard the progression of scoliosis before it progresses to a surgical level (over 45°) [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], by applying external forces to the patient’s trunk that will be transmitted to the spine [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Multiple types of braces exist with two of the main types being rigid full-time thoracolumbosacral orthoses (TLSO) and nighttime orthoses. TLSO have been extensively studied and a randomised controlled trial by <italic toggle="yes">Weinstein et al</italic>. demonstrated their effectiveness and showed it was proportional to the compliance of the patient [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To be effective, a brace should ideally be prescribed to be worn more than 18 hours a day [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies have shown that TLSO are associated with a lower quality of life (QoL) due to the psychological burden of the brace during the treatment [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent studies also highlighted the low brace-wear compliance of patients [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alternatives for full-time TLSOs are the less cumbersome nighttime braces, meant to be worn 8 hours/day at night [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They feature an overcorrection mechanism to compensate for the lower wear time [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Nighttime braces have been shown to prevent curve progression in patients with a main Cobb angle between 15 and 25 degrees [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, they haven’t been studied in randomized controlled trials for Cobb angles ranging from 20 to 40 degrees. A recent meta-analysis of case series showed that nighttime braces could be equivalent to TLSO braces [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Today braces are mostly designed using topographic scans of the torso and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This method can be combined with a patient-specific finite element model (FEM) to simulate different brace designs in a computer environment before manufacturing. This approach was validated by our group in a 2-year RCT of 120 patients with effective results, as the FEM-improved braces provided satisfactory correction while being thinner and using less surface covering area [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, this study was limited by the bias of the orthotists who were influenced over the course of the study by the results of the FEM approach, which reduced the difference in performance between the two cohorts, to the benefit of the treated patients. To reduce this bias and take full advantage of the combined FEM and CAD/CAM approach, we have recently developed an optimization algorithm to design orthotics semi-automatically.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The objective of this trial is to validate a Providence-type brace designed using a patient-specific FEM coupled with a semi-automatic optimization algorithm, and compare its effectiveness to the standard way to design a nighttime Providence-type brace. This will be done by testing the non-inferiority of the immediate and 2-year change in Cobb angle, as well as quality of life as measured by the SRS-22r and the treatment failure rate.</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>Patients will be randomized twice: Patients will first be randomized to determine the sequence of the brace they will try. Allocation for the first randomization will be 1:1 for either the sequence Test:Control or the sequence Control:Test. The second randomization will be to determine the brace that will be assigned to pursue the long-term treatment. The allocation will be 1:1 for either the Test brace or the Control brace. The randomization will be done by blocks of 2, 4 or 6. The individual randomization sequence will be concealed in separate sealed envelopes independently from the research team. The treatment assignement will be done at the brace delivery (visit 2) by the research team.</p>
                <p>For ethical reasons, if one of the braces during the crossover phase has an in-brace correction of the primary curve of more than 5 degrees compared to the other brace, the participant will be switched to the brace with the better in-brace correction.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Two brace designs will be created in this trial: a control Providence brace (Control) and an optimized FEM Providence-type brace (Test).</p>
                <sec id="sec015">
                  <title>Providence brace–control</title>
                  <p>The control Providence type brace will be designed by an orthotist with more than 20 years of experience. The orthotist will scan the patient torso in the supine position using the MSoft software (TechMed3D, Lévis, Canada). The scan will be uploaded in a CAD software (Rodin4D, Merignac, France). The orthotist will then design the Providence type brace by sculpting the shape of the brace and by adding areas of pressure and reliefs in the software. The final model will be exported to a numerical milling machine (Model C, Rodin4D) that will carve a polyurethane foam block to use for thermoforming. Upon delivery, the orthotist will make the final adjustments on the brace to ensure a comfortable fit.</p>

                  <title>Optimized FEM providence brace–test</title>
                  <p>The test Providence brace will be designed by the researchers and the orthopedist. As described by Cobetto <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the patient’s biplane radiographs will be used to build a 3D reconstruction of the spine from C7 to the coccyx, as well as the pelvis and the rib cage. A scan of the patient torso will be taken in the standing position using MSoft software (TechMed3D, Lévis, Canada). The 3D reconstruction and the scan will then be superimposed and imported into ANSYS 20.1 software (ANSYS, Canonsburg, USA) to create a patient-specific FEM. The intervertebral discs and osseous structures such as thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, ribs, sternum, and pelvis will be represented by 3D elastic beam elements. Ligaments, soft tissues, and joints will be modelled by tension-only springs. External soft tissues and their interaction with the brace will be represented by shells and surface-to-surface contact elements respectively. Mechanical properties of all anatomical structures are taken from cadaveric studies, and an estimate of patient flexibility will be factored in. A previously described optimization process computes the gravitational and stabilizing muscular forces to obtain a loaded geometry corresponding to the standing radiographs [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
                  <p>An initial brace design model is automatically generated from the patient’s skin geometry and is used as input of a surrogate optimization algorithm. During optimization, a new brace topology is generated at every iteration and imported into the patient-specific FEM. A supine position on a mattress is simulated [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with brace donning and tightening. Based on these results, patient growth is then simulated for a period of two years, with the vertebral growth rate modulated in response to the simulated stresses acting on the vertebral growth plates [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. 3D correction metrics (Cobb angle MT &amp; TL/L, TK/LL, mean axial rotation) are extracted from the corrected spine resulting from the two simulations (immediate in-brace supine and 2-year out-of-brace post-growth) and combined as a weighted sum to create the optimization’s objective function. The optimization process runs for hundreds of iterations to converge towards the optimal brace topology maximizing immediate and 2-year correction. The patient’s simulated corrected spine will be compared to the clinical radiographs to further validate the model for this context of use specifically.</p>
                  <p>The final design will be revised by an orthopedist. Both braces will be manufactured by the same method. Each brace (Control or Test) will be equipped with a thermal compliance monitoring device (iButton, Maxim Integrated Products Inc, Sunnyvale, CA). In each instance, the patient will be instructed to wear the brace at night when sleeping and compliance will be followed-up every 6 months.</p>

                  <p>Low-dose biplanar (coronal and sagittal) radiographs (EOS system, EOS imaging, Paris) will be acquired out-of-brace at the first visit, as well as at the follow-up visits every six months prior to seeing the orthopedic surgeon. At the initial and follow-up visits, the orthopedic surgeon will do a physical examination of the back and assess their general condition. An anterior-posterior (AP) x-ray will also be taken each time a new brace is delivered, to verify the fit. At each visit including the first one, the patient will be asked to fill the SRS-22r questionnaire. Other conservative treatments are not prohibited for this trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This article presented the need, as well as the design, of a prospective randomized controlled trial. This methodology will allow us to validate the use of an optimization algorithm that iterates based on a previously validated FEM [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0292069.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This algorithm has the potential of improving clinical outcomes, as well as reducing the time it takes for the orthotist to design nighttime braces.</p>
              <p>The outcomes evaluated will be clinically relevant, they include the immediate in-brace Cobb angle correction as well as the long-term out-of-brace Cobb. It will also include QoL questionnaires that will assess both the physical and mental health of the participants.</p>
              <p>The patients will be recruited based on the standardized SRS bracing criteria with primary curve angle modified to account for angle measurement variability [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This study also presents a new methodology for RCTs on braces, by comparing the immediate correction of multiple braces on the same patients, as well as the long-term correction. This is the first methodology, to our knowledge, that allows the direct comparison of two brace models using the immediate in-brace correction as a surrogate for the primary outcome of this study [<xref rid="pone.0292069.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while also having a two-year follow-up. Patients will be treated by an integrated team comprising of orthopedic surgeons, orthotists, nurses, and physiotherapists.</p>

              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: In this study protocol, a two-arm non-inferiority randomized control trial is being proposed to compare and validate a FEM semi-automatic algorithm used in designing back braces. The target accrual is 58. All patients will receive both the experimental and control braces and undergo immediate radiographic evaluations. Patients will then be randomized to keep either the experimental or control brace. The primary outcome is the change in Cobb angle of the main curve at two years. Secondary outcomes will be brace failure, quality of life, and immediate in-brace correction.</p>
              <p>Minor revisions:</p>
              <p>1- Line 224: Identify the software that will be used to capture the data.</p>
              <p>2- Provide a statistical analysis plan for the quality of life and immediate brace correction outcomes.</p>
              <p>3- Line 250 states that the failure rate will be illustrated on a Kaplan-Meier curve. Indicate if the two groups will be compared using inferential statistics. If so, state the testing method that will be used to make this comparison. Will point estimates and 95% confidence intervals be provided?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you very much for the opportunity to review the submitted article "Optimized braces for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a study protocol of a prospective randomised controlled trial".</p>
              <p>The planned study is evaluating a clinically and scientifically important topic prospectively.</p>
              <p>One concern is related to the low compliance reported for braces for the treatment of scoliosis and possible drop-out. How do the authors plan to avoid this problem or plan to deal with it if it occurs (e.g longer recruitment interval, multi-centric approach)?</p>
              <p>First, as the study focuses on pediatric/adolescent patients, informed consent must be obtained from participants AND legal representatives. The authors planned to obtain informed consent from patients "and/or parents". Please modify.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the authors submitted informations that a conflict of interest is present in some individuals involved in the study. The authors should provide more detailed data on the process of blinding and to assure that individuals with a conflict of interest are not involved in the measurement of clinical outcomes. Please comment.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Dear author,</p>
              <p>first of all, I congratulate you on the work you have done. This is a very interesting study regarding improving of braces in the treatment of adolescent idiopatic scoliosis.</p>
              <p>I think the quality of your paper could be improved in accordance with the following suggestions:</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>- Line 75: "To be effective, a brace should ideally be worn 20 to 23 hours a day."</p>
              <p>Could you please cite a reference/study that support it?</p>
              <p>- Line 76: "Studies have shown that TLSO are associated with a lower quality of life during the treatment"</p>
              <p>Could you please explain it? You might find some supporting literature here:</p>
              <p>PMID 33098493</p>
              <p>Inclusion criteria:</p>
              <p>- why do you exclude premenarchal or no more than 18-year postmenarchal for female patients? There is a particular reason?</p>
              <p>- Could BMI - or to be more exact heigt and weight - be or not be inclusion criteria of the study? The same question could also regard the familiarity for AIS.</p>

              <p>Responses to Comments to Authors</p>
              <p>Point #4: Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>In the revised version, we have specified that the anonymize data points will be made available in a public repository for academic purposes. [Line 44]</p>
              <p>Responses to Reviewers’ Comments</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 (minor revision):</p>
              <p>1- Line 224: Identify the software that will be used to capture the data.</p>
              <p>The software used to capture the data was added in the revised manuscript. [Line 259]: “All data, including the patient history, type of brace, radiographs, 3D files and questionnaires will be stored in a Microsoft Access relational database (Microsoft, Redmond, USA).”</p>
              <p>2- Provide a statistical analysis plan for the quality of life and immediate brace correction outcomes</p>
              <p>Details about the statistical analysis plan for the quality of life (SRS-22r scores) and the immediate in-brace correction outcomes were added the Statistical analysis section. [Line 288]: “ For both analysis, the continuous data will be compared between the test and control group with a non-inferior one-sided two-sample t-test, this includes the out-of-brace Cobb angle, the immediate in-brace Cobb angle and the SRS-22r scores. A survival analysis using the log-rank test will be done to analyze the failure rate will be presented on a Kaplan-Meier curve. In case of missing data, a worst-case single imputation will be used. Point estimates and 95% confidence interval will be provided for each result. The statistical analysis will be performed using the R programming language.”</p>
              <p>3- Line 250 states that the failure rate will be illustrated on a Kaplan-Meier curve. Indicate if the two groups will be compared using inferential statistics. If so, state the testing method that will be used to make this comparison. Will point estimates and 95% confidence intervals be provided?</p>
              <p>The statistical plan for the survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curve) was added. [Line 290] We also confirmed that point estimates and confidence intervals will be provided. [Line 292]</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
              <p>1- One concern is related to the low compliance reported for braces for the treatment of scoliosis and possible drop-out. How do the authors plan to avoid this problem or plan to deal with it if it occurs (e.g longer recruitment interval, multi-centric approach)?</p>
              <p>The dropout rate at our center is low and measures are in place to reduce this occurrence, such as automatic scheduling of follow-up visits and reminders. As for the low compliance, this will be considered part of the treatment, and evaluated in the per protocol analysis with the compliance monitor data. Sentences were added in the Revised manuscript [Lines 280-281] to detail how we plan to deal with this issue.</p>
              <p>2- First, as the study focuses on pediatric/adolescent patients, informed consent must be obtained from participants AND legal representatives. The authors planned to obtain informed consent from patients "and/or parents". Please modify.</p>
              <p>As suggested, the following sentence was added in the Revised manuscript: “The researchers, who have been trained in how to obtain free and informed consent, will obtain this consent from patients and parents/legal representatives.” [Line 140]</p>
              <p>3- Furthermore, the authors submitted informations that a conflict of interest is present in some individuals involved in the study. The authors should provide more detailed data on the process of blinding and to assure that individuals with a conflict of interest are not involved in the measurement of clinical outcomes. Please comment.</p>
              <p>In the Revised manuscript, the following details were added about the blinding process. We also clarified that the outcome assessors will be independent from the research team: “The physician and patient will not be able to identify the braces and thus the group assignation. The outcome assessors will be independent from the research team.” [Line 173]</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
              <p>Dear author, first of all, I congratulate you on the work you have done. This is a very interesting study regarding improving of braces in the treatment of adolescent idiopatic scoliosis. I think the quality of your paper could be improved in accordance with the following suggestions…</p>
              <p>We thank this reviewer for the positive appreciation of our study. </p>
              <p>1- Introduction: - Line 75: "To be effective, a brace should ideally be worn 20 to 23 hours a day." Could you please cite a reference/study that support it?</p>
              <p>As suggested, a reference was added in the Revised introduction section, the following sentence was modified to: “To be effective, a brace should ideally be prescribed to be worn more than 18 hours a day, based on the BrAIST Trial recommendations (Weinstein SL, Dolan LA, Wright JG, Dobbs MB. Design of the Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BrAIST): Spine. 2013 Oct;38(21):1832–41.)”. [Line 84]</p>
              <p>2- Introduction - Line 76: "Studies have shown that TLSO are associated with a lower quality of life during the treatment". Could you please explain it? You might find some supporting literature here: PMID 33098493</p>
              <p>In the Revised manuscript, we modified the following sentence and a reference to explain that the lower quality of life was due to the psychological burden of the brace treatment: “Studies have shown that TLSO are associated with a lower quality of life (QoL) due to the psychological burden of the brace during the treatment (Cheung PWH, Wong CKH, Cheung JPY. An Insight Into the Health-Related Quality of Life of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Patients Who Are Braced, Observed, and Previously Braced. Spine. 2019 May 15;44(10):E596–605.; </p>
              <p>Wang H, Tetteroo D, Arts JJC, Markopoulos P, Ito K. Quality of life of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients under brace treatment: a brief communication of literature review. Qual Life Res Int J Qual Life Asp Treat Care Rehabil. 2021 Mar;30(3):703–11.)”. [Line 85]</p>
              <p>3- Inclusion criteria:</p>
              <p>- why do you exclude premenarchal or no more than 18-year postmenarchal for female patients? There is a particular reason?</p>
              <p>Based on Little et al 2000 (Little DG, Song KM, Katz D, et al. Relationship of peak height velocity to other maturity indicators in idiopathic scoliosis in girls. J Bone Joint Surg Am 2000;82-A:685–93.), the exclusion criteria of more than 18-month postmenarchal was chosen as an indication that skeletal maturity was reached and that the brace treatment would not be appropriate in that group of patients. Premenarchal patient and patient who had their menarche less than 18-month prior are included in the study. In the revised manuscript, the reference to include this relevant point raised by this reviewer [Line 150] </p>
              <p>- Could BMI - or to be more exact heigt and weight - be or not be inclusion criteria of the study? The same question could also regard the familiarity for AIS.</p>
              <p>BMI, weight and height were not chosen as inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to maximize the external validity of the study. In the publication resulting from the study, we will present the available data on BMI. We also didn’t use a family history of AIS as inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to maximize the external validity of the study.</p>
