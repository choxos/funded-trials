                  <p>In this single‐center, parallel‐design randomized controlled trial conducted at a Canadian tertiary/quaternary care center, early‐stage thyroid cancer patients from a P‐DA trial were contacted 15 to 23 months after randomization/radioactive iodine (RAI) decision making to evaluate longer term outcomes. It was previously reported that the use of the computerized P‐DA in thyroid cancer patients considering postsurgical RAI treatment significantly improved medical knowledge in comparison with usual care alone. The P‐DA and control groups were compared for the following outcomes: feeling informed about the RAI treatment choice, decision satisfaction, decision regret, cancer‐related worry, and physician trust. In a subgroup of 20 participants, in‐depth interviews were conducted for a qualitative analysis.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>According to the most recent statistics, the number of individuals diagnosed annually with thyroid cancer is approximately 289,000 worldwide,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> including 63,000 Americans,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> 6000 Canadians,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and 53,000 Europeans.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Furthermore, the incidence of thyroid cancer is rising faster than that of any other malignancy in the United States and Canada.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Approximately two‐thirds of thyroid cancers are diagnosed at an early stage,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> and the 5‐year survival rate for early‐stage disease approaches 100%.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Because of the excellent prognosis of early‐stage differentiated thyroid cancer, it is important for patients and their health care providers to carefully weigh the potential long‐term benefits and risks of associated treatments. However, there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to guide evidence‐based radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment decision making.</p>
              <p>We recently developed and tested a patient‐directed computerized decision aid for thyroid cancer (patient decision aid [P‐DA]), to be used as an adjunct to physician counseling, in explaining the risks, benefits, evidence uncertainties, and implications of the decision to accept or reject postsurgical RAI treatment (also known as RAI remnant ablation) for early‐stage papillary thyroid cancer.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> RAI remnant ablation after total thyroidectomy may facilitate thyroid cancer disease surveillance, but its long‐term cancer outcome benefits are unclear because of a lack of long‐term RCTs and conflicting observational evidence. An important component of our P‐DA is that it provides an explicit explanation of evidence uncertainty related to the potential therapeutic benefit of RAI for long‐term cancer outcomes (ie, thyroid cancer–related mortality and recurrence).<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> In an RCT of patients with early‐stage thyroid cancer, compared with usual care, our P‐DA significantly increased patients’ medical knowledge and reduced decisional conflict at the time of RAI treatment decision making.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> However, the longer term effects of this and other decision P‐DAs are not well understood because P‐DA trials typically do not follow patients far beyond the period of decision making.</p>
              <p>In this follow‐up study, our aim was to explore the impact of our thyroid cancer P‐DA on patients’ decision and psychosocial outcomes at longer term follow‐up (ie, after the completion of decision making) with complementary quantitative and qualitative approaches.</p>

                <p>As previously reported, we conducted a parallel‐design, single‐center RCT of consenting adult patients with early‐stage papillary thyroid cancer, who were randomly assigned to either a 1‐time viewing of a computerized P‐DA (with usual care) or no P‐DA exposure (usual care alone).<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01083550). The trial was conducted at the University Health Network, a tertiary/quaternary care center for thyroid cancer, and it was approved by the research ethics board of the University Health Network. Informed consent was obtained for participation.

                <p>Potentially eligible patient participants in the extended follow‐up study included those who had participated in the original RCT.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Specifically, they were adults who were 18 years old or older, had undergone total thyroidectomy (completed in 1 or 2 stages) on or after September 1, 2009, and had been diagnosed with early‐stage (low‐risk) papillary thyroid cancer according to a review of their original surgical pathology report (a primary tumor measuring 1 to 4 cm, no known positive lymph nodes or distant metastases, no extrathyroidal tumor extension, no vascular or lymphatic invasion, and no tall cell variant; ie, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 1 or 2 in the absence of distant metastases<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> and American Thyroid Association “low risk of recurrence” classification<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>). Participants had not received RAI treatment before randomization, and all were taking thyroid hormone. Participants were fluent in spoken and written English and were able to use a computer. The original trial recruitment was between March 2010 and June 2011.<sup>9</sup> Contact for the extended follow‐up study was initiated by telephone approximately 15 to 23 months after randomization. This time point was selected to allow sufficient time to establish initial thyroid cancer outcomes and for acute side effects of RAI treatment side (if received) to resolve and yet be sufficiently close to the time of decision making to allow meaningful feedback and recollection about the experience. We excluded individuals diagnosed with thyroid cancer other than papillary thyroid cancer and those for whom a pathologic diagnosis could not be confirmed.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>

                <p>The qualitative study comprised individual in‐person, in‐depth interviews exploring patients’ experiences with RAI treatment decision making and the overall thyroid cancer treatment. We performed stratified purposive sampling of participants for participation in the qualitative study<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> to ensure sufficient representation of relevant demographic and clinical characteristics, including study group allocation. Criteria used in the purposive sampling included sex, group allocation (P‐DA or control), and RAI treatment status (receiving RAI or not) with the intention of achieving a subgroup with proportions representative of the original randomized trial sample. A researcher experienced in qualitative methods conducted the interviews, which were audio‐recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview questions were designed to uncover patients’ perceptions in the following overarching areas: the process of RAI treatment decision making and the overall treatment experience.</p>

An α value of .05 was used as the cutoff for statistical significance for all statistical analyses. Quantitative statistical analyses were performed with PASW Statistics 18.0 (IBM, Chicago, Ill). As previously reported, this study was designed to be powered for the comparison of the short‐term outcome of medical knowledge at the time of medical decision making,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> so all outcomes evaluated in the extended follow‐up study should be considered secondary and hypothesis‐generating.

Furthermore, 98.6% (69 of 70) of the participants in the extended follow‐up study provided permission for medical record review to confirm their thyroid cancer status and treatments. Fifty‐eight of these 70 participants were women (82.9%), 34 were in the P‐DA group (48.6%), and 17 had received RAI treatment (24.3%; 10 in the P‐DA group and 8 in the control group). The mean age was 47.1 years (SD, 12.3 years). The mean timing of participation in the extended follow‐up was 17.1 months after randomization (SD, 2.2 months) and 19.9 months (SD, 3.0 months) after first thyroid cancer surgery.

The subgroup of participants in the qualitative study included 20 individuals: 50% (10 of 20) had been exposed to the P‐DA, 85.0% (17 of 20) were female, the mean age was 48.4 years (SD, 13.5 years), and they were interviewed a mean of 17.8 months after randomization (SD, 2.7 months) and a mean of 20.7 months after their first thyroid cancer surgery (SD, 3.8 months). Approximately half of the patients in the respective P‐DA and control groups had been treated with RAI (ie, 5 of 10 participants in the P‐DA group and 4 of 10 in the control group).</p>

                <p>The first theme was the complexity of RAI treatment decision making from a patient perspective, and this included consideration of information from a variety of sources (eg, physicians, personal research on the Internet, other thyroid cancer survivors, and family/friends). Counseling by physicians was consistently reported as the most important information source affecting the ultimate treatment choice in both the P‐DA and control groups, and this mirrored findings at earlier time point evaluations.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> The degree to which individual participants in each of the groups was involved in RAI treatment decision making was variable. Individuals in the P‐DA group reported that the P‐DA was helpful in providing them with objective information and making them feel more comfortable with the decision‐making process, with some individuals feeling empowered. The concept of evidence uncertainty, explained in the P‐DA, was considered an important revelation in acquiring knowledge relevant to the treatment choice. In contrast, control group participants expressed negative feelings about not having the opportunity to use the P‐DA (eg, disappointment, frustration, and jealousy), and they indicated that they felt they may have missed out on helpful information.</p>
                <p>Another theme that emerged from the qualitative analysis of both study groups was the general benefits of study participation. Participants in both the P‐DA and control groups indicated that participating in this study strengthened their realization that there was a treatment choice and encouraged their engagement in learning about their cancer and its medical management. Furthermore, patients in both groups indicated that they felt some comfort in knowing that they were part of a greater community of individuals afflicted by the same condition, and they hoped that their participation would help future patients.</p>
                <p>Information and psychosocial support needs were raised as issues by participants in both groups, but unmet RAI treatment information needs were reported only by controls. Unmet knowledge translation needs relating to long‐term survivorship care, including thyroid hormone treatment, were reported, regardless of P‐DA use. The importance of psychosocial support by human contact with survivors was reported by both groups.</p>
                <p>Overall thyroid cancer treatment satisfaction in both groups was related to positive outcomes (eg, a lack of treatment side effects and no evidence of disease recurrence) or outcomes meeting expectations and the availability of health care providers for ongoing care and support. However, some lingering worries about future disease recurrence or development of another cancer were reported by participants in both groups.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We found in this single‐site RCT that a computerized P‐DA, used as an adjunct to usual care, was associated with greater patient medical knowledge around the time of RAI treatment decision making<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> and at extended follow‐up approximately 17 months later in comparison with usual care. Importantly, although our P‐DA explicitly explained the uncertainties in medical evidence related to postsurgical RAI treatment decision making (including a lack of RCTs and conflicting observational data), P‐DA participants’ decisional conflict was reduced at the time of decision making.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Furthermore, longer term decision satisfaction, decision regret, mood, trust in physicians, and cancer‐related worry did not appear to be negatively affected by the disclosure of evidence uncertainty to patients.</p>
              <p>Our qualitative study results highlighted how positive clinical outcomes and comfort during ongoing medical follow‐up were important components of patients’ overall satisfaction with their cancer care experience. With respect to decision making, we learned in the qualitative component of the study that the P‐DA was perceived as an objective source of medical information and empowered some patients in the decision‐making process (in part, this depended on the degree to which they desired to participate in that process). However, patients reported that physicians’ counseling/recommendations were the dominant factor influencing the ultimate treatment decision. Patients’ preferences for their degree of involvement in medical decision making was variable in both groups. These findings may explain some conflicting results of trials, as reported in recent systematic reviews specifically examining the impact of P‐DAs on patient involvement in decision making.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>
</p>
              <p>In a recent systematic review of decision aids for cancer screening and treatment, Trikalinos et al<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> reported that patients’ satisfaction with the decision‐making process was significantly increased among P‐DA users versus controls in approximately half of the trials examining this outcome (2 of 4); furthermore, in 8 cancer decision‐aid trials examining the outcome of decision regret, among P‐DA users, decision regret was lower in 4 trials and higher in 3 trials in comparison with individuals not using the P‐DAs. Trikalinos et al also reported that no large differences in emotional distress or worry were evident between cancer P‐DA users and those not exposed to P‐DAs in 7 trials. These findings as well as our results suggest inconsistency in the impact of oncology P‐DAs on patients’ decision satisfaction and decision regret and the lack of a significant impact on cancer‐related emotional distress (including cancer‐related worry and physician trust). The complexity of the overall cancer care experience, disease and treatment‐related outcomes, individual patient characteristics, and the life situation of the individual may be important contributing factors and should be explored in future cancer decision‐making research.</p>
              <p>Increased confidence in decision making and decision self‐efficacy has been reported as a positive effect of P‐DAs in some RCTs.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> However, in a recent RCT of a diabetes management P‐DA, patient empowerment was not significantly increased when it was measured on a disease‐specific quantitative self‐efficacy questionnaire.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> In the field of oncology P‐DAs, Alden<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> recently described a complex theoretical model of cancer patient empowerment in treatment decision making. This model includes specific antecedents of an individual's desire for medical information and overall life satisfaction with effects mediated by 1) the patient's confidence in cancer‐related comprehension and participation in decision making and 2) the patient's attitude to the malignancy.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> Furthermore, Alden reported that utilization of a cancer treatment P‐DA appeared to increase patient empowerment by directly interacting with a patient's desire for medical information and indirectly interacting with the individual's attitude to cancer. Yet, Joseph‐Williams et al<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> suggested that a power imbalance between health care providers and patients may be an important barrier to patient involvement in medical decision making, and they suggested that attitudinal changes are needed in the health care provider community to enable patients to be more involved in their medical decisions. The complex relation between P‐DA utilization, patient–health care provider interactions, and patient empowerment deserves further in‐depth study in other longer term follow‐up P‐DA trials.</p>
              <p>Another important finding of our study was that thyroid cancer patients in the control group expressed some disappointment in not being able to view the P‐DA, and this has some relevance to the disclosure of risks to participants in future decision‐aid trials. Control group participants also reported limitations in applying existing information from the Internet to their situation, in understanding available medical literature, and in obtaining information on potential RAI side effects and treatment expectations. These findings echo the results of prior studies and indicate that thyroid cancer patients do not feel fully informed about important aspects of treatment decision making, including the disease prognosis,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> possible treatment side effects,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, <xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> and evidence uncertainty associated with RAI use.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> In fact, the awareness of such knowledge gaps was part of the rationale for the development of our P‐DA.<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>
</p>
              <p>The strengths of this RCT follow‐up study include the measurement of longer term follow‐up P‐DA RCT data (well beyond the period of treatment decision making), a relatively high rate of patient participation (95% or 70 of 74), the use of complementary quantitative and qualitative methodology in evaluating patient outcomes, the strict avoidance of external contamination of the control group (P‐DA access was not available outside the study), and the completeness of the data collection. Furthermore, the results of the quantitative questionnaire analyses were enhanced by the qualitative analyses. Some of our study limitations include a relatively small sample size, a limited population scope (ie, English‐speaking, computer‐literate, Canadian thyroid cancer survivors), a lack of quantitative measurements of self‐efficacy or empowerment, and the secondary nature of follow‐up outcome analyses (ie, hypothesis‐generating). Furthermore, the clinical importance of the statistically significant quantitative difference in the perception of feeling informed between the study arms is not known. Our findings need to be confirmed and built upon in other long‐term follow‐up P‐DA RCTs.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, not only does a computerized thyroid cancer P‐DA improve medical knowledge significantly at the time of thyroid cancer treatment decision making,<xref rid="cncr29548-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> but at longer term follow‐up, individuals exposed to the P‐DA perceive themselves to be better informed about the decision in comparison with usual‐care controls. The value placed by patients on physician counseling in the cancer treatment decision‐making process was a central theme observed regardless of whether individuals were exposed to the P‐DA or not. A significant finding of our study is that for malignancies associated with treatment evidence uncertainty, disclosing this uncertainty to patients (via a computerized P‐DA) does not appear to result in adverse psychosocial outcomes or mistrust in physicians. This critical finding is relevant to many other malignancies for which evidence uncertainty exists either because there is a lack of high‐quality RCTs or because existing trials have conflicting results. Moreover, in such circumstances, cancer treatment decisions need to be made with the explicit disclosure to patients of related uncertainties as part of a fully informed shared decision‐making process. Although great advancements have been made in the scientific critical appraisal of medical literature, more research is needed on how to effectively to translate uncertainty in medical knowledge to oncology patients facing complex treatment decisions.</p>
