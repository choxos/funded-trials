                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>In the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) were at high risk of infection due to their exposure to COVID infections. HCWs were the backbone of our healthcare response to this pandemic; every HCW withdrawn or lost due to infection had a substantial impact on our capacity to deliver care. Primary prevention was a key approach to reduce infection. Vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent in Canadians and worldwide. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of respiratory infections. Whether this risk reduction would apply to COVID-19 infections remained to be determined. This study aimed to determine the impact of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection rate and severity in HCWs working in high COVID incidence areas.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>PROTECT was a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicentre trial of vitamin D supplementation in HCWs. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio in variable block size to intervention (one oral loading dose of 100 000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>+10 000 IU weekly vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) or control (identical placebo loading dose+weekly placebo). The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, documented by RT-qPCR on salivary (or nasopharyngeal) specimens obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes, as well as self-obtained salivary specimens and COVID-19 seroconversion at endpoint. Secondary outcomes included disease severity; duration of COVID-19-related symptoms; COVID-19 seroconversion documented at endpoint; duration of work absenteeism; duration of unemployment support; and adverse health events. The trial was terminated prematurely, due to recruitment difficulty.</p>

                  <p>This study involves human participants and was approved by the Research Ethics Board (REB) of the Centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine serving as central committee for participating institutions (#MP-21-2021-3044). Participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study before taking part. Results are being disseminated to the medical community via national/international conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly expanded to a global pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) played a crucial role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It was therefore a public health priority to develop strategies to decrease the risk and severity of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population. Indeed, this was a rising concern as HCWs were over-represented in terms of infections (3.8% of infected individuals in Wuhan, China,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> 10% in Italy and 12% in Spain, 10–20% in USA)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> and perhaps severity. Working in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and with aerosol generating medical procedures (eg, hospitals) further increased the risk (OR: 2.3).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The risk of reporting COVID-19 infection in front-line HCWs, defined as those in direct contact with patients, was 10-fold greater than the general population at the beginning of the pandemic (HR= 11.61).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Recent research also indicated that HCWs who were black, Asian or other minority ethnic populations, had a higher likelihood of contracting COVID-19.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Compared with those unexposed to patients with COVID-19, the risk was twofold to fivefold higher in HCWs exposed to suspected (HR=2.39) or confirmed (HR=4.83) COVID-19 cases, even with adequate personal protection equipment (PPE).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although infections may have been due to contact with infected patients, community-acquired disease or family acquired disease, cases were rapidly emerging from cross-infection with asymptomatic infected HCWs.</p>
              <p>Vitamin D is an immunomodulatory micronutrient, and its levels in the body may vary due to diet and environmental conditions. Vitamin D insufficiency had been associated with increased risk of respiratory infections, and possibly COVID-19,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> asthma exacerbations and acute respiratory distress syndrome, among others.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> Optimal pro-immune and anti-inflammatory impacts likely occur at 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> In a systematic review of 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 11 321 individuals, daily/weekly vitamin D supplementation decreased by 19% the rate of acute respiratory infections (two-step analysis; OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.91),<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> with a stronger effect in subjects with baseline 25OHD&lt;25 nmol/L. Whereas subgroup analyses suggested a protective effect, primary in individuals receiving daily or weekly vitamin D supplement, and not in those with bolus,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> other important differences in population (eg, malnutrition),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> age (infant),<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> chronic disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref> and type of infection (eg, bacterial)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> could have contributed to the apparent lesser effect. Of interest, vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the rate of severe exacerbations (ie, requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids), a condition associated with airway inflammation, with no impact according to bolus use or not.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Vitamin D supplementation was also found to be associated with a decreased load of rhinovirus (common cold), consistent with an increased antiviral immune response.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A systematic review and several studies reported an inverse association between serum vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity, inpatient mortality, as well as serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte percentage.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> These findings suggested that vitamin D status was linked with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection in the general population, particularly in severe COVID-19 cases. Whether vitamin D could have prevented or lessened infection and/or the inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 remained to be explored.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> At the time of funding (June 2020) and study initiation (February 2021), no other primary prevention trials were published. Since then, one positive and two negative trials testing different vitamin D interventions as primary prevention were published.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref></p>
              <p>The vitamin D receptor is expressed on innate and adaptive immune cells which also synthesise the active metabolite 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>); thus, vitamin D could strengthen innate and adaptive cellular immunity by increasing local production of antimicrobial peptides, decreasing secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting dendritic cell activation, suppressing T helper cell type 1 response, and promoting T regulatory cells induction. These cellular effects are crucial for host responses against infection and can reduce the survival and replication of respiratory viruses.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 24</xref> 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is also produced locally in bronchial epithelial cells and downregulates inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-8) and chemokines (eg, leucocyte attracting CXCL10) expression from stimulated cells.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
              <p>The protocol of a placebo-controlled parallel-group triple-blind RCT to explore the impact of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on reducing the risk and severity of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in HCWs is described here, as per Standard Protocol Items: Recommendation for Intervention Trials guidelines (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>). After funding, but prior to the start of recruitment, the protocol underwent four amendments (eight protocol versions) in view of the rapidly evolving science, multiple challenges faced with conducting a large-scale COVID-19 trial of high-risk HCWs during the pandemic, including difficulty in obtaining large-scale supplies, as well as favourable pilot results of two novel technologies (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). These original and final (V.1.8, 18 January 2021) protocol versions are described below. The trial was initiated but stopped prematurely due to recruitment difficulty.</p>

                <p>The primary research question was whether one oral dose of 100 000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (administered at baseline) plus weekly supplement of 10 000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> could decrease the risk of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, versus placebo, in front-line HCWs in high COVID-19 incidence areas.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the study aimed to examine if, compared with placebo, the vitamin D intervention reduced: (1) Illness severity, (2) Symptom duration, (3) Work absenteeism and (4) Unemployment among front-line HCWs in high COVID-19 incidence areas. This study was to also assess various exploratory outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The original primary outcome, incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, was originally based on (1) Bi-monthly self-obtained mid-turbinate nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, complemented by (2) NP swabs obtained clinically for screening or diagnostic purposes throughout the study, both analysed by Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPRC) approved by Health Canada. Faced with the unexpected cancellation of our large order of Falcon tubes to collect saliva sample for qPRC, combined with the unacceptable additional delay for a public tender to securing a contract with a private courier service, and in view of the uniform protocol for screening symptomatic or COVID-19-exposed HCWs throughout the Province of Quebec and the reliability of IgG serology, we decided to forgo the twice-monthly saliva sampling for qPRC analysis. The revised definition of the primary outcome became the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, documented by RT-qPCR based on salivary (or NP) specimens (1) Obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes throughout the study and (2) Self-obtained salivary specimens obtained at endpoint as well as (3) COVID-19 IgG seroconversion at endpoint (in COVID-unvaccinated individuals: ≥15 UA on the anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG Diasorin on Liaison XL platform; in COVID-vaccinated individuals : ≥1.40 index (specimen/calibrator (S/C)) on the anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG on ARCHITECT platform from Abbott Core Laboratory Total Solution)</p>

                <p>At the virtual screening visit by videoconferencing, research coordinators completed with the individual a more extensive eligibility questionnaire, which included additional questions about: anticipated work exposure over the next 16 weeks to COVID-infected or suspected individuals and to high-risk medical procedures; work place (Centre hospitalier universitaire de Montréal (CHUM) or CHU Sainte-Justine) or health region (CIUSSS or CISSS), serving as randomisation stratum; prior laboratory-confirmed or physician-suspected COVID-19 infection; assessment of the likelihood of prior/current, yet undocumented, COVID-19 infection using the five-item questionnaire developed by Menni <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> (score &gt;0.50 interpreted as high likelihood of prior infection); and finally, the comfort level with the study design and procedures, including saliva and capillary blood sampling self-collection demonstrated by instructional videos. Eligible and consenting individuals electronically signed an online consent form (with the signed Portable Document Format (PDF) consent form automatically emailed to participants). Then, two additional questionnaires were completed online with the research coordinators namely: (1) The baseline questionnaire collecting information about household, ethnicity, part-time versus full-time work, personal health, skin colour (measured with the Fitzpatrick Scale),<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> concomitant medications or supplements, and (2) The nominative Case Report Form (CRF) collecting demographic information essential to opening a medical and pharmaceutical research record (ie, public health insurance number, allergies) and maintaining contact with the research team throughout the study (preferred means to receive electronic reminders/questionnaires and to be notified of positive test results; address to receive study material or for biological sample pick-up; and next-of-kin contact in case of inability to respond to questionnaire due to illness), and to document work absence (employee number).</p>
                <p>Finally, at the screening visit, the participant was asked to choose an appointment for a <italic toggle="yes">virtual</italic> (via a secured videoconferencing platform) or <italic toggle="yes">inperson</italic> randomisation visit at one of several locations. To help select their preferred visit format, videos of key procedures (such as home blood collection) were shown. An <italic toggle="yes">inperson</italic> randomisation visit was mandatory only in participants with a significant likelihood of a current or past undocumented COVID-19 infection (Menni Score&gt;0.5) in order to receive the rapid COVID-19 serology test, prior to randomisation.</p>

                <p>Every 2 weeks, participants received a link to complete a <italic toggle="yes">brief online questionnaire</italic> asking to report: their adherence to weekly study supplement intake; health status including recent COVID-19 related exposure, symptoms or testing; AHEs or new comorbidities; change in concomitant medications or supplement intake; work status (active duty, quarantined, holiday, sick) and work setting (emergency department, intensive care unit, etc.); as well as expected/recent COVID-19 vaccination (date and vaccine name) if any; the latter question served to enable timely shipment of materials for additional sampling prior to vaccination, as COVID-19 vaccination was permitted during the study. In participants who planned to get vaccinated during the study, three additional blood, and one additional saliva, samplings, either <italic toggle="yes">on-site</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">remotely</italic>, were planned including: saliva (for COVID-19 qPCR analysis) and blood (for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG serology) sampled prior to vaccination, a blood sample (for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S and anti-N IgG serology) collected just prior to the second vaccine dose, and a blood sample (for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S and anti-N IgG serology) collected 1 month after second vaccine dose and endpoint. Regardless of their vaccination status, participants were asked to continue taking the weekly study supplement and complete the bi-monthly questionnaire until the end of the study. If questionnaires were not completed within 2 days of the target date, the research coordinator reached out to the participant to complete the information.</p>

                <p>Several covariates that could act as confounders or interaction variables in the magnitude of effect associated with the intervention were documented, namely: baseline serum 25OHD level; smoking; concomitant supplements or drug(s) that can alter calcium or vitamin D absorption or metabolism such as diuretics and antiepileptics (reported at baseline and every 2 weeks); skin colour (documented at baseline); obesity (documented by height and weight (body mass index (BMI)) at baseline); other comorbidities (ie, diabetes, hypertension, etc) that may affect the severity of COVID-19 infection and receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine (documented by verbal report bi-monthly). All external (governmental and institutional) databases were to be obtained 3 months before, and up to 16 months following, randomisation (as well as 12 months after then study endpoint).</p>

Participants who reported symptoms suggestive of vitamin D intoxication had a venous blood sampling (total and ionised calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and creatinine). Any abnormal laboratory value was interpreted as ‘clinically significant’ or ‘not clinically significant’ by the site endocrinologist blinded to study allocation. Further investigation or action for individual participants (including interruption, cessation, or unblinding of the study drug via pharmacy or by analysis of serum 25OHD) was determined by the site endocrinologist, if indicated to ensure participant safety. The AHE’s occurrence was reviewed periodically by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Code breaking was allowed only if deemed essential for participant management. If relevant, summary reports aggregating (or not if requested) both groups were to be provided to the DSMB.</p>

For the primary outcome, the posterior distribution of the OR of COVID-19 infection (OR) was the basis of inference in interim and final analyses. The posterior distribution of the OR was to be estimated by drawing samples from the posterior risks under each arm, which could be obtained analytically in a β-binomial model. Flat prior distributions were assumed for the risks (β(1,1)). Posterior 95% credible intervals were to be reported as interval estimates for the OR. Crude analyses as well as analyses adjusted for important covariates (ie, potential confounders, effect modification and baseline group imbalances) were to be conducted. Subgroup analyses would be conducted on baseline 25OHD, age, sex, BMI, occupational risk and COVID-19 vaccination. A stratified analysis on geographical infection rate would be explored; sensitivity analysis censoring to date of COVID-19 vaccination, would be conducted if applicable.</p>

A non-objection letter from Health Canada had been obtained to use high-dose vitamin D loading dose as well as the TASSO-SST device for home blood sampling and the NADAL COVID-19 IgM/IgG rapid serology test. Written informed consent for study participation, for biobanking specimens for ancillary studies, and for subsequent publication of results was obtained from all participants, with the knowledge that participation was voluntary and could be withdrawn at any time with no effect on their current/future medical care. As part of the informed consent, enrolees had the option to participate in the HostSeq COVID-19 Canadian biobank conducted under the supervision of CGen, a national Canadian platform for sequencing and genome analysis (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>).

              <p>All protocol amendments were submitted to Health Canada, investigators and REB; if these changes implied a revision of consent forms, ongoing trial participants were informed of new modifications to provide informed consent. All information obtained during the study were and would continue to be kept confidential as per the law. Data were collected directly by electronic data capture on Dacima Clinical Suite (DACIMA Software, Montreal, Canada). Data safety and confidentiality was upheld at all data collection stages by assigning a unique subject identifier (ID) to each participant, with data and samples kept under lock and key, electronic password protection and access restricted to study personnel. Samples collected during the study were labelled with the unique research code, prior to transfer and storage at the CHU Sainte-Justine biobank, with access restricted to authorised personnel.</p>
              <p>This trial used pragmatic patient (irrespective of baseline 25OHD level) and intervention to attempt to maximise subsequent implementation into practice. If the intervention had been shown to be effective in reducing infection and morbidity, this approach would have been readily implementable and could have markedly influenced practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. No participant identifiers were used in the dissemination of this research. Healthcare professionals serving as partners were informed of the study design and pretested all questionnaires.</p>

                <title>Trial status, challenges and discussion</title>
                <p>The study was conducted as per V.1.8 (18 January 2021). The recruitment started on 9 February 2021. On the DSMB recommendation, recruitment was stopped prematurely on 18 March 2021, after 34 participants were enrolled, due to the inability to recruit approximately 200 participants/week required to meet the target sample size of 2415 participants. The DSMB advised that the continuation of the trial, as originally designed, would not be able to answer the research question and recommended that recruitment be stopped for futility. Recruitment difficulties were attributed in part to the high use of vitamin D and high concurrent vaccination rate among our target population, HCWs, the first targeted to be vaccinated from January 2021 onwards. Based on the recommendations of the study’s endocrinologist, a premature end of follow-up after a minimum of 4 weeks from randomisation was deemed sufficient to monitor the safety of the intervention in all participants. The time frame was deemed sufficient to ensure participant safety while learning for the study, that is, transforming the PROTECT Study into a pilot study to document the impact of the study intervention on the rise in vitamin D serum level, participants’ adherence to the study intervention and procedures in the context of a hybrid study, and so on. The last end of visit was conducted on 4 May 2022.</p>
                <p>Potential re-directions of the study were discussed. The first option was to change the main outcome for an immunogenicity study in the general adult population. However, after strong consideration of the amount of changes to be made to the protocol and related documents (standards of procedures, case report forms, participant’ instructions and notification, etc), the expected delay in obtaining approval by all regulatory and ethical authorities, the impossible logistic of recruiting participants after the same duration of exposure to the study intervention prior to their vaccination, combined with the government of Quebec announcement that all willing adults would be vaccinated by 24 June 2021, the research team judged that it would unfeasible to perform a scientific solid and feasible trial on immunogenicity if one could not control the timing of immunisation, combined with the expected very short recruitment time frame.</p>
                <p>A second option that received very strong consideration was to replicate the PROTECT Trial in children aged 9 years and over. Again, after considering changes to be made to the protocol and related documents, the expected delay for obtaining approval by all regulatory and ethical authorities including school boards, combined with the Pfizer-BioNtech announcement that their vaccine was not only 100% successful for preventing COVID-19 infection in adolescents aged 12–15 years, but that they forecast vaccinating teenagers in time for the September 2021 school entry, the Principle Investigator judged that it was unrealistic to aim for the large recruitment target within such a short time frame.</p>
                <p>The protocol was submitted for publication after the last patient end-of-study visit, due to the incredible amount of work done to set up and initiate this large hybrid trial. Of note, the hybrid trial was preceeded by two pilot studies, each to test a new experimental device that enabled partial or totally remote participation. The pandemic also imposed important sanitary protocols and space restrictions for recruiting on-site potentially COVID-19-infected HCWs, as well as several protocol amendments to facilitate and adjust the trial in the context of emerging science, material shortage, and anticipated vaccination campaign; each amendment in turn required significant modification of all related electronic documents and manual of procedures, and resubmission to obtain regulatory approvals. Collectively, this lead to a delay in recruitment initiation which contributed to the premature end-of-follow-up in enrolled participants.</p>
                <p>With the gained experience and knowledge, it is crucial that a future trial must begin fast prior to widespread vaccination and in populations where infection rate is high.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Permitting study entry to individuals with prior infection and prior vaccination (given common re-infections and temporary vaccine protection)<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> could have been considered, but it would have significantly reduced the event rate, required prolongation beyond 24 weeks (and additional funding), and compromised study power as was noted in other primary prevention trials.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Restricting eligibility to patients with vitamin D deficiency (&lt;25 nmol/L) would have severely interfered with recruitment ability in population-based or HCWs studies.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> Use of calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamine D or (25OHD)) may have been associated with more potency and rapid rise in serum 25OHD than expected for cholecalciferol<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) although the choice is debated<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and rapid access to study drug and matching placebo remains a crucial challenge at the onset of a pandemic. Revisiting the intervention dose and frequency of administration in light of the latest literature on SARS-CoV-2 and related virus could be considered, although current evidence suggest that, with similar doses, high-incidence population may be more important than dosing in primary prevention<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 28</xref> and high doses are effective in tertiary prevention.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Of interest, we have demonstrated that the intervention significantly rose 25OHD levels well above 75 nmol/L, that is, in the hypothesised range for optimal pro-immune and anti-inflammatory impact.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> A pragmatic design with fewer outcomes and monitoring via administrative databases appeared theoretically more efficient, but required rapid access to data when interim analyses are planned to monitor event rate; any delay in data access could raise serious challenges and hamper trial decisions. Pursuing a hybrid approach to facilitate enrolment in the context of a pandemic was feasible, although electronic self-screening and outcome monitoring required a lot of programming that have contributed to implementation delays.</p>
                <p>The publication of this protocol is meant to share our experience, including conducting a hybrid (virtual and/or inperson) trial and lessons learnt, to serve as template to accelerate protocol writing and its improvement in the context of another epidemic/pandemic, and to serve as reference for the publication of our pilot studies that enabled this trial, and lessons learnt from this experience. As vitamin D supplementation has shown a benefit as tertiary prevention in severe COVID-19 cases, with insufficient data to conclude its impact as primary and secondary prevention, this approach remains worthy of testing.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p>
