                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Housing First (HF)-based interventions have been implemented in North America and beyond to help people exit homelessness. The effect of these interventions on access to primary and specialist care services is not well-defined. This study assesses the long-term effects of an HF intervention for homeless adults with mental illness on primary care physician (PCP) and non-primary care physician (non-PCP) visits.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>This is a secondary analysis of the At Home/Chez Soi study, a randomized trial of HF for homeless adults with mental illness in Toronto, Canada. High-need (HN) participants were randomized to HF with assertive community treatment (HF-ACT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Moderate needs (MN) participants were randomized to HF with intensive case management (HF-ICM) or TAU. The primary outcomes were the incidence and the number of visits to a PCP and non-PCP over 7-years post-randomization, compared to the 1-year pre-randomization.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Of 575 enrolled participants, 527 (80 HN and 347 MN) participants were included in the analyses. HN participants who received HF-ACT had a significant reduction in the number of visits to a PCP compared to TAU participants (ratio of rate ratios (RRR): 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.93) and a significant reduction in the number of non-PCP visits compared with TAU participants (RRR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.97) in the 7-years post-randomization compared to the 1-year pre-randomization. MN participants who received HF-ICM had a significant increase in incident visits to a PCP compared to TAU participants (RRR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10-2.50). No effect of HF-ICM was observed on the incidence or number of non-PCP visits.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>HF has differing effects on visits to PCPs and non-PCPs among homeless people with high and moderate needs for mental health supports. HF does not result in a consistent increase in PCP and non-PCP visits over a 7-year follow-up period. The At Home/Chez Soi study is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN, ISRCTN42520374).</p>

              <p>Primary care (PC) services play a critical role in achieving more equitable health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr3-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> People who are socioeconomically excluded, such as those experiencing homelessness, face several barriers to accessing these services. Even in settings with universal health insurance (UHI), studies have found that homeless people have lower rates of PC use and preventive and outpatient services than the general population,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> despite higher rates of chronic health conditions,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> infectious diseases,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> traumatic brain injury,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and mental illness.</p>
              <p>Further, the access and usage of other non-PC services provided in out-of-hospital care settings, such as visits to specialist physicians, may be even less frequent in homeless people. In a publicly funded UHI system, access to specialist care outside the hospital setting usually requires a referral from a primary care provider (PCP), who acts as the central coordinating point for the care of their patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, having no PCP can contribute to health disparities in accessing and receiving specialized care for disadvantaged populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Housing First (HF) interventions have been widely implemented in North America<sup><xref rid="bibr12-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and Europe<sup><xref rid="bibr14-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> to better address the complex social and health needs of people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. The HF approach is grounded in immediate access to housing without treatment preconditions, coupled with client-centered support services, as a critical starting point for recovery and social and health well-being.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In theory, HF interventions have the potential to improve access to PC by increasing housing stability, reducing barriers to seeking care, and providing support that foster connections with PC providers.</p>
              <p>The few studies that have assessed the effects of HF-based programs on PC utilization have been mainly non-randomized studies completed over periods less than 2 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> There is scant evidence on the long-term impacts of HF support on PC utilization. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of an HF intervention for homeless people with mental illness on PCP and non-PCP visits over a 7-year follow-up period. We hypothesized that the HF intervention would increase both the incidence and number of PCP and non-PCP visits compared to treatment as usual (TAU).</p>

                <p>This study is a secondary analysis of health outcomes over a total of up to 7 years of follow-up among participants of the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> From October 1, 2009, to March 31, 2013, the Toronto site was part of the multi-site Canadian AH/CS study conducted in 5 cities (Vancouver, Winnipeg, Montreal, Moncton, and Toronto).<sup><xref rid="bibr20-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> At the end of this period, participants at the Toronto site were asked to consent to be followed-up for an additional 4 years (January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2017).</p>

                <title>Data Sources</title>
                <p>Study participants were linked to administrative health (AH) databases at ICES, an independent, non-profit research institute whose legal status under Ontario’s health information privacy law allows it to collect and analyze health care and demographic data, without consent, for health system evaluation and improvement. Linkage was performed using unique encoded identifiers, such as participant’s name, date of birth, and personal Ontario health insurance number. PCP and non-PCP visits were ascertained using the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database, which captures information on essentially all physician visits in the province. This dataset was analyzed at ICES.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The 2 main outcomes of this study were PCP visits and non-PCP visits, measured as (1) the incidence of a first visit per person-years of observation and (2) the total number of visits per person-years of observation. The PCP and non-PCP outcomes were ascertained during 2 periods: the 1 year prior to randomization and the 7 years after randomization to the HF intervention. When calculating the incidence of a first PCP and non-PCP visit, the period of observation (time-at-risk) for each participant was truncated on the date that their first PCP or non-PCP visit occurred. The period of observation was also truncated if the participant died or was de-enrolled from the Ontario health care system or if the participant’s consent for data linkage ended.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>An intention-to-treat analysis was used. The analyses included an offset for time-at-risk (log of person-years) for each participant. The person-years accounted for time that the participant was alive, eligible for and consenting to data linkage. The Poisson model was used to compare the number of PCP and non-PCP visits between the HF and TAU groups over the study periods (1-year pre-randomization and 0-7 years post-randomization). Generalized estimating equation models that included the intervention (HF vs TAU), period (1-year pre-randomization vs 0-7 years post-randomization), and an intervention × time interaction were used to assess differences in rate changes in outcomes between HF and TAU groups and to compare differences in the 0- to 7-year follow up period versus the 0 to 1 year pre-randomization period. Rates, rate ratios(RR), and the ratio of rate ratios(RRR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using SAS 9.4 statistical software.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We used AH databases to examine the effects of HF on the use of PCP and non-PCP visits over a 7-year follow-up period. In this analysis of changes in the HF intervention groups compared to the TAU groups, HF had differential effects depending on participants’ level of need for mental health supports. Among individuals with HN, HF-ACT did not significantly affect the incidence of a PCP and non-PCP visit but significantly decreased the number of both PCP visits and non-PCP visits over time. In contrast, HF-ICM significantly increased the incidence of a PCP visit among individuals with MN but not the number of PCP visits over time. There was no significant effect of HF-ICM on changes related to the incidence and number of non-PCP visits.</p>
              <p>Compared with housed or the general population, a recent study using ICES databases (similar data source for the present study),<sup><xref rid="bibr22-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> found that during March to July 2019 (pre-COVID-19), there were on average 7.66 visits per 1000 people/day to PCPs in the province of Ontario (the setting of our study), while in our participants overall, there were on average 14.34 person-year visits (or 39.3 visits per 1000 people/day) to PCPs during 1-year pre-randomization. This finding suggests that our study population tended to accumulate more visits to PCs than the general population. In homeless populations, very few previous RCTs of HF have examined the effects of this intervention on PC utilization. In a 1-year follow-up study in the United States, researchers found that veterans with a history of homelessness that received HF services through the HUD-VASH program had more visits to PC services than other low-income and homeless veterans who did not receive HF.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Most other RCTs of HF have examined the effect of HF on emergency department visits and hospitalizations, but not PCP visits.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> No previous studies have assessed the impact of a housing intervention for homeless people on non-PCP visits outside a hospital-based setting.</p>
              <p>Our findings indicate that although HF clearly reduces homelessness over 7 years of follow-up,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> it does not result in a consistent increase in PCP and non-PCP visits over this time frame. Among high-need individuals who received HF with ACT, the observation of a reduction in the rate of PCP and non-PCP visits was unexpected. It is possible that the HF-ACT model, in which a team of psychiatrists, case managers, and peer support workers provide high-intensity supports in the community, including health supports (eg, mental health assessments and treatment and harm reduction and substance use disorders), reduces participants’ desire or need for frequent PCP and non-PCP visits.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It is also possible that due to severe mental illness and functional impairment, participants who receive HF-ACT may not seek help or attend scheduled appointments<sup><xref rid="bibr26-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> with both PCPs and non-PCPs despite receiving HF support. Seeking health care is voluntary rather than a requirement under the HF framework.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Further, stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system toward vulnerable people could constitute a barrier to more frequently accessing PC services by this population.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Among moderate-need individuals who received HF-ICM, the observed effect of an increased incidence of PCP visits was expected, as one of the goals of ICM is to connect clients to PC and other services in the community. In addition, the provision of stable housing through the HF intervention is expected to reduce barriers to connecting with PC. However, the lack of a significant effect on the number of PCP and non-PCP visits indicates that in this population, an initial connection to a PCP does not necessarily lead to more frequent PCP and non-PCP visits over time. Regarding non-significant findings on the non-PCP visits outcomes, this may be explained by the potential connection between fewer visits to PCPs and fewer visits to non-PCPs, since having a PCP facilitates access to more specialized healthcare services.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is also likely that having a PCP supports the delivery of more holistic management or treatment of individuals’ health needs<sup><xref rid="bibr9-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> without requiring further assessment or treatment by other health specialists.</p>
              <p>The study’s findings have significant implications for practice and research. First, organizations providing HF, particularly in conjunction with ACT for homeless people with HN for mental health services, should monitor their clients’ need for and potential under-utilization of PC services and access to specialized health services outside the hospital.</p>
              <p>Second, organizations providing HF should assess the initial connection of their clients with PCPs and other medical specialists in out-of-hospital settings and their ongoing rate of PCP and non-PCP visits over time to inform efforts to improve care. Further, integrating PC services within existing HF and other types of support programs serving people with lived experiences of homelessness could reduce existing structural and individual barriers to accessing and receiving PC.</p>
              <p>Third, PCPs and health systems that provide care for people experiencing homelessness and those who have transitioned out of homelessness should be aware that HF interventions do not necessarily ensure successful ongoing connection to PC. Thus, PC systems may need to develop collaborations with their patients’ social service providers to ensure these individuals receive appropriate preventive care. Furthermore, PCPs could contribute to leading changes in the way they engage with vulnerable people to facilitate their access to PC and non-PC services.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Additionally, PCPs, non-PCPs, and support services could lead coordinating efforts<sup><xref rid="bibr9-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in partnership with other allied health professionals (including nurses, nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychologists, and social workers) to enhance and provide timely and appropriate multidisciplinary health support<sup><xref rid="bibr29-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> for addressing the complex health needs of homeless people.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Fourth, PCPs and non-PCPs could also advocate for collecting and sharing medical and non-medical information with health and social support providers working within the existing social support programs (eg, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, case managers working with HF clients)<sup><xref rid="bibr29-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; carry out closer and frequent health and well-being follow-up visits, and allocate more time for the medical encounter with this population.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> All of this has the potential to promote and facilitate the continuity of healthcare<sup><xref rid="bibr28-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> through a more collaborative PC model.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Fifth, promote a participatory learning approach and skills-building activities<sup><xref rid="bibr33-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> of the current and future PCPs and Non-PCPs and allied PC professionals on homelessness and mental illness and its contributing factors, and how it intersects with systemic issues such as racism, stigma, and discrimination within primary care and social support settings,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and building trusting professional relationships with people with lived experiences of homelessness<sup><xref rid="bibr28-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> may also contribute to increasing the help-seeking behavior of people experiencing homelessness, and the quality of care they receive within the in primary care services.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-21501327211027102" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Finally, future studies should assess the extent of unmet needs for primary care among formerly homeless individuals receiving HF services. Also, the effect of the HF intervention on PC-related health outcomes such as management of chronic diseases and mental health and substance use symptomatology and access and delivery of preventive or screening services in people with lived or recent experiences of homelessness need further research. Since the incidence and number of PCP and non-PCP visits may not always be a good proxy to assess potential improvements or decline in individuals’ health status, such studies should include qualitative approaches to have a better and more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic on how HF-based approaches and other contributing factors or circumstances mitigate or increase the usage of primary care and other out-of-hospital care services by homeless people.</p>
              <p>The present study used a rigorous randomized controlled design to examine the long-term impact of an HF intervention on PCP and non-PCP visits. PCP and non-PCP visits were ascertained using highly reliable administrative databases rather than self-report, reducing the possibility of misreporting. However, further studies comparing the number of visits to PCPs and non-PCPs of homeless and housed people with and without mental illness can provide a further understanding of the contribution of access to care in these populations.</p>
              <p>This study has certain limitations. First, eligibility for the study required the presence of a mental disorder; therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to homeless individuals without mental illness. Second, data on the reasons for visits (eg, preventive care, diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up) and the quality of care provided during these visits were not available. Third, we did not have data on PC services provided by other health care professionals such as nurse practitioners. In Ontario, where this study was conducted, these professionals are paid by salary rather than by billing the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, which was our source for healthcare utilization data. Fourth, as the study was conducted in a setting with a Universal Health Insurance system, the findings may not be generalizable to settings where homeless individuals do not have access to universal health coverage. Further studies in other jurisdictions may provide further insight into the effects of HF programs on PC and non-PC services utilization.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, HF has differing effects on visits to PCPs and non-PCPs among homeless people with high and moderate needs for mental health supports. HF does not result in a consistent increase in PCP and non-PCP visits over a 7-year follow-up period.</p>
