              <abstract>
                <p>Antipsychotics (APs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia (SCZ) but are unfortunately associated with serious metabolic adverse effects including weight gain and type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiology of AP-induced metabolic dysfunction is largely undetermined. Brain insulin resistance has been posited to be at the cross-roads of many cognitive and metabolic disorders, and disruption of central insulin action has emerged as a possible explanatory mechanism underlying AP induced metabolic dysfunction. Previous studies suggest that change in neuroimaging-based parameters with intranasal insulin administration can be leveraged to investigate brain insulin resistance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will utilize neural signatures of insulin action in the brain to examine if APs disrupt brain insulin signaling. It is hypothesized that: 1) intranasal insulin (INI), but not intranasal placebo (INP), will change cerebral blood flow and resting state connectivity, as well as increase glutamate levels in the striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 2) oral olanzapine (OLA), but not oral placebo (PL), will inhibit the effect of INI on these parameters. Thirty-two healthy volunteers will undergo a single blind, cross-over design, wherein all participants receive the following four treatment combinations, 2–6 weeks apart, in a random sequence: INP + PL, INP + OLA, INI + PL, and INI + OLA. Participants will undergo an MRI-based assay of brain insulin resistance 15 minutes after administering 160 IU INI or INP. The scanning protocol includes resting and task-based functional MRI, arterial spin labelling, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Demonstrating that OLA can acutely induce brain insulin resistance is clinically relevant to metabolic health in SCZ. Evidence of brain insulin resistance induced by acute AP dosing can inform the early use of adjunctive insulin sensitizers for the treatment of metabolic comorbidities associated with AP treatment in severe mental illness.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Antipsychotic (AP) medications are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia (SCZ) spectrum disorders [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with increasing off-label use in children and adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, APs, and second-generation APs (SGA) in particular, are associated with serious metabolic adverse effects including significant weight gain, impaired glucose control, and dyslipidemia [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such metabolic disturbances occur rapidly after exposure to APs [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with olanzapine and clozapine representing two SGAs with the greatest metabolic liability.</p>
              <p>Recently, brain insulin resistance has been posited to lie at the cross-roads of many cognitive and metabolic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and disruption of central insulin action has emerged as a plausible contributor to AP-induced metabolic dysfunction. The effect of APs on central insulin sensing is a novel area of investigation as the brain was long considered an insulin-insensitive organ [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, it is now well-established that insulin within the central nervous system (CNS) has modulating effects on processes such as appetite regulation, metabolism, behaviour, and cognition [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, using the pancreatic euglycemic clamp technique to separate central and peripheral insulin effects, it has been established that an intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of insulin in rodents, and intranasal administration of insulin in humans, results in a decrease in endogenous glucose production by the liver [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, using this same gold-standard technique, our group has shown that an acute dose of olanzapine (OLA) can completely abolish the ability of a central insulin stimulus to decrease hepatic glucose production in rats [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This suggests that APs have a direct anti-insulin action in the brain that is independent of weight gain. Endogenous glucose production is a major source of fasting and post-absorptive hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes; therefore, disruption of the central insulin regulation of hepatic glucose production poses patients on APs at a greater risk for developing glucose dysregulation.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the effect of central insulin on brain functioning and regulating cognition has also been demonstrated. Studies employing neuroimaging techniques with intranasal insulin (INI) administration have shown that insulin enhances connectivity in the default-mode network (DMN) between prefrontal brain regions and the hippocampus [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], reduces cerebral blood flow in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and increases perfusion in the insular cortex [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Infusion of high concentrations of peripheral insulin also increases glutamate levels in the frontal and temporal cortex [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but only in non-insulin resistant individuals. Interestingly, insulin resistance has specifically been correlated with lower striatal glutamate [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, studies in healthy, normal weight humans have revealed that INI administration improves declarative, working and verbal memory, as well as visuospatial function [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; improvements in visuospatial and verbal fluency performance have also been related to changes in regional vasodilation [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notably, these cognitive domains are disrupted in AP-treated patients with SCZ. Additionally, APs are known to normalize concentrations of glutamate within the striatum [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is otherwise high in unmedicated first episode SCZ patients [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, with evidence to suggest an anti-insulin effect of APs, it is possible that APs might interact with cognitive processes through interruption of insulin-mediated processes on brain activity, perfusion and neurotransmission in salient brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Taking the above findings together, INI-induced changes in the brain can be exploited and utilized as an “assay” of insulin activity, where absence of these changes can be interpreted as a sign of brain insulin resistance. Indeed, perfusion changes have been found to be absent or attenuated in participants with insulin resistance or high visceral fat [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], demonstrating that neuroimaging-based parameters can be used to investigate the presence of insulin resistance in the brain. Thus, in this proof-of-concept study, we will utilize well-characterized neural signatures of brain insulin action to examine if APs disrupt brain insulin signaling in humans. We have chosen to 1) use olanzapine as the representative AP given its high metabolic liability, 2) study healthy volunteers to avoid confounding effects of psychiatric illness on glucose metabolism and cognition, and 3) utilize acute AP dosing to avoid adiposity changes, allowing us to dissect whether APs directly inhibit brain insulin action in humans.</p>

                <p>The two objectives of this study are: 1) To examine if intranasal insulin (INI) induces any changes in cerebral blood flow, resting state connectivity, glutamate levels within the striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and visuospatial task performance, as compared to intranasal placebo (INP); 2) To examine if olanzapine (OLA) acutely inhibits INI associated changes in cerebral blood flow, resting state activity, glutamate levels in the striatum and DLPFC, and visuospatial task performance.</p>

                <p>We hypothesize that: 1) INI, but not INP, will change cerebral blood flow and resting state connectivity, increase glutamate levels in the striatum and DLPFC, and improve visuospatial memory performance; 2) oral (OLA), but not oral PL, will inhibit the effect of INI on these parameters. There will be no difference between INI and INP in the presence of OLA (and performance in both these arms will be worse than that in the INP-PL arm).</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This study will follow a single-blind, crossover design wherein each participant will receive all 4 possible treatment combinations (INP-PL, INP-OLA, INI-PL, and INI-OLA) (summarized in <xref rid="pone.0277211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These will be administered at different times in a predetermined sequence to counterbalance the effects of treatments across participants. The assignment of participants to sequences will be at random. Each participant will be investigated on 4 separate occasions (i.e., 4 study periods), 2–6 weeks apart. Each of the study periods will follow a three-day protocol (<xref rid="pone.0277211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>): administration of OLA 5 mg HS (or placebo) on day 0, OLA 10 mg HS (or placebo) on day 1, and cognitive testing and MRI scanning on day 2. MRI assessments will occur 15 minutes after administering 160 International Units (IU) of INI/INP and will involve measuring cerebral blood flow, resting state activity, glutamate levels in specific regions of interest, and the spatial n-back cognitive test of visuospatial function [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The two acute OLA doses of 5 mg and 10 mg were chosen for reasons of practicality and safety, although this is not representative of how the drug is used clinically (i.e. daily administration, often at higher doses) [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, previous research has shown that a single 10 mg dose of OLA in healthy controls may invoke early changes in some parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism, justifying the chosen dose in this study [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The rationale for the chosen INI dose is based on a study finding that in nine healthy men receiving placebo, 40 IU, 80 IU or 160 IU of INI in a randomized order, there was a dose-dependent relationship on regional brain activity, with the strongest effects being observed after 160 IU [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It should be noted that the high dose of INI is necessary for the experimental design but likely does not reflect postprandial insulin concentration. Blood samples will also be drawn before and after the MRI to measure insulin spillover and olanzapine blood levels.</p>

The study team will maintain records for the number of people approached, screened, eligible, withdrawn, and the reasons for non-enrolment. Any research information recorded for, or resulting from, participation in this research study prior to the date that the subject formally withdrew their consent will be retained and may continue to be used and disclosed by the investigators for research purposes; however, no new data will be collected.</p>

                <p>The study staff will confirm eligibility and assign a participant trial number. Eligible participants will be randomized to receiving 1 of 4 treatment sequences (outlined in <xref rid="pone.0277211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These randomized sequences are computer generated using SPSS syntax and a seed to ensure reproducibility. The assignment of treatment condition, according to the randomization table, is done by CAMH pharmacy staff who are unblinded and not involved in any other trial matters; at any time, the pharmacy staff is only unblinded to the current randomization and not the entire randomization table. Oral OLA and PL will be dispensed by the pharmacy in identical looking capsules packaged in blister packs. INI or INP will be transferred from their respective vials into an unlabeled metered spray bottle that is identical for both conditions. Study staff will not be involved in any pharmacy related processes. Treatment sequences will be unblinded on an ongoing basis, once a participant has completed all four study visits. Premature unblinding will only occur if a serious adverse event were to occur that requires knowing the allocation the participant has received.</p>

                  <p>Prior to inviting participants to complete the consent form and begin the screening visits of the study, participants will be asked a series of eligibility-related questions through a telephone screen to act as an initial check of eligibility and safety. The telephone pre-screening will be reviewed by the PI and if the participant has been deemed eligible, they will proceed to the screening visits of the study for informed consent and thorough assessment of eligibility. The following demographic and clinical information will be collected to characterize the sample and confirm study eligibility: demographic variables (e.g. age, sex, race, education level/type); personal and family medical history; personal psychiatric history (assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)); anthropometric measures (e.g. blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, height, BMI); fasting bloodwork and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test to rule out prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (using a standard glucose drink (75gm)); and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) to assess hand dominance or laterality. Participants will only be enrolled in the study once eligibility has been determined following the screening visit.</p>

                      <p>Administration of 160 IU of INI (or INP) will occur ~30 minutes before the MRI scan. MRI scans will be performed using CAMH’s research dedicated 3T scanner. The MRI scanning protocol will be ~1 hour in duration and will include structural MRI, arterial spin labelling (ASL), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), resting state functional MRI (fMRI), and task-based fMRI. Under resting conditions, participants will be asked to remain awake but keep their eyes closed and let their mind wander. Task fMRI data will be acquired during the performance of the spatial n-back paradigm, a visuospatial working memory task [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The task is a block design spatial variant of the n-back working memory task with two levels of difficulty (<xref rid="pone.0277211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The paradigm has been designed using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) and has been shown to activate frontal and parietal brain regions involved in spatial cognition and working memory [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this continuous performance task, participants will alternate between 0 back and 2 back conditions. Participants are shown four large blue dots in a diamond-shaped diagram, indicating the four possible positions of the stimulus. The stimulus consists of one dot changing colour at a time. Participants will be instructed to respond to the stimulus by button box presses as fast and as accurately as possible. Responses are made either directly following the stimulus (0-back), or with a delay of two stimuli (2-back). Outcome measures are both accuracy and reaction time. Acquisition parameters for the MRI scan sequence are outlined in <xref rid="pone.0277211.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>, along with additional details for the spatial n-back intrascanner cognitive task.</p>

Brief versions of the neuropsychological tests (i.e., which can be completed within a 2-hour period) are employed due to insulin pharmacokinetics, which appear to be sensitive relative to neuropsychological effects. In addition to advantages of brevity, the BVMT has alternate form capacity, with an associated low risk of direct practice effects during serial neuropsychological assessments. The DSST is a widely used and simple cognitive task that principally assesses visual scanning and processing speed and is sensitive to sedation [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277211.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

The same set of statistical analyses will be completed for all neuroimaging parameters and behavioural data. Descriptive analysis including data visualization of individual trajectories will be conducted to inspect the data for atypical data points and to characterize the data. Mixed effect models that control for period (1, 2, 3 and 4) and sequence (1, 2, 3 and 4) and specify random intercept for subjects will be used to test all hypotheses as well as to estimate effect sizes. Hypothesis 1 will be tested by comparing INI-PL with INP-PL using linear contrasts. Hypothesis 2 will also use linear contrasts to compare the difference INI-PL—INP-PL with the difference INI-OLA—INP-OLA. Statistical significance will be declared if p-value &lt; 0.05 and regardless of it, estimated means with their standard errors will be reported for all outcomes. Eventual dropouts will be included in the model. Since OLA is associated with sedation which may impact our cognitive domains of interest, we will quantify sedation using: a) the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; and b) a digit symbol substitution test (DSST) [<xref rid="pone.0277211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Scores on the POMS and SWN scales will be used as covariates to control for changes in energy, mood, and subjective well-being induced by the study medication.

A participant screening log, noting reasons for screen failure, where applicable, will be maintained for all participants. The investigator will document the obtained informed consent and record medical and psychiatric history, medications, and efficacy data in the eCRF/CRF. Clinical scales and neuropsychological assessments will be considered source documents and will be incorporated into the eCRF/CRF in a confidential manner. Study data will be entered in a secure database using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software. At point-of-entry, data values will undergo consistency edits (e.g., ID validation, range verification, duplicate detection) and personnel will be required to correct errors.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Brain insulin resistance is emerging as a shared pathological feature between cognitive and metabolic disorders. Drawing parallels between brain insulin resistance, SCZ, and its treatments, the illness is associated with high rates of type 2 diabetes, obesity and impairments in cognitive function which overlap with those linked to metabolic disease and insulin resistance. Of interest, cognitive deficits are understood to be a key illness domain of SCZ for which no effective pharmacological interventions have been established. Thus, the possibility exists that AP efficacy to target cognitive deficits may be diminished secondarily via AP-induced metabolic dysregulation and insulin resistance. Examination of the translational value of our earlier findings suggesting OLA can induce central resistance to insulin is both intriguing and very clinically relevant to domains of physical health and, possibly, psychopathology.</p>
              <p>This study aims to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms behind metabolic adverse effects of AP drugs and their cognitive effects. In an exploratory fashion, this study will employ an MRI-based assay of brain insulin resistance to investigate the potential cognitive impact of APs in the context of central insulin stimulation. Hence, this study can help shed light on how insulin resistance in the brain can affect neuroimaging, cognitive, and metabolic outcomes. Additionally, this work is of relevance to all diseases positioned at the crossroads of metabolic and cognitive health. It has the potential to initiate new streams of work in an area of significant unmet need that intercepts disciplines of physiology, endocrinology, and psychiatry, and may lead to new therapeutic strategies. Specifically, evidence of AP-induced brain insulin resistance may advise use of adjunctive treatment with targeted central insulin sensitizers to address metabolic and possibly cognitive dysfunction at the earliest stages of the illness.</p>

                <title>Limitations and measures to minimize bias</title>
                <p>It is recognized that the single-blind nature of this study is a limitation. However, it should be noted that study staff will operate in a double-blind fashion while participants are actively enrolled. In this regard, blind assignments will be kept by the CAMH pharmacy and only released once a participant completes all four visits of the study to be included in the ongoing analysis. A pharmacy member external to the study team will have access to unblinding codes in case of a serious adverse event. The trial will be registered with a publicly available, free-to-access, searchable clinical trial registry before approaching the first participant to avoid bias selection of the reported result(s). Furthermore, study staff administering and scoring the extra-scanner cognitive assessments will be blinded to the INI/INP allocation to minimize any bias (they will not be involved in transferring the product into the nasal spray bottle).</p>

              <p>Journal requirements:</p>
              <p>1. PLOS requires an ORCID iD for the corresponding author in Editorial Manager on papers submitted after December 6th, 2016. Please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. To do this, go to ‘Update my Information’ (in the upper left-hand corner of the main menu), and click on the Fetch/Validate link next to the ORCID field. This will take you to the ORCID site and allow you to create a new iD or authenticate a pre-existing iD in Editorial Manager. Please see the following video for instructions on linking an ORCID iD to your Editorial Manager account: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ</ext-link></p>

              <p>3. We note that the original protocol file you uploaded contains a confidentiality notice indicating that the protocol may not be shared publicly or be published. Please note, however, that the PLOS Editorial Policy requires that the original protocol be published alongside your manuscript in the event of acceptance. Please note that should your paper be accepted, all content including the protocol will be published under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license, which means that it will be freely available online, and any third party is permitted to access, download, copy, distribute, and use these materials in any way, even commercially, with proper attribution.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we ask that you please seek permission from the study sponsor or body imposing the restriction on sharing this document to publish this protocol under CC BY 4.0 if your work is accepted. We kindly ask that you upload a formal statement signed by an institutional representative clarifying whether you will be able to comply with this policy. Additionally, please upload a clean copy of the protocol with the confidentiality notice (and any copyrighted institutional logos or signatures) removed.</p>
