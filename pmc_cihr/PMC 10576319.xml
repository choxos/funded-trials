                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Potassium regulation in the body is primarily done in the kidney. In addition to this, hyperkalemia, occurs in approximately 10% of individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with elevated all-cause mortality. Individuals with CKD are often told to restrict dietary potassium (K), however, this recommendation is based on low quality evidence. Reduced quality of life, limited dietary choices and nutritional deficiencies are all potential negative outcomes that may occur when restricting dietary K in CKD patients. There is a need for randomized controlled trials investigating the impact of dietary K modification on serum K concentrations in people with CKD.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A randomized 2-period crossover design comparing a liberalized K fruit and vegetable diet where participants will be required to consume ~ 3500 mg of dietary K daily, to a standard K restricted diet where participants will be required to consume &lt; 2000 mg of dietary K daily. All participants will begin on a liberalized K run-in period for 2 weeks where they will receive fruit and vegetables home deliveries and for safety will have clinical chemistry, including serum potassium measurements taken after 1 week. Participants will then be randomized into either liberalized K or standard K diet for six weeks and then crossover to the other intervention for another 6 weeks after a 2-week washout period.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">30 male and female CKD outpatients, ≥ 18 years of age, who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 15 and 45 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and serum K between 4.5 and 5.5 mEq/L. This design would have greater than 80% power to detect a difference of 0.35 mEq/L serum K between groups. Anthropometric measurements, clinical chemistry, dietary recalls, physical function assessments, as well as a quality of life assessments will also be measured in this trial. These findings will provide high quality evidence for, or against, recommendations for dietary K restriction in individuals living with CKD. The removal of K restriction could provide individuals living with CKD more dietary choice leading to improved dietary status and quality of life.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p id="Par5">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern with rising incidence and prevalence worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than one in ten Canadians suffer from CKD, and it is currently a leading contributor to global morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To help slow CKD progression, optimal management includes interventions such as blood pressure control, RAASi, and SGLT2i therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Equally as important are management of its complications, which include anemia, metabolic acidosis, mineral bone disorder and hyperkalemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par6">The kidney is the primary site of potassium (K) regulation in the body. Hyperkalemia, elevated serum K (sK) occurs in approximately 10% of individuals living with CKD and is associated with elevated all-cause mortality. Hyperkalemia may result from many factors that influence both internal and external K regulation. Comorbid conditions commonly found in patients with CKD such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic acidosis, as well as the use of RAASi and K sparing diuretics, are associated with hyperkalemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Potassium binders exist, but they are poorly tolerated, can cause rare but fatal gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], have insufficient long-term data and there is poor access for most Canadians due to cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia, individuals living with CKD are often recommended to restrict dietary K (dK). A systematic review and meta-analyses done in 2019 showed that the recommendation to restrict dietary K is based on very-low quality evidence, mostly epidemiological studies and a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving individuals living with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who received only manufactured liquid diets with low K concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While the review authors concluded that it is prudent to continue to restrict dK based on low-quality evidence, definitive trials are needed to determine if dK restrictions lowers sK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par7">Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are also typically rich in K as well as other minerals, vitamins and fiber, and are a source of dietary bicarbonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. High K diets, where the K is from fruit and vegetables, are associated with health benefits, including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regrettably, due to the K content fruit and vegetable intake is often reduced when dK is restricted. The benefit of restricting high K fruit and vegetables in terms of sK lowering may not be guaranteed because high K fruit and vegetables often contain carbohydrate, which promotes insulin secretion and K uptake into cells, therefore the impact of different sources of dK influence sK concentrations is not always predictable. Additionally, dK restrictions can negatively impact quality of life, dietary choices and may put participants at risk of nutritional deficiencies such as decreased calcium, therefore it is essential that such a restriction should be based on good quality evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is a clear need for high quality RCTs investigating the impact of dK modification on sK concentrations in individuals living with CKD.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par8">The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the impact and safety of dK liberalization with fruit and vegetables on sK concentrations and to monitor the effects it may have on their physical function and overall quality of life in patients with CKD.</p>
                <p id="Par9">For this trial, our primary hypothesis is that liberalization of dietary K intake, via the provision of higher K fruit and vegetables will be non-inferior to the standard recommended CKD diet in terms of change in sK concentrations. We also hypothesize that liberalization of dietary K will improve self-reported quality of life and lower blood pressure.</p>

The following information will be recorded: description, date of onset and end date, severity, assessment of relatedness to trial intervention. Follow-up information should be provided as necessary. In case any adverse event is reported, patients will be offered to be seen in the next available clinic visit or within one week, whichever is earlier, and will continue to be followed in the clinic until the AE is resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The severity of events will be assessed on the following scale: 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. AEs considered related to the trial intervention as judged by the Qualified Investigator will be followed either until resolution or the event is considered stable. In case AEs result in withdrawn from the trial, the patients that are withdrawn due to adverse treatment reaction will also be followed by the CKD clinic until the AEs has resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

This study will also help increase our understanding of how dietary restrictions are implemented and the effects these restritions can have on people’s quality of life. The findings of this study may also help inform other dietary interventions in CKD, such as the use of fruit and vegetables as dietary bicarbonate sources in the treatment of metabolic acidosis, for which the perceived risk of hyperkalemia may be a barrier for practioners and people living with CKD.</p>
