              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Obesity is a significant global health concern.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Despite advances in pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for obesity and related comorbidities, bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for severe obesity.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In addition to reducing metabolic disease, it reduces mortality in patients with severe obesity.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, 11% to 22% of patients experienced suboptimal weight loss within the first 2 years after surgery, and 10% or greater weight regain was reported by 23% and 72% of patients at 1 year and 5 years after surgery, respectively.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Weight regain is a major challenge facing bariatric teams. A systematic review identified 5 categories of risk factors associated with weight regain: temporal, anatomical, genetic, dietary, and psychiatric factors.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Binge eating, loss-of-control eating, emotional eating, food urges, larger portion sizes, and anxiety were the modifiable dietary and psychiatric risk factors most consistently associated with weight regain.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, an additional review suggested that the most common factors associated with weight regain were dysregulated or maladaptive eating behaviors, lifestyle factors, life stresses, and depressive symptoms.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that post–bariatric surgery eating psychopathology was associated with weight regain<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and showed an association between depression and disordered eating, lower mental quality of life, and weight regain.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given that weight regain has been associated with recurrence of medical comorbidities and deterioration in quality of life,<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> developing efficacious psychosocial interventions that target risk factors and prevent or reverse weight regain is imperative.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Several studies have examined the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving disordered eating and psychological distress before and after bariatric surgery. Concerning timing of psychosocial interventions, those delivered before bariatric surgery did not yield sustained benefits in improved disordered eating, psychological distress, or weight loss after bariatric surgery compared with surgery alone.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Psychosocial interventions delivered 1 year after surgery were likely associated with improved disordered eating and psychological distress<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and potentially mitigation of significant weight regain, although the current evidence for weight loss outcomes is mixed.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A systematic review that included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for disordered eating in adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery identified a total of 7 studies (2 preoperative and 5 postoperative studies), with the largest study sample consisting of 117 patients.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Findings from this systematic review included support for short-term reductions in eating pathology before and after surgery; however, it was noted that there were a small number of RCTs and that additional longitudinal studies are needed.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Moreover, only 2 of the postsurgery psychosocial interventions used web-based modules, telephone communication, or videoconferencing, which has expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Larger, multisite RCTs that are exclusively virtual have not been published to date, to our knowledge.</p>
              <p>This multisite RCT sought to determine the efficacy of a telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (tele-CBT) intervention delivered 1 year after bariatric surgery in improving weight loss, disordered eating (ie, binge eating and emotional eating), and psychological distress (ie, depressive and anxiety symptoms) at 1.5 years after surgery compared with a treatment-as-usual control group (ie, standard postoperative bariatric care). Our study reports initial outcomes (ie, first follow-up period at 1.5 years after surgery) of an RCT with a follow-up period extending to 3 years after surgery. Primary hypotheses were that the tele-CBT group would report greater weight loss and greater improvements in psychosocial functioning (ie, binge eating, emotional eating, depression, and anxiety) compared with the control group.</p>

                <title>Study Setting</title>
                <p>Patients were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital Bariatric Centre of Excellence (TWH-BCOE), Humber River Hospital Bariatric Surgery Program (HRH-BSP), and Ottawa Hospital Bariatric Centre of Excellence (TOH-BCOE) between February 2018 and December 2021. To be accepted into the TWH-BCOE, HRH-BSP, or TOH-BCOE, patients were required to be 18 years or older with a preoperative body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 40 or greater or a BMI of 35 or greater with at least 1 obesity-related comorbidity. All patients underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were eligible to participate in the study if they were 1 year after bariatric surgery, fluent in English, and had access to a telephone and a computer with internet connection to complete questionnaires. Study exclusion criteria included active suicidal ideation or poorly controlled severe psychiatric illness (eg, current psychosis) that would preclude a patient’s ability to engage in tele-CBT sessions.</p>

                <title>Study Procedures</title>
                <p>The study used a 2-group RCT design. Patients were screened by the research coordinator (S.E.L.) to determine their study eligibility. Patients self-reported race and ethnicity in a single question during the baseline questionnaire. Options were Aboriginal (eg, Inuit, Metis, or North American Indian), Arab or West Asian (eg, Armenian, Egyptian, Iranian, or Lebanese), Black (eg, African, Haitian, Jamaican, or Somali), East Asian (eg, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), Latin American, South Asian, Southeast Asian, White, or other (patients typed in their own responses). Race and ethnicity were assessed given that most bariatric surgery programs have predominantly White populations (approximately 80%). We would possibly like to assess in a subanalysis whether race and ethnicity may be a predictor of treatment response for our intervention. This would also help to identify if there are any gaps in our intervention to inform future studies on better ways to adapt the intervention for more marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Participants completed a series of questionnaires at baseline (1 year after surgery; time 1 [T1]) and were subsequently randomized 1:1 to the tele-CBT or treatment-as-usual control group. Open randomization was used, with permuted blocks of sizes 4 and 6 and stratification by site. The randomization sequence was generated in R statistical software version 3.4.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and implemented initially through a custom web-based application, then switched to a manual reveal of allocations for the final few months of participant randomization given that the application was no longer supported. This was an unblinded study. Participants randomized to the control group received standard bariatric care, which included access to and ongoing monitoring by their multidisciplinary bariatric surgery team, including a dietitian, social worker, and psychologist, psychiatrist, or both. Participants randomized to the tele-CBT group received the intervention described subsequently. All participants completed the same questionnaires online using Qualtrics survey software version February 2018 to December 2021 (Qualtrics) after the intervention (approximately 15 months after surgery; time 2 [T2]) and at 3-month follow-up (approximately 18 months after surgery; hereafter, <italic>follow-up</italic>; time 3 [T3]). The total time interval was 12 weeks between the baseline and postintervention questionnaire and 24 weeks between the baseline and follow-up questionnaire.

Sessions were conducted by 5 clinical psychology doctoral students with experience in the assessment and treatment of patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Study therapists received clinical supervision from a registered clinical psychologist (S.E.C.) and had biweekly group supervision.</p>
                <p>The tele-CBT intervention includes setting goals, identifying and planning for difficult eating scenarios, planning pleasurable activities as an alternative to overeating, reducing vulnerability to overeating by challenging negative thoughts and solving problems, and scheduling healthy meals and snacks at regular intervals. Participants completed worksheets between sessions and implemented skills taught during sessions. The final booster session allowed participants to review skills they had learned, develop a relapse-prevention plan, and troubleshoot any issues that arose.</p>

                  <p>Participants weighed themselves in pounds or kilograms and sent in an image of their scale to report their weight at baseline, after intervention, and at follow-up. Postoperative percentage total weight loss was calculated using the following formula: percentage total weight loss = ([baseline weight in kilograms − postintervention or follow-up weight in kilograms]/baseline weight in kilograms) × 100. Weight outcomes were calculated using participant-reported weight at baseline rather than presurgery weight to determine whether the tele-CBT intervention was efficacious in affecting weight outcomes and to eliminate the surgery itself as a factor for weight loss.</p>

Scores on the BES range from 0 to 46, with moderate and severe levels of binge eating corresponding to cutoff scores of 18 and 27, respectively. At a cutoff point of greater than 17, the BES has a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 75%.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The EES is a 25-item self-report measure that assesses a person’s tendency to cope with negative affect through eating. The scale ranges from 0 (no desire) to 4 (overwhelming urge) and consists of questions that ask participants to rate the intensity of their urges to eat in response to 25 emotions. The EES comprises 3 subscales that reflect eating in response to anger or frustration, anxiety, and depression. Both scales have been used in bariatric surgery populations to detect changes in eating psychopathology after surgery.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>

                <p>In previous research on the impact of calorie-restricted dietary interventions that included CBT programs, weight loss was typically in the range of 7.5% to 10%.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Discussion with bariatric surgeons has indicated that a difference of 5% in weight loss would be impressive enough to warrant a program to implement CBT. In our clinic data among 191 patients, we found that the mean weight at 2 years after surgery was 92 kg, the Pearson correlation between 1- and 2-year weights was 0.8, and the between-patient SD at 1-year and 2-year was 21 kg. A 5% difference in weight at 2 years (equivalently, a difference in 1- to 2-year weight change equal to 5% of the 2-year weight) is a clinically important difference and translates to approximately 4.5 kg. With a type I error rate of 5%, if the true difference in weights between control and tele-CBT groups at 2 years is 4.5 kg, a sample size of 124 individuals per group gives 80% power in an analysis of covariance with 1 year weight as the covariate. Anticipating up to 30% loss to follow-up or withdrawal between 1 and 2 years, it was determined that 175 participants would be enrolled per group.</p>

                <p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows version 24.0 (IBM). Analyses adhered to the intent-to-treat principle. Participant characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics, including means, SDs, frequencies, and proportions. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether continuous outcomes were normally distributed. Nonnormally distributed outcomes were log(x) or log(x + 1) transformed for analysis. Linear mixed models with random intercepts were generated for each outcome variable, with fixed effects of group (control and tele-CBT), time (baseline, after intervention, and follow-up), and group-by-time interaction. For reporting, estimated means and SEs from mixed models were back-transformed to their original units as: exp(mean log) ± exp(mean log) × (exp(SE log)-1) or exp(mean log) − 1 ± exp(mean log) × (exp(SE log) − 1) for log(x) or log(x + 1) transformations, respectively (based on the Delta method<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>). Data were analyzed from January to February 2023.</p>

                <p>Participant flow is detailed in the flowchart in <xref rid="zoi230781f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Of 314 patients who consented to participate, 306 individuals (97.5%) completed the baseline questionnaire and were randomized to the tele-CBT (152 participants) or control (154 participants) group. Of the remaining participants, 3 individuals did not respond to calls or emails, 2 individuals dropped out due to time constraints, and 3 individuals were excluded due to screening results. After randomization, 56 participants (18.3%) discontinued from the study, with 23 participants being lost to follow-up and the remaining 33 participants choosing to discontinue due to time constraints, not benefiting from the study, or general disinterest to continue. Of these 56 participants, 31 participants were in the tele-CBT group; 23 of these participants dropped out during the tele-CBT intervention. Of 152 participants in the tele-CBT intention-to-treat group, 127 individuals (83.6%) completed the tele-CBT intervention. A total of 123 patients (80.9%) completed both treatment and 1.5-year postsurgery follow-up. For the actual enrollment of 152 and 154 participants, the statistical power of the final sample was 87.6%.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Disordered eating and psychological distress are well-documented risk factors associated with weight regain after bariatric surgery. This multisite RCT sought to test the efficacy of a tele-CBT intervention targeting these risk factors 1 year after surgery in weight loss outcomes 1.5 years after surgery. To our knowledge, this is the largest RCT examining psychosocial interventions to support patients after bariatric surgery. Contrary to our hypothesis, the tele-CBT and control groups did not significantly differ in percentage weight loss at 1.5 years after surgery. However, the tele-CBT group did demonstrate significant improvements in binge eating, emotional eating, and depressive and anxiety symptoms immediately after the intervention, and these improvements were maintained at 3 months after the intervention (1.5 years after bariatric surgery).</p>
              <p>The study showed a high engagement rate in tele-CBT at 1 year after surgery, with 123 patients (80.9%) completing both the treatment and the 1.5-year postsurgery follow-up, and a high engagement rate of the intervention itself, with a completion rate of 127 participants (83.6%) for tele-CBT. Given the high attrition rates related to follow-up after bariatric surgery and the expansion of virtual psychosocial interventions for patients who underwent bariatric surgery, the high acceptability of treatment and retention of patients in this telephone-delivered psychological intervention is noteworthy.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although tele-CBT did not significantly improve weight loss outcomes at 1.5 years after surgery in comparison with standard bariatric surgery aftercare, it did significantly improve disordered eating and psychological distress. Tele-CBT and control groups had BES, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 scores below the threshold of clinical significance. Despite this outcome, the tele-CBT group reported statistically significant improvement in these variables compared with the control group across time. Postoperative disordered eating behaviors, such as loss of control over eating, were found to be associated with attenuated weight loss outcomes and weight regain after bariatric surgery.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Rates of loss of control over eating are estimated to range from 10% to 39% at 2-year postsurgery follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Therefore, results of this multisite RCT provide further evidence for the efficacy of this intervention in treating disordered eating after bariatric surgery, which could potentially improve weight loss and mitigate weight regain long term.</p>
              <p>The tele-CBT intervention also improved anxiety and depressive symptoms. A deterioration in postsurgery mental health–related quality of life has been negatively associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptoms.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230781r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> A longitudinal study assessing depressive symptoms and weight outcomes over a 7-year period reported that the trajectory characterized by initial reductions in depressive symptoms was associated with the greatest weight loss.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The group recommended the first postoperative year as a key intervention period, noting that early improvement in depression may be associated with longer-term weight outcomes.<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Furthermore, 7-year data from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Consortium<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggest that having a postoperative mood disorder may be associated with weight regain.</p>
              <sec id="H2-9-ZOI230781">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Study strengths included the multisite RCT study design, standard postoperative bariatric care control group, large sample size, high retention rate, and psychometrically sound outcome measures that have been commonly used in bariatric populations. This study also has several limitations. These included the short-term postintervention follow-up, which may have limited our ability to observe treatment effects on weight loss outcomes. Additionally, energy intake and expenditure were not collected and were not part of this intervention, which may explain why there were no changes in short-term weight loss outcomes given that no caloric-restricted dietary intervention was used. Data collection extending to 3 years after surgery is still in progress and may help determine whether improvements in disordered eating and psychological distress are maintained over time and lead to better weight outcomes 3 years after surgery. Moreover, patients at 1 year after surgery in this RCT may still be too early in their postbariatric surgery journey to experience significant risks of weight regain, and future studies could examine the effects of tele-CBT delivered beyond the first 2 years after surgery. Additionally, bariatric centers of excellence included in this multisite RCT offered routine postsurgery care in which behavioral health support from a dietitian, social worker, and psychologist, psychiatrist, or both was part of the care provided by the interprofessional team. The standard postoperative model of care received by the control group may not be the standard in all countries and practice contexts, and this additional integrated support may have provided sufficient support to attenuate weight loss outcome differences between tele-CBT and control groups. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that significant differences were observed in disordered eating and psychological distress symptoms between groups despite the standard care control groups’ access to behavioral health supports. Future studies should examine the efficacy of this intervention in other contexts with different models of care. The intervention could be more scalable by developing an online training program to teach bariatric clinicians how to deliver the CBT protocol and by developing a user-friendly patient workbook to share with patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Previous research has found group CBT to be associated with improved disordered eating among patients who underwent bariatric surgery,<sup><xref rid="zoi230781r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and that may be another avenue for increasing access to this intervention. Additionally, study inclusion criteria did not require patients to have current disordered eating or psychological distress (eg, some patients who experienced preoperative binge eating set goals of developing habits and learning coping skills to prevent the recurrence of binge eating), which may underestimate the potential effect of tele-CBT on these psychosocial and weight loss outcomes. Future studies should recruit patients with clinically significant depression and binge eating to determine the efficacy of the intervention in populations at higher risk of weight regain.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Although tele-CBT did not affect short-term weight outcomes, the intervention demonstrated significant reductions in eating psychopathology, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms after bariatric surgery in the largest RCT to date, to our knowledge. These findings support the Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guidelines, which shift the focus of obesity care to health and quality of life outcomes rather than weight loss alone. Our tele-CBT intervention had a high retention rate as a virtual intervention to support patients after bariatric surgery and may have the potential to address weight regain long term by mitigating disordered eating and mental health risks factors.</p>
