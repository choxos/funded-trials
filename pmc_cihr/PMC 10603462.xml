                  <p>Despite the high mortality rates in long-term care (LTC) homes, most do not have a formalised palliative programme. Hence, our research team has developed the Strengthening a Palliative Approach in Long Term Care (SPA-LTC) programme.

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A cross-jurisdictional, effectiveness-implementation type II hybrid cluster randomised control trial design will be used to assess the SPA-LTC programme for 18 LTC homes (six homes within each of three provinces). Randomisation will occur at the level of the LTC home within each province, using a 1:1 ratio (three homes in the intervention and control groups). Baseline staff surveys will take place over a 3-month period at the beginning for both the intervention and control groups. The intervention group will then receive facilitated training and education for staff, and residents and their family members will participate in the SPA-LTC programme. Postintervention data collection will be conducted in a similar manner as in the baseline period for both groups. The overall target sample size will be 594 (297 per arm, 33 resident/family member participants per home, 18 homes). Data collection and analysis will involve organisational, staff, resident and family measures. The primary outcome will be a binary measure capturing any emergency department use in the last 6 months of life (resident); with secondary outcomes including location of death (resident), satisfaction and decisional conflict (family), knowledge and confidence implementing a palliative approach (staff), along with implementation outcomes (ie, feasibility, reach, fidelity and perceived sustainability of the SPA-LTC programme). The primary outcome will be analysed via multivariable logistic regression using generalised estimating equations. Intention-to-treat principles will be used in the analysis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>As the population ages, more people are likely to die in long-term care (LTC) homes. In Canada, annual mortality rates of residents in LTC range from 27% to 52.3%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Research has shown that care for the dying is suboptimal in LTC with the lack of attention given to advance care planning (ACP) and issues of loss, grief and bereavement, and unnecessary emergency department (ED) use.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> Many challenges to caring for dying residents and their families have been identified; including staff discomfort and uncertainty about how and when to initiate early discussions about goals of care; lack of training and capacity building for staff, particularly unregulated staff (who provide the majority of bedside care); high rates of cognitive impairment among residents; and a failure to identify impending death.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> As a result, clinical decision-making becomes challenging for LTC residents who often have multiple comorbidities, and where prognostication is challenging.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Unfortunately, failure to proactively and pre-emptively discuss and identify end-of-life (EOL) issues in LTC creates added stress and burden for family and staff.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 9</xref></p>
              <p>A palliative approach promotes a seamless transition from admission to LTC to EOL, beginning with ACP to activate critical communication early with residents and families so that decisions regarding EOL care can be made.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> To implement a palliative approach, developing opportunities for education and improving staff’s capacity to communicate with families and residents are fundamental.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Pilot evaluation of Comfort Care Rounds (CCRs) in an interdisciplinary group of staff in LTC showed that staff reported: (a) new learning about palliative care; (b) improved communication among staff members; (c) increased confidence in providing palliative and EOL care; (d) empowered personal support workers/aides; (e) provided opportunities for debriefing and reflection; and (f) increased awareness and use of palliative care human resources.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref></p>
              <p>Despite the high mortality rates in LTC, most LTC homes do not have a formalised palliative programme. Hence, our research team has developed the Strengthening a Palliative Approach in Long Term Care (SPA-LTC) programme.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It consists of the following core, evidence-informed components: (a) an interdisciplinary Palliative Champion Team (PCT) (to provide leadership, support implementation and sustainability), (b) CCRs among staff (for capacity building and reflection), (c) informational pamphlets (to help prepare residents and families better as their condition/disease progresses), (d) Palliative Care Conferences (PCCs) (to strengthen relationships between residents, families and staff and discuss changes in health and planning for EOL care) and (e) postbereavement follow-up (for residents, families and staff).</p>
              <p>Recent pilot work involved developing a variety of tools and practices to help implement the SPA-LTC programme by exploring: (a) resident and family needs within a palliative approach to care<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and related staff knowledge gaps,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> (b) quality improvement strategies to reduce ED use at EOL,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (c) strategies to provide education and support to residents and families soon after admission to LTC using pamphlets,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and later on when EOL is near by holding PCCs<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and offering bereavement support.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Most recently, pilot findings of the SPA-LTC programme using a pre-post design have shown: (a) a 55% reduction in ED visits and 21% decrease in inappropriate ED visits at EOL,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> (b) increased family satisfaction, (c) 67% of residents and family members are more comfortable with exploring ACP issues after reading a pamphlet<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and (d) 82% of participating residents (and their families) had a PCC before they died. However, there have been no large-scale clinical trials conducted in Canada to evaluate a programme, such as SPA-LTC; research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of SPA-LTC using a more rigorous design (ie, randomised control trial (RCT)) to inform decisions regarding widespread use and scaling up.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref></p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The goal of the proposed study is to examine: (a) the implementation (feasibility, reach, fidelity, adaptability, sustainability) and (b) effectiveness (ED use in the last 6 months of life (primary), location of death, family satisfaction and decisional conflict, staff knowledge and confidence implementing a palliative approach) of the SPA-LTC programme.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>We will use a cross-jurisdictional, effectiveness-implementation type II hybrid cluster RCT design<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> to assess the SPA-LTC programme. The implementation component is designed as a formative evaluation to explore how to adapt the SPA-LTC programme in real time. The effectiveness component is designed to achieve the goals of comparative effectiveness research: (a) informing clinical and policy decisions, (b) comparing the intervention to usual care, (c) employing patient-relevant outcome measures and (d) conducting the trial in real-world settings. It was decided to randomise at the level of the LTC home within the province, to avoid contamination of the control group. Hybrid type II designs provide a more direct blending of effectiveness and implementation research to support more rapid translation and are best suited when there is ‘implementation momentum’ within the clinical system.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The effectiveness component is designed to achieve the goals of comparative effectiveness research which includes: (a) informing clinical and policy decisions; (b) comparing the intervention to usual care; (c) employing patient-relevant outcome measures; and (d) conducting the trial in real-world settings.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2) tool was used to design the trial, with emphasis on maximising pragmatism across the tool’s nine domains<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). A pragmatic design was adopted to test the programme in a context that mirrored real world practice as closely as possible, in order to reduce the research-practice gap.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The intervention arm of the study will include a 3-month preintervention period followed by 12 months of intervention and 3 months of follow-up. In the control arm, the 3-month preintervention will be included and the 1-month follow-up will occur 15 months later. In the control arm, research staff will be available for up to 6 months after the follow-up period to provide support for SPA-LTC implementation.</p>

The intervention itself within each site (intervention sites only) will run for 12 months from June 2022 to January 2024.</p>

                <p>A sample size of 18 clusters in the trial (nine clusters per arm, six clusters per province) with an overall sample of 594 (297 per arm) is needed to detect a group difference in the primary outcome (proportion with an ED visit) of 0.40 (intervention) and 0.60 (control). These proportions are based on the effect sizes observed in the pilot study.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This calculation assumes a 95% confidence level, 80% power and an intraclass coefficient no greater than 0.10 for the primary endpoint of interest. We have also based this calculation on our previous pilot work demonstrating that we will be able to recruit a mean of 33 residents/LTC home that has at least 100 residents.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>To recruit resident and family participants in the SPA-LTC programme, we will work with LTC staff at each site to select eligible residents and families based on our inclusion criteria to obtain consent. At baseline, LTC staff will be offered training on the PPS tool. They will then assess the PPS score for all residents in both the intervention and control homes. For those residents who have a PPS score of ≤50%, an LTC staff member will approach the resident (only if resident is able to consent), and their family member/substitute decision maker to invite them to participate in our study. The PPS is a valid and reliable tool used to measure progressive decline in a person suffering from terminal/incurable illness; it can be divided into three stages: stable, 100%–70%; transitional, 60%–40%; EOL, 30%; or less.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> For those LTC homes that are under-resourced, we will offer them the option of using the RAI-MDS CHESS score instead of the PPS since it is routinely completed and will minimise extra study burden. In these cases, we will use a CHESS score of two or greater for recruitment since both the PPS and CHESS scores are comparable.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p>
                <p>The LTC staff will provide the site RA with the contact information of eligible families and residents (where possible) and the RA will contact eligible participants and invite them to participate in the study using the research staff recruitment script. For participant enrolment, if the resident is able to attend the first enrolment meeting, they will be invited to sign a consent form giving research staff permission to access their medical information for chart audit purposes, as well as complete a demographics questionnaire. If the resident is unable to sign on behalf of themselves, their family will sign for research staff to have permission to review the resident’s medical records as part of the family consent form, which also includes a demographics questionnaire and baseline survey. Once recruited we will work closely with staff to implement the SPA-LTC programme.</p>

                <title>Recruitment challenges</title>
                <p>We anticipate that clinical demands on LTC staff will be a challenge, however based on our previous experience we have identified a number of mitigation strategies. Involving staff at all levels will help to overcome these challenges. Additionally, external consultants, such as palliative consultations will help with study implementation, though we recognise that regions are unique in how LTC and palliative consultants are structured and funded. Supporting the development of a PCT will provide each setting with a working group to consult as challenges arise, which will be documented and included in the final tools and reports developed from this project.</p>
                <p>At the resident/family level, our rate of compliance with implementing the individual SPA-LTC components is very good in a pilot study of 39 participants, with 100% of all residents having a PPS completed (39/39) and 81% of family attending a PCC before a resident death (21/26).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Based on our previous work and current death rates in Canadian LTC homes, we anticipate at least a 27% annual death rate.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We will therefore account for this loss in recruitment and to ensure feasibility measures are met.</p>
                <p>At the site level, it is possible that an LTC home may drop out during the study. To mitigate this challenge a staged approach has been developed to implementing the SPA-LTC programme to help offset burden and support staff with the training and skills that are needed to implement it successfully, thereby reducing the likelihood of an intervention home dropping out.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>From the inception of SPA-LTC in 2014, we have actively pursued the involvement of LTC residents, their families, healthcare providers and decision-makers. We have a long-standing commitment to patient and public involvement, starting back in our early pilot studies in 2008 where we interviewed residents and families to get a sense of their needs and preferences. All of the SPA-LTC tools developed have involved residents and/or families, such as receiving feedback after PCCs and adapting them and involving staff in how to best implement them from their perspective. At least four family advisors who have been involved in piloting a family survey will help with reviewing findings and later dissemination.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>At the individual (participant) level, the primary outcome (any ED visit, binary—yes/no) will be analysed via multivariable logistic regression using generalised estimating equations (GEE) to address the non-independence of the data (ie, clustering effects of participants in the same LTC home). GEE is one of two methods (the other—generalised linear mixed methods, or GLMM) used in the analysis of individual-level data in cluster RCTs.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Compared with GLMM, GEE has been shown to perform better for binary outcomes<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and is more conservative.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> GEE model results will be expressed as ORs with corresponding 95% CIs, assume an exchangeable correlation matrix, and employ a small sample adjustment to correct for bias that occurs in estimating the SE when a small number of clusters is used.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55 56</xref> Confounding is not expected to be a significant issue due to randomisation, although cluster randomisation does not necessarily achieve balance on individual-level covariates, thus sites will be compared on key factors and any variables showing large imbalances by randomisation group will be added as covariates to the GEE model. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (2004 for cluster RCTs) recommends that adjustment covariates be prespecified, thus the following covariates will be examined: age, number of chronic conditions, days from randomisation to death, ED visits in the 6 months prior to baseline and cluster-level variables (hospital transfer rate, number/rate of hospital deaths). Intention-to-treat (ITT) will be used, meaning participants will be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised and adjustment for biases arising from missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation (or alternative methods, such as inverse probability weighting) with models including covariates and accounting for the clustered data structure.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Sensitivity analyses will be performed to compare the results with the ITT analysis, and these will consist of a complete case analysis and the testing of key assumptions made in the multiple imputation (or alternate method). The analysis of secondary outcomes will be conducted on individual-level data and use complete case data (no ITT). The analysis method chosen will allow for the clustered nature of the data and be selected based on the data type of the secondary outcome, for example, binary outcome data will use GEE (resulting in ORs) and continuous outcome data will use GLMM (producing mean differences).</p>
                <p>Imputation will be applied to address missing data. Multiple imputation is considered the best method for addressing the most common and realistic missing data patterns seen in RCTs. A range of auxiliary variables will be used in the imputation model to improve accuracy. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using the complete case dataset.</p>
                <p>All quantitative analyses will be done using R V.4.0.2 (2020-06-22), all statistical tests and CIs will be two-sided and assume a 5% level of significance (α=0.05), and reported measures will include p values, CIs and SEs.</p>
                <p>For qualitative data, conventional content analysis will be conducted for all qualitative sources of data including: a careful reading of the transcripts and materials, the development of an initial coding frame, constant comparison between new and existing data to ensure consistency, relevance and comprehensiveness, and the application of final codes to all text with attention to maintaining the ‘trustworthiness’ of findings and promoting triangulation of all data sources.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p>

                <p>The proposed study aims to advance knowledge to improve quality of healthcare for LTC residents and their family members and incorporate a palliative approach into the LTC sector. Reformation of healthcare systems and the delivery of a palliative approach across provinces by supporting key transition points along the living-dying continuum, reducing unnecessary hospital use at EOL and creating a more compassionate and holistic view of EOL care are goals of this study. We also aim to create and apply health-related knowledge to implement a palliative approach in LTC in Canada.</p>
