                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) improves the outcome of experimental necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) by preserving intestinal microcirculation. The feasibility and safety of RIC in preterm infants with NEC are unknown. The study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of RIC in preterm infants with suspected or confirmed NEC.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Phase I non-randomised pilot study conducted in three steps: step A to determine the safe duration of limb ischaemia (up to 4 min); step B to assess the safety of 4 repeated cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion at the maximum tolerated duration of ischaemia determined in step A; step C to assess the safety of applying 4 cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion on two consecutive days.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Four cycles of ischaemia (varying duration) applied to the limb via a manual sphygmomanometer, followed by reperfusion (4 min) and rest (5 min), repeated on two consecutive days.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>The primary outcomes were (1) feasibility defined as RIC being performed as planned in the protocol, and (2) safety defined as perfusion returning to baseline within 4 min after cuff deflation.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Four cycles/day of limb ischaemia (4 min) followed by reperfusion (4 min) and a 5 min gap, repeated on two consecutive days was feasible and safe in all neonates with suspected or confirmed NEC.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This study is pivotal for designing a future randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of RIC in preterm infants with NEC.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common and severe gastrointestinal complications of prematurity. NEC affects 5%–10% of extremely preterm infants and is associated with high mortality (30%–50%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Survivors have increased comorbidity (ie, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, postnatal growth restriction) and neurodevelopment impairment rates compared with preterm infants without NEC.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Current management is based on broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel decompression and rest, analgesia, blood product transfusions and cardiovascular and respiratory support as required.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In case of bowel perforation or clinical deterioration despite the implementation of adequate medical treatment, surgery is indicated.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This has been the standard of care over the last three decades as there have not been significant changes in the management of NEC. However, NEC morbidity and mortality still remain high.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> Therefore, new preventive strategies and therapeutic options are urgently needed.</p>
              <p>Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a manoeuvre that involves application of brief cycles of non-lethal ischaemia and reperfusion to a remote organ/site that conveys protection to distant organs withstanding ischaemic injury. We recently demonstrated that RIC promotes recovery from experimental NEC by reducing intestinal injury, inflammation and enhancing survival.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mechanism of action of RIC in NEC is dependent on improving intestinal microvascular blood flow by the vasodilatory action of hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>RIC has been applied to adults,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> children<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> and neonatal patients &gt;36 weeks of gestational age<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> for different diagnoses. However, it has not been attempted in preterm neonates including those who had NEC, mostly due to concerns regarding feasibility and safety in this vulnerable population. Thus, our objective was to assess the feasibility and safety of RIC in preterm infants with suspected or confirmed NEC. We hypothesised that RIC (up to four cycles of 4 min of ischaemia repeated after 24 hours) would be feasible and safe in this vulnerable population.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Limb ischaemia-reperfusion cycles were applied by placing an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff around a limb, and inflating (until blood flow distal to the cuff was interrupted with no pulse detected by pulse oximetry) and deflating it using a manual sphygmomanometer (Tycos, Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, New York, USA). Before and after each ischaemia-reperfusion cycle, cutaneous integrity and perfusion (colour, capillary refill time) were assessed. The presence of grasp reflex was ascertained immediately before, right after and again 24 hours after RIC. Urine output (mL/kg/hour) during the 24 hours before and 24 hours after RIC was also recorded. Pain was evaluated 30 s after each ischaemic phase and 6 hours after the last RIC cycle using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP score).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> According to the protocol, RIC was due to be stopped if there was no return of limb perfusion on clinical assessment and/or no return of oxygen saturation to baseline values±3% within 4 min in the hand or foot of the limb receiving RIC. If perfusion did not return, the limb was warmed and elevated for 10 min, followed by nitroglycerine patch application and Doppler ultrasound if necessary.</p>
                <p>To determine tolerability of the ischaemia period up to a maximum of 4 min, as well as feasibility of applying repeated cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion on two consecutive days, the study was conducted in three steps.</p>

                <p>RIC was completed according to the protocol in all neonates (14 in the arm and 1 in the leg). Arterial flow and limb perfusion returned to baseline within 4 min in all patients, as confirmed by clinical assessment of limb, return of pulse waveform displayed by pulse-oximetry, return to peripheral oxygen saturation to pre-RIC value (<xref rid="F1 F2 F3" ref-type="fig">figures 1A–3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>) and capillary refill time preservation (<xref rid="F1 F2 F3" ref-type="fig">figures 1B–3B and 3F</xref>). Two enrolled patients died before discharge; however, none of the deaths were attributed to the RIC procedure. One patient died due to septic shock 4 days after RIC and the other died due to multiorgan failure 2 months after RIC.</p>

(D) Urine output (mL/kg/hour) was measured 24 hours before and after RIC. Data are represented as median with range. A two-way analysis of variance with main effects only and post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used to compare pre-RIC and post-RIC oxygen saturation, CRT (s) and PIPP score. A paired non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare pre-RIC and post-RIC urine output (mL/kg/hour). There was no significant difference between pre-RIC and post-RIC values of any of the listed parameters.</p>

There was no significant difference in PIPP score comparing its value before and 6 hours after RIC (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Compared with the assessment before RIC, the PIPP score did not change from ‘no pain’ or ‘mild-to-moderate’ to ‘severe’ pain 6 hours after the last ischaemic cycle. The PIPP score in five neonates (33%) increased from ‘no pain’ to ‘mild-to-moderate’ pain, and in two neonates (13%) decreased from ‘mild-to-moderate’ pain to ‘no pain’. No patient became oligo-anuric (defined as urine output &lt;1 mL/kg/hour) after RIC (<xref rid="F1 F2 F3" ref-type="fig">figures 1D–3D and 3H</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this phase I feasibility and safety trial, we demonstrated that RIC consisting of four consecutive cycles of 4 min ischaemia followed by 4 min reperfusion on two consecutive days is feasible in preterm infants with NEC. No significant adverse events related to RIC were detected. Reperfusion occurred promptly after RIC in all patients without any impairment in vascular flow and no cutaneous, nor nerve injury was observed.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, RIC has not been evaluated in preterm infants with NEC. Eighty-seven per cent of enrolled neonates in this phase I trial were born before 28 weeks gestation and 73% were extremely low birth weight (&lt;1000 g), representing the population at higher risk of NEC. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and safety of RIC in fragile preterm neonates with either suspected or defined medical and surgical NEC, suggesting that RIC is safe and can be applied even during acute illness.</p>
              <p>Prematurity and enteral formula feeding are two of the most important risk factors for NEC.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 8 20 21</xref> Additionally, ischaemia plays a role in both NEC pathogenesis and pathophysiology.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> Physiologically, intestinal blood flow is known to increase above baseline to fulfil the increased intestinal oxygen demand after feeds.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, postprandial hyperaemia is remarkably compromised in premature infants that later developed NEC,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and we have demonstrated that NEC in human preterm infants is associated with impairments in intestinal microcirculation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 20</xref> Furthermore, NEC risk is higher in infants with intrauterine growth restriction and circulatory impairment, respiratory distress syndrome and associated hypoxia requiring surfactant treatment or early onset sepsis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, persistent ductus arteriosus can lead to bowel hypoperfusion<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and is also associated with NEC.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Previous studies on splanchnic circulation using near-infrared spectroscopy showed that regional oxygen saturation is lower, especially after feeds in babies who later developed NEC.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 27</xref> Lastly, at the disease onset, local bowel inflammation is associated with impaired microcirculation which leads to bowel wall ischaemia and eventually transmural necrosis.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In fact, patched coagulative necrosis (a marker of ischaemia) is the main pathological finding in NEC patients, and hypoxia markers like hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and glucose transporter 1 are elevated in NEC intestinal resection specimens.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p>
              <p>Considering the role of ischaemia in NEC, modulating the immature intestinal microvasculature could prove to be a viable strategy to counteract the feeding-induced hypoxia and prevent the progression of NEC. For this reason, we evaluated RIC, a manoeuvre which can improve the blood supply to the intestine. RIC involves application of brief cycles of ischaemia and reperfusion to a limb to protect distant organs from sustained ischaemic damage—in this case the intestine. Prior to the current trial, experimental studies performed by our group demonstrated that RIC induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation, preserved bowel microcirculation and reduced gut injury and mortality due to NEC.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>RIC implies inflating a standard blood pressure cuff around a limb, aiming to interrupt distal arterial blood supply to produce transient skeletal muscle ischaemia. To assess safety of this procedure in the study population, potential complications/side effects were monitored including limb ischaemia, peripheral nerve damage, pain and change in urinary output.</p>
              <p>First, limb ischaemia is a potential complication of peripheral or central arterial lines in neonates. Vascular obstruction is known to present as a pale and poorly perfused limb distal to the occluded point. We assumed RIC could have induced persistent limb ischaemia after cuff deflation secondary to arterial thrombosis or vasospasm. To prove this was not the case, limb perfusion was continuously monitored during the procedure and cautiously assessed after RIC, both visually and with pulse oximetry. During RIC, the limb became dusky (venous congestion), and the pulse wave was lost due to total arterial compression as expected and desired. Once the blood pressure cuff was deflated, we observed rapid reperfusion, usually with evident hyperaemia in visual inspection. Capillary refill time was assessed before and after every ischaemia cycle to quantify limb perfusion and always recovered within 4 min.</p>
              <p>Second, to assess peripheral nerve integrity, palmar or plantar grasp reflex (depending on the limb used) was assessed before and after RIC as it is a useful clinical marker of potential nerve ischaemic injury involving both sensorial and motor fibres.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The grasp reflex was preserved in all patients.</p>
              <p>Third, RIC requires limb compression with pressure above systolic pressure affecting venous blood return and potentially leading to microhaemorrhage (petechiae, ecchymosis, bruising) and/or skin breakdown in this vulnerable patient population. However, none of the neonates developed cutaneous bleeding or changes in skin integrity after RIC.</p>
              <p>Forth, pain has also been related to worsening neurodevelopment in preterm infants.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> NEC is a cause of pain, making it challenging to separate pain due to NEC from that due to RIC. To add objectivity to our prospective evaluation, pain was assessed before and after RIC using the validated PIPP score.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There was no development of persistent or severe pain after RIC, and in none of the neonates, the RIC manoeuvre was discontinued due to pain.</p>
              <p>At last, in theory, muscle ischaemia could have led to muscle necrosis and rhabdomyolysis.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The most severe potential complication of rhabdomyolysis is oliguric acute kidney injury secondary to renal tubules obstruction with myoglobin affecting &gt;50% of them. We did not find any difference in urine output 24 hours before and after RIC and none of the neonates studied became oligo-anuric after RIC. Moreover, without significant renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis is a self-resolving transient condition.</p>
              <p>Two of our patients died, none of them of causes directly related to RIC but due to the underlying disease. Indeed, the study’s mortality was not higher than the mortality of NEC in preterm infants. Although there is no evidence of harm in this phase I preliminary trial, there may be beneficial or detrimental effects that can only become apparent in larger phase II–III trials. We acknowledge that the small sample size of the present study, although typical of phase I trials, did not allow us to rule out other potential complications. Specifically, the possibility that reactive oxygen metabolites can cause reperfusion injury in other organs and may worsen chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity or other complications of prematurity, as well as potential effects of RIC on long-term neurological development will have to be assessed in future phase II and III trials.</p>
              <p>RIC is simply performed by inflating and deflating a blood pressure cuff, similar to blood pressure measurement, and can be performed with minimal invasiveness and cost in preterm neonates with NEC, making it potentially applicable worldwide.</p>
