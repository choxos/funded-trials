                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Women with obesity are at a higher risk of infertility as well as gestational and neonatal complications. Lifestyle changes are universally recommended for women with obesity seeking fertility treatments, but such intervention has only been assessed in very few robust studies. This study’s objectives are therefore to assess the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention (the Fit-For-Fertility Programme; FFFP) targeting women with obesity and subfertility in a diverse population.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will include 616 women with obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or ≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with polycystic ovary syndrome or at-risk ethnicities) who are evaluated at a Canadian fertility clinic for subfertility. Women will be randomised either to (1) the FFFP (experimental arm) alone for 6 months, and then in combination with usual care for infertility if not pregnant; or (2) directly to usual fertility care (control arm). Women in the intervention group benefit from the programme up to 18 months or, if pregnant, up to 24 months or the end of the pregnancy (whichever comes first). Women from both groups are evaluated every 6 months for a maximum of 18 months. The primary outcome is live birth rate at 24 months. Secondary outcomes include fertility, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes; lifestyle and anthropometric measures; and cost-effectiveness.

                <title>Women with obesity and infertility</title>
                <p>Infertility affects approximately 10%–15% of couples in Canada and the rest of North America.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to the International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, infertility is ‘a disease characterised by the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse or due to an impairment of a person’s capacity to reproduce either as an individual or with his/her partner’.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For the purpose of this study, subfertility is defined as an infertility with a reasonable probability of spontaneous pregnancy without medical intervention, which excludes couples with sterility or severe infertility (such as bilateral irreversible tubal factor or severe male factor). Medically assisted reproduction (MAR), including ovulation induction, ovarian stimulation, intrauterine insemination and assisted reproductive technology (ART)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> are part of the current clinical management of infertility and have become more and more used and effective in helping infertile couples to achieve a pregnancy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Unfortunately, these procedures are costly and carry risks for both women and infants. These risks can occur at different stages of ART: ovarian stimulation (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, thromboembolism and ovarian torsion), oocyte retrieval (infection and bleeding) and early pregnancy (ectopic or heterotopic pregnancy, and multiple gestations<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although these risks are rare, they can have significant consequences. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that ART procedures may have negative neonatal consequences, such as higher frequencies of alterations in DNA methylation patterns associated with DNA imprinting disorders in children conceived through ART.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
                <p>Obesity (defined operationally as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), is a known modifiable risk factor associated with female infertility<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the population affected worldwide is high enough for obesity to be recognised as a global epidemic by the WHO since 2000.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The prevalence of obesity has been estimated to be as high as 30% in Canadian and 38% in American populations, respectively.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> More precisely, 21% of Canadian women of reproductive age had obesity in 2015.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Women who plan to get pregnant are currently more likely to be affected by obesity,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which can significantly affect their fertility. For instance, a very large cohort study including more than 40 000 couples estimated that women with obesity display a 78% higher risk of having infertility compared with women with a normal BMI (18.50–24.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (OR with 95% CI: 1.78 (1.63 to 1.95)).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Women with obesity are also more likely to develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is the leading cause of anovulatory infertility, affecting 6%–10% of women of childbearing age.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, a higher BMI has been associated with reduced pregnancy rates even in women with ovulatory cycles, equating to a 4% decrease in pregnancy rate per kg/m<sup>2</sup> of BMI increase in women with a BMI ≥29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
                <p>Moreover, studies assessing MAR procedures have reported that women with obesity: (i) require higher doses and a longer duration of clomiphene<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and gonadotrophins<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref> to achieve ovulation, (ii) display a lower pregnancy rate per cycle<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and (iii) are at a higher risk of cycle cancellation<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 18</xref> and miscarriage.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Obesity also increases the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section and intrauterine death.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> In keeping with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease paradigm, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and excessive gestational weight gain are consistently associated with the early development of obesity and diabetes in the offspring.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Obesity in childhood is closely linked to adult obesity,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> perpetuating the intergenerational cycle of obesity.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref> Adopting a healthy lifestyle before conception and restoring a healthy metabolic environment early during pregnancy likely represents the best approach to break the vicious circle of intergenerational propagation of obesity and diabetes.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, targeting women with obesity prior to conception may be essential to reduce the burden of infertility and MAR costs, as well as obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in our societies.</p>

                <title>Infertility management in women with obesity seeking fertility treatments</title>
                <p>To prevent the adverse effects of obesity on female fertility and on gestational and neonatal health, many organisations have recommended that women with obesity should be assisted, before conception, to lose weight (5%–10% of their initial weight) and adopt a healthy lifestyle, and maintain that healthy lifestyle during pregnancy.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30–33</xref> Results from a recent systematic review support lifestyle modification prior to ART in women with overweight or obesity.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The authors pointed out that despite the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the area, pre-conception weight loss in women with overweight or obesity can help improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Out of the seven RCTs assessing non-surgical methods of weight loss, including some form of lifestyle intervention, the most methodologically rigorous study was a RCT published in the <italic toggle="yes">New England Journal of Medicine</italic> in 2016.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This study compared 287 women with obesity and subfertility who were randomised to a 6-month structured lifestyle intervention (including six outpatient visits and four telephone consultations with a nurse or dietician) and 285 women assigned to prompt fertility treatments. The lifestyle intervention lasted only 6 months and was not continued during fertility treatments or pregnancy. After a follow-up of 24 months, the lifestyle programme did not improve the live birth rate, but resulted in a significant increase in the rate of spontaneous pregnancies (rate ratio (95% confidence): 1.61 (1.16 to 2.24)) and reduced the need for fertility treatments (rate ratio (95% confidence): 0.78 (0.70 to 0.86)).<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In a follow-up article, the same group of authors observed, from a hospital perspective, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €15 845 per additional point of percentage in the healthy live birth rate resulting from the lifestyle programme compared with usual care. The authors concluded that their intervention may be deemed as cost-effective, especially for longer follow-up timelines, in anovulatory women, women who completed the study or women ≥36 years of age.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</p>
                <p>Interestingly, in a survey asking women with obesity or overweight and considering pregnancy if they were interested in adopting a healthier lifestyle prior to conception, 91% reported their willingness to participate in a lifestyle programme.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, despite the patients’ motivation and the international recommendations to encourage women to optimise their lifestyle before starting fertility treatments, most women with obesity do not have access to such targeted lifestyle programmes integrated within their fertility care. Therefore, our objective is to give these women access to the Fit-For-Fertility Programme (FFFP), an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention, integrated into the fertility clinic care pathway. This programme supports participants in adopting sustainable healthy behaviours, in pre-conception, throughout fertility treatments and during pregnancy. In response to the national priority to improve the quality and costs of reproductive and perinatal care established by our <italic toggle="yes">Canadian network on reproductive and maternal health of women with obesity and infertility</italic>, we will conduct a multicentre RCT assessing the FFFP in women with subfertility and obesity.</p>

                <title>Research question and hypotheses</title>
                <p>For this RCT, our research question is: Compared with usual care, does the FFFP cost-effectively improve (i) the live birth rate and other fertility outcomes and (ii) pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, in women with obesity and subfertility who seek fertility treatments. We hypothesise that in comparison to prompt initiation of usual fertility care, participation in the FFFP, alone for 6 months and then in combination with usual care for infertility, will: (1) improve the fertility of women with obesity, (2) reduce costs associated with fertility treatments and (3) decrease the occurrence of some complications related to maternal weight during the pregnancy and for their offspring.</p>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the FFFP on fertility outcomes in a diverse Canadian population of women with obesity and subfertility who are seeking fertility treatments. Secondary objectives are to assess the FFFP’s (1) cost-effectiveness, primarily in terms of costs per live birth, as well as other measures of the programme’s costs and effectiveness measures, and (2) impacts on maternal and neonatal health.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Our study relies on the early and regular involvement of engaged patients, knowledge users and decision-makers to ensure their appropriation of the results. Policymakers and professional or patient organisations of all relevant provinces provided their support to the project and partnered with the research team to facilitate the feasibility of the trial and dissemination of the results. Importantly, three patient organisations partnered with our team and provided strong support letters: Obesity Canada, the <italic toggle="yes">Association des couples infertiles du Québec</italic> and Conceivable Dreams. Engaged patients have been implicated early in the development of this protocol to ensure that the results will be relevant for the target population and that the methods are appropriate for the participants. Two previous participants from the pilot study conducted in Sherbrooke are acting as engaged participants and have participated in each step of the trial’s development. Before submission of the grant proposal to the funding agency, they approved the study’s research question and its general objectives, as well as the acceptability of the intervention and the burden of research visits. Thereafter, they were regularly consulted by the Sherbrooke research team, and they partnered with the team during dedicated research meetings. Among other contributions, they have given precious input regarding recruitment approaches, data collection tools and timing, intervention upgrades from the pilot study, as well as participants’ newsletters. Other fertility clinics have committed to include one or two engaged patients, who will participate at research meetings at each site.</p>
                <p>Engaged patients and patient organisations will also be instrumental in disseminating the trial’s results to the public, in particular young women with obesity and those with infertility. This will be performed through patient organisations’ network, social media, as well as lay public press conferences and ‘<italic toggle="yes">Café scientifique</italic>’-like activities in which our engaged patients will be implicated. Such involvement of decision-makers and patients increases the potential impact on the public and scientific communities, and the use of the study’s findings to influence policies and priorities of institutions and governments.</p>

                <p>The study will be conducted in seven Canadian fertility clinics from coast to coast and in an ethnically diverse population of women: Olive Fertility Centre in Vancouver (British-Columbia), with its Asian population; Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto (Ontario) and <italic toggle="yes">Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal</italic>, with large multiethnic communities; <italic toggle="yes">Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke</italic> (CHUS) and <italic toggle="yes">Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec de l’Université de Laval</italic> (CHU de Quebec-UL) (Quebec), which are smaller centres with mainly a Caucasian population; and Atlantic Assisted Reproductive Therapies Clinic in Halifax (Nova Scotia) that has a Caucasian and Afro-American populations. We are also in the process of recruiting a seventh centre, ideally in the province of Manitoba.</p>
                <p>Potentially eligible patients can be approached in one of two ways: (1) by a member within their circle of care (nurse, physician, receptionist, etc) who then provides contact info to research staff, or (2) by responding to an advertisement indicating their interest to learn more about the study. Written informed consent (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>) is obtained individually for each patient during the baseline research visit (V0), after a full explanation of the study’s protocol and answers to the patient’s questions by the research staff, and before any data collection or study procedures. The following screening and baseline data are obtained during this visit: eligibility assessment (inclusion/exclusion criteria), medical history, concomitant medications, patient demographics and a baseline evaluation of study outcomes. Eligibility is confirmed by the site investigator before randomisation.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation to the FFFP or control group occurs after completion of the V0 and the eligibility assessment. Group allocation is concealed using online computerised randomisation using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture tool hosted at the Université de Sherbrooke)<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> with permuted blocks of variable block sizes (2–6), stratified by centre and PCOS status (yes/no). PCOS is an important potential confounder or modifier since it decreases fertility and may affect the response to the lifestyle intervention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The randomisation list has been generated by an independent statistician and participants are randomised in one of two arms using a 1:1 ratio. The randomisation process is initiated by the site investigator or delegate who accesses the web-based system and confirms patient’s eligibility and informed consent. The patient’s unique study identifier and open-label study treatment allocation is then automatically and electronically delivered to the local site investigator or delegate.</p>
                <p>Following randomisation, the research staff informs the fertility care team of the patient’s allocation group. On the one hand, if the participant is randomised to the control group, the fertility care team is informed that their patient can undergo fertility treatments immediately, according to their usual care. On the other hand, if the participant is randomised to the intervention group, the fertility clinic will be notified that the patient has to postpone any MAR procedures for the following 6 months, during which the patient is enrolled in the FFFP. At the end of this first 6-month period, if the participant failed to conceive, the research staff informs the fertility clinic team that the participant can now undergo usual fertility care, in combination with the FFFP.</p>

                  <p>Participants randomised to the control group are provided immediate access to the usual fertility care, as recommended by their fertility specialist, for a maximum of 24 months. This may include lifestyle counselling by their fertility specialist and usual fertility treatments. Since this is a pragmatic trial, they may undergo any lifestyle approaches or consult any professionals they want on their own, but are discouraged to engage in a lifestyle programme similar to the FFFP, as they agreed when recruited for the study, in order to avoid such an important contamination between intervention arms.</p>

                <sec id="s2-6-2">
                  <title>Experimental arm</title>
                  <p>Participants randomised to the intervention group follow the FFFP alone for the first 6 months, then in combination with usual fertility care for an additional 12 months if not pregnant. After these 18 months, usual fertility care can continue to be provided alone for a maximum follow-up of 24 months. The FFFP is also provided throughout gestation for participants who achieve a successful pregnancy. Accordingly, the lifestyle programme is provided for a maximum of 18 months if there is no pregnancy, or otherwise, up to the end of pregnancy or to a total study follow-up of 24 months (whichever comes first).</p>
                  <p>The FFFP was initially developed based on 2007 Canadian clinical practice guidelines<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and the approach implemented by our group at the CHUS obesity clinic,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and was then improved and adapted based on the experience gained from our completed pilot study<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and its focus groups. This intervention is aimed at supporting participants to implement progressive and sustainable lifestyle changes. Participants attend 30-min individual sessions with a dietitian and a kinesiologist, respectively, every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, then every 8 weeks for the following 6 months and then every 12 weeks until the end of the treatment period. These individual meetings take place in person with the participant, or virtually using an authorised system of telemedicine in the event that face-to-face meetings are not possible (eg, due to public health rules such as during the COVID-19 pandemic). Personal remote contact (eg, by phone, email) is offered between in-person meetings. Patients are guided by the dietitian and kinesiologist to formulate SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely).<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> These professionals are trained in evidence-based motivational communication skills,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> with emphasis placed on how to arm women with the knowledge, motivation and skills to achieve sustainable lifestyle changes. To ensure equitable delivery of the intervention, we will implement an internal quality control and training process. Therefore, after receiving training in motivational communication by our leading expert (KL), each professional will audio-record their first three individual meetings. These recordings will be evaluated by an expert in motivational communication using a coding scheme to verify fidelity. Feedback regarding the professional’s application of motivational communication techniques will be provided as needed, and additional recordings may be necessary based on the trainer’s assessment. After 6 and 12 months, three more individual sessions are recorded and used to analyse the quality and fidelity of the intervention from a research perspective. Consent for recording individual meetings is a specific question in the informed consent form and participants have the opportunity to revoke their agreement at any time during the course of their participation in the study.</p>
                  <p>Participants also benefit from weekly group sessions divided into two parts of 45 min each<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for group sessions’ topics): (1) Workshops that cover eight different topics addressing nutritional aspects and relevant healthy lifestyle habits (alcohol, tobacco and motivational issues) and (2) Supervised classes of physical activity where 1 of 8 different types of exercise are practiced. Women are invited to participate in group sessions every week throughout the study, but are required to attend all eight different sessions within the first 6 months. The spouses are highly encouraged to participate in all activities, as lifestyle modification is also important for the partner to improve a couple’s fertility.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref>

                  <p>Lifestyle outcomes are assessed at each research visit. Nutritional intake is evaluated using the validated web version of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ web), referring to the patient’s nutritional consumption of the last month. This questionnaire enables to extract data on specific food groups and micronutrients or macronutrients. This questionnaire has been shown to have a moderate validity and a good reproducibility for assessing nutrient intakes in healthy adults.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Participants complete the questionnaire at the research centre at their first research visit to ensure good understanding of the questions. For subsequent research visits, participants have the possibility to receive a link to complete the FFQ web electronically from home. Sleep duration and quality are evaluated by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index questionnaire, which has been shown to have a strong reliability and validity, as well as a moderate structural validity in the context of screening for sleep dysfunction.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The International Physical Activity Questionnaire—short version—is used to assess physical activity practice over the past 7 days: it was shown to have a good repeatability of data and is as reliable as other self-administered physical activity questionnaires.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Furthermore, participants are asked to wear after the research visit a Fitbit Flex 2 monitor during seven consecutive days, 24 hours/day, in order to objectively assess physical activity levels (energy expenditure, number of steps, distance walked, time spent being inactive, lightly active, active and very active), as well as sleep data (minutes spent asleep, awake and restless (when moving while sleeping)). Fitbit devices have been shown to accurately estimate the daily number of steps and the time spent in bed and sleeping, while overestimating the time spent doing highly intense activities.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> However, data extracted will be mainly used to assess the change of physical activity levels and sleep over time and not whether physical activity recommendations are met. This estimation bias should be consistent at each measurement time point and will be adjusted for baseline measures. The participant’s physical fitness level is assessed using the 6-minute walk test, which has shown to be a simple, safe and low-cost test to assess the effect of an intervention on the physical performance and walk capacity beyond weight loss.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Other lifestyle habits, such as alcohol, tobacco and drugs consumption, are measured by a study-specific self-reported questionnaire.</p>

These aspects will be further assessed on a small sample (from both groups) using focus groups. The satisfaction questionnaire is given at the 18-month research visit (V18) or at the second pregnancy research visit (PV2) if pregnant. Focus groups will take place at two time points: (1) after completion of the study by half of the participants and (2) close to the end of the trial. A total of 168 patients (27% of all participants) will participate in the focus groups across all seven centres, each centre evaluating two separate subgroups of six patients from the intervention and control groups. The number of participants for the second series of focus groups may be adjusted to reach data saturation. See bellow under ‘Methodology and analyses of qualitative substudy’ for more details.</p>

These visits will begin after the site research teams have recruited their first 35 participants (corresponding to one-third of participants to be recruited per site). Then they will be held at every 6-month intervals to assess protocol adherence, intervention standardisation, as well as data completeness and quality. During on-site monitoring visits, approximately 10% of participants’ records will be reviewed. Concordance with the original data entered by the site will be assessed using the Cohen’s kappa statistics. A kappa coefficient below 0.60 for one site at the time of a visit, which is considered as less than a moderate concordance,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> will require repeating the training of research staff at this site and, if necessary, revising all records of participants who completed the study at this site, if possible.</p>

                <title>Safety measurement</title>
                <p>Due to the relatively short duration of recruitment and follow‐up of participants, it will not be relevant to perform formal interim efficacy analyses for futility or superiority and interim safety analyses. Furthermore, it is very unlikely that the proposed lifestyle intervention, which is already recommended during preconception and pregnancy in women with obesity, would cause any safety issues. For these reasons, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board will not be required for this trial, and no interim analyses will be performed. However, adverse events of special interest (AEoSI) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be closely monitored throughout the study (see <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>). These potential events will be evaluated according to their causality and severity. Furthermore, after randomisation of the first 50 patients, the trial’s steering committee will produce a quarterly blinded report of AEoSI and SAE for each treatment group, including the grades of causality with the intervention. If SAE occur, these events will be reported to the coordination centre and local Research Ethics Board (REB), as well as the central REB of the Province of Quebec.</p>

                  <p>Experts from our <italic toggle="yes">Canadian network on reproductive and maternal health of women with obesity and infertility</italic> agreed that for a study using a lifestyle intervention and following intent-to-treat (ITT) principles, the minimal clinically important difference in the trial primary outcome, that is, cumulative life birth rates, would be 15% between groups. Therefore, a sample size of 293 women per group is required to detect a 15% absolute difference between groups, with a power of 95% and alpha level of 5%, from an estimated live birth rate of 35% in the control group (based on our previous pilot RCT<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) to 50% in the intervention group (nQuery Advisor V.4.0). Assuming a withdrawal rate of 5% (eligibility criteria violation and loss to follow-up), the total recruitment target is 616 women. A 95% power is sufficient for most of our secondary outcome analyses. To recruit a total of 616 participants in 18 months, the two clinics with smaller practices (CHUS and <italic toggle="yes">Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec</italic> (CHUQ)) will need to recruit 53 participants (ie, 39 per year), and the other five clinics will have to recruit 102 participants (ie, 68 per year). These recruitment rates are feasible given the data from our pretrial survey of participating fertility clinics that showed that smaller practices (CHUS and CHUQ) evaluate 80 to 315 new women with obesity per year, and larger practices, between 265 and 810.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analyses of quantitative data</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome is 24‐month live birth cumulative incidence and the primary analyses of interest will be ITT, including all randomised participants with available data and no violation of eligibility criteria. The ITT analyses will be supplemented by per‐protocol analyses that will exclude women who dropped out of the study during their first 6 months in both groups, that is, who signified their desire to stop participating in the study and/or intervention visits, or were unreachable from that period up to the end of the trial. The per-protocol analyses will keep all women who persevered in the study for at least 6 months and were therefore appropriately exposed to the intervention (intervention group) and adherent to the 6-month study visit (both group). The 24‐month cumulative incidence of live birth will be compared between the two arms using the Mantel‐Haenszel test with stratification by centre and PCOS status. This analysis will be supplemented by a survival analysis (logrank test) where the time to live birth will be used. Randomised groups will be examined at baseline to ensure demographic and clinical data are comparable. If substantial imbalance is found, which is very unlikely, additional analyses will be carried out to assess the potential confounding effects of this imbalance, using multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model. Similar analyses will be used for the other clinical outcome variables that are categorical. Continuous outcome variables will also be compared between groups based on either ITT or per-protocol analyses, using linear mixed models with repeated measures.</p>
                  <p>We will also analyse the impact of the FFFP on lifestyle and anthropometric outcomes, as well as other outcomes measured during a research visit, at 6 months (including research visits occurring 6±1 months after randomisation), as frequently reported in previous and similar trials. For these analyses, continuous variables will be compared between groups using unpaired t-tests and categorical variables will be examined using χ<sup>2</sup> tests. Missing data due to missed research visits or incomplete data collection will not be imputed, due to the relatively small sample size, such that these analyses might be subjected to non-random missing data differing between groups. Therefore, these tests will be corrected for potential baseline imbalances and confounding effects as mentioned above. Variables that are not normally distributed will be mathematically transformed to fit a normal distribution allowing their use in these models. Subgroup analyses will be performed for all outcomes based on baseline age, level of obesity (BMI ≥35 vs &lt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), ethnic origins, socioeconomic status, the cause of subfertility and PCOS status. A 5% level of significance will be used for all analyses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this paper, we present the research protocol for a multicentre pragmatic RCT assessing clinical and economic outcomes of an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention targeting women with subfertility and obesity (the Fit-For-Fertility programme) that takes place 6 months before initiating fertility treatments and, for the first time, continues in combination with usual fertility care as well as during pregnancy. This study will highlight the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and transferability of such a programme in a diverse population.</p>
              <p>Obesity has been shown to negatively impact on women’s reproductive capacity by reducing chances of pregnancy, with or without the help of fertility treatments.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16 18 19</xref> Women with obesity are also at a higher risk of complications during pregnancy. Interventions supporting changes in lifestyle habits and a moderate weight loss of 5%–10% of the initial weight are highly recommended for women who are trying to conceive.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31–33</xref> Unfortunately, there is little evidence from large and of good quality RCTs in this population supporting this recommendation. To our knowledge, there is only one published RCT (the LIFESTYLE study) evaluating the impacts of a 6-month lifestyle intervention on fertility outcomes among a general population of women with obesity and subfertility, not specifically affected with PCOS.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Although the authors did not observe an improvement in their primary outcome (vaginal birth of a healthy singleton) with their lifestyle intervention as compared with usual care, they reported a higher proportion of women in the intervention group achieving a spontaneous pregnancy (26.1% vs 16.2%, relative risk with 95% CI: 1.61 (1.16 to 2.24)) and a reduced total number of treatment cycles. Our trial will therefore contribute significantly to the actual knowledge and levels of evidence in the literature.</p>
              <p>Although this study uses a robust methodology, as all studies, it has a few limitations. First, it is not possible to blind the intervention and data collection, either to the participants nor the professionals (research or clinical), since the tested intervention is a lifestyle programme. Although a blind research study adds robustness and limits potential bias, we do not think this represents an important stake, because the study’s primary outcome is life birth, which is a robust clinical outcome that is not susceptible to bias. Second, data collection is done mainly using self-reported questionnaires that can result in a desirability bias. However, most of the questionnaires used have been validated and used in previous studies, and the bias should be similar in the intervention and control groups. Additionally, self-reported questionnaires may introduce a recall bias when patients have to report on previous events (eg, costs, nutritional intake in the last month). In that perspective, clear and detailed instructions are given to patients at each research visit to assist them in completing the questionnaires to the best of their ability. Thirdly, there may be a degree of diversity in the FFFP delivery due to the multicentre nature of the study. In the context of a pragmatic RCT, this diversity would in fact, reflect the real-world reality of programme implementation in different fertility clinics. While we consider this aspect to be a strength contributing to the generalisability of the results, it could also result in a variability in the efficacy of the intervention at each centre. To mitigate this concern, formal training is provided to all health professionals regarding motivational interviewing techniques, with coaching for the first meetings with participants until the professional masters these skills appropriately. Fidelity of the proper use of motivational communication in real clinical settings will be monitored throughout the study and corrective measures will be initially suggested to professionals, if needed. Furthermore, some standardisation in administering the core concepts of the FFFP is provided to health professionals beforehand to ensure that the interventions are as effective as possible.</p>
              <p>Despite its limitations, this study is highly relevant and uses a robust study design. The multicentre setting allows our work to be more generalisable, because of the diversity in the subpopulations and healthcare systems enrolled. The slight differences in provincial healthcare systems in Canada will allow us to examine the potential of the FFFP to be implemented in various healthcare contexts. The proposed study relies on early involvement of engaged patients, key decision-makers from each province, directors of fertility clinics, as well as professional and public health associations, which will increase the potential impact and use of the findings to influence policies and priorities of institutions and governments. The results of our multicentre RCT will have a major scientific impact since they will provide important data on the importance of a lifestyle programme supporting women with obesity seeking fertility treatments. We believe our work will promote better fertility outcomes and response to ART as well as contribute in achieving a healthy pregnancy and giving birth to a healthy baby. This study will also provide valuable information on potential cost-effectiveness for individuals and the healthcare system. Therefore, the Fit-For-Fertility study has the potential to improve the care trajectory of women with subfertility and obesity seeking fertility treatments, and do so at an acceptable cost both for patients and government-funded providers.</p>

                <p>Due to the widespread public health rules and restrictions implemented in the province of Quebec from March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the RCT has experienced considerable delays in the initiation of the study in each centre. Furthermore, one centre located in the province of Alberta had to withdraw from the trial for considerations related to the pandemic. Recruitment has begun in Sherbrooke, Quebec, with its first randomisation in May 2019 (n=33 as of November 2021), Québec City, Quebec, in February 2020 (n=14), Toronto, Ontario, in May 2021 (n=1) and in Montreal, Quebec, in November 2021 (n=1). The centre in Halifax has not yet begun recruiting because of COVID-19 restrictions in its province. Other centres are ready and allowed to start recruiting at this time. We are also in the process of recruiting a seventh centre in the province of Manitoba.</p>
