                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The challenge of implementing best evidence into clinical practice is a major problem in modern healthcare that can result in ineffective, inefficient and unsafe care. There is a growing body of literature which suggests that the removal or reduction of low-value care practices (ie, deadoption) is integral to the delivery of high-quality care and the sustainability of our healthcare system. However, currently very little is known about deadoption practices in Canada. We propose to map the current state of deadoption in Canadian intensive care units (ICUs). A key deliverable of this work will include development of an inventory of barriers, facilitators and potential implementation strategies for guiding the deadoption efforts.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will use Canadian adult general systems ICUs as our laboratory of investigation and employ a two-phased sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach: (1) semi-structured interviews with critical care stakeholders to develop an understanding of the structure (ie, healthcare context), process (ie, actions and events in healthcare) and outcomes (ie, effects on health status, quality, knowledge or behaviour) of deadoption (phase I) and (2) surveys with a broader sample of critical care stakeholders to further identify important barriers and facilitators, as well as potential implementation strategies (phase II). Interview data will be analysed through qualitative content analysis and survey data will be analysed through quantitative analyses to identify top barriers and facilitators, as well as top rated strategies.</p>

                  <p>Ethical approval has been obtained through the University of Calgary Research Ethics Board (REB 17â2153). Participants involved will have the opportunity to provide feedback on the final written reports to support accurate representation of the data. The findings of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and oral presentations with critical care stakeholders across Canada. Patient and family partners will receive an executive summary of the findings.</p>

                <p>To provide the best healthcare to patients, the translation of best evidence into clinical practice is vital. This is especially true in the context of critical care medicine where the most advanced technology and treatments are often necessary to save lives.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â3</xref> There is a significant delay between the development of scientific evidence and its implementation into clinical practice (~17 years).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Delay in the translation of scientific information into clinical practice remains a challenge for healthcare systems as it creates gaps between best evidence available and the way clinical practices are delivered.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Low-value care may be described include three categories of practice where the best available evidence suggests that there is (1) little to no benefit for patients (ineffective), (2) the benefits provided is not proportional to the cost (inefficient) or (3) the risk of harm exceeds the potential benefit (unsafe).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref>

                <title>Deadopting low-value clinical practices</title>
                <p>Previous efforts in the area of implementation science that aim to close knowledge-care gaps have focused on adoption, or the implementation of new high-value practices into clinical practice. However, recent work in this area has emphasised the importance of deadopting (eg, reducing) the use of practices that are of low-value (no longer supported by best scientific evidence) from clinical practice.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â11</xref> Two types of knowledge gaps in particular, overuse (use of an intervention despite strong evidence indicating it is ineffective or harmful) and misuse (use of an intervention that scientific evidence has demonstrated to be effective, but for the wrong patients or under the wrong circumstances) highlight the need for deadoption. Both of these types of gaps indicate instances where an evidence supported intervention is used incorrectly, for the wrong patient or under the wrong circumstances and have critical implications on patient healthcare outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> For example, Pearson and Littlejohns showed that in the USA, patients in acute care receive recommended care only 53% of the time, leading to poor management of health conditions and preventable patient death.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Meanwhile, numerous high-quality studies have demonstrated no meaningful effect using albumin during fluid resuscitation for most critically ill patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Despite this, albumin continues to be prescribed to a high number of patients who need fluid resuscitation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

                <title>A focus on critical care medicine</title>
                <p>Intensive care units (ICUs) look after the most vulnerable patients in the hospital where rapidly changing technologies are needed to provide treatment to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Adult ICU admissions have increased by 12% in the last 10 years.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In Canada, ICU costs are estimated to be ~CAD$6âbillion a year.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The average daily cost of an ICU stay has been reported to be three times that of a stay in a general hospital ward.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Due to both the ageing population in Canada and increased severity of patient illness, it is expected that the use and cost of critical care in Canada will continue to increase.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recent studies also indicate that ICUs already frequently operate close to capacity levels, limiting possibilities for units to accommodate for rising admission rates.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19â21</xref> Further, patients in the ICU are often frail with little ability to tolerate ineffective or harmful practices.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 20</xref> Research to build a foundation to guide the deadoption of low-value practices in critical care medicine is both timely and necessary given that ICUs currently use the highest number of expensive therapies, technologies and treatments in the health system in an effort to save lives.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Reduction of costs to the healthcare system through removing practices no longer supported by best evidence in critical care medicine is necessary to reduce low-value care.</p>

                <p>Campaigns such as Choosing Wiselyâwhich has prioritised the identification of low-value care practices in critical care medicine<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> âhave been highly publicised<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and have influenced healthcare priorities at provincial, national and international levels.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> However, little is known about how best to facilitate and sustain the deadoption of these practices.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Purely technical approaches have been shown to be insufficient, as they often neglect the impact of social, ethical, cultural and preferential factors.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Given the recent Choosing Wisely campaign and raised attention level to low-value care in critical care medicine,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> this programme of work is timely, since a lack of knowledge of how to apply and execute principles of deadoption in a critical care context risks efforts being ineffective (eg, a deadoption strategy that decays over time because it is not tailored to the local setting), or having unintended consequences (eg, a deadopted practice replaced by another low-value practice). To address this gap in implementation science, we propose a programme of research that uses Canadian ICUs as a laboratory to develop an evidence base by mapping the structure (ie, healthcare context), process (ie, actions and events in healthcare) and outcomes (ie, effects on health status, quality, knowledge or behaviour)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> of current approaches to deadoption in Canadian critical care medicine.</p>

                <p>To understand factors associated with the deadoption of low-value clinical practices in critical care medicine and develop an evidence base of facilitators, barriers and potential implementation strategies to guide future deadoption efforts. To achieve our objective, we will use Canadian adult ICUs as our laboratory of investigation and apply the Donabedian model of healthcare quality.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Donabedianâs model has previously been validated in other acute care contexts (ie, trauma) where improvements in care structures and processes were associated with beneficial effects on patient outcomes and use of resources.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In this study, we will employ a two-phased sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach: (1) one-to-one interviews with critical care stakeholders to understand the current structure (ie, context), process (ie, interactions between stakeholders) and outcomes (ie, impact of deadoption efforts)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in ICUs across Canada (phase I) and (2) surveys with the broader critical care community to further identify additional barriers, facilitators and potential implementation strategies not published in the literature (phase II). This work also builds on an in-progress systematic review to identify published barriers and facilitators to deadoption in acute care (registered in PROSPERO: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42016050234">http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42016050234</ext-link>). Findings from both phases of research will be integrated with the results of the systematic review and synthesised into an inventory of barriers, facilitators and targeted implementation strategies to map the current state of deadoption in Canadian critical care medicine. The protocol for this manuscript is informed by initial findings from the systematic review also involving members of this team (Parsons-Leigh, Niven and Stelfox). Phase I of this work is intended to start in October of 2019, followed by phase II in June 2020.</p>

                <p>The primary aim of this programme of work is to build an evidence base to guide the process of deadoption in critical care medicine on a national scale. A map of the structure, processes and outcomes of deadoption in critical care settings will be developed based on the findings from two phases of research using a sequential exploratory methodology, which involves interviews (phase I) and surveys (phase II) with stakeholders working in critical care settings across Canada (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). We will also utilise the findings from the published literature on deadoption,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> including the systematic review (see Overall Objective) currently taking place, to identify barriers, facilitators and potential implementation strategies to support the deadoption of low-value clinical practices. Canadian adult general system ICUs (ie, ICUs that provide care to a mix of illness types but are primarily medical and surgical patients) will be used as our laboratory of investigation to evaluate and refine the barriers, facilitators and implementation strategies within a clinical context. The findings from this research will help capture the complexity of the deadoption process and will ultimately support clinical and health policy decision-making in critical care medicine. We define barriers and facilitators as factors that influence the discontinuation of a clinical practice (ie, healthcare delivery acts such as diagnosis, therapeutic interventions, healthcare technology, education and prevention efforts) after it has been previously adopted.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, we divide low-value clinical practices into three categories: <italic>ineffective</italic> (ie, do not produce any significant or desired effect), <italic>inefficient</italic> (ie, where the cost is not proportional to the benefits) or <italic>harmful</italic> (ie, where the risk of harm outweighs any benefit).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 29</xref> We define ICU as a distinct hospital care unit staffed by specialised professionals where immediate and continuous life-sustaining treatment is provided to patients. This protocol is the foundational step in a programme of research that will launch a systematic, customisable and sustainable deadoption strategy for ICUs across Canada.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Individual interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of ICU administrators (unit managers, medical directors) and frontline providers (physicians, nurses) from at least two hospitals in five Canadian provinces (n=10 hospitals) with general systems ICUs to further explore their experiences of deadoption. The interview question guide will be informed by the barriers, facilitators and potential implementation strategies identified in the published literature, as well as in the systematic review (discussed earlier) in an effort to further understand the relevance of top-rated factors in the context of the current state of deadoption decision-making. Furthermore, the interview guide will be structured based on the Donabedian model and will include questions focused on exploring factors related to structure (ie, healthcare context), process (ie, actions and events in healthcare) and outcomes (ie, effects on health status, quality, knowledge or behaviour)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in the removal of low-value care practices. For example, we will ask stakeholders to describe the type of facility or institution (eg, teaching hospital vs community hospital; quality improvement staff support integrated into structure) they work in (<italic>structure</italic>) and how they perceive this to impact stakeholder actions or responses related to deadoption initiatives (<italic>process</italic>) and the effects of this on the use of low-value care (<italic>outcomes</italic>). The interview guide will be piloted and iteratively refined with four to five local critical care medicine stakeholders in the Calgary prior to conducting interviews with stakeholders from additional hospitals and provinces in Canada.</p>

                  <p>Participants will be purposively sampled to ensure representation of both urban and regional ICUs and academic and non-academic ICUs from various Canadian geographic regions to maximise the diversity of perspectives and experiences captured. We will target five provinces (Alberta, AB; British Columbia, BC; Nova Scotia, NS; Ontario, ON; Quebec, QC) that represent 4/5 of Canadaâs major geographic regions: West (BC), Prairie (AB), Central (ON, QC) and Atlantic (NS). We will start with our teamâs home province of Alberta and to initially ensure our design will capture a diverse range of perspectives, we will recruit at least four ICUs across the province (n=16â24 in Alberta). Our team has previously compiled a comprehensive list of Canadian adult ICU medical directors and unit managers that was successfully used to survey administrators in a study of ICU rounding practices.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This list will be reviewed for accuracy, updated based on any publically available information and used to identify potential interviewees. We will use snowball sampling based on this list to request participation of 4â5 participants from each ICU, including 1 medical director or unit manager, 2 physicians and 1â2 nurses from 1 academic and 1 non-academic hospital in the 5 Canadian provinces (except in Alberta, we will recruit at least 2 academic and 2 non-academic hospitals) to participate in the interview process (4â5 participants Ã 2 hospitals Ã 4 provinces+4â5 participants Ã 4 hospitals in Alberta=48â60 participants in total). Contact will be initially made through telephone calls to either the medical director or unit manager to request their participation and to ask for their help in forwarding the study information to physicians and nurses in their ICU. Participants who consent to the study will be contacted for an interview. If we are not able to initially achieve our target sample as described above, we will follow-up with the medical director or unit manager to ask for their help in obtaining the proposed sample frame in their ICU. Interview guides and transcripts will be translated into French as necessary by a skilled translator and then checked for accuracy by a bilingual healthcare professional. Non-respondents will be contacted up to three times at 2-week intervals to set up an interview. If selected participants do not respond within this timeframe, we will contact the next person on our list of consenting participants with like characteristics. Interviews will last ~30â45âmin.</p>

Moreover, participants will be asked how low-value practices are selected of deadoption, what types of deadoption practices or initiatives are currently underway, successes and failures related to the deadoption processes, barriers and facilitators to deadoption, and effective strategies that have been used in their unit to successfully deadopt an ineffective or harmful clinical practice (eg, how are interventions developed, implemented, evaluated and sustained?).</p>

                  <p>Participants will be asked to rate the importance of barriers and facilitators that contribute to improving the deadoption of low-value care practices within their ICU, using a 7-point Likert scale. Through open-ended questions, survey respondents will also be asked for their ideas and thoughts on contextual factors that influence deadoption. The perceived effectiveness of potential strategies to initiate and sustain changes in practice within the ICU will be assessed by participants using a similar scale. Specific examples of both ineffective (eg, albumin for fluid resuscitation)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and harmful (eg, tight glycemic control)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> clinical practices relevant to ICU care will be used throughout the survey to illustrate meaning. The top five barriers and top five facilitators, as well as the top five harmful or ineffective practices and top five implementation strategies appropriate for the deadoption of low-value practices will be identified by each participant through this survey. Finally, demographic data will be requested (ie, age, gender, number of years working in critical care, role in organisation, primary specialisation, type of institution) to ascertain if there are differences in perception related to provider characteristics (eg, medical director vs unit manager, physicians vs nurses) and hospital setting (ie, urban vs rural, academic vs non-academic).</p>

                  <p>A comprehensive list of barriers (eg, ICU resistance to change), facilitators (eg, local champion) and proposed implementation strategies (eg, onsite education) to deadoption reported in the individual surveys will be compiled through quantitative analysis. The importance of each barrier, facilitator and proposed implementation strategies will be illustrated by using medians with IQRs and proportions with binomial 95% CIs. Detailed tabulations to compare characteristics by decision-maker (unit manager, medical director), provider (nurses, physicians) and hospital (urban vs rural, academic vs non-academic) will also be conducted. Ï<sup>2</sup> and Kruskal-Wallis tests for institution comparisons and mixed-effects logistic regressions will be used to evaluate the significance of observed differences in reported barriers and facilitators for provider comparisons (data clustered by unit), although these comparisons are not the primary objective of this phase and likely to be underpowered. An earlier study that also surveyed stakeholders in the ICU identified a response rate of over 60%,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> however, we have used a more conservative estimate of 40% to assume that 864 surveys (2160 surveys distributed with 40% target response rate) will be returned and used for quantitative analysis. This will provide a binomial CI of Â±4.6% (based on 864 surveys equally clustered across 180 ICUs) for global point estimates.</p>

                <p>Following stakeholder interviews, data from both phases of work will be synthesised to map the process, structure and outcomes of deadoption efforts in Canadian medical surgical ICUs. Specifically, the interview and survey findings will be synthesised into an inventory of key factors, barriers, facilitators and proposed implementation strategies to guide the deadoption of both ineffective (eg, albumin for fluid resuscitation) and harmful (eg, tight glycemic control) clinical practices. Findings from the systematic review (mentioned earlier) will also be integrated into this final deliverable. Barriers, facilitators and proposed implementation strategies pertaining to deadoption will also be characterised based on their appropriateness to different practice settings (academic vs non-academic), providers (physicians vs nurses) and decision-maker (medical director vs unit manager) characteristics. Interview participants will be given an opportunity to provide feedback on the draft findings as a form of member checking. To date, contextual and institutional factors that influence the removal of low-value clinical practices from patient care are simply not known. The results of this work will provide researchers, providers, and clinical and health policy decision-makers with vital information to launch informed, evidence-based deadoption initiatives. Moreover, while this research will be conducted in the context of Canadian adult ICUs, we believe it will be transferable to other acute care contexts and multidisciplinary healthcare settings, although this will need to be confirmed in future studies.</p>

We plan to share results with patient and family partners in the form of written executive summaries and potentially oral presentation if there is interest. Results of the study will also be shared with the Canadian Critical Care Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://canadiancriticalcare.org">https://canadiancriticalcare.org</ext-link>), the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ccctg.ca/">https://www.ccctg.ca/</ext-link>) and more broadly to informal networks in the community through traditional peer-review publications and oral presentations at upcoming meetings and conferences.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Ineffective, inefficient or potentially harmful practices are common in healthcare due in part to the complexity and difficulty associated with the translation of scientific evidence into clinical practice.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This programme of work will map prevailing opinions pertaining to deadoption of low-value clinical practices in adult ICUs in Canada, determine barriers and facilitators to deadoption in general system ICUs and provide hospitals with an applied framework to guide the deadoption process. Canadians who are critically ill are the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the healthcare system, and thus, it is imperative they <italic>receive the right care at the right time</italic>. This project will help to build a foundation for the creation of effective strategies to improve the use of best evidence in critical care by facilitating the removal of practices that are no longer supported by scientific study.</p>
