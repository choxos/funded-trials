                  <p>Although the satellite cell (SC) is a key regulator of muscle growth during development and muscle adaptation following exercise, the regulation of human muscle SC function remains largely unexplored. STAT3 signalling mediated via interleukin-6 (IL-6) has recently come to the forefront as a potential regulator of SC proliferation. The early response of the SC population in human muscle to muscle-lengthening contractions (MLC) as mediated by STAT3 has not been studied.</p>

                  <p>Twelve male subjects (21±2 y; 83±12 kg) performed 300 maximal MLC of the quadriceps femoris at 180°•s<sup>−1</sup> over a 55° range of motion with muscle samples (<italic>vastus lateralis</italic>) and blood samples (<italic>antecubital</italic> vein) taken prior to exercise (PRE), 1 hour (T1), 3 hours (T3) and 24 hours (T24) post-exercise. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of muscle biopsies were purified and analyzed for total and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) by western blot. p-STAT3 was detected in cytoplasmic fractions across the time course peaking at T24 (p&lt;0.01 vs. PRE). Nuclear total and p-STAT3 were not detected at appreciable levels. However, immunohistochemical analysis revealed a progressive increase in the proportion of SCs expressing p-STAT3 with ∼60% of all SCs positive for p-STAT3 at T24 (p&lt;0.001 vs. PRE). Additionally, cMyc, a STAT3 downstream gene, was significantly up-regulated in SCs at T24 versus PRE (p&lt;0.05). Whole muscle mRNA analysis revealed induction of the STAT3 target genes <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>SOCS3</italic>, <italic>cMyc</italic> (peaking at T3, p&lt;0.05), <italic>IL-6Rα</italic> and <italic>GP130</italic> (peaking at T24, p&lt;0.05). In addition, <italic>Myf5</italic> mRNA was up-regulated at T24 (p&lt;0.05) with no appreciable change in <italic>MRF4</italic> mRNA.</p>

                  <p>We demonstrate that IL-6 induction of STAT3 signaling occurred exclusively in the nuclei of SCs in response to MLC. An increase in the number of cMyc+ SCs indicated that human SCs were induced to proliferate under the control of STAT3 signaling.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Muscle satellite cells (SCs) are a population of cells that reside between the sarcolemma and basal lamina of myofibres <xref rid="pone.0017392-Mauro1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and have been shown to play an integral role in skeletal muscle repair <xref rid="pone.0017392-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0017392-Rosenblatt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and hyperplasia <xref rid="pone.0017392-Tamaki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, in humans and animals. Although SCs are key regulators of muscle growth during development and muscle adaptation following exercise <xref rid="pone.0017392-Carlson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0017392-Dreyer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the cellular regulation of human muscle SC function remains largely unexplored. Undoubtedly, the orchestration of events that govern SC function following damage involves a complex milieu of factors originating from the SC in addition to niche factors extrinsic to the SC <xref rid="pone.0017392-Christov1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Identified regulators of human SCs include insulin like growth factor-1 <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, hepatocyte growth factor <xref rid="pone.0017392-OReilly1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, transforming growth factor beta <xref rid="pone.0017392-Carlson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and Notch/Delta <xref rid="pone.0017392-Carlson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recently, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated as playing a role in the regulation of human SCs in response to damaging eccentric contractions <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Traditionally, IL-6 was considered an inflammatory cytokine <xref rid="pone.0017392-Spangenburg1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, however, recent work has shown that IL-6 is produced by muscle <xref rid="pone.0017392-Hiscock1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, released into circulation <xref rid="pone.0017392-Steensberg1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and can act on the muscle cells themselves. As such, IL-6 is now also referred to as a “myokine” <xref rid="pone.0017392-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Importantly, IL-6 knockout mice demonstrated a blunted hypertrophic response and less SC-mediated myonuclear accretion compared to wild-type mice following compensatory hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0017392-Serrano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, SCs from IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice demonstrated an impaired proliferative capacity, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, which was shown to be related to a lack of IL-6-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signalling <xref rid="pone.0017392-Serrano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We have recently reported an increase in IL-6 protein localized in SCs 24 hours following a damaging bout of muscle-lengthening contractions (MLC) in humans coinciding with an increase in <italic>cyclin D1</italic> expression and SC number <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These data indicate that IL-6, acting via the janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signalling pathway, may be involved in SC proliferation/activation.</p>
              <p>STAT3 is a downstream target of IL-6 <xref rid="pone.0017392-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Trenerry1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and in response to IL-6 binding, STAT3 is phosphorylated via JAK2. This leads to the subsequent homodimerization and translocation of p-STAT3 to the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0017392-Rawlings1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Once in the nucleus, p-STAT3 binds to the γ-interferon activation sequence (GAS) element where it then promotes the transcription of downstream genes <xref rid="pone.0017392-Ivanova1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These genes have been shown to be responsible for a number of cellular functions including proliferation, migration, as well as anti-apoptotic functions <xref rid="pone.0017392-Serrano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. <italic>cMyc</italic> is a downstream target gene in the STAT3 signalling cascade. It has been shown to regulate cell-cycle kinetics through the up-regulation of a number of Cyclin proteins which are involved in the cell growth phase G1 <xref rid="pone.0017392-Fukada1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0017392-Masuda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, STAT3 also regulates a number of its upstream signalling cascade members including IL-6, GP130, IL-6Rα and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). The STAT3 pathway is regulated in a negative feedback loop through interactions with JAK2 <xref rid="pone.0017392-Naka1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. SOCS3 can bind phosphotyrosines on JAK2 and physically block STAT3 from binding to JAK2. Additionally, SOCS3 can recruit ubiquitin-transferases leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of JAK2 <xref rid="pone.0017392-Rawlings1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Based on previous work by McKay and colleagues (2009) showing that p-STAT3 co-localized with SCs we aimed to quantify SC localized p-STAT3 signalling over a time course. We hypothesized that the mRNA species of the IL-6/STAT3 signalling cascade would be up-regulated early following the MLC protocol along with a similar increase, as reported previously by McKay and colleagues (2009), in the IL-6<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell population. Furthermore, using a time course directed at capturing STAT3 phosphorylation, we hypothesized that we would observe an increase in p-STAT3 specifically in the SC population coinciding with an increase in SC number. In addition, we hypothesized that cMyc, a downstream product of STAT3 signalling, would be detected with mRNA up-regulated in whole muscle and protein co-localized to SCs following an increase in STAT3 signalling in the SC population.</p>

              <p>To confirm that the MLC protocol caused muscle damage we examined serum creatine kinase (CK) levels over the time course.

              <p>In response to acute muscle damage we observed a 26.6% increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells 24 hours following the MLC protocol. Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells per 100 myofibers increased from 15.5 at PRE to 19.6 (p&lt;0.05) 24 hours post exercise. When expressed as a percentage of total myonuclei we observed a 60.3% increase in satellite cell number (∼3% at PRE to ∼4.5% 24 hours post) (p&gt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017392-g001">figure 1d</xref>)). Satellite cells were quantified using a Pax7/Laminin co-stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017392-g001">figure 1e</xref>) to ensure that all Pax7 cells were in the SC niche.

Diffuse p-STAT3 staining was observed throughout the muscle fibres and appeared to intensify over the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017392-g004">figure 4a–b</xref>), which agreed with the increased cytoplasmic p-STAT3 at 24 hours post observed using western blot analysis.

To further verify that p-STAT3 signalling was indeed occurring, downstream target genes of STAT3 were analyzed. <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA peaked at 3 hours, up approximately 150 fold from PRE (p&lt;0.05) and remained elevated, up ∼80 fold from PRE (p&lt;0.05) at 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017392-g005">figure 5a</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Cell proliferation is a complex process regulated by a number of factors, such as IL-6, IGF-1, HGF and TNFα <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Machida1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Serrano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-OReilly1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, among others. It is a process vital for continued functional capacity and overall tissue survival of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle fibres are post-mitotic thus the satellite cell (SC) is the exclusive source of new nuclei for the maintenance of healthy skeletal muscle. Here we illustrate the potential of STAT3 signalling in promoting SC proliferation following acute muscle damage in humans. We have demonstrated that following muscle damage, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in SCs increases early (within one hour), inducing downstream target genes (i.e. <italic>GP130</italic> and <italic>SOCS3</italic>), which further regulate the increase in STAT3 production and response (as induced via IL-6), leading to increased <italic>cMyc</italic> expression, which drives cell proliferation. As SCs account for such a small percentage of total myonuclei (∼2–7%), even when the nuclear fraction of whole muscle homogenate was analyzed, no p-STAT3 was observed. This lack of observable p-STAT3 in the nuclear fraction combined with the increase in p-STAT3<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells, measured via immunohistochemistry strongly support the premise that p-STAT3 signalling occurred almost exclusively in SCs in human muscle. Further evidence is provided by the expansion of the cMyc<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell population from PRE to 24 hours expressed as a percentage of total Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells. Collectively, the time-course utilized in this study was successful in capturing a rapid up-regulation in p-STAT3 signalling in SCs shown to be associated with an increase in SC number following exercise induced muscle injury.</p>
              <p>In agreement with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, IL-6 mRNA and protein in both the blood and co-localized to the SC increased in response to MLC. The ∼1.5 fold increase in serum IL-6 supports a number of studies reporting that IL-6 is released from the muscle into circulation in response to MLC <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA was significantly up-regulated 3 hours and 24 hours post MLC, up ∼150 fold and ∼100 fold respectively. While the fold changes were of a greater magnitude in this study than in McKay and colleagues (2009), most likely due to the dietary controls and the training status of the subjects, the directional temporal pattern of expression was similar between the two studies. Finally, IL-6<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells increased from PRE, where there were relatively few co-positive cells, to a peak at 3 hours where approximately 75% of all SCs were IL-6<sup>+</sup>. IL-6<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells remained significantly up-regulated from PRE at 24 hours, with approximately 60% of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells expressing IL-6. It is known that SCs express the IL-6Rα <xref rid="pone.0017392-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> allowing for IL-6 signalling to occur. Thus, an increase in SC mediated IL-6 synthesis suggests that IL-6 signalling occurs in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. As a consequence, we suggest that increased IL-6 signalling leads to the induction of p-STAT3 signalling in the SC as evidenced by the increases in the p-STAT3<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> population and the up-regulation of p-STAT3 regulated genes.</p>
              <p>Previously p-STAT3 was found to be localized in the SC compartment; however, quantification of p-STAT3 over a time-course was not conducted in that study <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To verify that p-STAT3 regulated the SC response, we quantified p-STAT3 immunofluorescence. The proportion of p-STAT3<sup>+</sup> SCs was significantly elevated at T1 with ∼40% of SCs co-positive and peaking at T24 where ∼60% of SCs were co-positive, similar to that of IL-6<sup>+</sup> SCs. Importantly, this early increase in p-STAT3<sup>+</sup> SCs verifies the rapid signalling of this system and confirms that the timing of these events were indeed occurring early as proposed by McKay et al. <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This provides temporal evidence that following a bout of damaging exercise, STAT3 is phosphorylated leading to downstream signalling events resulting in proliferation of human SCs. The significant increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells, the up-regulation of <italic>Myf5</italic> mRNA (a major regulator of SC proliferation) coupled with no significant change in <italic>MRF4</italic> mRNA (a major regulator of SC differentiation) and an increase in the percentage of cMyc<sup>+</sup> SCs 24 hours after the MLC provide further evidence that human SC proliferation involved p-STAT3 signalling. In addition, because almost no other nuclei other than SCs were positive for p-STAT3 and the nuclear fraction western blots detected virtually no p-STAT3 as they were not sensitive enough to detect such a small percentage of cells expressing p-STAT3protein, it would appear that the IL-6 induced STAT3 signalling cascade occurred almost exclusively in SCs. This supports the observational report from McKay and colleagues who found that p-STAT3 was co-localized to SCs 4 hours after subjects had preformed 300 MLC <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and work done by Kami &amp; Senba who co-localized p-STAT3 to c-Met<sup>+</sup> cells in rats following freeze crush injury <xref rid="pone.0017392-Kami1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Trenerry and colleagues also showed a transient response in myonuclei expressing p-STAT3 2 hours following leg extension exercise <xref rid="pone.0017392-Trenerry1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, however no SC specific analysis was conducted in that study.</p>
              <p>It is also worth noting that there was a progressive increase in p-STAT3 staining in the muscle fibers over the time-course. This agrees with the stepwise increase in p-STAT3 observed in the cytoplasmic fraction. This may be explained by additional cellular functions of p-STAT3. p-STAT3 has been implicated in microtubule remodelling, matrix metalloproteinase production <xref rid="pone.0017392-Korzus1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and focal adhesion protein production <xref rid="pone.0017392-Reich1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, leading to increased migratory potential of different cell types such as inflammatory and SCs. In addition, p-STAT has also been shown to play a role in regulating the general hypertrophic response through its interactions with the leptin receptor in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0017392-Olmedillas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and angiotensin II in cardiac muscle <xref rid="pone.0017392-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Possibly, in response to muscle fiber damage, STAT3 is phosphorylated in damaged myofibers acting as a localized chemotactic stimuli for the SC and inflammatory cell populations to migrate toward. This allows for expeditious repair via phagocytosis of necrotic or damaged tissues <xref rid="pone.0017392-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, breakdown of connective tissues through matrix metalloproteinase activity <xref rid="pone.0017392-Senft1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and efficient migration of SCs to the areas of damage <xref rid="pone.0017392-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p>
              <p>There was no significant increase in p-JAK2 protein at any of the time points. As an upstream regulator of STAT3 phosphorylation we would expect a temporal profile for JAK2 phosphorylation similar to that of STAT3. Since cytoplasmic p-STAT3 peaked at 24 hours following MLC it is possible that we missed the increase in p-JAK2 as it may have occurred sometime between 3 and 24 hours.</p>
              <p>In addition to the increase in serum IL-6 and <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA, we also observed an up-regulation of several STAT3-related downstream genes. <italic>SOCS3</italic> expression, downstream of STAT3 signalling serves as a negative regulator of JAK/STAT signalling. <italic>SOCS3</italic> functions via a classic feedback inhibition loop. Production of SOCS3 is up-regulated in response to JAK/STAT signalling whereby it then acts to suppress JAK/STAT signalling by inhibiting the activity of JAK2 kinase <xref rid="pone.0017392-Naka1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017392-Rawlings1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Importantly, the temporal expression of SOCS3 was closely related to the temporal expression of IL-6 with a peak at 3 hours and remaining elevated at 24 hours post MLC. <italic>cMyc</italic>, a gene known to promote proliferation, and that is expressed downstream of STAT3 <xref rid="pone.0017392-Kiuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, was also associated with the same pattern of temporal expression as IL-6 and SOCS3 following MLC, as demonstrated through significant correlations with each of these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017392.s001">figures S1d</xref>–e). Two other necessary members of this signalling cascade are the receptor sub-complexes <italic>IL-6Rα</italic> and <italic>GP130</italic>. They both revealed increases in their mRNA expression over the time course with a peak at 24 hours. This is important as both of these mRNA species are up-regulated in response to STAT3 signalling and serve to autoregulate the pathway.</p>
              <p>Providing yet another level of support for STAT3 mediated SC proliferation was the increase in the number of cMyc<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells observed at T24 versus PRE. Previous work by McKay and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0017392-McKay2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> did not localize the downstream signalling events of the STAT3 pathway to the SC, looking only at different mRNA species in whole muscle. Importantly, this work definitively shows that the change observed in <italic>cMyc</italic> mRNA translates into significant protein expression specifically in the SCs during a time when these cells were proliferating. This implicates STAT3 as a primary inducer of SC proliferation in human muscle following MLC. The cMyc<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> population was only analysed PRE and 24 hours post MLC as this was the time when the highest levels of proliferation were occurring as evidenced by the significant increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells. cMyc is a critical regulator of the cell cycle, responsible for the transition from G1 to S phase <xref rid="pone.0017392-Dang1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It has also been shown to be up-regulated in response to IL-6 signalling <xref rid="pone.0017392-Nabata1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and in a STAT3 induced GP130 mediated manner <xref rid="pone.0017392-Kiuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. One of its main downstream functions is to regulate the production of CyclinD1, a known regulator of the cell cycle, which we have previously reported to increase in response MLC. The increase in SCs expressing cMyc serve as direct evidence that p-STAT3 signalling is occurring in SCs leading to their proliferation.</p>
              <p>The STAT3 signalling cascade as induced by IL-6 has been shown here to be an important regulator for the proliferation of SCs early following a muscle damaging protocol. Collectively, we have shown that SCs up-regulate IL-6 following damage which likely acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to promote proliferation through STAT3 signalling. This IL-6 induced STAT3 signalling is evidenced by the up-regulation of the downstream genes regulated by p-STAT3. Furthermore, with p-STAT3 being observed almost exclusively in SCs, not in other myonuclei and only to a large degree at least 1 hour post muscle damage, it appears that it acts in a very specific manner through IL-6 leading to the proliferation of SCs and subsequent repair of muscle damage. Thus, as evidenced by the induction of cMyc protein it appears that STAT3 is a key signalling molecule in human SCs in response to physiological levels of muscle damage and contributes to the robust proliferation of SCs in the acute period following damage.</p>

                <p>Serum analysis was conducted for both creatine kinase activity and IL-6 protein. Creatine kinase activity was analysed using a commercially available kit (Pointe Scientific, Inc., Canton USA) with modifications to the protocol to allow for running the samples at 25°C. This included adding additional sample using a ratio obtained from the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) for conversion between 37°C and 25°C. Additionally, sample absorbance was measured every twenty seconds for twenty minutes to obtain the slope of the change in absorbance/minute. This value was used to calculate the concentration of creatine kinase in international units (U/L) which is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of one micromole of substrate per minute.</p>

                  <p>(<bold>S1a</bold>) Pearson correlation between the serum concentrations of IL-6 (pg/mL) and cMyc (U/L); R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3055; p&lt;0.001. The correlation is representative of the individual data points presented as mean values ± SD (error bars). (<bold>S1b</bold>) Representative image of nuclear and cytoplasmic preparations with the cytoplasmic marker LDH present only in the cytoplasm and the nuclear marker p84 present only in the nuclear fraction. (<bold>S1c</bold>) Pearson correlation between the mRNA regulation (fold change) of IL-6 and SOCS3; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5984, p&lt;0.001. The correlation is representative of the individual data points presented as mean values ± SD (error bars). (<bold>S1d</bold>) Pearson correlation between the mRNA regulation (fold change) of IL-6 and cMyc; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2876, p&lt;0.001. The correlation is representative of the individual data points presented as mean values ± SD (error bars). (<bold>S1e</bold>) Pearson correlation between the mRNA regulation (fold change) of SOCS3 and cMyc; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5406, p&lt;0.001. The correlation is representative of the individual data points presented as mean values ± SD (error bars). (<bold>S1f</bold>) Representative image of a muscle cross section stained with only the secondary and hematoxylin during the cMyc staining protocol. Note that there is no brown colour change indicating no false positivity caused from the addition of the secondary antibody.</p>
