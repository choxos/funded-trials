                <p id="Par1">Enzyme and chaperone therapies are used to treat Fabry disease. Such treatments are expensive and require intrusive biweekly infusions; they are also not particularly efficacious. In this pilot, single-arm study (NCT02800070), five adult males with Type 1 (classical) phenotype Fabry disease were infused with autologous lentivirus-transduced, CD34<sup>+</sup>-selected, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells engineered to express alpha-galactosidase A (Î±-gal A). Safety and toxicity are the primary endpoints. The non-myeloablative preparative regimen consisted of intravenous melphalan. No serious adverse events (AEs) are attributable to the investigational product. All patients produced Î±-gal A to near normal levels within one week. Vector is detected in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, plasma and leukocytes demonstrate Î±-gal A activity within or above the reference range, and reductions in plasma and urine globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>) are seen. While the study and evaluations are still ongoing, the first patient is nearly three years post-infusion. Three patients have elected to discontinue enzyme therapy.</p>

              <p id="Par3">In Fabry disease, mutations of the X-linked <italic>GLA</italic> gene lead to accumulation of glycosphingolipids including globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This results in end-organ damage to the kidneys, heart, and brain leading to a decreased life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Current approved treatments for Fabry disease include enzyme therapy (ET) and an oral pharmacologic chaperone (migalastat)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Biweekly ET can reduce Gb<sub>3</sub> levels in urine, plasma, and tissues but is intrusive, not curative, and progressive disease continues to cause clinical symptoms and a decreased lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, antibody formation directed against the recombinant enzyme occurs, which may affect therapy outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The short plasma half-life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> requires biweekly infusions at considerable cost. Despite these issues, ET is recommended for treatment of Fabry patients to prevent progression in conjunction with nonspecific adjunctive therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Migalastat is protein-variant specific, and therefore only available to a subset of Fabry patients with amenable mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Gene therapy, in theory, would enable Fabry patients to receive a single treatment that could be more effective than current options and free them from ET. Transduced cell populations that continuously produce Î±-gal A may be more effective clinically. As well, cross-correction may make Fabry disease particularly amenable to gene therapy; enabling systemic correction with a lower number of vector transduced cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Transgenic mice, with tissue Î±-gal A activity &gt;10,000 times endogenous levels, were healthy and did not have altered cyto-architecture;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> thus high levels of Î±-gal A may not be deleterious.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In a pilot safety study, we have targeted enriched CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for lentivirus (LV)-mediated gene therapy in patients with Fabry disease (NCT02800070, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Transduced HSPCs may deliver the functional enzyme to sites not accessible to ET. HSPC progeny may be a major source of Gb<sub>3</sub> and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>; this may correct substrate accumulation at the point of origin. Use of autologous primitive HSPCs with conditioning may facilitate immune tolerance. We employed a recombinant LV with a self-inactivating LTR design and an optimized Kozak start sequence to deliver a human codon-optimized Î±-gal A transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A single ex vivo LV transduction allowed for controlled dosing of the vector with a relatively low multiplicity of infection that should minimize insertional mutagenesis events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We also utilized reduced-intensity melphalan conditioning, enabling outpatient management, fewer Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and reduced cost. We report safety and outcome measures of the first gene therapy trial for Fabry disease.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study schema.</title><p>Five men with Type I Fabry disease were infused with autologous transduced CD34<sup>+</sup>-selected hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells engineered to express Î±-galactosidase A (Î±-gal A) following mild ablation.

                <p id="Par7">The primary objectives of this study were to determine the safety and toxicity of autologous stem cell transplantation with mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic cells transduced with a lentiviral vector containing human codon-optimized Î±-gal A cDNAÂ in adult male Fabry disease patients. Several secondary objectives were analyzed including monitoring levels of Î±-gal A activity in plasma, peripheral blood leukocytes and bone-marrow-derived mononuclear cells, and measuring levels of Gb<sub>3</sub> and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> in plasma and urine. In addition, the transduction efficiency of CD34+ hematopoietic cells was assessed as well as the presence and persistence of marked cells expressing Î±-gal A in peripheral blood. An exploratory objective was also incorporated to track the levels of anti-Î±-gal A antibodies in recipients. The primary endpoint of this study was toxicity as assessed using the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03. Because of the small sample size of this clinical study, there was insufficient power for comprehensive statistical analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par16">In this pilot clinical trial of LV-mediated gene therapy in 5 men with Type 1 (classical) Fabry disease, all patients demonstrated a sustained safety profile. One patient is now out nearly 3 years from hisÂ infusion date. We chose a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for drug product engraftment, based on many years of transplant experience with melphalan in Toronto. Since there is limited experience with transplant conditioning procedures in Fabry patients, and Fabry disease patients have considerable comorbidities, we also wanted to establish whether mobilization and engraftment could be tolerated in this population. All patients received a low melphalan dose; 3 men (Patients 1, 4, and 5) received the treatment as an outpatient and returned home the same day. Full ablation regimens may require lengthy hospital stays and result in additional AEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">We demonstrated efficient LV-mediated gene transfer into enriched Fabry patient CD34+ cells. VCN levels were modest, minimizing the chance of genotoxicity. Our regimen led to increased circulating and intracellular Î±-gal A activity. All patients reached reference range levels. Values declined over time, possibly due to an exhaustion of transduced short-term repopulating HSPCs, but remained above what is typically observed in Fabry patients and well above pretreatment levels in all five cases. Whether the enzyme values reach an asymptote reflecting engraftment of transduced long-term HSPCs remains to be determined. VCN and Î±-gal A activities were well correlated, underscoring the fidelity of our therapeutic LV construct. Patient weight, eGFR, proteinuria and LVMI were stable for all patients throughout the study period (ranging from 12-33 months post-infusion), with the exception of Patient 2 who is showing symptoms of chronic kidney disease associated with his Fabry disease. Plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> levels decreased in all patients with the exception of Patient 4 where an increase was observed. Plasma Gb<sub>3</sub> levels were generally stable in all patients, except for increases at later time points in Patients 2 and 3. Urine lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> values were increased in Patient 1, stable in Patient 4, and decreased in Patients 2, 3 and 5. Finally, urine Gb<sub>3</sub> levels were stable in Patients 2 and 5 who continued ET after gene therapy, but were observed to increase in Patients 1, 3, and 4 who elected to withdraw from their ET infusions. Interestingly, Patient 3 who chose to stop ET prior to mobilization had sustained low levels of plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> and urine lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>; a result of the gene therapy product alone.</p>
              <p id="Par18">It is possible that a more myelo-suppressive conditioning regimen would result in better engraftment of LV/AGA transduced cellsâ€”although this hypothesis remains to be tested. In selection of a partial myeloablative conditioning regimen, we considered that our prospective patients were relatively healthy males with Fabry disease who were receiving ET prior to recruitment to our trial. Unlike most other acute disorders that have been treated by gene therapy, Fabry disease is a chronic disease. As such, our clinical team and our regulatory body were reluctant to implement a full myeloablative conditioning regimen. Such protocols are more invasive, are accompanied by aÂ greater number of adverse events, and have the potential for future oncogenic events. Likewise, infection of our target cells at a higher MOI or multiple infection courses may also lead to higher transgene expression; however, GMP-grade, recombinant LV was already limiting in our trial.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Host immunity to ET is thought to limit therapeutic efficacy; and, it is unknown whether gene therapy might exacerbate anti-Î±-gal A antibody responses. Each of the three patients (Patients 3â€“5) who had pre-existing anti-enzyme IgG antibodies had nearly complete elimination of titers after the gene therapy intervention without resurgence of levels despite continuous enzyme exposure from the transduced cell-derived source. Only one patient (Patient 1) had an onset of antibody titer to enzyme, which diminished over time. Two patients (Patients 2 and 5) remained antibody titer negative after gene therapy. We conclude that gene therapy is not only not highly immunogenic, but may also reduce pre-existing immunity to foreign ET.</p>
              <p id="Par20">If successful, LV-mediated gene therapy may result in beneficial outcomes for Fabry patients with a single treatment. No serious safety concerns were observed in our pilot trial. All Fabry patients in this study were responsive to the LV-mediated gene therapy at some level. Three patients have discontinued ET to date. Recipients had detectable levels of VCN in PB and BM, plasma and leukocyte Î±-gal A-specific activity above or within the reference range, and reductions in Gb<sub>3</sub> and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> levels. Gene therapy may be an effective treatment option in patients with Fabry disease but requires more study.</p>

All steps of mobilization, apheresis, conditioning, and transplantation occurred at the relevant site for each patient. Patients were initially mobilized with filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF] 16â€‰Âµg/kg). If peripheral blood CD34<sup>+</sup> counts were low (i.e., if the predicted CD34<sup>+</sup> count was &lt;50% of our target of 12.5â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>6</sup>/kg), filgrastim was supplemented with plerixafor (240â€‰Âµg/kg). Three patients were mobilized with filgrastim and plerixafor; for one patient this occurred because of a site preference for this regimen. A backup graft of at least 2.5â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>6</sup> unmanipulated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg was harvested from each patient for utilization in the event of graft failure. After apheresis, the nucleated cells were transported to the Juravinski Cancer Centre, Hamilton, ON, for CD34<sup>+</sup> cell enrichment. Cells were then transported to the Orsino Cell Processing Laboratory, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, for the lentiviral transductions. The transduction protocol was described in detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Quality control was performed: cell viability, evaluation of Î±-gal A activity in the transduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cell population, and VCN were evaluated. After cryopreservation and safety/sterility testing, and an approved Certificate of Analysis from Health Canada, the drug product was transported back to the stem cell center of origin. Patients received melphalan (100â€‰mg/m<sup>2</sup>) intravenously one day prior to autologous drug product infusion (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After we observed prolonged Î±-gal A activity in both leukocytes and plasma of Patient 1, the protocol was amended to allow patients to discontinue ET after an appropriate consultation/consent procedure.

Research Ethics Board (REB) approval was provided by University Health Network Research Ethics Board, Alberta Health Services Research Ethics Board, Capital Health Services Research Ethics Board, Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics and the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. This study was designed by the Fabry Disease Clinical Research and Therapeutics (FACTs) team. Clinical trial management was performed by Ozmosis Research, Inc., of Toronto, Canada. Clinical data were collected by the investigators of the FACTs team who were responsible for clinical assessments during the Treatment Phase and long-term follow-up. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed monthly by the FACTs team. Clinical decisions and safety monitoring for each patient were completed by a Clinical Trial Steering Committee (CTSC) of the FACTs team. Safety review meetings were conducted by the CTSC 1 month after the transplant date for each patient. The next patient was then eligible for recruitment to the study only after the CTSC reviewed all of the safety data and unanimously concluded that there have been no treatment-related serious adverse events. A Data Monitoring Safety Committee (DSMC) reviewed clinical and safety data after the Treatment Phase for Patients 1 and 3. Interim analysis and publication of this clinical trial was authorised by the DSMC. As this is the first lentivirus-directed gene therapy trial to focus on adults with a lysosomal storage disorder, the DSMC supported reporting of safety data up to 1-year post-infusion of each patient.</p>
