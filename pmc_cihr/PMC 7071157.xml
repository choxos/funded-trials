                <p>Spontaneous preterm birth is associated with vaginal microbial dysbiosis. As certain strains of lactobacilli help restore homeostasis in non-pregnant women, the goal was to determine the effect of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> RC-14 administered orally, twice daily for 12 weeks on the vaginal microbiota, cytokines and chemokines of low-risk pregnant women. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing probiotic lactobacilli to placebo daily was performed in 86 asymptomatic pregnant women who had an Intermediate or Bacterial Vaginosis Nugent score at 13 weeks. After drop outs, 32 women receiving probiotics and 34 receiving placebo completed the study. The Nugent score returned to normal in 30% of the women in both groups at 28 weeks and was maintained until 35 weeks. The majority of subjects had normal pregnancy outcomes. Ninety-three bacterial species were detected at 13 weeks, with <italic>Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> being the most abundant across pregnancy. There was no difference in the Shannon diversity index between the probiotic and placebo groups at 13, 28 or 35 weeks. Almost all subjects consumed fermented foods and many of the organisms in the vagina are also known to be present in fermented foods. Interleukin-4 in the placebo group and Interleukin-10 in both probiotic and placebo groups increased slightly at 28 weeks but were not different at 35 weeks when compared to 13 weeks. In conclusion, this study showed no adverse issues resulting from 12 week use of probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains GR-1 and RC-14 during pregnancy in women at low risk for premature birth. The vaginal microbiota demonstrated flux irrespective of this oral probiotic administration. </p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Healthy human vaginal microbiota, characterized by the dominance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp., plays an important role in reproductive health and disease. Lactobacilli prevent the overgrowth of pathogens by various mechanisms [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), an altered vaginal microbiota associated with preterm birth (PTB), is characterized by a depletion of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of facultative anaerobic bacteria [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The predominance of pro-inflammatory cytokines over anti-inflammatory cytokines is associated with early onset of labor [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. BV is associated with elevated vaginal concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β and chemokine IL-8, both of which are also elevated in the amniotic fluid and cervical fluid of women with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and preterm delivery [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p>
              <p>A Gram stain-based Nugent’s score of 7–10 is widely used to indicate BV [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. High throughput sequencing techniques to characterize the human vaginal microbiota overcome the inability to grow some microorganisms and the underestimation of vaginal diversity [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several studies have characterized the vaginal microbiota of healthy pregnant [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and non-pregnant women [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] using these methods. </p>
              <p>Probiotics are defined as “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Probiotic lactobacilli can ameliorate BV and replenish lactobacilli in the vagina of non-pregnant women [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and reduce recurrence of urinary tract infections [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The rationale for selecting probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 (GR-1) and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> RC-14 (RC-14) was derived from a previous study in non-pregnant women, in which treatment with GR-1 and RC-14 (10<sup>9</sup> cfu) reduced BV occurrence and recurrence [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, GR-1 supernatant possesses anti-inflammatory properties in cultured human intrauterine tissues [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], mouse macrophages [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and can reduce inflammation-associated PTB in pregnant mice [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We hypothesized that oral administration of GR-1 and RC-14 would present no safety issues and could positively influence the vaginal microbiota, as well as dampen the vaginal concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. </p>

                <title>2.1. Study Participants</title>
                <p>Pregnant women with no symptoms of vaginal infections were recruited at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), Toronto, Canada. Subjects were over 18 years of age, prior to 17 weeks of gestation, had singleton pregnancies and could provide informed consent. Subjects were excluded if they had multi-fetal pregnancies, fetal complications, a history of previous PTB, second trimester loss, significant maternal medical/surgical complications or HIV. The study was approved by the MSH Research Ethics Board (Approval Number 08-0005-A) following the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki and was registered with <uri>ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> (Number NCTO1697683). </p>
                <p>As part of the Baseline Eligibility Assessment, information regarding pre-pregnancy weight and height, ethnicity, mode of conception, folic acid intake prior to conception and during the pregnancy, presence or absence of unprotected sex in the previous 4 days, obstetrical history, pre-existing medical conditions, current medications, allergies, smoking, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use during the pregnancy, vaginal and urinary tract infections, antibiotic use during the pregnancy and ingestion of probiotics or fermented foods (yogurt) was obtained. </p>
                <p>Vaginal Swabs were collected under direct visualization using a speculum. Dacron swabs were placed in the posterior fornix or lateral vaginal wall for 10 seconds and then smeared on a glass slide for Nugent scoring. Three additional Dacron swabs were collected using the same technique and stored at -80 for future DNA, cytokine and chemokine analysis. </p>

                <p>A Z test was used to determine the sample size with alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.8, giving a per-group sample size of 40 women to detect a difference between an asymptomatic Intermediate/BV prevalence of 30% in the probiotic group and 60% in the placebo group at the end of treatment protocol. This was increased to 43 in each group to compensate for 5% lost to follow-up. Subjects were randomized using a web-based service to receive two identical looking capsules per day containing either GR-1 and RC-14 or placebo given orally for 12 weeks. Vaginal swabs were collected at 13-, 28- and 35 weeks of gestation and analyzed for Nugent score, cytokines, chemokines and microbiota. Fourteen subjects were lost to follow-up or withdrew, 3 had taken less than 25% of the capsules, and there was insufficient sample for analysis in 3 others. This left 32 subjects in the probiotic and 34 in the placebo group with samples available for sequencing analysis and samples from 31 probiotic and 33 placebo subjects for cytokines and chemokine analysis. </p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>This study showed that 12-week oral administration of probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains GR-1 and RC-14 is safe for use during low-risk pregnancy. The rate of preterm labor was too low to determine whether probiotic therapy had an impact, similar to a previous large study [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. </p>
              <p>The Nugent scoring system indicated that the subjects had either BV or an Intermediate status, yet lactobacilli dominated the vagina in more than one third of them at 13 weeks of gestation. This indicates the unreliability of the Nugent scoring system for diagnosis [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A DNA level of ≥10<sup>9</sup> copies/mL for <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and ≥10<sup>8</sup> copies/mL for <italic>A. vaginae</italic> has a 95% sensitivity and positive predictive value, and 99% specificity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of BV, much higher than the Nugent score [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Of note, there was no difference in pregnancy outcomes between women who had an Intermediate Nugent score at 13 weeks when compared to those with BV.</p>
              <p>The probiotic dosage was based upon studies in non-pregnant women [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We now know that pregnant women have a higher abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. including <italic>L. crispatus, L. gasseri</italic> and <italic>L. jensenii,</italic> and a more resilient microbiota than non-pregnant women [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, the finding that the three months of probiotic therapy did not alter the microbiota may reflect too low a dose, or an inability to displace indigenous lactobacilli [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Of note, as metabolomics were not performed, we cannot state whether the microbiota function was altered or not as a result of the probiotic administration. </p>
              <p>The high prevalence of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> as a vaginal commensal was unexpected as this species is not one of the five (<italic>L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri, L. jensenii</italic> and <italic>L. reuteri or L. vaginalis</italic>, depending on the country) detected in most microbiota studies of healthy women [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This may have been a result of the subjects ingesting fermented foods during the study. Presence of these strains may have been a barrier to <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 persistence given the point made above that probiotic lactobacilli do not persist if the same species is already present in the indigenous microbiota [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. </p>
              <p>An interesting finding was the high incidence of consumption of fermented foods. This led to the suggestion that it may have resulted in more <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> being present in the vagina. Many of the genera identified can be found in fermented foods [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], raising the possibility that consumption of these foods may provide bacteria that are beneficial to vaginal health during pregnancy. </p>
              <p>The elasticity of the vaginal microbiota, in agreement with a previous study [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], was observed by a decline in <italic>A. vaginae</italic>, <italic>A. rimae</italic> and <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>.

              <p>Previous studies in term-cultured human intra-uterine tissues and in pregnant mice, demonstrated that <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 supernatant possesses anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As the current subjects did not have an underlying state of inflammation, no anti-inflammatory induction was necessary. The use of probiotics administered intravaginally, including the GR-1 and RC-14 strains, may be more likely to influence the microbiota as well as the inflammatory status [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, there was a shift towards an anti-inflammatory environment across gestation, as was made evident by an increase in vaginal IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations at 28 weeks, which were in a comparable range with previous studies [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. CSF3, which is important in placentation and neutrophil progenitor proliferation, differentiation and survival, decreased with advancing gestational age. CSF3 possesses anti-inflammatory properties in cultured human placental trophoblast cells [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, elevated maternal CSF3 concentrations have also been associated with spontaneous PTB in humans [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. </p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study showed that oral probiotic treatment with probiotic GR-1 and RC-14 did not result in adverse outcomes, in agreement with other studies [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B56-nutrients-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The characteristics of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GR-1 determined in vitro that predicted an ability to alter the vaginal environment of pregnant women via oral administration, did not translate to humans when the organism was administered orally with <italic>L. reuteri</italic> RC-14. That said, many women delivered normally which suggests that the probiotic was not essential for health in women consuming fermented foods, and the cohort was not devoid of lactobacilli or at risk of preterm labor. Future studies of probiotics should include women at risk of preterm delivery, administer a higher lactobacilli oral dose or use intravaginal instillation and more closely examine fermented food products and regularity of consumption. </p>
