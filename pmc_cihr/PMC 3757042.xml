                <p>The adhesion of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to receptors on different host cells plays a divergent yet critical role in determining the progression and outcome of the infection. Based on our ex vivo studies with clinical parasite isolates from adult Thai patients, we have previously proposed a paradigm for IRBC cytoadherence under physiological shear stress that consists of a recruitment cascade mediated largely by P-selectin, ICAM-1 and CD36 on primary human dermal microvascular endothelium (HDMEC). In addition, we detected post-adhesion signaling events involving Src family kinases and the adaptor protein p130CAS in endothelial cells that lead to CD36 clustering and cytoskeletal rearrangement which enhance the magnitude of the adhesive strength, allowing adherent IRBC to withstand shear stress of up to 20 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>. In this study, we addressed whether CD36 supports IRBC adhesion as part of an assembly of membrane receptors. Using a combination of flow chamber assay, atomic force and confocal microscopy, we showed for the first time by loss- and gain-of function assays that in the resting state, the integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> does not support adhesive interactions between IRBC and HDMEC. Upon IRBC adhesion to CD36, the integrin is recruited either passively as part of a molecular complex with CD36, or actively to the site of IRBC attachment through phosphorylation of Src family kinases, a process that is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent. Clustering of β<sub>1</sub> integrin is associated with an increase in IRBC recruitment as well as in adhesive strength after attachment (∼40% in both cases). The adhesion of IRBC to a multimolecular complex on the surface of endothelial cells could be of critical importance in enabling adherent IRBC to withstand the high shear stress in the microcirculations. Targeting integrins may provide a novel approach to decrease IRBC cytoadherence to microvascular endothelium.</p>

                <p>Of the several species of malaria parasites that infect humans, disease caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for most of the deaths. The unique pathological finding of this infection is the intense adhesion of infected red blood cells (IRBC) in the microcirculation, resulting in obstruction to blood flow and organ dysfunction. The focus of our research is to identify the molecules on host endothelial cells that support the adhesion as potential therapeutic targets. In this report, we showed for the first time a functional association between CD36, a well studied adhesion molecule for parasite adhesion, and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, a member of the integrin family of adhesion molecules that are important for adhesion of leukocytes to blood vessels and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We found that by itself, α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin does not support IRBC adhesion. When IRBC adhere to CD36, the integrin is recruited to the site of adhesion through activation of the Src family kinase signaling pathway. As a result, both the number of adherent IRBC and the strength with which they adhere is greatly increased. These results demonstrate that IRBC adhesion is a dynamic and complex process. We need to identify each of the functional components to design anti-adhesive therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cell-cell interaction in the microvasculature is a complex process that involves multiple ligands and receptors that mediate different types of adhesive behavior in a sequential manner. The adhesive cascade is best studied in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions that includes leukocyte tethering, crawling, rolling and adhesion on endothelium, followed by transmigration of leukocytes into extravascular tissues <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The strength of the interaction between ligands and receptors at each stage of the cascade can be qualitatively or quantitatively regulated by molecular events such as conformational change of the adhesion molecules, and/or intracellular signaling in both leukocytes and endothelial cells leading to modification of biological processes such as calcium flux, protein phosphorylation, cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Legate1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The adhesive interaction between <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) with vascular endothelium, the most consistent pathological finding in the human infection, is also governed by similar molecular mechanisms. Based on our findings with clinical parasite isolates obtained directly from infected patients, we have previously proposed a paradigm for IRBC cytoadherence under flow conditions that consists of a recruitment component that involves tethering, rolling and adhesion of IRBC that is mediated largely by P-selectin, ICAM-1 and CD36 respectively on primary human dermal microvascular endothelium (HDMEC) <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yipp1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yipp2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, we detected post-adhesion signaling events involving Src family kinases and the adaptor protein p130CAS in endothelial cells that lead to receptor clustering and cytoskeletal rearrangement which in turn enhance the magnitude of the adhesive strength, allowing adherent IRBC to withstand higher shear stress <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yipp3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Intracellular signaling in endothelial cell lines has also been shown for parasite lines and clones selected to adhere to ICAM-1 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Together, these findings underscore the complexity of the cytoadherence process in the vasculature that might not be appreciated when studied as isolated ligand-receptor interactions on recombinant proteins or transfectants <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Ochola1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Janes1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Bengtsson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The class B scavenger molecule CD36 has a unique relationship with IRBC. CD36 is highly expressed in vital organs such as the lung, liver and kidney <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and scantily in the brain <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. CD36-mediated cytoadherence may contribute to dysfunction in these organs by impairing microcirculatory blood flow, although a direct link between IRBC adhesion to CD36 or any other receptor on primary endothelium under flow conditions has not been established. A recent report on <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection in mice suggests that CD36-dependent tissue sequestration may also promote parasite growth and other parasite survival benefits <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Fonager1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This long suspected association makes teleological sense as cytoadherence has likely evolved as a mechanism for host evasion. On the other hand, platelets have been shown to have a direct cytotoxic effect on IRBC adherent on CD36 through the release of platelet factor 4 (PF4) that binds to the Duffy blood group antigen on erythrocytes<xref rid="ppat.1003590-McMorran1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. PF4 acts by its lytic activity on the food vacuole of the intraerythrocytic parasite while sparing the red cell membrane <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Love1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Collectively, these findings indicate that IRBC can interact with CD36 on different host cells with diverse biological effects.</p>
              <p>An important question regarding IRBC–host cell interaction that has not been addressed is whether CD36 supports IRBC adhesion alone, or as part of an assembly of membrane receptors as it does in response to fibrillar α-amyloid <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Bamberger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Koenigsknecht1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The engagement and focal aggregation of the receptors following initial IRBC adhesion may lead to the formation of a functional complex which increases the strength of the adhesive interactions critical for determining adhesion in the microvasculature in vivo. IRBC could bind directly to multiple host surface molecules through different domains on the cytoadherent parasite ligand <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Alternatively, the involvement of other membrane receptors may occur downstream of CD36 ligation by being recruited to the site of adhesion where cross-talk between signaling molecules is facilitated <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In either scenario, integrins, a family of heterodimeric, non-covalently bound cell surface receptors, are likely candidate molecules to be involved, as they promote adhesion to other cells and matrix proteins, and are often associated physically and functionally with CD36 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Thorne1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Indeed, CD36 is known to guide integrins into signaling rafts, and in so doing, may regulate integrin function. IRBC may bind to integrins directly through the tri-amino acid motif arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) present on PfEMP1 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Baruch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, or interact with integrins through binding to thrombospondin-1(TSP-1) <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In support of a role for integrins in cytoadherence, an anti-α<sub>v</sub> antibody has been reported to partially inhibit the adhesion of a laboratory-adapted parasite line to HDMEC under flow conditions in vitro <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Siano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. There is also evidence that IRBC and apoptotic leukocytes could downregulate dendritic cell function through CD36 or α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>
<xref rid="ppat.1003590-Urban1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. As over 250 anti-integrin drugs have now entered clinical trials <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, an understanding of the role of integrins in cytoadherence may lead to the novel application of some of the available agents as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria.</p>
              <p>In this study, we used a combination of flow chamber assay, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal microscopy to investigate the role of integrins in cytoadherence. Our results reveal a novel and robust co-operative association of CD36 with the integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> in microvascular endothelium as a result of Src family kinase signaling. The formation of an IRBC-endothelial cell synapse consisting of multiple adhesion molecules contributes significantly to overall IRBC recruitment and adhesive strength. Identification of the dynamic interactions among all binding partners for IRBC on primary endothelial cells will provide a theoretical basis for the rational design of anti-adhesive therapy.</p>

In this study, we focused on α<sub>v,</sub> α<sub>5</sub> and β<sub>1</sub> that have been shown to be associated with CD36 on HDMEC by both an antibody array and by co-immunoprecipitation <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Kazerounian1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. All 4 proteins were shown to be surface expressed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003590.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003590.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The latter findings indicate that the integrin molecules are expressed on the luminal surface of endothelial monolayers and are therefore available for interaction with IRBC.</p>

                <p>To begin to assess a role for integrins in IRBC adhesion, HDMEC monolayers were pretreated with 5 to 50 µM of the integrin antagonist RGD (H-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-OH) for 30 min at 37°C before the infusion of IRBC in a flow chamber assay. The IRBC used was a lab adapted clone 7G8 that binds to both CD36 and ICAM-1. The results indicate that RGD inhibited IRBC adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), while the control peptide RAD (H-Gly-Arg-Ala-Asp-Ser-Pro-OH) had no effect. The decrease in the total number of adherent IRBC on RGD treated monolayers was associated with an increase in the number of rolling cells that did not adhere (control 52±8 vs RGD 95±12 cells/7 min, n = 6, p = 0.0034), suggesting that integrins are critical for firm adhesion to occur.</p>

                <p>It has been previously reported that an anti-α<sub>v</sub> antibody inhibited IRBC adhesion to HDMEC <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Siano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The integrin was assumed to be α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> by the authors and in subsequent publications <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Chakravorty1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, but the finding has never been confirmed. To determine if α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> could mediate IRBC adhesion, we pre-incubated HDMEC with the cylic peptide cRGDfV (cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val)) that is a specific inhibitor for the α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub> integrins <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In contrast to RGD, the cyclic peptide at 20 µM had no effect on cytoadherence of 7G8 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
                <p>To confirm that the ability of IRBC to interact with integrins is not acquired as a result of prolonged passage in the laboratory, flow chamber experiments were performed with clinical parasite isolates. As in the case with 7G8, adhesion of cryopreserved IRBC from acutely infected patients, cultured for 24 to 36 h, was inhibited by RGD at 20 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, cytoadherence of the clinical isolates was reduced by the inhibitory anti-β<sub>1</sub> mAb TDM29 (10 µg/ml) but not the activating anti-β<sub>1</sub> mAb TS2/16 (10 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Inhibition of adhesion was also seen with the anti-α<sub>5</sub> mAb JBS5 (10 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that binding of IRBC is to an epitope involving both subunits of the heterodimer. Consistent with the results obtained with cRGDfV, an inhibitory anti-α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> mAb 23C6 (10 µg/ml) did not affect cytoadherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

An IRBC attached to the cantilever by dopamine hydrochloride was brought into contact with an endothelial cell using a contact force of 150 pN at a steady velocity of 1.5 µm sec<sup>−1</sup>. These parameters were chosen because they approximate the marginating force experienced by a more rigid IRBC as it is pushed from centreline blood flow towards the vessel wall by NRBC. Upon contact, the IRBC and HDMEC were allowed to remain in contact for 5 min before it was withdrawn at the same velocity. Adhesive strength was measured as the force required for detachment of the IRBC from an HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In a previous study, we found that the detachment force between IRBC and HDMEC increased rapidly with the duration of contact, so that the magnitude of the force could be 5 to 6 fold higher by the end of 5 min <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The resulting increase in adhesion strength enabled adherent IRBC to withstand shear stress of up to 20 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                <title>IRBC binds to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> only in the presence of CD36</title>
                <p>The inhibitory effect of an antagonist peptide and mAb to the integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> suggest that IRBC may be binding directly to the integrin. Indeed, RGD motifs have been demonstrated in several DBL domains of the cytoadherent ligand PfEMP1 in a number of parasite lines <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Baruch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These parasite RGD motifs could potentially interact with endothelial integrins and contribute to the overall adhesive force between IRBC and endothelium. To determine if IRBC can bind to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> under flow conditions, IRBC were infused over HMEC-1 monolayers. This endothelial cell line, derived from HDMEC, does not express CD36 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, or only at a very low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, the α<sub>5</sub> and β<sub>1</sub> integrins are highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that &lt;5 IRBC/mm<sup>2</sup> rolled and/or adhered on HMEC-1 for the total duration of a 7-min infusion in the flow chamber assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, when HMEC-1 was tranduced with CD36-GFP, but not GFP alone, there was a dramatic increase in IRBC adhesion that was reduced by pre-treatment of the monolayer with RGD. A similar effect of CD36 on β<sub>1</sub> integrin function was detected by AFM, as indicated by an increase in adhesive force on CD36 transduced cells that was partially inhibited by pre-treatment of the monolayer with RGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that in its resting state, β<sub>1</sub> integrin by itself is unable to support IRBC adhesion under flow conditions. The presence of CD36 may lead to proadhesive changes of β<sub>1</sub> integrin through changes in i) integrin surface expression, ii) conformation or iii) subcellular localization.</p>

                <p>To determine the mechanism of CD36-β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction with respect to cytoadherence, we first determined if the presence of CD36 modulated surface expression of β<sub>1</sub> integrin using HMEC-1 cells. No increase in β<sub>1</sub> integrin expression on HMEC-1 was seen by flow cytometry after the transduction of CD36 (data not shown). The contribution of conformational changes was also unlikely as neither the activating β<sub>1</sub> antibody TS2/16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) nor the addition of 1 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> (data not shown), both of which activate β<sub>1</sub> integrin <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Arroya1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, had any effect on IRBC adhesion. The most likely mechanism is integrin clustering. Indeed, clustering of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as a result of lateral diffusion has been demonstrated to increase adhesive strength between the integrin and its natural ligand fibronectin, while clustering of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> contributes to mechanotransduction <xref rid="ppat.1003590-RocaCusachs1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p>
                <p>To determine if β<sub>1</sub> integrin is recruited upon IRBC adhesion, IRBC purified on a magnetic bead separation column (Miltenyi Biotec,Auburn, CA) were allowed to adhere to HDMEC. A labeled anti-β<sub>1</sub> antibody was added and endothelial cells were observed by live cell imaging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows that β<sub>1</sub> integrin was recruited to the site of IRBC adhesion within minutes of the adhesion process. Moreover, the recruited β<sub>1</sub> integrin forms a cup-shaped protrusion around the IRBC on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, β<sub>1</sub> integrin clustering was also seen with polystyrene beads coated with an anti-CD36 mAb FA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), or the recombinant PpMC-179 peptide representing the minimal binding domain of PfEMP1 (residues 88–267 of the CIDR domain of the parasite strain Malayan Camp) for CD36 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Baruch2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The results suggest that β<sub>1</sub> integrin recruitment likely occurred as a result of CD36 ligation, either passively as a member of a molecular complex with CD36, or as a result of recruitment downstream of CD36 ligation. The recruitment of β<sub>1</sub> integrin by CD36 was specific, as anti-CD36 coated beads did not recruit ICAM-1 on HDMEC transduced with GFP-ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Compared to anti-CD36 coated beads, anti-ICAM-1 coated beads recruited much less β<sub>1</sub> on TNF-α-stimulated endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g007">Figure 7F and 7G</xref>).</p>

                <p>If α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> clustering occurs downstream of CD36 ligation by IRBC, one would expect that the process would be mediated by Src family kinases that are activated by the binding of IRBC to CD36 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yipp3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The possibility was investigated with anti-CD36 coated beads using PP1, a specific Src family kinase inhibitor and its inactive analog PP3. The requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> was also investigated by preincubating HDMEC with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. Similar to the effects of the inhibitors on CD36 and actin recruitment <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, β<sub>1</sub> integrin recruitment in response to anti-CD36 coated beads was significantly reduced by these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g009">Figure 9A and B</xref>). In contrast, neither RGD nor anti-β<sub>1</sub> antibody had any effect on the recruitment of β<sub>1</sub> integrin or CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g009">Figure 9C</xref>), or actin and phosphorylated Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). Consistent with these observations, neither RGD nor anti-β<sub>1</sub> mAb had any effect on the force of detachment of anti-CD36 coated beads as measured by AFM (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that β<sub>1</sub> integrin clustering occurs as a downstream event of CD36 ligation and subsequent signaling events, and not through extracellular integrin activation.</p>

                <title>β<sub>1</sub> integrin clustering increases the binding avidity with IRBC</title>
                <p>Lateral diffusion of the β<sub>2</sub> integrin LFA-1, as detected by single molecule tracking, can be induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and low dose cytochalasin D in lymphocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Kucik1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and monocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The resulting integrin clustering leads to an increase in the number of adherent leukocytes on ICAM-1. To determine if PMA could also affect integrin interaction with IRBC, we performed the flow chamber assay with HMEC-1 monolayers with or without pre-treatment with PMA (50 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. HMEC-1 cells were utilized in these experiments to allow for an assessment of IRBC adhesion directly to integrins in response to PMA in the absence of CD36. Fewer than 5 IRBC adhered on either untreated or treated monolayers under flow conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). However, PMA treatment significantly increased the number of IRBC that adhered in a static binding assay. In these experiments, monolayers were pre-treated with either 50 ng/ml of PMA alone for 30 min at 37°C, or 100 µM RGD or RAD peptide added after 10 min of incubation. At the end of 30 min, 1 ml of a 1% hematocrit suspension of IRBC in RPMI at 5–9% parasitemia was added and allowed to adhere for 20 min. The 35 mm dish with the HMEC-1 monolayer and IRBC was then mounted into the flow chamber system. HBSS was infused at 1 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the number of adherent cells was counted at 30 sec intervals for a total of 4 min and the mean taken. The results suggest that while PMA stimulation did not increase IRBC adhesion under flow conditions, the adhesion of IRBC to PMA-stimulated HMEC-1 was significantly increased when the IRBC were allowed to bind under static conditions. Moreover, the enhancing effect of PMA was abrogated by pre-treatment of the HMEC-1 monolayers with RGD but not RAD. The increase in the number of adherent IRBC on PMA-stimulated monolayers was not associated with an increase in CD36, β<sub>1</sub> integrin or ICAM-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003590-g010">Figure 10B</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The adhesion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red cells to host endothelial cells in vital organs such as the brain and lung plays a fundamental role in the progression and outcome of the infection <xref rid="ppat.1003590-White1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In this report, we showed for the first time by loss- and gain-of function assays that the integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> may have a significant role in this pathological process on human microvascular endothelium. Our data suggests that in the resting state, α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> does not support adhesive interactions between IRBC and HDMEC. Upon IRBC adhesion to CD36, the integrin is either recruited passively as part of a molecular complex with CD36, or recruited actively to the site of IRBC attachment on CD36 ligation through phosphorylation of Src family kinases, a process that is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent. Clustering of b<sub>1</sub> integrin is associated with an increase in IRBC recruitment under flow conditions as well as an increase in adhesive strength after attachment on both unstimulated and TNF-α-stimulated endothelium. Conformational change of the integrin does not appear to play a role, as neither an activating antibody nor Mn<sup>2+</sup> had any effect on IRBC adhesion. The binding of IRBC to clustered β<sub>1</sub> could be inhibited by RGD and inhibitory antibodies to β<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>5</sub> integrins.</p>
              <p>As adhesion molecule expression can be affected by cytokines in the microenvironment, we also tested if integrins would have a role in IRBC adhesion to TNF-α-stimulated HDMEC. We found that TNF-α did not affect the surface expression of α<sub>5</sub> or β<sub>1</sub>, and the RGD peptide inhibited adhesion as on unstimulated endothelium. Moreover, anti-CD36 beads recruited β<sub>1</sub> integrin on stimulated endothelium. Anti-ICAM-1 and RGD inhibited IRBC adhesion to a similar degree, but their effects were not additive, suggesting that α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and ICAM-1 have a similar functional role in IRBC adhesion under flow conditions. This finding is consistent with our previous in vitro <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yipp1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and in vivo <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yipp2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> observations that for IRBC that adhere to CD36, such as most clinical isolates from Thailand, ICAM-1 plays an important accessory role in increasing the number of adherent cells by reducing their rolling velocity. The relative contribution of integrins to IRBC cytoadherence compared to adhesion molecules that are upregulated or induced on stimulated endothelium suggested by our current findings will need to be confirmed with a large number of clinical parasite isolates with different binding phenotypes.</p>
              <p>An association between integrins and CD36 has been described in several human cell types, including melanoma cells <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Thorne1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, microglial cells <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Bamberger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, platelets <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Miao1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and HDMEC <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Kazerounian1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In melanoma cells, the association between CD36 and b<sub>1</sub> integrins requires the extracellular domain of the CD36 molecule. The association may occur within raft domains, since ectopic expression of CD36 increases the proportion of β<sub>1</sub> integrins found within this fraction. In microglial cells, CD36, α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and CD47 form a receptor complex for fibrillar β-amyloid, and antagonists specific for each component inhibits phagocytosis of β-amyloid to the same extent, suggesting that each component of the receptor complex is required but not sufficient for uptake of β-amyloid. In both platelets <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Miao1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and HDMEC <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Kazerounian1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, two distinct pools of CD36 in the cell membrane have been identified. One pool of CD36 is distributed in low-density lipid rafts and co-localizes with the Src family kinases. The other pool is in the high density soluble fraction that also contain β<sub>1</sub> integrin, VEGFR-2, Syk and tetraspanins. Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is also strongly detected in the high-density fraction, and participates in the formation of the VEGFR-2-Syk-CD36 complex that regulates angiogenesis. The 40% reduction of IRBC adhesion and adhesive strength by β<sub>1</sub> integrin knock down may be mediated by this high density pool of CD36 in the cell membrane. Collectively, the evidence points to a close functional and subcellular association of CD36 with β<sub>1</sub> integrin in multiple cell types.</p>
              <p>The integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> is one of 24 known members of the integrin family of adhesion molecules that are formed by noncovalent linkage of an α and β subunit with the ligand-binding ‘head’ region of the integrin being formed by both subunits <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Takagi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> can exist in multiple conformational states, i.e. inactivated, intermediate activated, and fully activated. It can be activated by inside-out signaling or by non-physiological stimuli such as an activating antibody or extracellular Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The natural ligand of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> is the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN), a dimeric glycoprotein composed of two subunits each with multiple homologous domains named FNI, FNII, and FNIII. Optimal binding of FN to the integrin requires both the RGD motif present in FNIII domain 10 (FN10) and a synergy site located in FN9 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Mould1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The RGD motif binds to the β<sub>1</sub> subunit while the synergy site interacts with α<sub>5</sub>. AFM studies have shown that FN with RGD deletion binds weakly to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, while the force of detachment is only slightly less than wild type when the synergy site is mutated, and there is no enhancement of binding upon integrin activation <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These findings would support our results on the differential effect of β<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>5</sub> knock down on IRBC adhesion and adhesive strength. Interaction with both subunits appeared to be essential for IRBC adhesion under shear stress in the flow chamber assay. In the AFM experiments, IRBC and HDMEC were brought together mechanically at a constant rate and kept in contact by a constant force. In this situation, the interaction with α<sub>5</sub> appeared dispensable, as evidenced by the normal force of detachment in α<sub>5</sub> knockdown cells, and in cells pre-treated with the anti-α<sub>5</sub> mAb JBS5. As endothelial cells are surrounded by an extracellular glycocalyx of approximately 30 to 50 nm in thickness that cannot be breached by either the bent (10 nm) or extended (20 nm) integrin forms <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Sabri1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, the initial attachment to CD36 may in addition to clustering lead to compression of the glycocalyx, bringing α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin to close proximity of ligands on IRBC.</p>
              <p>Several mechanisms that underlie the change in affinity or avidity of integrins for their ligands have been proposed <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Boettiger1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The importance of clustering in promoting the avidity of integrin-ligand interactions, i.e. an increase in adhesiveness independently of integrin conformational changes, has been demonstrated by single molecule tracking. Using this technique, PMA was seen to induce a 10-fold increase in the lateral diffusion rate of LFA-1 in EBV transformed B lymphocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Kucik1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The movement induced was random instead of directed, indicating that it was due to a release of the integrin from cytoskeletal attachment and subsequent free diffusion rather than a directional movement due to the application of forces. As a corollary, it would appear that the nonadhesive state of integrins is actively maintained by the cytoskeleton. The movement of LFA-1 was considered an important early step in the adhesion of monocytes to immobilized ICAM-1/E-selectin under flow conditions <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, the bond formed by IRBC with clustered integrins on HMEC-1 induced by PMA appeared to be unable to withstand shear flow. Whether ligation by IRBC results in integrin activation and/or outside-in signaling that further modifies endothelial cell functions such as barrier function or proinflammatory mediator production remains to be determined.</p>
              <p>Using an α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>/α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-specific antagonist (cRGDfV) and an inhibitory mAb to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, we were unable to confirm a role for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin in mediating cytoadherence on HDMEC. Nevertheless, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> or other integrins may play an important role in IRBC adhesion to endothelial cells in other anatomical locations or other cell types, as already demonstrated for dendritic cells <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Urban1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Integrins on the surface of platelets also play an active role in many physiological process, e.g. α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> in thrombus formation <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Zhi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and may quite likely participate in the interaction of IRBC and platelets.</p>
              <p>The ligand(s) on IRBC that interacts with α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin remains to be determined. The cytoadherent ligand PfEMP1 appears to be the most likely candidate, but ligands of host cell origin such as phosphatidylserine that is exposed by changes in membrane topography induced by an intracellular parasite may also play a part <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Eda1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The presence of RGD motifs on PfEMP1 was noted in the initial reports on the cloning of the gene in the lab-adapted parasite clones MC and FCR3 <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Baruch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. While RGD motifs did not occur in each protein sequence examined, their positions varied (DBL1-4) when they did occur. More recently, an analysis of seven <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes revealed that RGD motifs are overrepresented in highly conserved positions in the DBLα0 domain in close proximity to several cysteine residues <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This observation raises the interesting question of why the localization of RGD motifs on PfEMP1 is conserved in <sub>1</sub>a parasite protein that is otherwise highly structurally variant. Further studies into the process of ligand recognition between IRBC and integrins may shed light not only on IRBC adhesion to endothelial cells, but to other host cells such as monocyte/macrophages and platelets.</p>
              <p>In summary, we have demonstrated that the integrin α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> acts synergistically with CD36 in mediating cytoadherence of IRBC to primary human microvascular endothelium. Together with our previous finding of IRBC-induced CD36 clustering and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, a picture is emerging of the formation of a cytadherence synapse involving multiple adhesion molecules and ligand(s) on IRBC. This type of cooperative adhesive interactions may be of critical importance in enabling IRBC adhesion in the microcirculations. The ultimate goal for elucidating the molecules and processes involved in cytoadherence to primary endothelial cells is to develop rational treatments that could target key receptor molecules that come into play under physiological shear stress. Integrins are known to mediate immune cell recruitment and tumor cell migration that are associated with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and different types of cancer respectively, and have become common therapeutic targets for these diseases <xref rid="ppat.1003590-Siano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. As CD36 on different host cells may have both a protective and a pathological role against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in the human host, anti-adhesive therapy targeted against its functional partners such as integrins with antibodies or small peptides rather than CD36 itself may provide a mechanism to decrease IRBC cytoadherence to microvascular endothelium while preserving the beneficial effects of this molecule against <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p>
