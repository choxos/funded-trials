                  <p>The integration of house-screening and long-lasting insecticidal nets, known as insecticide-treated screening (ITS), can provide simple, safe, and low-tech <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> control. Cluster randomised controlled trials in two endemic localities for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> of south Mexico, showed that ITS conferred both, immediate and sustained (~2 yr) impact on indoor-female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> infestations. Such encouraging results require further validation with studies quantifying more epidemiologically-related endpoints, including arbovirus infection in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. We evaluated the efficacy of protecting houses with ITS on <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> infestation and arbovirus infection during a Zika outbreak in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.</p>

                  <title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
                  <p>A two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluated the entomological efficacy of ITS compared to the absence of ITS (with both arms able to receive routine arbovirus vector control) in the neighbourhood Juan Pablo II of Merida. Cross-sectional entomological surveys quantified indoor adult mosquito infestation and arbovirus infection at baseline (pre-ITS installation) and throughout two post-intervention (PI) surveys spaced at 6-month intervals corresponding to dry/rainy seasons over one year (2016–2017). Household-surveys assessed the social reception of the intervention. Houses with ITS were 79–85% less infested with <italic>Aedes</italic> females than control houses up to one-year PI. A similar significant trend was observed for blood-fed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females (76–82%). Houses with ITS had significantly less infected female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> than controls during the peak of the epidemic (OR = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.08–0.29), an effect that was significant up to a year PI (OR = 0.24, 0.15–0.39). Communities strongly accepted the intervention, due to its perceived mode of action, the prevalent risk for <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases in the area, and the positive feedback from neighbours receiving ITS.</p>

                <p>We evaluated the efficacy of protecting houses with insecticide-treated nets permanently fixed with aluminium frames on external doors and windows on <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> infestation and arbovirus infection during a Zika outbreak in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Houses protected with screens were ≈80% less infested with <italic>Aedes</italic> females and very importantly, had significantly less infected female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> during the peak of the epidemic. Communities strongly accepted the intervention, due to its perceived mode of action, the prevalent risk for <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases in the area, and the positive feedback from neighbours. House screening provides a simple, affordable sustainable method to reduce human-vector contact inside houses and can protect against dengue, chikungunya and Zika.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The modification of human housing to make it refractory to insect vectors is gaining renewed impulse as a new paradigm for mosquito control [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Particularly, the use of mosquito-netting (mesh) as a physical barrier to prevent mosquito entry has been found protective against malaria and dengue in some observational studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Noteworthy, recent evidence from field trials on house-screening (HS) conducted primarily in Africa have shown significant protection against malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] while being widely accepted by communities [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>The principle of “keeping the vector out” is at the core of effective housing interventions to sustainably prevent vector-borne diseases and it is currently encouraged by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; yet, it has been largely ignored for policies &amp; programs for the prevention and control of <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases (ATDs). In 2017, a research-to-policy forum convened by TDR/WHO [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], finally identified HS as a promising vector management approach for the prevention and control of ATDs. However, the need on stronger epidemiological evidence was also recognised [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HS is not included in the current WHO dengue guidelines [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but, given its potential and wide-ranging benefits, it is a strong candidate for further trials to evaluate its effectiveness and optimal delivery within an Integrated Vector Management (IVM) framework that may include social mobilization and collaboration within the health sector and beyond [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>The integration of HS and Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN), known as insecticide-treated screening (ITS) [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], can provide simple, safe, and low-tech <italic>Aedes</italic> control. Projects supported by TDR/IDRC within the “Eco-Bio-social Research” and “Ecohealth” programmes in Mexico showed that LLIN affixed as ITS on doors and windows act as a physical/chemical barrier [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and confer sustained protection for indoor-female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

In the communities where it was implemented, ITS was considered a sustainable, popular and easy to adopt intervention [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with a significant effect on indoor <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and therefore human-vector contacts.

              <p>Under the support of the International Development Research Centre Government of Canada (IDRC) we evaluated the community acceptance and efficacy of ITS on <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> infestation and arbovirus infection during a Zika outbreak in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Capitalizing on the novel introduction of Zika virus (ZIKV) into Merida [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we quantified the relative efficacy of ITS in comparison to the absence of ITS in the context of continued routine vector control reactive to the report of symptomatic ZIKV cases.</p>

The average altitude of site is nine meters above sea level. Climate is mainly warm with an annual average temperature of 26°-27°C (36°C max- 18°C min). Two seasons can be clearly distinguished: a rainy season, in May to October (with most of the rainfall from June-October) and a dry season from November to April. The rainy season is associated the dengue risk season (transmission increases 80% approximately, although there is continuous transmission throughout the year) and marks the starting point for major vector control activities.</p>

In the national context, Merida is one of the cities that reported the highest proportion of dengue cases in the last 18 years [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and has accounted for ≈50% of all dengue cases in Yucatan during the last decade. The first cases of chikungunya in Merida and a subsequent outbreak (1,669 cases) occurred in 2015 and transmission decreased in the following years (11 cases in 2016, and 0 cases in 2017–2018) [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Zika transmission was detected in May 2016 reporting in the end of the year 2,199 cases; the transmission decreased to 24 cases in 2017, and 28 cases in 2018 [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Juan Pablo II has approximately 4,100 households, and with &gt; 20,000 inhabitants is one of the most populated neighbourhoods in the city. Juan Pablo II was selected in consensus with the local Ministry of Health, because epidemiologically is considered the second neighbourhood most important for the local dengue control programme (from 2011–2018 it concentrated 5.4% of all dengue cases reported in Merida).</p>

                <p>The study followed a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial design, comparing five clusters with the intervention versus another five without ITS as control for one year, as in previous studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An area (0.24 km<sup>2</sup> comprising 31 blocks and 1,038 houses) was divided in ten clusters (nine clusters of three blocks and one of four blocks) that were randomized to receive the intervention or to remain as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We powered the study to detect a significant difference in our primary entomological endpoint: the density of <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> indoors (collected after a 10-min Prokopack aspiration session). Based on an expected effect size of 70% in the reduction of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> indoors by ITS [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] from an expected mean baseline number of 4.4 ± 9 [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%, we estimated a total of 134 houses per arm (268 total houses) to detect a significant difference between groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx">https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx</ext-link>).Therefore, our population of over a thousand houses provided enough statistical power to evaluate a difference at even a lower effect size than 60%. The implementation of the intervention (installation of ITS, see below) was carried out during June-July 2016. The intervention was evaluated with entomological indicators of impact e.g. female <italic>Aedes</italic>, blood fed female <italic>Aedes</italic> and female <italic>Aedes</italic> infected with any ATD. It is worth mentioning that the study was planned and implemented prior to ZIKV introduction in the study site and took advantage of the opportunity to compare the impact before and after the introduction of ZIKV. Originally, the primary goal was to evaluate de entomological efficacy (presence and abundance of the vector). Infection of mosquitoes with arboviruses was already planned but was originally a secondary goal since we cannot predict when and where an outbreak can occur.</p>
                <p>Both areas received routine vector control, which in Merida occurs in response to reported symptomatic ATD cases and elevated entomological indices [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These activities included: outdoor-spraying with organophosphates (chlorpyrifos-ethyl, malathion), indoor spraying with carbamates (propoxur, and bendiocarb) and a pyrethroid (deltamethrin) and larviciding with temephos, novaluron and spinosad.</p>

A total of 139 <italic>Aedes</italic> female pools (mean of 1.2/ house positive to females), of which 74% were blood fed mosquitoes, were analysed for DEN/CHIK/ZIK virus diagnosis. A high number of pools, 108 pools (77.7%), were positive to ZIK virus indicating a strong signal of epidemic spread. All pools were negative to DEN/CHIK viruses. No significant differences were observed between study arms in the house positivity to ZIKV at baseline (OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.07–6.32, P = 0.72) (<xref rid="pntd.0009005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, statistically significant differences were observed on the positivity for ZIK virus at the subsequent PI survey (OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.08–0.29, P&lt;0.001) during the rainy season. A year after the installation of ITS (dry season), these differences remained significant (OR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.15–0.39, P&lt;0.001). The estimated intervention effectiveness in reducing ZIK infection, ITS<sub>eff</sub>, was 85% (6 months) and 76% (12 months), or an average of 80.5%.</p>

                <title>Community acceptance and social perception on effectiveness</title>
                <p>Three main reasons encouraged the participation of the residents from Juan Pablo II: the perception and worries about the high risk for <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases transmission in the community (39%), the rationality and efficacy of the intervention in reducing mosquito-human contacts (25%), and that initially enrolled participants convinced more families through sharing their positive experiences about the effectiveness of the method (23%).</p>
                <p>The installation process of ITS was considered very good for 91% of respondents. Overall, 100% of the participants perceived an efficacy on mosquito reduction; either with i) no mosquitoes inside some houses (58%) or ii) reduced number of mosquitoes (40%). In terms of the epidemiological association, most of the participants (91%) interviewed did not report any case of DEN/CHIK/ZIK virus infection within their families after the installation of mosquito screens on doors and windows. Interviewees did not acknowledge feeling any temperature increase attributable to the screening (77%); some reported a little increase on the temperature of the houses (19%) but related to specific day-hours such as mid-day. Finally, most of the participants (93%) said to be satisfied and recognised ITS as an effective method for the prevention of DEN/CHIK/ZIK transmission (96.43%). Families definitively recommended (100%) the scaling-up of the intervention, because the multiple positive outcomes perceived.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Screening entry-points of a house to prevent the access of adult mosquitoes -particularly <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females- is expected to decrease the number of vectors, human exposure to infective mosquito bites and therefore, reduce dengue, chikungunya and Zika transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Here we provide evidence of the protective effect of ITS in reducing not only the entomological risk (presence and abundance of <italic>Aedes</italic> females and those blood-fed indoors), but also a reduction of an epidemiological proxy of the risk of transmission of ATDs (indoor <italic>Aedes</italic> females infected with ZIK virus). A house protected with ITS on doors and windows in this study at Merida, not only had ≈ 84% less chance of having <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females in comparison with a non-screened house during the peak of the mosquito season, but also and very importantly, had ≈ 80% less chance of having ZIK infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females inside in comparison with a non-screened house.</p>
              <p>During 2016, a total of 10, 007 cases of dengue (2,064), chikungunya (69) and Zika (7,874) were recorded in Merida. Zika was first recorded in the city in 2016 and was the most frequent <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted disease (78.4%) reported in Merida [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A cohort study conducted in pregnant woman at the same time of our study found ZIKV attack rates of ~30% [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], indicating high levels of virus transmission in Merida. Such high transmission was evidenced in the number of positive pools found within our study houses. Although this study was not designed to test the epidemiological impact of ITS at the human population level, results reported in the present study were in the context of a Zika outbreak, so they provide evidence that ITS/HS could give high protection against circulating arbovirus in mosquitoes, reducing significantly indoor <italic>Aedes</italic> presence, density and ZIKV infection. This also illustrates the importance of adult collections (and adult derived indicators including infection) rather than larval indicators for the evaluation of control methods targeting the adult stage.</p>
              <p>Evidence of protection of ITS against local <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> populations was observed despite the presence of a high level of resistance to pyrethroids in the local mosquito population. Previous studies from our research team have characterized the susceptibility/resistance levels of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> from Juan Pablo II (JP), with knockdown resistance (allele frequency of I1016 of 82% and C1534 of 93%) to pyrethroids [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mosquito populations from JP are from moderately resistant to completely susceptible to alpha-cypermethrin, the active ingredient of the LLIN material used for the ITS intervention evaluated in this study. The insecticidal activity of ITS has shown to be effective (&gt;70% mortality) as a chemical barrier, in addition to the benefits of house screening as a physical barrier [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], to exclude and kill mosquitoes and eventually protect against mosquito bites, which is epidemiologically relevant if most transmission occurs indoors.</p>
              <p>ITS or HS have advantages over other approaches -as a preventive method- because once installed, they are permanently fitted, protect individuals and the whole family, require little additional work or behavioural change by household members, and are associated with high overall satisfaction and acceptance levels [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some degree of success -and failure- has been reported after interventions with LLINs against dengue vectors (measured usually with immature based indicators) when used as curtains hanged on windows and doors [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, unprotected doors and windows because peoples’ habit of ‘folding’ the curtains during the heat of the day; compromise house mosquito-entry points [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Fixed screens covering permanently doors and windows eliminate this problem.</p>
              <p>In the present study, ITS was very well accepted by the community, with a perceived efficacy on reductions on mosquito abundance and biting, and furthermore, reduction in other domestic insect pests; evidence that reinforces the positive outcomes found in other studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the case of ITS, two main limiting factors for its accessibility by the community have been identified. Firstly, LLINs are not yet commercially available for public and/or in the retail market in Mexico, and secondly (also applicable for HS), the initial expenditure of the installation of aluminium framed-screens with high-quality materials is costly. Current implementation research from our group is focused on how to overtake these limitations to enhance community access to ITS or HS, including cost-saving strategies i.e. the use of less- expensive materials rather than aluminium frames, or with a Do-it-yourself strategy. Further implementation research is also exploring how much are the families are willing to pay and to find supplementary support by local governments or other funding schemes as part of a “safe housing” initiative or micro-credits.</p>
              <p>While very encouraging, our findings have suffered from limitations in our study design and methods. The main limitation has been our lack of evidence of epidemiological impact of ITS on the human population. As an entomological trial, we never set to evaluate the impact on arbovirus infection in humans. However, our significant findings of a reduction in ZIKV infection in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> shed light into our inability to detect and test members of each house. Other limitations of the study include the limited number of houses, which prevented to evaluate any population-level effect of ITS scale-up, as well as detailed information of the distribution of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> in the peridomicile. While in Merida <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is found primarily indoors [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the lack of Prokopack aspirations outdoors limits our understanding of the true effect of ITS on <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. If both the chemical and mechanical barriers act on mosquitoes, one might expect to see a significant reduction in peridomestic <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> indices; driven by reductions in adult density and their oviposition. Conversely, if only ITS acts as a mechanical barrier, one may expect not to see a dramatic reduction in vector densities if opportunities for human biting occur in the peridomicile. Either way, future studies should focus on the effect of ITS beyond the indoor environment and focus on spillover of mosquitoes to neighbouring houses (if any) as well as the potential long-term effect of ITS on the evolution of resistance to the active ingredient used in screens.</p>
              <p>“Mosquito- proofing” of houses with house-screening has been a historic recommendation of environmental management [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] based on changes to human habitation to exclude vectors and reduce human-vector-pathogen contact. Mosquito-proofed housing and environmental management are recognised as part of the success in eliminating malaria in high-income countries [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A notable example is the construction of the Panama Canal, during which IVM was implemented as early as 1904, including the screening of living quarters and draining standing water, to reduce yellow fever and malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Even tough, HS was largely ignored for policies &amp; programs for the prevention and control of ATD; and it was not until the Zika emergency that the WHO [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and their regional offices, finally emphasised the prevention and protection against mosquito bites using physical barriers such as window screens [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To complicate things further, and even nowadays, the evidence on the effectiveness of the current “toolbox” for ABDs is mixed in terms of “arboviral control” and not specific for Zika, mainly because the lack of scientific evidence (both insufficient to dengue and also because Zika was a newly emerged disease) [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
              <p>There is an opportunity to demonstrate and support that HS can be a sustained protective barrier for families and the domestic environment as recommended by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HS (and/or housing improvement) should be “actively endorsed” and part of the current paradigms for urban vector-borne disease control [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Housing improvement is considered a public health intervention compatible with the integrated vector management strategy for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> in Mexico [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The strategy "safe housing and safe water" which consists of installing mosquito nets on doors and windows (either with or without insecticide) and keeping the patio clean and taking care of the stored water, is specifically recommended; nevertheless, it´s implementation by the vector control program of the Mexican MoH hasn’t been accomplished yet. It is clear that housing improvements are far beyond of the budget of the MoH worldwide, and therefore, it is critical to involve other sectors, particularly the housing, urban planning and infrastructure sectors [<xref rid="pntd.0009005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Protecting the home from <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases is a current and active challenge, with utmost relevance during COVID-19 (and post-COVID-19), due to strains in public health personnel, budgets, resources and vector control ‘readiness’.</p>
              <p>The results presented in this study further add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that ITS/HS is a promising new paradigm for the control of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, an antropophilic, endophilic, endophagic and day-biting species. The observed reduction in household <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> infestation and importantly, on mosquito infection rates during a transmission period, could impact virus transmission in a measurable way, with evidence indicating good potential for sustainability, given the high levels of acceptance and popularity among targeted communities, and justify a second phase for larger trials (thousands of households) quantifying the effectiveness of ITS/HS on stronger epidemiological endpoints (human sero-conversion or infection).</p>
              <p>We recently started the implementation of different high-quality, innovative interventions to complement traditional <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> control in Merida, México, with a strong collaborative work with local authorities. The protection of houses with ITS received support from the local and national government It is under consideration how to expand <italic>Aedes</italic>-proof housing to as many homes as possible, conceivably as a targeted intervention for high-risk areas (hot-spots) and vulnerable populations of endemic localities.</p>

              <p>Dear Prof. Manrique Saide,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Insecticide-treated house screening protects against Zika-infected Aedes aegypti in Merida, Mexico" for consideration at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. </p>
              <p>We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.</p>
              <p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p>
              <p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
              <p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file). </p>
              <p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments.</p>
              <p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 60 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. Please note that revised manuscripts received after the 60-day due date may require evaluation and peer review similar to newly submitted manuscripts.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for your submission. We hope that our editorial process has been constructive so far, and we welcome your feedback at any time. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>

              <p>
                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: -The objectives of the study are clearly articulated and an important hypothesis was stated and tested.</p>
              <p>-Study design: The study design was appropriate, but the total number of Aedes collected was relatively small. I find the differences convincing, but the represent relatively modest, albeit statistically significant differences. Again not many studies have demonstrated these kind of differences, linked to a proxy for transmission, but I might temper the enthusiasm a little. I would also commend the research team in taking advantage the introduction of ZIKV. Was the study planned prior to ZIKV introduction or were you able to react that quickly.</p>
              <p>-No sample size calculation is included - this does not bother me, but trialists would be interested in if the study was powered for a particular effect size. If not I might describe how you got this trial up and running so quickly to take advantage of measuring ZIKV transmission the value this type of trial can contribute to evidence-base for vector-borne diseases.</p>
              <p>-Statistics look appropriate to me, and Table 1 provides the "raw" numbers, again some care needs to be taken in talking about the significance.</p>
              <p>-ZIKV testing - the authors note the "surprising number of positive pools for ZIKV. The lack of DENV/CHIKV provides some confidence, but my guess is the more laboratory inclined reviewers might be a bit nervous about this. You might provide a bit more discussion on this issue. If we could see the proportion of houses with Aedes aegypti that tested positive for ZIKV it would provide some additional perspective. Was the laboratory blinded to the cluster allocation?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The objective is clear and the methodology to achieve it is sound. </p>
              <p>Sample size calculation is not reported.</p>

              <p>-Tables are good.</p>
              <p>- Any insecticide resistance testing?</p>

              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: -The conclusions are supported by the data presented.</p>
              <p>-Limitations: I did not see this addressed directly and would have liked to see some discussion. Although the results speak for themselves, I feel the conclusions could be tempered a bit. This is 3 collection period (only 2 post intervention), it would have been far more convincing if monthly or bimonthly collections were done. They weren't and I'm sure there were economic constraints. While infected mosquitoes is an important proxy, it does not represent disease. Was any attempt made to look at MOH case reports or reports from study population (also flawed). Again this is incredibly promising but I would tone the language down in the abstract at least. </p>
              <p>-Excellent discussion of public health relevance, but I would encourage the authors to mention COVID-19 which makes this type of intervention even more relevant.</p>
              <p>-One thing missing from the discussion, is a review (not necessary to be complete) of other studies using Insecticide treated materials, I believe there are some other studies from the Yucatan by another group and an RCT with less promising results using epi endpoints was recently published by Lenhart et al. in PLOS NTD. Again I think just tempers the conclusions, may not work everywhere in the same way.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Conclusions are supported by results. </p>
              <p>It is not reported if the sample size calculation has been performed so we do not know if this has affected the power of the analysis.</p>

                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper is well written and clear, but a some minor modifications addressing my previous comments would result in a better manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I strongly invite authors to add the numbers of mosquitoes and houses positive for Zika infected mosquitoes in Table 2 (it is just an additional column).</p>

                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript shows convincing evidence of an impact of Household screening on Aedes aegypti population parameters and Aedes infected mosquitoes. This is should be of high relevance, this type of data on an infection proxy is rare so this should be of high interest to PLOS NTD and the ATD vector control community.</p>
              <p>General Comments</p>
              <p>- The paper is clear and well done and makes a convincing argument for the value of HS.</p>
              <p>- Study is of good size but not huge. Took advantage of the high transmission period associated with ZIKV, but there is no discussion of human transmission in the study area or houses. I understand the study may have not been able to test the population, but the lack of discussion of what sort of disease was seen feels a little like a read flag. ZIKV cases are talked about in the intro but very generally.</p>
              <p>-There is not mention of insecticide resistance testing, it would have been important to include if done, and any context would have been useful. My understanding is pyrethroid resistance is high thorough out Mexico, so this issue at least deserves some discussion.</p>
              <p>-A paragraph in the discussion about the potential limitations of the study would be useful.</p>
              <p>-A paragraph in the discussion describing some of the previous work done on Insecticide treated curtains also be important.</p>
              <p>-You might mention the importance of this intervention in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: As this is a review of revised manuscript I will confirm that I had few concerns about the study methodology and the authors essentially addressed all of my "added" suggestions which were optional.</p>
              <p>I'm completely satisfied here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The study is well conceived, methods are appropriate and statistical analysis is adequate. Proper community engagement has been performed.</p>

              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Again all my mild concerns were addressed.</p>
              <p>- one additional piece of information I would be interested in is a comparison between the blood-fed and non-blood fed pools of mosquitos, one could this was xenodiagnosis in a sense. Did you test the other species? This is not necessary here, but just something I failed to ask in the last revieve.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Data are analised according to the plan and the results and statistical analysis are clearly presented. In the PDF I have downloaded Figures are blurred.</p>

              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Affirmative to all the questions asked by PLOS NTD, and again I commend the authors for considering all of my previous suggestions.</p>

              <p>Dear Prof. Manrique Saide,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Insecticide-treated house screening protects against Zika-infected Aedes aegypti in Merida, Mexico," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
