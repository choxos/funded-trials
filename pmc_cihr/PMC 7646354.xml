                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Lifetime prevalence of shoulder pain is 70%, and approximately 50% of people with shoulder pain will experience pain for more than a year. Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) is the most common shoulder condition and the main non-surgical intervention is exercise therapy. For approximately 30% of people with RCRSP, this approach does not lead to a significant reduction in symptoms. This may be due to an inappropriate dosage or choice of exercises. The aim of this investigation is to compare the short, mid and long-term effects, in terms of symptoms, functional limitations, kinesiophobia and pain catastrophising, of three different shoulder rehabilitation approaches (education, strengthening, motor control) in adults with RCRSP.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>In this single-blind (assessor), parallel-group, randomised clinical trial, 123 adults presenting with RCRSP will take part in a 12-week rehabilitation programme. They will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (education only, strengthening approach or motor control-focused approach). Abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire, the primary outcome, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index and Brief Pain Inventory will evaluate symptoms and functional limitations, while Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia and Pain Catastrophizing Scale will evaluate pain-related fear and catastrophising at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Ultrasonographic acromiohumeral distances and tendon thickness will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Intervention groups will be compared on outcomes with intention-to-treat analyses using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance if the data are normally distributed or non-parametric analysis of longitudinal data if they are not.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Shoulder pain is one of the most frequent musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of up to 70%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The overall prognosis is highly variable, with up to 50% of patients still reporting persistent pain 6–12 months after seeking an initial primary care consultation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP), a broad term that includes rotator cuff tendinopathy, tendinitis, tendinosis, partial and atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears, impingement and subacromial pain, accounts for 50%–85% of diagnoses for shoulder pain.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Several interventions are available for RCRSP such as education, exercise, manual therapy, electrotherapy, injection, medication and surgery. Clinical trials suggest that the long-term outcomes of patients pharmacologically or surgically treated are comparable to those receiving rehabilitation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref> Regardless of modality, treatment is unsuccessful for more than one-third of patients who continue to have pain and disability following care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Several reasons may explain this lack of effectiveness and include psychosocial factors (including kinesiophobia<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and pain catastrophising<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), occupational factors, lifestyle factors,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> lack of adherence to the exercise programme,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> low expectations regarding recovery and low levels of self-efficacy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Other reasons behind this lack of success might be inadequate choice of exercise.</p>
              <p>Education and exercises are two of the most frequently used interventions for RCRSP with evidence supporting their effectiveness.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 10 11</xref> Patient education often constitutes the first management strategy in health-related conditions as it does not necessitate extensive resources and is available to all. It helps reduce false beliefs and fears related to the pathology as well as increase patient’s knowledge of their condition in order to improve their self-efficacy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, education alone might not be sufficient for all patients, as some may present deficits such as muscular weakness or inhibition, altered shoulder muscle recruitment patterns and kinematics.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> These deficits might explain the persistence of symptoms in some patients. Recent systematic reviews strongly recommend with low to moderate quality evidence that exercises be prioritised as a first-line intention treatment since it presents better outcome on pain and function than placebo or wait-and-see.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref>However, we still do not know which types of exercise are better and thus lead to better outcomes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There is even some evidence in the literature suggesting that some types of exercise may not be more effective than a placebo.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> These findings highlight the need for higher quality studies evaluating the effect of different exercises for RCRSP.</p>
              <p>Motor control exercises have been shown to reduce pain and disability in individuals with RCRSP.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> One rationale behind these effects is that improving muscle recruitment patterns and kinematics could prevent the compression of the subacromial soft tissues underneath the coracoacromial arch as the arm elevates.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Apart from this potential explanation that is still debated,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> efficiency of motor control exercises might reside in the reduction of fear-avoidance behaviour or pain catastrophising as the patients are encouraged to move in previously feared positions.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It could also have a direct neurophysiological central effect on pain-related brain areas, similar to the one observed with manual therapy,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and bring change in pain sensitivity and sensorimotor processing. On the other hand, by progressively loading contractile tissue, strengthening exercises have been shown to decrease pain and muscle weakness.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This could be the result of an increased capacity by the tendon to sustain load or to a decrease in rotator cuff tendon inhibition.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>Although their clinical usefulness has already been assessed separately,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> no study has directly compared those three interventions for the management of RCRSP in order to better highlight recovery over time as well as the choice of intervention provided. Identifying the most effective and efficient intervention(s) for RCRSP is of paramount importance to prevent symptoms persistence, limit healthcare costs associated with these disorders and all resulting consequences.</p>

                <title>Objective and hypotheses</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the short, mid and long-term effects of three different approaches (education, strengthening, motor control) of delivering shoulder management on the symptoms and functional limitations of individuals with RCRSP. A secondary objective is to explore the effects of the programmes on shoulder control (acromiohumeral distance (AHD)), subacromial structures (supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus (IS) tendon thickness), kinesiophobia and catastrophisation related to shoulder pain. The hypothesis is that both exercise groups will demonstrate a better outcome in pain and function compared with the education group. The motor control programme should lead to a quicker improvement in symptoms and functional limitations than the strengthening programme because, by improving muscle recruitment patterns, it will decrease control deficits and thus lower the odds of individuals experiencing pain. Its effect on kinesiophobia should also contribute to a quicker reintegration of movements into patients’ life, hence improve function. Finally, all groups should lead to a decrease in kinesiophobia and pain catastrophisation, but the motor control and strengthening groups should lead to a greater reduction since participants will be guided to move in amplitudes that were previously limited by pain or pain-related fears or perform near-maximal intensity muscle contractions.</p>

                <p>This single-blind, parallel-group RCT will include five evaluation sessions over 24 weeks (baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks), six intervention sessions over 12 weeks for both exercise groups and two education sessions over 12 weeks for the education group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). All participants will take part in the baseline evaluation. They will complete self-administered questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, symptomatology, comorbidities, functional limitations, kinesiophobia and pain catastrophising using self-reported questionnaires. Then, ultrasonographic (US) measurements of the AHD and of the SS and IS tendon thickness will be conducted. Thereafter, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups, and take part in their assigned programme. All study outcomes will be reevaluated at 12 weeks, while the self-administered questionnaires will also be readministrated at 3, 6 and 24 weeks using web-based questionnaires. A global rating of change question will be completed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The study will be conducted at the <italic>Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche en réadaptation et en intégration sociale</italic>. This RCT is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials checklist was used when writing the protocol.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>

A positive cluster of criteria 3, 4 and 5 represents an adequate diagnostic tool for RCRSP (sensitivity: 0.75, specificity: 0.74).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Participants will be excluded if they present any of the following criteria: (1) clinical signs of massive rotator cuff tears as defined by presence of gross weakness in the absence of limited pain, (2) other shoulder disorders, for example, adhesive capsulitis (restriction of passive glenohumeral movement of at least 30% for two or more directions), severe osteoarthritis, fracture, dislocation, severe acromioclavicular joint pathology, (3) previous shoulder surgery, (4) presence of significant comorbidity, for example, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, (5) current or past carcinoma, (6) unlikely to be able to perform required clinical assessment tasks or attend the required evaluation and intervention sessions, (7) symptomatic cervical spine pathology, defined as reproduction of symptoms with active physiological cervical spine movements, and (8) corticosteroid injection in the last 6 weeks. All recruited participants will be evaluated by a physiotherapist (PT) in order to confirm their eligibility.</p>
                <p>Based on our sample size calculation, calculated for our primary outcome (abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (<italic>Quick</italic>DASH)), 41 participants are required per group (G*Power V.3.1.9; effect size: 0.80, α=0.05, power=0.95, SD=13 DASH points, clinically important difference (CID)=11 DASH points, expected lost at follow-up=15%).

                <p>A randomisation list has been generated prior to the initiation of the study by an independent research assistant not involved in data collection using a random number generator. Allocation is concealed in sealed and opaque envelopes that are sequentially numbered. Randomisation was stratified to ensure balance of the treatment groups with respect to sex (male/female) and age (18–55/55–75). A blocked randomisation was also used to make sure that three equal groups of 41 participants will be obtained (random blocks of 3, 6 or 9). Given that it is impossible to blind the treating PT and participants, a single-blind design will be used. To reduce potential contamination bias, the three programmes will be given at different time periods. Further, participants will be instructed not to discuss their group assignment, exercises performed or advice received with other potential participants and with the evaluator. To evaluate the effectiveness of blinding at the 3-month follow-up, the evaluator will answer the following question: <italic>What intervention do you think the participant received?</italic>; with one of the following answers: (1) education and advice, (2) strengthening, (3) motor control, or (4) no idea. If they answer 1, 2 and 3, they will have to explain why they think the participant received this intervention.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>It is essential to develop and identify effective interventions for the management of shoulder pain since it may become chronic and lead to adverse consequences such as decreased participation and quality of life, absenteeism at work, early retirement, multiple medical consultations as well as high associated health costs. As stated earlier, up to 30% of individuals with RCRSP still present pain and disability after rehabilitation interventions such as rehabilitation exercises. A recent study conducted by our research team showed that a rehabilitation programme comprising mainly motor control exercises led to fewer than 15% of individuals showing unsatisfactory results.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In order to further decrease this percentage, we have attempted to compare different optimized exercise programmes. We have added exercises targeting the whole body, not only the shoulder, to our motor control programme because we believe it is essential to involve the whole body since deficits in trunk or lower limb capacity may overload the upper limb during activities of daily living. On the other hand, multiple studies have shown promising results from strengthening programmes primarily targeting shoulder abductors and external rotators.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> We believe that adding strengthening exercises for other shoulder muscles such as scapular muscles could lead to even better results.</p>
              <p>A true control group (wait-and-see approach) will not be included as it would be difficult to maintain a high retention and avoid cointerventions during the mid-term and long-term follow-up. We also chose not to include a placebo group, as it is hard to have a real placebo for this type of study and it is not really ethically fair for the participants given that they will be followed for the 6 months and that the exercises used in the programmes have been shown to be superior to placebo.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>Defining more efficient rehabilitation regimens for common conditions such as RCRSP is important as it may lead to a reduction in associated costs. Therefore, the present study will establish the effectiveness of these two programmes and determine if one is more effective than the other or more effective than education.</p>
