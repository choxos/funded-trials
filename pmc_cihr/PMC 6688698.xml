                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Technological and medical advances have led to a growing population of children with medical complexity (CMC) defined by substantial medical needs, healthcare utilisation and morbidity. These children are at a high risk of missed, fragmented and/or inappropriate care, and families bear extraordinary financial burden and stress. While small in number (&lt;1% of children), this group uses ~1/3 of all child healthcare resources, and need coordinated care to optimise their health. Complex care for kids Ontario (CCKO) brings researchers, families and healthcare providers together to develop, implement and evaluate a population-level roll-out of care for CMC in Ontario, Canada through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The intervention includes dedicated key workers and the utilisation of coordinated shared care plans.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Our primary objective is to evaluate the CCKO intervention using a randomised waitlist control design. The waitlist approach involves rolling out an intervention over time, whereby all participants are randomised into two groups (A and B) to receive the intervention at different time points determined at random. Baseline measurements are collected at month 0, and groups A and B are compared at months 6 and 12. The primary outcome is the family-prioritized Family Experiences with Coordination of Care (FECC) survey at 12 months. The FECC will be compared between groups using an analysis of covariance with the corresponding baseline score as the covariate. Secondary outcomes include reports of child and parent health outcomes, health system utilisation and process outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Medical advances have led to improved survival for many previously life-threatening conditions of childhood, such as prematurity,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> congenital anomalies<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and congenital or acquired brain injury.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Technological advances such as ventilator support, feeding tubes and transplantation have successfully prolonged the lives of children with lung, gut and other organ failure. This epidemiological transition<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> has created a burgeoning population of children with medical complexity (CMC)—children with new morbidities, which are caused by longer survival itself as well as the complications of their life-sustaining therapies and created a new population that requires specialised care delivery to meet their complex healthcare needs.</p>
              <p>CMC have been defined as ‘children with chronic conditions with elevated service needs, functional limitations and high healthcare utilisation’.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Data from Ontario, Canada suggest that while CMC account for ~0.7% of all children, they use about one-third of all child health resources.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Studies from the USA have also reported that CMC account for 43% of child deaths, 49% of hospital days and 75%–92% of consumed assistive health technology.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> CMC and their parental caregivers endure enormous challenges, including multiple and prolonged hospitalisations,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> frequent medical errors,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> poor care coordination<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11</xref> and extraordinary stress.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The consequences may include poor caregiver health,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> marital strain<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and profound negative financial impact.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>Previous research has shown through a series of before and after studies, that targeted and integrated complex care interventions, most commonly within structured clinical programme, may improve the health outcomes of CMC,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> including reducing the burden of caregiving,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and mitigating costly and unnecessary healthcare expenditures.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Other studies have shown additional benefits such as a decreased need for medical information and improved satisfaction,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> improved family perceptions of their providers, their overall healthcare experience and provider communication,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> as well as decreased unplanned healthcare visits.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, the validity of these findings has been limited by small sample sizes, lack of control groups and incomplete outcome measures.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) report improved parental satisfaction with care, but mixed results for other outcomes. One parallel-group RCT described a decrease in both rates of severe illness and healthcare costs<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> among children enrolled in a structured complex care programme, while another cluster RCT reported increased costs with no change in functional status or hospital-based utilisation.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p>
              <p>The Provincial Council of Maternal and Child Health (PCMCH) is a provincial organisation, supported by Ontario’s public single-payer of healthcare (the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care). PCMCH implemented complex care kids Ontario (CCKO), a population-health strategy to improve care for CMC by providing an integrated approach to medical care and coordination. The strategy aims to improve service delivery, health and quality of life of the patient families involved through care coordination across acute and primary care, rehabilitation, home and community care, facilitated by dedicated nurse practitioners,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> who function as key workers to establish seamless integrated care through the development and maintenance of a single, comprehensive and collaborative care plan, that is, designed to meet the child’s/family’s goals and optimise health outcomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 1</xref>). The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the CCKO intervention to usual care for CMC in Ontario.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>CCKO will utilise a waitlist variation of an RCT design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The waitlist approach involves rolling out an intervention over time, whereby all participants are randomised into two groups (A and B) to receive the intervention at different time points determined at random.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 28</xref> Group A receives the intervention at the next available appointment. Group B is placed on a waitlist and receives the intervention after 12 months. This study design uses the time period before the intervention as the control period/baseline, to be compared with those receiving the intervention.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Baseline measurements would be collected at month 0, and groups A and B would be compared at months 6 and 12.</p>

                <p>The waitlist design is used in scenarios where it is considered unethical to withhold an intervention with likely benefits, or if there are logistical or financial constraints that prevent the intervention from being administered in whole at one time point.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> This design generates robust evidence of an intervention programme’s effectiveness by leveraging real-world operational need for a staggered rollout. For CCKO, it is logistically not feasible for all eligible children to be seen immediately. For example, the initial intake process for key workers is time intense, requiring the creation of careplans and the development of a patient–provider relationship. A staggered rollout facilitates workflow, allowing programme implementation within the context of human resource limitations. With the exception of patients for whom care coordination is thought to be urgently required (see exclusion criteria (a)–(c)), all patients referred to CCKO will be randomly assigned to either receive the intervention immediately or after the waitlist period (12 months). This approach minimises the risk of selection bias by retaining the design element of randomisation.</p>

                  <p>Patients who satisfy exclusion criteria (a)–(c) are deemed to urgently require care coordination; as such, it would be unethical to randomise these patients to a waitlist. Patients who satisfy exclusion criteria (d) would have experienced the potential benefits of care coordination already. Patients who satisfy exclusion criteria (e) would be in the process of being transitioned to adult care. Patients who satisfy exclusion criteria (f) would not be able to complete the study questionnaires as the majority are only validated in English. Patients who satisfy exclusion criteria (g) would not be able to complete the study questionnaires at all time points as these children are placed in out of home care during the study period (social history is provided to the triaging team in each referral).</p>
                  <p>Patients whose caregivers cannot complete questionnaires in English will not be involved in the primary analysis; however, they will be enrolled in CCKO and provide healthcare utilisation data via health card linkages to health administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences that will be used in secondary analyses. Similarly, patients who require urgent care coordination are excluded from the study, but will be able to contribute data through similar linkages.</p>
                  <p>The CCKO intervention involves care coordination, defined as: ‘deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services. Organizing care involves the marshaling of personnel and other resources needed to carry out required care activities and is often managed by the exchange of information among participants responsible for different aspects of care ’ R Mangione-Smith, personal communication, 2016.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Within CCKO, care coordination will include family/healthcare provider cocreation and management of care coordination plans which will be facilitated and accounted for by key workers partnering with families. The key worker would have an advanced practice nursing (eg, nurse practitioner) background and will support the development and enactment of the coordinated care plan between acute care, primary care, rehabilitation, home and community care. Further details about care plan development are available online.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The key worker would be available to provide advice from Monday to Friday, 09:00 to 17:00, and will also develop plans of care for emergencies after hours as part of care plan development. Resources to maintain intervention fidelity among key workers will be maintained with oversight by PCMCH.</p>
                  <p>The waitlist group consists of CMC who are receiving care from primary and specialty providers, and are waitlisted for complex care clinic (preenrolment control period). Standard of care during the control period will involve care delivered through a primary care provider (family physician or paediatrician) for routine healthcare such as vaccination and acute care visits with subspecialty consultation as needed. Currently, this model of care for the vast majority of CMC in Ontario; among ~6200 patients who are estimated to meet CCKO criteria in Ontario, only ~500 receive care in a structured complex care clinic. At the end of year 1, all CMC randomised to the waitlist will be enrolled in complex care and data will continue to be collected for one additional year on all participants in an extension phase.</p>
                  <p>Criteria for discontinuing study intervention: participants in the waitlisted arm that experience a change in clinical status and now meet exclusion criteria (eg, prolonged hospital stay &gt;30 days), will be taken out of the waitlist arm and will be seen at the next available appointment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>While growing attention has been provided to CMC in recent years,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> there are important gaps in the literature regarding the optimal care delivery model for CMC.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19 23</xref> Before and after studies have shown possible benefit but there has been few rigorous RCTs conducted that look at multiple outcomes including service delivery, parent and child health outcomes as well as health system outcomes such as health utilisation. Furthermore, this is the first study that prioritised outcomes as identified by patients and families directly in order to understand if a complex care programme was successful in the eyes of a family by selecting outcomes that matter most to them. The care delivery model in CCKO—utilising a key worker and comprehensive care plans—is a time intensive and possibly costly one. Well-designed evaluations are needed to examine how they relate to outcomes of care for this population.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
</p>
              <p>Several aspects of this trial are important to highlight as innovative and novel.</p>
              <p>First, in contrast to other trials that target CMC within a single healthcare setting (eg, a children’s hospital), this study focuses on population-level implementation and evaluation in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province. This setting allows the implementation of complex care coordination within a wide geographic area combing both densely populated urban areas with more rural locations for which travel to specialised care is challenging. The large number of sites participating in this study account for the majority of CMC care in Ontario. This environment is unique in terms of the current literature as these patients reflect population-level CMC representation, with outcome data availability across the continuum of care available from a large provincial repository of data. The focus on many sites creates some challenges in both implementation and evaluation across diverse settings. However, this evaluation also provides an opportunity for the development of generalisable knowledge not only for publically funded healthcare delivery systems but also for broad groups of payers focused on other high-need/high-cost populations.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
</p>
              <p>Second, the outcome measures used are patient and family informed. Previous literature has highlighted the need for uniquely developed outcome measures for CMC recognising the nature of their healthcare usage and trajectory. Before recruitment began, the outcome measures were determined through a process of direct consultation with parents of CMC.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Previous evaluations of CMC care have relied primarily on readily available data (eg, claims data or other administrative datasets), with minimal patient and family reported input. Previous PROMs utilised in evaluations have not been validated in a CMC population. A strength of this study is the utilisation of broad outcomes that encompass multiple potential targets of care. We chose care coordination as the primary outcome measure because it is the primary target for change as in this patient population and the measurement instrument has been validated in CMC. Unfortunately, expectation of a change in disease status is not meaningful or realistic in many CMC, whereas improved navigation of the healthcare system is an important and improvable target of care. Biomedical endpoints, although important, are not meaningful in such a heterogeneous population.</p>
              <p>Third, the study has been designed to mitigate risk of bias. It is anticipated that some patients may be excluded; a concern are those who are marginalised (eg, non-English speaking), or are deemed too urgent to enrol in a waitlist. We aim to conduct a secondary study focused on comparing such patients to contemporaneous controls using administrative data to ensure knowledge generation about the impact of CCKO in this group as well, although with a higher risk of bias that would otherwise be attenuated with randomization (eg, unmeasured confounders).</p>
              <p>Fourth, the focus of this study is not solely quantitative in nature. We have elicited a mixed-methods approach. We will conduct interviews with a subset of intervention arm parents to capture their experience with the intervention, areas of improvement, as well as perceived benefits and harms. This approach will identify what aspects of the CCKO intervention are more or less effective, for whom, in what context and why.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the integrated knowledge translation (KT) is unique in that the direct provincial implementation of the CCKO rollout has been matched directly with the evaluation such that the knowledge end-user was a part of the study team from the outset. The integrated KT approach has included families caring for CMC, policymakers and widely representative clinicians such as nurses and physicians. This large integrative model allows direct translation of results and seamless integration of knowledge.</p>
