                <sec id="s1">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Both the Crohn’s disease exclusion diet combined with partial enteral nutrition (CDED+PEN) and exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in mild-to-moderate pediatric Crohn’s disease and are associated with a marked decrease in fecal kynurenine levels. This suggests a link between clinical outcome of dietary therapy and changes in tryptophan metabolism pathways. Here, we characterize the changes in several fecal tryptophan metabolites induced by CDED+PEN or EEN and their association with remission.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A total of 21 tryptophan metabolites were quantified in fecal samples from a 12-week prospective randomized trial with CDED+PEN or EEN for induction of remission in mild to moderate pediatric Crohn’s disease. Tryptophan metabolites at week 0 (W0), W6, and W12 of 73 samples were quantitatively measured by liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, and data were analyzed according to clinical groups of baselines (W0), induced remission at W6, no remission, sustained remission at W12, and nonsustained remission.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Reduction in components of the kynurenine pathway, such as kynurenine and quinolinic acid, were strongly associated with induced remission with both CDED+PEN and EEN, which were maintained in sustained remission. Specific serotonin pathway metabolites, such as melatonin, N-acetylserotonin, and 5-OH-tryptophan, were significantly increased in fecal samples from patients maintaining remission at W12 with both CDED+PEN and EEN. Importantly, in samples from patients failing to sustain remission, no changes were observed. Remission induction with EEN differs from CDED+PEN, particularly the moderate effects on indole pathway metabolites. The ratios of kynurenine and melatonin and quinolinic acid and melatonin perform well as markers for sustained remission.</p>

                <sec id="s4">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The reduction in specific kynurenine pathway compounds and the increase in serotonin pathway compounds are associated with diet-induced and sustained remission. Further studies are warranted to assess causality and the association of these metabolites with specific diet and lifestyle factors, affecting sustained clinical remission.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The increased incidence of pediatric Crohn’s disease (CD) worldwide has been strongly linked to dietary shifts toward a Westernized diet,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1-3</xref></sup> which includes high amounts of processed foods, red meat, high fat, sugar and additive exposure, and a lack of dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetables.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Westernized diet patterns may negatively affect the gut microbiome and metabolome and alter the intestinal immunity, which influences CD development and the disease course.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Sufficient tryptophan intake is necessary to maintain gut homeostasis: a diet deficient in tryptophan has been shown to alter the gut microbiota and increase inflammation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The CD exclusion diet combined with partial enteral nutrition (CDED+PEN) and exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) were designed to minimize dietary exposure to foods that might adversely influence the microbiome, metabolome, intestinal barrier, and immunity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although dietary therapies are effective in inducing remission and have been recommended as first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate pediatric CD, there are still some challenges.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> For EEN therapy, rigorous exclusion of solid food intake is necessary for success, which makes EEN an unsuitable treatment to maintain remission long term.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5-7</xref></sup> In addition, and as repeatedly shown, there is a rapid return of inflammation upon food reintroduction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8-10</xref></sup> CDED+PEN is primarily based on table food with improved tolerance compared with EEN and has also shown promise to sustain remission. Like any behavioral modification, CDED+PEN requires a strong commitment to planning, preparation, and cost of meals according to the dietary instructions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Thus, understanding the mechanism of actions of nutritional therapy, including specific changes in metabolomics or microbiome associated with clinical remission induction and maintenance, may yield new strategies to simplify and ultimately improve the dietary intervention. This could potentially identify new therapeutic targets and perhaps even prevention approaches.</p>
              <p>In humans, the main source of tryptophan is dietary intake. Tryptophan is metabolized by 3 pathways in the gastrointestinal tract: kynurenine, serotonin, and microbiota-derived indole pathway metabolites.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The balance between these 3 pathways is critical to maintaining intestinal homeostasis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Alterations in tryptophan metabolism pathways are strongly associated with CD, suggesting an active role in disease development.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13-16</xref></sup> Elevated concentrations of some kynurenine pathway metabolites, such as kynurenine and quinolinic acid, have been detected in fecal and serum samples of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Moreover, increased serotonin levels and a reduction in some serotonin pathway components such as melatonin and 5-OH-tryptophan were seen in colitis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14-16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We have recently shown significant changes in a limited set of fecal metabolite levels that were associated with clinical outcome and type of dietary intervention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Among the most robust associations with remission was the reduction in kynurenine levels with both CDED+PEN and EEN. The changes in kynurenine levels displayed the highest discriminatory biomarker power compared with other metabolite changes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> While these data suggest a potential link between possible changes in tryptophan metabolism pathways and the clinical outcome associated with the dietary therapy, there were a limited number of tryptophan metabolites included in our previous study. In addition, the changes were mainly displayed as normalized intensity and not absolute concentrations, which limited the interpretation of the data.</p>
              <p>In the present study, we sought to characterize the changes in the absolute concentration of multiple metabolites belonging to the 3 different tryptophan metabolism pathways (the measured metabolites are illustrated in <bold><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) in the feces of pediatric CD patients that were subjected to CDED+PEN or EEN therapy. We aimed to analyze the data according to the clinical outcome and type of dietary therapy and identify potential biomarkers associated with clinical remission.</p>

                <p>A total of 21 tryptophan metabolites were quantified in 73 fecal samples collected from 43 pediatric CD patients through a previously performed 12-week prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT)<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> using 2 different nutritional therapies (CDED+PEN: n = 22 patients; or EEN: n = 21 patients) for induction of remission in mild-to-moderate pediatric CD.</p>
                <p>The first group followed CDED, with additional PEN (MODULEN IBD; Nestlé) for 50% of calculated energy requirements for 6 weeks, followed by a step-down diet with an additional 25% of energy requirements by PEN until week 12 as described previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The second group followed 100% EN for 6 weeks, after which they gradually returned to a free diet with 25% of calories from PEN as described previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The primary outcome of the RCT was the tolerability to the dietary therapy. Secondary endpoints of the study were intention-to-treat remission at week 6 (defined by a Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score ≤10) and corticosteroid-free intention-to-treat sustained remission at week 12. The study was approved by the local ethics board at each of the participating sites, and informed consent was obtained for each participant as described previously (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01728870" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01728870</ext-link>).<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Each patient was provided 2 containers labeled with stickers. When the patient brought the samples (up to 24 hours), we kept the calprotectin container at -20 °C and split the microbiome/metabolome container into 4 transfer tubes (Eppendorf tube with black cap) using a wooden stick and stored them immediately at -80°C without any buffer.</p>
                <p>A targeted quantitative measurement of tryptophan metabolites at week 0 (W0), W6, and W12 of 73 fecal samples was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometry as described previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The data were analyzed according to clinical groups of baseline (W0), induced remission at W6 (W6_rem), no remission (W6_nr), sustained remission at W12 (W12_sr), and nonsustained remission (W12_nsr).</p>
                <p>The number of CDED+PEN fecal samples was the following (total: n = 38): W0 (n = 14), W6_rem (n = 13), W6_nr (n = 2), W12_sr (n = 8), and W12_nr (n = 1). The number of EEN fecal samples was the following (total: n = 35): W0 (n = 13), W6_rem (n = 9), W6_nr (n = 4), W12_sr (n = 6) and W12_nr (n = 3).

                <p>For fecal tryptophan metabolites measurement, 3 mg of lyophilized stool samples and 900 μL of MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O mixture (1:1) were added according to internal standards. The samples were vortexed, homogenized, and centrifuged. Then, 100 µL of the supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate for metabolites quantification and 800 µL were evaporated to dryness with a vacuum concentrator (Savant SPD 111 vs SpeedVac; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 45°C for 4 hours. The residues were reconstituted in 100 μL of MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O mixture (1:9), and 2 µL were analyzed.</p>
                <p>The liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification was performed as previously described.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A calibration curve was created for each metabolite by calculating the intensity ratio obtained between the metabolite and its internal standard. These calibration curves were then utilized to determine the concentrations of each metabolite in fecal samples. Specific calibration ranges and internal standards concentrations associated to fragmentation parameters are provided in the <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>
                <p>The 21 tryptophan metabolites measured were tryptophan, kynurenine pathway metabolites (kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-OH-kynurenine, 3-OH, anthranilic acid, picolinic acid, and quinolinic acid), serotonin pathway metabolites (5-OH-tryptophan, serotonin, N-acetylserotonin, melatonin, and 5-OH-indoleacetic acid), and indole pathway metabolites (tryptamine, indoxyl sulfate [indole-3-sulfate], indole-3-acetamide, indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, indole-3-aldehyde, tryptophol, and indole).</p>
                <p>The chemical structure and the position of all measured metabolites in different tryptophan metabolism pathways are illustrated in <bold><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>.</p>

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated with 95% confidence intervals.

Thus, we commanded MetaboAnalyst 5.0 to compute and include all possible ratios of the top 20 tryptophan metabolite pairs (based on <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values) to be integrated in further biomarker analysis. Individual metabolites and metabolite ratios with AUC ≥0.8 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05 were selected. The final figures were adapted in Inkscape 0.92.4.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have shown that clinical outcomes of dietary therapy are strongly linked to specific changes in some kynurenine and serotonin pathway compounds that were previously shown to be associated with mediating intestinal homeostasis and immunity, as well as mediating mood and sleep regulation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13-15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In this study, we report the reduction in kynurenine pathway metabolites, which appear early with clinical remission and are maintained with ongoing dietary therapy and clinical sustained remission, while the increase in some specific serotonin pathway compounds occurs with the clinical outcome of sustained remission.</p>
              <p>Importantly, these observations were not seen when an early flare occurred upon resuming a free diet in the EEN group. These data suggest that dietary therapy–induced and sustained remission may be linked with certain tryptophan metabolite composition level changes that dietary therapy nonresponders or patients experiencing an early flare upon resuming free diet do not display.</p>
              <p>Induced and sustained remission with EEN differs from CDED+PEN with changes in some indole pathway metabolites. Ratios between kynurenine or quinolinic acids and melatonin performed remarkably well as biomarkers for sustained remission with both dietary interventions. This suggests that some metabolic changes might reflect remission, whereas others could represent diet-specific processes.</p>

                <title>Changes in Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites</title>
                <p>The main source of kynurenine is from the degradation of tryptophan. Kynurenine is further metabolized by several host enzymes, eventually leading to the formation of quinolinic acid.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The tryptophan metabolites (kynurenine and quinolinic acid) have been suggested to be critical in modulating intestinal immunity and disturbances in their fecal and serum concentrations were linked to CD.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Several studies of tryptophan metabolites reported an overproduction of kynurenine and quinolinic acid in inflammatory diseases. Based on previous literature, it is suggested that during inflammation these metabolites are increased in order to suppress inflammation rather than being proinflammatory metabolites themselves.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> For instance, kynurenine has been suggested to play a critical role in controlling the inflammatory response via activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> AhR activation has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Quinolinic acid has been suggested to have immunosuppressant properties (eg, on cytokine production).<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In this study, both CDED+PEN and EEN therapies were strongly associated with reduced kynurenine and quinolinic acid compared with baseline samples. This reduction persists through W12_sr. Kynurenine reduction in this study confirmed our previous observations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Thus, CDED+PEN–induced, CDED+PEN–sustained, EEN-induced, and EEN-sustained remission point to either kynurenine and quinolinic acid reductions as one of the factors that may functionally participate in the clinical outcome of remission, or just reflecting the reduction in inflammatory response due to diet-induced remission. In active IBD, IDO1 is highly expressed in cells of both the lamina propria and epithelium.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> IDO1 is critical to trigger the kynurenine pathway, and its decrease with reduced inflammation can affect kynurenine pathway metabolites synthesis in colitis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>

              <sec id="s19">
                <title>Changes in Serotonin Pathway Metabolites</title>
                <p>Changes in some serotonin pathway metabolites have been consistently observed in studies of experimental colitis and IBD patients, particularly the reduction in 5-OH-tryptophan, N-acetylserotonin, and melatonin.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14-16</xref></sup> These metabolites were significantly increased with dietary therapy–sustained remission in our study but not in samples in which remission was not sustained, suggesting a role in mediating intestinal homeostasis.</p>
                <p>While no data are yet available in colitis, administration of 5-OH-tryptophan led a strong anti-inflammatory effect in collagen-induced arthritis, through decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and reducing T helper 1 and T helper 17 populations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Interestingly, this was associated with decreased serum levels of kynurenine,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> which corroborates our observation in feces with dietary therapy–induced remission in CD.</p>
                <p>Melatonin supplementation has been found beneficial in some preclinical studies of IBD but has been understudied in clinical IBD.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Melatonin and its direct precursor N-acetylserotonin have demonstrated strong antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effects.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The effect of melatonin on shaping gut microbiota composition in relation to susceptibility to colitis is well established.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Kim et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> demonstrated that melatonin reverts microbial dysbiosis by increasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes through controlling antimicrobial peptide production in DSS-induced colitis.</p>
                <p>We previously showed that CDED+PEN– and EEN-induced remission is associated with improvement of dysbiosis, but some dysbiotic features remain even after 12 weeks of treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In our current study, we show that dietary therapy–sustained remission is associated with markedly increased levels of melatonin and N-acetylserotonin. Thus, we suggest the changes in melatonin and its precursor N-acetylserotonin level might be a potential player in the remission maintenance by positively affecting the gut microbiota composition and controlling the inflammatory response. It is tempting to speculate that these metabolites also play a role in the improved quality of life associated with clinical remission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Serotonin is produced mainly in the gastrointestinal tract,<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and its reduction in untreated CD patients has been suggested to influence CD development.<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Serotonin influences autophagy and gut microbiota composition and is associated with disease activity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> We found significant associations in this study, with increased N-acetylserotonin (also known as normelatonin, a precursor of melatonin in the production pathway from serotonin) in CDED+PEN–sustained remission, whereas a significant decrease in fecal serotonin level was only associated with EEN-induced remission at week 6. These observations suggest that pairwise investigations of metabolites of these metabolic pathways may shed more light on the true strength and biological relevance of these associations.</p>

                <title>Biomarker Signatures</title>
                <p>ROC analysis revealed robust biomarker signatures associated with the clinical outcome of remission with both dietary therapies. In particular, ratios between kynurenine pathway metabolites (kynurenine or quinolinic acid) and the serotonin pathway metabolite (melatonin) performed well as biomarkers for remission with CDED+PEN and maintaining remission with both CDED+PEN and EEN therapy. Interestingly, the ratios between serotonin and some other metabolites in the serotonin pathway such as N-acetylserotonin and melatonin were the most promising signatures associated with EEN-induced remission samples. These data can add to the development of more comprehensive disease signatures combining calprotectin, microbiome, and metabolomics to define and monitor clinical outcomes with dietary therapy.</p>
                <p>While the ROC analysis is meant to identify the accuracy of biomarkers for dietary therapy–induced remission, the patterns of different tryptophan pathways activation we identified may give some indications about the mechanism of action of nutritional therapy. The serotonin-to-N-acetylserotonin and serotonin-to-melatonin ratios were high at baseline and significantly decreased with EEN-induced remission. Serotonin is the main precursor for N-acetylserotonin and melatonin synthesis, which indicates that the degradation of serotonin into subsequent metabolites in the serotonin metabolism pathway is enhanced with remission induction.</p>
                <p>Ratios between kynurenine and melatonin and quinolinic acid and melatonin were significantly reduced with sustained remission compared with baseline, suggesting that the degradation of tryptophan into the kynurenine metabolism pathway is reduced in favor of its degradation into the serotonin metabolism pathway as inflammation improves. In CD patients, previous studies of active disease have shown an accumulation of serotonin<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and reduction in serotonin pathway metabolism activation<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14-16</xref></sup> and an increased kynurenine pathway activation leading to kynurenine and quinolinic acid accumulation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Thus, our data suggests that dietary therapy may correct the inflammatory disturbance in the different tryptophan pathways.</p>
                <p>As the kynurenine and serotonin pathways generally are not directly related to intestinal microbiota, this suggests that nutritional therapy may indeed affect some host enzymes regulating these pathways such as IDO1 and TpH1.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In turn, this can be the consequence of the reduced inflammation by nutritional therapy. Transcriptional studies and the assessment of tryptophan-metabolizing enzymes are warranted to better understand the effects of diet-induced remission on tryptophan metabolism. For instance, Wnorowski et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> showed that in intestinal tissues of active IBD, the changes in the expression of genes encoding the tryptophan-metabolizing enzymes indicate the shift in intestinal tryptophan metabolism from the synthesis of serotonin pathway metabolites toward kynurenine pathway metabolites. Importantly, these transcriptomic profiles were normalized after successful treatment with infliximab (responders),<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> which corroborates our finding using dietary therapy.</p>
                <p>The intestinal microbiota orchestrates the direct tryptophan degradation into indole pathway metabolites and derivatives.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> While the beneficial clinical outcome of both CDED+PEN and EEN was associated with strong changes in the concentration of some key compounds of kynurenine and serotonin pathways, the concentrations of indole pathway metabolites were unchanged in CDED+PEN samples, and only moderate changes in indole pathway metabolites were observed with EEN. This corroborates our previous microbiome (metagenome) findings on the same fecal samples that were used for this targeted tryptophan metabolites study.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> No significant differential gene abundances were detected in indole pathway comparing diet-induced remission vs nonremission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In this study, we used fecal samples from a previously reported RCT<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> to describe the impact of CDED+PEN and EEN on gut tryptophan metabolite profiles and the association with the clinical outcomes. Limitations of our study include the small sample size, particularly concerning CD patients not achieving or maintaining remission with CDED+PEN, as around 88% achieved and sustained remission with CDED+PEN from W6 to W12. We used a targeted approach to measure 21 tryptophan metabolites complementing previously presented targeted investigations of metabolomics composition and microbiome.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As tryptophan pathways contain many other metabolites (not included in this study), this inevitably leads to reduced resolution of the analysis of complex metabolic pathways.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study shows that a reduction in kynurenine pathway activity and an increase in serotonin pathway activity are associated with diet-induced and -sustained remission. These data may inform future research to improve dietary interventions in CD. The pairwise metabolite investigations we presented show promise as markers of metabolomic diet–induced remission and warrant further study in conjunction with other noninvasive inflammatory and microbiome markers. Future study to understand the effect of the identified tryptophan metabolite changes on achieving remission through anti-inflammatory and regulatory effects, eg, through AhR signaling and tryptophan metabolism–associated genes and enzymes, is warranted.</p>
