                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The World Health Organization recommends tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment (TPT) for all people living with HIV (PLH) and household contacts (HHC) of index TB patients. Tests for TB infection (TBI) or to rule out TB disease (TBD) are preferred, but if not available, this should not be a barrier if access to these tests is limited for high-risk people, such as PLH and HHC under 5 years old. There is equipoise on the need for these tests in different risk populations, especially HHC aged over 5.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This superiority cluster-randomized multicenter trial with three arms of equal size compares, in Benin and Brazil, three strategies for HHC investigation aged 0–50: (i) tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) for TBI and if positive, chest X-Ray (CXR) to rule out TBD in persons with positive TST or IGRA; (ii) same as (i) but GeneXpert (GX) replaces CXR; and (iii) no TBI testing. CXR for all; if CXR is normal, TPT is recommended. All strategies start with symptom screening. Clusters are defined as HHC members of the same index patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TBD. The main outcome is the proportion of HHC that are TPT eligible who start TPT within 3 months of the index TB patient starting TBD treatment. Societal costs, incidence of severe adverse events, and prevalence of TBD are among secondary outcomes. Stratified analyses by age (under versus over 5) and by index patient microbiological status will be conducted.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">All participants provide signed informed consent. The study was approved by the Research Ethic Board of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, the Brazilian National Ethical Board CONEP, and the “Comité Local d’Éthique Pour la Recherche Biomédicale (CLERB) de l’Université de Parakou,” Benin. Findings will be submitted for publication in major medical journals and presented in conferences, to WHO and National and municipal TB programs of the involved countries.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This randomized trial is meant to provide high-quality evidence to inform WHO recommendations on investigation of household contacts, as currently these are based on very low-quality evidence.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par12">Tuberculosis (TB) was responsible for 1.3 million deaths in HIV-negative persons in 2020, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] despite being preventable and curable. Prevention of the disease through treatment of TB infection (TBI) is a key strategy for TB elimination, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] as nearly 1/4 of the global population has TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] of whom approximately 10% will develop the disease, maintaining the transmission chain. For these reasons, the United Nations’ High-Level Meeting (UN-HLM) held in 2018 recommended to provide preventive TB treatment (TPT) to 30 million people by 2022. This included 6 million persons living with HIV (PLHIV), 4 million children under 5 years of age who were contacts of pulmonary TB patients and 20 million other contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The goal for PLHIV was attained and some progress has been made to reach the goal among children, but up to December 2020, only 0.3 million contacts over 5 years of age completed TPT. This represents only 1.6% of the UN-HLM target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">To increase uptake of TPT worldwide, shorter and safer rifamycin-based regimens have been adopted to replace the current standard of 6–9 months of isoniazid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, treatment adherence represents only the tip of the iceberg of the cascade-of-care for TBI. Many losses occur along all the other steps of the cascade-of-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These include identifying those eligible for investigation, placing and reading a tuberculin skin test (TST), or performing an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), ruling out TB disease through medical evaluation and a chest radiograph (CXR) in those with a positive TST or IGRA, and finally the prescription of TPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A systematic review reported that less than 30% of those eligible for TPT receive a prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Recognizing the real and perceived barriers in large scale implementation of testing for TBI and ruling out TB disease (TBD), the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if TST/IGRA or CXR are not available, this should not be a barrier for TPT prescription for those in need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, performance of TST/IGRA and CXR is recommended where feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is because TST and IGRA identify people at greater risk of progressing to TBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since TPT may cause serious adverse events, including fatal hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], this should be offered only to those who will benefit. Importantly, systematic reviews and large-scale clinical trials have consistently shown that TST identifies those who will benefit from TPT, even among immunocompromised patients, such as those living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Surveys have found that half of household contacts in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and over 2/3 of PLHIV are TST-negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], suggesting that the majority of persons who would be treated if TBI testing was not accessible would be exposed to potential harms, without significant benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">With regard to ruling out TBD, systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have estimated that sensitivity of symptom screening is close to 80% in PLHIV who are not receiving antiretroviral treatment, but the sensitivity of symptom screening is less than 50% in PLHIV receiving antiretroviral treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although systematic reviews of randomized trials have concluded that TPT does not increase the risk of resistance to rifampicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or isoniazid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], in all trials included in these reviews, participants underwent CXR to exclude active TBD before initiating TPT.</p>
              <p id="Par16">In summary, current evidence favors the need for a TST (or IGRA) to identify those who will benefit most from TPT and a CXR to exclude disease before offering TPT, but equipoise exists.</p>

                <p id="Par21">This is a superiority, open label cluster-randomized multicenter trial with three arms of equal size; clusters are defined as all HHC of patients with newly diagnosed active pulmonary TB. The first eligible member of the household who provides signed informed consent to participate is randomized to one of the three strategies. All subsequently enrolled members of the household are assigned to the same arm. Randomization is computer-generated and stratified by country, in blocks of variable length.</p>

                <title>Study sites</title>
                <p id="Par22">The coordinating center is based in the McGill TB Centre of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada. Clinics reporting more than 80 TB patients per year were selected in Porto-Novo and Cotonou, Benin and in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Manaus, Brazil. Clinics were purposely selected to representative of the diagnostic facilities and capacities available in these countries. Some clinics have all diagnostic facilities on site; others have made administrative arrangements with nearby health facilities for the rapid performance of the needed tests, for study participants.</p>

              <sec id="Sec7">
                <title>Eligibility and inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
                <p id="Par23">Index patients aged 13 or more in Benin or 14 or more in Brazil with pulmonary TB diagnosed within the past 30 days are approached for permission to invite their HHC to participate. Index cases are classified as microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed. Microbiological confirmation is defined as a positive sputum smear microscopy, GX, or culture for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Index cases are excluded if they have no eligible HHC or they have confirmed MDR (patients with mono-resistance to INH or rifampin can be included as long as they have documented sensitivity to the other drug).</p>
                <p id="Par24">Eligible HHC are those aged up to 50 years (under 5 years of age are excluded in Benin), not known to have HIV infection, and who have not had a CXR or any TBI test in the past 3 months. For HHC with unknown HIV status, HIV testing is not mandatory but is offered according to National Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The reason for the upper age limit is the higher risk for severe adverse events (hepatotoxicity) of isoniazid in persons over the age of 50. In Benin, all HHC under 5 are prescribed TPT, regardless of testing; thus, they are not included. In Brazil, current policy for investigation of HHC of all ages is TST, CXR for those with a positive TST; thus, all age HHC up to 50 years are eligible in Brazil. In Benin, pregnant women can be included after the first trimester and undergo CXR—when indicated—with appropriate shielding. In Brazil, female HHC undergo a urine pregnancy test before randomization, and if positive, they are excluded.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par25">All strategies start with symptom screening for cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. In all three strategies, the investigations mandated by the protocol are the minimum required. The treating clinical team can, at any time, order additional investigations, such as HIV testing, and prescribe non-TB related treatment, if they feel these are clinically warranted. All non-protocol mandated investigations and treatment are recorded, and the costs added in the calculation of total costs for each strategy, regardless of whether these added costs are borne by the public health system or the patient.</p>

                  <p id="Par26">This strategy is based on the 2018 WHO recommended algorithm for HHC that are HIV-negative and aged ≥ 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Simultaneously with symptom screen, a TST is performed at the first interview. An interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) would be an acceptable alternative, but in the two countries where this study is conducted, IGRA testing is not accessible in the public health system. Training for TST administration and reading is done during initial site training, if needed. The “mTST tool” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is used as a quality assurance tool for TST administration and reading (see link for video on mTST instructions <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v</ext-link> = PsBTYiEAKcc&amp;t = 4 s).</p>
                  <p id="Par27">The TST induration is read 48 to 72 h after tuberculin injection. The cut-point for a positive TST follows the NTP guidelines in each country. The Brazilian guidelines recommend a second TST 8 weeks later if the first TST is negative. This is not mandated by the study protocol—to be consistent in both countries and with WHO guidelines. However, if providers wish to do this second TST, this can be done, and therapy given if the second TST is at least 10 mm greater than the first TST (defined as conversion). At the time of TST reading (i.e., after 48–72 h), patients with symptoms at the time of initial screening are reassessed for persistence of symptoms.</p>
                  <p id="Par28">Participants with negative TST and with no symptoms or resolved symptoms are discharged. If TST is positive or if symptoms persist, a CXR is performed. If the CXR is normal and they have no symptoms, they are recommended to start TPT. If the CXR is abnormal, or normal but TB symptoms persist, they undergo microbiological testing. If the microbiological tests are negative for TBD, then participants are discharged if TST is negative or recommended to start TPT if TST is positive.</p>

                  <p id="Par29">The key difference from strategy 1 is that GX replaces CXR. Initial steps of symptoms screening and TST administration with symptom re-assessment at time of TST reading 48–72 h later are the same. However, those who are TST positive, or TST negative but with persistent symptoms, have a GX test. It is predicted that even after careful training, approximately 40% of adolescents and adults, and an even higher proportion of children between 5 and 10 years of age, will not be able to produce a sputum sample. In these participants, this could result in missed TBD, so if participants cannot produce a sputum sample, they will have a CXR. If the CXR is abnormal and judged possibly or probably TBD such that microbiologic investigations are necessary, procedures outlined for the other two arms are followed. In a planned secondary analysis, we will examine the proportion of participants in the GX arm (strategy 2) who are unable to produce sputum and (i) are judged to have possible or probable TBD on CXR or (ii) are treated for TBD or (iii) have positive sputum cultures. For children under 5 years of age, sputum induction is performed using the method described by Zar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

Four months of rifampicin (4R) is recommended for those over 50 years of age, under 10 years of age and for those with suspected or confirmed chronic liver disease.

For HHC, CRF for randomization, study procedures and follow-up are also completed. The study personnel ensure that the protocol-mandated procedures are followed for each strategy, but any medical decision by the treating team is allowed, although recorded. Because this was intended to be a pragmatic trial, we adopted procedures that were in place in the sites and used routinely to enhance adherence. Thus, if the participant misses one procedure or appointment, the study team tries to make contact once, by telephone. When the investigation of the HHC is completed, this is reported using a specific “investigation completed” CRF. If the protocol-mandated investigation is not completed within 3 months after randomization, this is considered a failure of the strategy, and the same CRF is completed. Participants who receive TPT are followed by the clinical staff as per national guidelines. If started on TPT, then outcomes of TPT are recorded on a specific CRF completed at the end of therapy. If an AE occurs during TPT, that is recorded separately on a different AE specific CRF. If at any time during study follow-up TB disease is diagnosed, or death occurs, these are recoded on TBD or death CRFs respectively.</p>

                  <p id="Par35">Once uploaded, the coordinator center in Montreal evaluates each CXR to check if it has the minimum quality criteria. If not, they provide feedback to the sites, and a new CXR is requested. After ensuring the quality criteria, all CXR are forwarded to a panel of experts. They reassess all images for interpretation and categorize them as normal, abnormal not TB, and abnormal possible TB. Feedback to the study team is sent if there is a disagreement between the panel and the clinical staff.</p>

Costs include time and travel costs for visits for investigation and treatment, and all out-of-pocket expenses, particularly for the time, travel, and any other expenses related to TST and CXR (even if the participants do not pay for the actual tests—these may require separate visits to the health facility just to complete them—which requires time and out-of-pocket expenditures).</p>
                  <p id="Par38">We have adapted a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire that we used previously to measure patient and family costs associated with TBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We have included a small number of items on this questionnaire regarding patient experience and acceptability of study procedures. For participants who completed investigations required for the study but do not require TPT or TBD treatment, the questionnaire is administered within 1 month of completing all investigations. For participants who were recommended to start treatment for TBI or TBD, the questionnaire is applied 3 months after randomization, which should correspond to having been on treatment for about 2 months. We expect that participants will have good recall of their experience with TST injection and reading, performance of CXR, and provision of sputum samples and performance of GX or other microbiologic testing, as 3 months will still be recent enough to avoid recall difficulties. Patient time will be valuated based on an assumption of income equivalent to the average per capita income in the country.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par39">Our primary analysis will address the outcomes in HHC aged 5–50 years of index patients with microbiologically confirmed TB. We will base the total sample size on the proportion of identified HHC who start TPT in each strategy. We are interested in detecting a difference between the proportion of HHC starting TPT in those randomized to the standard algorithm and each of the alternative regimens. The proportion starting TPT during phase 2 of ACT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], at the same study sites, when solutions had been implemented and the barriers of TST and CXR had been resolved, will be used as the likely proportion in the standard arm. We consider that accepting to start treatment will likely be strongly influenced by other household members. We do not have an estimate of the cluster effect of HHC on starting, so we will use the “cluster effect” of study therapy completion which was observed in previous TPT trials in the same sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This gave an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) or clustering effect of HHC of 0.33. Based on this ICC and an average of three HHC aged 5–50 years (observed in the ACT4 trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we can estimate the design effect as 1 + (household size-1)*ICC. We will assess differences across sites but expect randomization to reduce potential confounders.</p>
                <p id="Par40">In the ACT4 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], 60% of eligible HHC started a TPT regimen once the TST and CXR problems were resolved. We assume that 50% of HHC aged 5–50 would be eligible for TPT and that 60% of eligible HHC contacts in the standard arm would start therapy—for an overall initiation rate of 30% of participants randomized to the standard arm in this trial. To detect an improvement to 85% of eligible starting TPT in the GX arm (strategy 2), resulting in an overall initiation rate of 42.5% in this arm, we would need to enroll 455 participants into each arm. Allowing for 5% withdrawal, or otherwise not analyzable participants, this would inflate the number per arm to 478, so we plan to enroll a total of 1434 participants. If the TPT initiation rate among eligible is 80%, providing an overall initiation rate that is only 10% better than the standard algorithm, then 1371 participants would still provide 60% power to detect a significant difference. Power will be greater if the initiation rate in the standard arm is lower; for example, if only 50% of eligible HHC or 25% overall, initiate TPT, as seen in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For the 0–5 subgroup, we used the same estimates of effect and ICC but assumed 50% of household with 1 child under 5 and 50% with 2 and a higher loss to follow-up (10%). That would mean a sample size of 284 children under 5.

                <p id="Par65">All participants will sign an informed consent obtained by the research team. In Brazil, index TB patients will also sign an informed consent. The current version of the study was approved by the Research Ethic Board of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre on August 16, 2019 (Study 2020–5634 Form F1-59915), by the Brazilian National Ethical Board CONEP on May 7, 2020 (#4.014.402), and by the “Comité Local d’Éthique Pour la Recherche Biomédicale (CLERB) de l’Université de Parakou,” Benin, on December 30, 2019 (#0293). In Brazil, an amendment to include children under 5 and index TB patients who were clinically diagnosed (not microbiologically confirmed) was approved on July 30, 2021 (#4.133.939).</p>
                <p id="Par66">All protocol amendments were approved by the ethical review boards and notified to the funders and subsequently to the centers. A copy of the revised protocol is available in each site’s Master Binder. Any deviations or violations from the protocol are fully documented using a report form (Note to File). All adverse events and deviation are informed to the Coordinating Centre in Montreal. Any serious adverse event is also reported to the ethical review boards.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Findings will be submitted for publication in major medical journals and presented in conferences, to WHO and National and municipal TB Programs of the involved countries as reports and in planned workshops. All data is safely stored at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gxt-ltb.cred.ca/">https://gxt-ltb.cred.ca/</ext-link>. Results will be submitted for publication in major medical journals.</p>
