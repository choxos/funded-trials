                <sec id="s1">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Periods of prolonged lockdown increase the risk of physical inactivity, which can contribute to physical decline among older adults. Online technology could be an innovative solution to promote physical activity (PA) habits in this context. The goal of this study was to examine and compare the acceptability, feasibility, and potential benefits of 2 modalities of web-based PA interventions in older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Eighty-three nonphysically active community-dwelling older adults (aged 60 and older) were randomized to a 12-week web-based PA intervention delivered either in a live group (LG; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 38) or a recorded group (RG; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 45). Acceptability, feasibility as well as functional capacities, physical performance, quality of life, and PA level were assessed pre and postintervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There were fewer dropouts in the LG than RG (LG: 16% vs RG: 46%). However, adherence rate (LG: 89%; RG: 81%), level of satisfaction (LG: 77% vs RG: 64%), and enjoyment (LG: 68% vs RG: 62%) were similar across groups, even if the participants found the intervention slightly difficult (LG: 58% vs RG: 63%). Both groups significantly improved on functional capacities, physical performance, and quality of life. Only the LG showed significant improvements in perceived health and PA level. The LG showed greater improvements in physical performance and quality of life than the RG.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Web-based PA interventions are feasible, acceptable, and beneficial for improving functional capacities and physical performance during periods of lockdown. However, the interactive web and live modalities appear to be more effective for promoting some of these outcomes than recorded and individual modalities.</p>

            <p>Physical inactivity, defined as a lack or absence of regular physical activity (PA) (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), affects more than 50% of older adults and is recognized as the fourth most important risk factor for early mortality (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The lockdowns or social isolation that occurred during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic limited opportunities to practice PA (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Indeed, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, sedentary time, defined as time spent doing activities that do not increase energy expenditure at rest (ie, sitting and lying down), increased from 5 to 8 hours per day (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In addition, it has been observed that 40% of previously inactive people became even more inactive during the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals reported poorer mental health than individuals who engaged in more PA (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition to negative effects on mental health and quality of life, lack of PA and sedentary behaviors are also known to be detrimental to older adults’ physical health and functional independence (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In this context, online technologies represent an approach to deliver PA services while respecting social distancing guidelines. In addition, more than 60% of community-dwelling older adults in Canada have digital devices (ie, tablets, computers, or smartphones) and 70% connect to the internet daily (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
            <p>It has been shown that a 10-week web-based recorded PA intervention leads to high adherence in obese older women, and could be used as an alternative to supervised exercise for weight loss (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, another study reported that a 9-month web-based recorded PA intervention had a high and similar acceptance rate in older adults compared to an in-person PA intervention (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It has been observed that a web-based recorded PA intervention (3×/week from 12 to 16 weeks) improved metabolic health (ie, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin) in obese older adults (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the levels of mobility, functional balance and muscle strength (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) in inactive older adults. However, a systematic review shows that web-based PA interventions providing live feedback, such as live webconferences (Zoom, Skype, etc.), are an interesting alternative that leads to the same adherence than supervised in-person PA interventions in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Studies using web-based live PA interventions (ie, Zoom live group training; duration of 8–10 weeks) have shown that this type of intervention could be feasible in older adults living with cognitive decline or chronic pain (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Studies also demonstrated that the intervention was safe (no adverse events) and led to low drop-out rates and high adherence and satisfaction in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that the presence of an instructor, who provides live feedback during in-person group PA, potentiates the effectiveness of the intervention on health parameters by increasing participants’ motivation, adherence, and engagement (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Indeed, a study investigating the effect of an 8-week web-based live PA intervention (live web real-time communication) demonstrated positive effects on fall-related risk factors (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) in older adults. In addition, another study conducted on older adults observed that a 12-week live PA intervention (Skype) led to positive effects on sarcopenia-related factors (ie, total-body skeletal mass, appendicular lean soft tissue, lower limb muscle mass, and chair sit-and-reach score (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)). Finally, another study observed that implementing an 8-week web-based live PA intervention (Facebook live group exercise) improved functional fitness compared to a control group in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
            <p>While these recent studies showed the interesting potential of the implementation of web-based PA interventions (recorded or live) in older adults, it is important to note their limitations, especially in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. First, despite the likely difference in motivation induced by the presence of an instructor during live (interactive web-based intervention) compared to recorded online training sessions (noninteractive web-based intervention), none of the aforementioned studies compared the effects of these two modalities (recorded vs live training) nor their feasibility and acceptability in older adults in the same study. Second, none of these studies performed objectively, fully remote evaluations of physical function before and after the intervention. Finally, and more importantly, none of the studies reported a clear and replicable methodology for tailoring the content of the training sessions to a remote setting (ie, personalization within the live session based on the instructor’s guidance), thus compromising the validity, replicability, and transferability of the previous results. This aspect is of high importance because it has been shown that a personalized and tailored approach, based on the participant’s needs and individual characteristics, is necessary to implement remote interventions in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
            <p>In this context, the primary objective of this study was to confirm the feasibility and acceptability of 2 web-based PA interventions (ie, recorded video training on website platform or live-interactive training on Zoom platform) during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The secondary objective was to assess and compare the effects of two fully remote and tailored web-based PA interventions on physical and mental health in inactive community-dwelling older adults. We hypothesized that both interventions would be feasible and acceptable but that the live-interactive modality would lead to a greater adherence than the recorded. Finally, we hypothesized that both interventions would lead to health improvements, which would be higher in the live-interactive modality.</p>

                <p>Participants were recruited, between March and April 2020, from the CRIUGM’s volunteer database, which contains a large number of community-dwelling older adults, who voluntarily registered to be invited to participate in research projects related to aging. To be included in the study, participants needed to: (a) have an email address, an internet connection, and a digital device with a webcam at home, (b) be aged 60 and older, (c) live independently in the community, (d) be inactive (less than 7.500 steps per day and less than 150 minutes of exercise per week) based on the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity questionnaire (RAPA (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)), (e) have no counterindication to practice PA, (f) not be frail (based on the study of osteoporotic fractures questionnaire (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)) or use walking aids, and (g) not be diagnosed with neurological, cardiovascular, lung (auto-reported) or have cognitive diseases/disorders (based on the Telephonic-Mini Mental State Examination [T-MMSE] (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)).</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>To recruit participants, an email was sent to potentially eligible older adults from the CRIUGM database. For those who replied and expressed interest in the study, a phone screening was performed in order to: (a) confirm their eligibility, (b) obtain their verbal consent, and (c) verify their ability to use Zoom. After the screening phone call, the consent form and security training procedures were sent by email. Participants were asked to either return the consent form with their signature, or send a preformatted email confirming their consent to volunteer in the study. Thereafter, participants received the email, including the Zoom schedule for the training sessions and the link to perform the assessment. Participants who had never used Zoom were sent a link by email and taught how to use Zoom by phone. This step was needed by 20% of our sample. Both groups (LG and RG) underwent Zoom evaluations conducted by an assessor and including physical tests as well as questionnaires before and after the intervention. In addition, at the end of each training session, participants completed Limesurvey questionnaires on various outcomes.</p>
                <p>A total of 83 older adults were randomized to the LG (LG; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 38) or RG (RG; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 45), as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. This sample size was determined based on the resources available to conduct the project between April and August 2020.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>During the COVID-19 lockdown, face-to-face interventions could not be performed. Thus, to ensure the safety of our web-based PA interventions (live vs recorded), we created 4 levels (L1 = nonfit to L3 = fit) of difficulty to tailor the exercise intervention for each participant. Allocation to exercise group levels was performed using a mobility decisional tree as done previously (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Briefly, the mobility decisional tree included 6 tests (30-second sit-to-stand, bipodal balance, semitandem-balance, tandem-balance, unipodal balance, and level of PA) to obtain a score from 0 to 14 (Level 1: score &lt; 6; Level 2: 6 ≤ score ≥ 10; Level 3: score &gt; 11). This mobility decisional tree was performed during the evaluation session at baseline. Participants of the same level were grouped together and allocated to the appropriate exercise intervention. The 12-week exercise intervention included three 55-minute sessions per week. All sessions were structured into 3 blocks of exercises that aimed to improve muscle function, flexibility, and cardiovascular capacity, respectively. During each week of the intervention, one session per week was predominantly focused on one of the 3 blocks of exercises previously mentioned. Full details of the weekly structure can be found in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Material 1</xref>. In addition, every 4 weeks, the difficulty and intensity of the sessions were adjusted to maximize the health effects, adherence, and enjoyment. Moreover, the position (sitting or standing), amplitude, number of repetitions, and intensity of the exercises were modified and adapted to the level of the participants, which allowed a safe and appropriate progression. Finally, both groups followed the same training program, but the LG sessions included a certified exercise instructor (kinesiologist; using Zoom) following a specific schedule (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings), whereas the RG attended individual video sessions, which were prerecorded by a certified exercise instructor (kinesiologist). To ensure safety in the LG, the number of participants in each level was limited from 10 (L1) to 14 (L3) individuals.</p>
                <p>During our study, 3 specific LGs (Group 1 [L3]: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12 [W: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> =10/M: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2]; Group 2 [L3]: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14 [W: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12/M: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2]; Group 3 [L2]: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12 [W: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8; M: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4]) were trained. Moreover, all the training sessions were supervised by the same 2 certified exercise instructors (kinesiologists) during the 12-week intervention. The first certified kinesiologist was in charge of training the LG participants each Monday, while the second trained them each Wednesday and Friday throughout the intervention.</p>
                <p>In contrast, the RG followed the training program individually using a secure website (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.trainingrecommend.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.trainingrecommend.com</ext-link>; access code required). Participants in the RG were free to complete the recorded sessions at any time, but they did not receive supervision or feedback while completing the exercises. To ensure safety in the RG, participants (L1 to L3: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 45; L3: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 34; L2: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11) had access to 9 specific and adapted videos according to their exercise group level (similar exercise sessions to the LG). During the first 4 weeks of the program (weeks 1–4), participants had access to the first 3 videos. Thereafter, they followed the second block of 3 videos for 4 weeks (weeks 5–8) and the third block of 3 videos for the 4 subsequent weeks (weeks 9–12) in order to increase the difficulty/intensity level (similarly to LG participants). Regarding safety, before each training video or PA session, a short video was presented to remind participants of the safety protocol to follow before their training (ie, phone close by, remove objects or carpets from path, etc.). Like LG participants, they were required to fill out a Limesurvey questionnaire at the end of each session on various outcomes and report any adverse events. A phone number was provided in the same questionnaire to contact the team if needed.</p>

                  <p>Feasibility and acceptability were assessed throughout the intervention.</p>
                  <p>In this study, feasibility was assessed using adherence to the intervention, that is, the proportion of sessions completed out of the 36 prescribed among the participants who did not drop-out. In the LG, adherence (proportion of completed weekly sessions out of the total sessions prescribed among the participants who did not drop-out, ie, completed pre and postassessments) was measured by the certified exercise instructor (kinesiologist) according to the presence or absence of the participants during the live training. In the RG, adherence was measured using the number of questionnaires completed by the participants at the end of their training sessions. For the intervention to be considered feasible, participants were expected to complete 80% of the web-based exercise sessions (29/36 sessions) as commonly recommended (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Acceptability was assessed using 5 variables rated after each exercise training session using Limesurvey: (a) perceived exertion, (b) difficulty level of the exercises, (c) enjoyment during the training session, (d) pride related to performing the training sessions, and (e) overall satisfaction with the training session. More specifically, perceived exertion was estimated using the OMNI perceived exertion scale (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The difficulty of the exercises was assessed using a 4-Likert scale from “low,” “rather low” to “high” or “very high.” Enjoyment during the training session was rated using a 5-Likert scale from “not at all,” “a little,” “neutral” to “well,” or “a lot.” Pride was assessed using a 4-Likert scale from “no pride at all,” “a little pride” to “some pride,” or “a lot of pride.” Finally, the overall satisfaction level with the training session was assessed using a 4-Likert scale: “very unsatisfied,” “not very satisfied,” “satisfied,” or “very satisfied.” Finally, follow-up phone calls were done every 3 weeks to ask the participants to confirm the adherence and safety of the intervention.</p>

During the 4-m walking test, the webcam captured the starting and finishing point, which foot was used, and whether the webcam was placed in front or behind the participant. Regarding participant safety during the 4-m walking test, the kinesiologist ensured to ask the participant to remove any objects that could obstruct the exercises and also verified that participants could correctly and safely stop after the stop line. To perform the balance test, a webcam was placed in front of or beside the participant, which allowed the assessor to observe the participant’s foot and hand during the test. Regarding safety, participants were asked to be close to a wall or chair for them to hold in the event of loss of balance. Finally, for the sit-to-stand tests, a webcam was placed beside the participant to fully capture them in the sitting and standing position. For safety, a chair was placed against a wall to ensure that it could not move backward during the test.</p>

No help from any family member was provided for the webcam set-up. None of our participants had to reposition their webcam during the assessments.</p>
                <p>Finally, a recent study from our laboratory comparing remote assessment sessions with in-person assessments (performed on participants from our study) showed that the 4-m walking test, 5-repetition sit-to-stand test, 30-second chair test, and 10-repetition sit-to-stand test have high relative reliability, acceptable absolute reliability, and low variability. These results suggest that online and remote assessments are valid methods of performing these tests, which can be compared to other tests done in person and laboratory settings (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>

                <p>Data distributions were tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were expressed by mean ± standard deviation. Categorical variables were expressed in percentages. The Chi-squared test or Fisher test were used to compare the frequency of observations between groups. Due to our design (aims and sample size), we used a per-protocol analysis instead of an intent-to-treat analysis. Thus, only participants who completed the 12-week intervention and the pre and postevaluations were included in the analysis (drop-out participants nonincluded).</p>
                <p>An independent parametric <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test was used to identify between-group baseline differences. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to estimate the time and time × group effects. A paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test was used to assess the effect of the intervention within each group. The effect size partial eta squared (ηp<sup>2</sup>) was used to estimate the clinical relevance of the effects. Partial eta squared between 0.06 &lt; ηp<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.01 and 0.1 &lt; ηp<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.06 or ηp<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.1 were considered as low, medium, or large effects, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The percentage change from baseline ([pre–post/pre] × 100) was estimated to evaluate and compare the clinical effect of our interventions. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 27.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The significance was set at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> ≤ .05 (two-tailed) for all analyses.</p>

                <p>First, a time effect was observed for muscle power (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .01, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.12), normal (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.34), and fast (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .012, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.12) walking speed and sit-to-stand tests (5 repetitions [<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.59], 10 repetitions [<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.57], and 30-second [<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.53]). More specifically, both groups significantly improved their normal walking speed (change: LG: +0.15 m/s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .049; RG: +0.18 m/s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001) and time to perform the 5-repetition (change: LG: −3, 6s, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001; RG: −2, 2s, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001) and 10-repetition (change: LG: −7, 6s, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001; RG: −4, 6s, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) sit-to-stand tests, as well as, the number of sit-to-stand repetitions performed in 30 seconds (change: LG: +5-repetitions, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001; RG: +3.3-repetitions, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
                <p>Finally, only the LG significantly improved their fast-walking speed (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .022) and total SPPB score (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .010) after the intervention.</p>
                <p>Second, the time × group interaction reached significance for the 5-repetition (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .047, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.07) and 10-repetition (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .02, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.10) sit-to-stand tests.</p>
                <p>Finally, based on percentage change from baseline following the 12-week intervention, we observed a greater improvement on muscle endurance (minimal change expected: &gt;7%; 30 seconds sit-to-stand: LG: +37.6 ± 34.1% vs RG: +8.6 ± 60.0%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .925) and time to complete the 5-repetition sit-to-stand (minimal change expected: −20%; LG: −45.0 ± 39.8% vs RG: −28.0 ± 18.7%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .023, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .552) in the LG than the RG.

Finally, only the LG improved their fast-walking speed (LG: +17.9 ± 36.8%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .042, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = −0.405) and total SPPB score (minimal change expected: +0.5 point; LG: pre: 11.0 ± 1.4 vs post: 11.6 ± 0.6, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .001, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .514).</p>

              <p>The purpose of this study was to (a) confirm the feasibility and acceptability of 2 modalities of remote PA interventions (video website: recorded or Zoom platform: live and interactive) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) evaluate and compare their effects on health parameters using fully remote assessments.</p>
              <p>First, our results show a high level of acceptability and adherence for older adults who completed the intervention, independently of the remote PA modality (interactive or recorded). More than half of the participants from both groups reported that the PA sessions were “easy” to perform (LG: 69%; RG: 82%). These results suggest that the PA program was adapted to the participants’ capacities even if the intensity and level of difficulty were increased every 3 weeks during the 12-week program. Furthermore, both groups reported a similar level of satisfaction (LG: 77%; RG: 64%) throughout the remote PA intervention. These results are promising because the level of satisfaction is one of the main factors that enable older adults to participate and stay motivated in the practice of PA (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). These results are in line with other studies using web-technologies in older adults ((20) (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15–16</xref>)). We also observed the same level of enjoyment in both groups (LG: 68%; RG: 62%). This result is important because this aspect is considered as one of the key reasons for older adults to regularly practice PA (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
              <p>Overall, among the participants who completed the exercise intervention (sessions &gt; 80%) and pre and postassessments, the adherence rate could be considered high in both remote exercise modalities, with a slightly better adherence rate in the LG compared to the RG (LG: 89%; RG: 81%). The minimum and maximum number of attended sessions were similar in both groups (LG [min–max]: 16–36 sessions; RG [min–max]: 17–36 sessions). The high adherence rate could be explained by the improvement in quality of life as well as affinity for the technologies themselves (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It can also be explained by the customization of the exercises to the participants needs, which is important for older adults and leads to enjoyment during practice (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the drop-out rate (participants who did not complete the study) was significantly different between the 2 remote exercise modalities (LG: 16% vs. RG: 46%). Some studies have reported that the drop-out rate in remote exercise interventions was related to older peoples’ motivation to engage in PA (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p>
              <p>Among those who remained in the intervention, the motivation to practice PA significantly improved only in the RG (RG [delta change]: +16%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001). These results can be explained by the fact that these 2 remote exercise modalities do not involve the same type of motivation. For example, the LG participants received live feedback from a kinesiologist, and sessions were completed in groups. Social interactions and personalized feedback on performance are both known to influence PA adherence (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In contrast, the RG participants practiced their exercise sessions on their own and increased the training difficulty at their own pace every 4 weeks. The self-directed and individual nature of this intervention may help strengthen feelings of self-efficacy, a powerful predictor of PA adherence (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In addition, giving older adults control over the pace of the intervention may also contribute to motivation (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>
              <p>Moreover, our results show that both of the remote exercise interventions significantly and clinically improved walking speed (clinical threshold: +0.10 m/s<sup>−1</sup>; Delta change: LG: +0.15 m/s<sup>−1</sup>; RG: +0.17 m/s<sup>−1</sup>). More specifically, both groups went from at-risk to safe/good walking speed (LG = pre: 0.86 to post: 1.01 m/s<sup>−1</sup>; RG = pre: 0.95 to post: 1.13 m/s<sup>−1</sup>), which is associated with reduced health risks and mortality in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
              <p>In addition, we also observed beneficial effects on muscle endurance in both groups. As muscle endurance is recognized to predict the risk of falls in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), both of our remote interventions could help reduce these falls, which occur in 50% of older adults aged over 80.</p>
              <p>Physical health improvements were also observed in functional capacities. More specifically, a meaningful clinical change was observed in the total SPPB score (range: from 0.4 to 1.5 points) in the LG only (SPPB delta change: LG = +0.6 point; RG = −0.1 point (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)). This meaningful clinical change in the SPPB is important as it has been shown to reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Other studies also report that older adults taking part in exercise programs improved health-related fitness, which reduced the use of health care services (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p>
              <p>Moreover, quality of life (perceived health) significantly improved in the LG only (EQ-5D [delta change]: LG = +4%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .016). It is well-known that quality of life can predict the risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In a pandemic period, reducing hospitalizations can be important to reduce pressure on the health care system. In addition, mood tended to deteriorate significantly more in the RG than in the LG (mood [delta change]: RG = +33% vs LG = −6%; time × group effect: <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .06). This result suggests that the live-interactive modality may be recommended as the first choice of remote exercise intervention because it could help prevent depression and ultimately the risk of mortality (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Furthermore, even if the study was conducted remotely during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, the feeling of loneliness remained stable in both groups. This result could be considered a positive impact as it has been argued that social isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown increased loneliness (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which raises the rate of depression, suicide, or mental-health mortality (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). This result could be explained by the modality of our remote interventions (live, interactive, and group) and the follow-up phone calls done every 3 weeks for each participant (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Our results are important as quality of life and depression are known to deteriorate in older adults during social isolation and/or pandemics like COVID-19 (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p>
              <p>Overall, it appears that during a lockdown period, an interactive and live remote exercise modality leads to greater improvements in physical and mental health than a remote recorded exercise modality and helps increase the quality of life. Nevertheless, the remote recorded exercise modality requires fewer human resources and also leads to physical and mental health improvements.</p>
              <p>In addition, the improvements following these two remote web-based PA interventions were similar to those obtained in other studies carried out in laboratory settings (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This point is very important as these 2 remote interventions can be performed anywhere (no specific infrastructure needed), anytime (even during extreme hot or cold weather), and involve all older adults (even those living in urban or rural areas or who have limited transportation). In addition, these 2 remote exercise modalities are less expensive than on-site physical training. Finally, from a public health perspective, the interactive exercise modality may be preferred as the drop-out rate was lower than the recorded modality. This lower drop-out rate suggests that this type of intervention (fully interactive and live using Zoom) could help older adults integrate PA habits into their lifestyle. This aspect is significant as more than 50% of older adults are inactive and sedentary, even though it is recognized that exercise helps preserve health.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, our study presents some limitations. The relatively small sample size (postintervention: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 56) and the exploratory design may reduce our capacity to detect small differences between groups. Due to our design and per-protocol analysis, the adherence rate reported includes only participants who completed the two assessment sessions (pre and postintervention). Thus, the adherence observed in this study limits our public health recommendations, even if the adherence rate was slightly higher in the live-interactive modality. Moreover, study participants were fairly educated, healthy, and were already using some technologies on a daily basis. Thus, our findings cannot be generalized to the population as 40% of older adults did not have access or the skills to use technology before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a recent study has shown that remote exercise programs are feasible and acceptable to prevent loss of mobility in predisabled older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus supporting the importance of our study (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It is important to highlight that the health professionals who performed the assessments (assessors) were not the same as those (certified exercise instructors) who trained the participants during the intervention. It is crucial to note that our experimental design included a follow-up phone call every 3 weeks, which did not allow us to keep the assessors blind to the group allocation. Nevertheless, even if the assessors and instructors were not blinded, they were unaware of the primary aim of the study. Furthermore, even if there were significant differences in our data for fast-walking speed, total SPPB score, quality of life, and motivation to practice PA at baseline, these differences were not clinically significant as both groups had the same functional capacity levels (SPPB score &gt;10 and fast-walking speed &gt; 1.2 m.s<sup>−1</sup>), quality of life (score &gt; 60/100; good quality of life) and motivation to practice PA (score &gt; 5/7; good motivation). Finally, the unexpected absence of between-group differences regarding loneliness and isolation could be due to the follow-up phone call in both groups (every 3 weeks). Therefore, additional double-blind randomized control trials are needed to generalize our results.</p>
              <p>This study also has some strengths, such as the same number and type of exercises in both remote interventions, the use of standardized and implementable exercise interventions, and the use of validated measures, which allowed the generalization and adequate comparison of the exercise interventions.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence that recorded or live-interactive web-based PA interventions are innovative, feasible, acceptable, and safe modalities for community-dwelling older adults during isolated periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. However, it is important to keep in mind that adherence was slightly higher, and the drop-out rate was lower in the live-interactive group. These results suggest that remote live-interactive group interventions should be favored over the recorded modality. However, recorded sessions may be appropriate for participants who cannot temporarily follow online and LG sessions (eg, constrained hours, loss of internet connection, or insufficient internet bandwidth). In addition, exercise physiologists (trainers and researchers) using the recorded exercise modality must keep in mind that a closer follow-up should be carried out to reduce or at least try to attenuate the drop-out rate.</p>
              <p>Overall, the use of web technology to deliver PA interventions is not only feasible and acceptable but also seems effective to mitigate the impact of lockdown periods by maintaining mental health, improving physical health (functional capacities and physical performance), and quality of life. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine the best dose of interactive/recorded sessions in order to implement the most efficient intervention at a larger scale in at-risk populations.</p>
