                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Revised guidelines for caesarean section (CS) advise maternal antibiotic administration prior to skin incision instead of after umbilical cord clamping, unintentionally exposing the infant to antibiotics antenatally. We aimed to investigate if timing of intrapartum antibiotics contributes to the impairment of microbiota colonisation in CS born infants.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>In this randomised controlled trial, women delivering via CS received antibiotics prior to skin incision (n=20) or after umbilical cord clamping (n=20). A third control group of vaginally delivering women (n=23) was included. Faecal microbiota was determined from all infants at 1, 7 and 28 days after birth and at 3 years by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Compared with vaginally born infants, profound differences were found in microbial diversity and composition in both CS groups in the first month of life. A decreased abundance in species belonging to the genera <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> was found with a concurrent increase in members belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria. These differences could not be observed at 3 years of age. No statistically significant differences were observed in taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiome between both CS groups at any of the time points.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>We confirmed that microbiome colonisation is strongly affected by CS delivery. Our findings suggest that maternal antibiotic administration prior to CS does not result in a second hit on the compromised microbiome.

                    <p>The present study confirms that CS delivery strongly affects microbiota development in the first month of life. Here we demonstrate that antenatal exposure to maternal administrated prophylactic antibiotics prior to skin incision, according to the current revised guidelines, does not seem to further aggravate the compromised microbiome development in CS born infants. Concluding that CS delivery itself, and not antenatal antibiotic exposure, seems to negatively affect microbiota development, and consequently infant health.</p>

              <p>Early life microbiome acquisition and development can be compromised by external perturbations such as delivery via caesarean section (CS), formula feeding and antibiotics.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Acute effects of antibiotics on the microbiota range from self-limiting diarrhoea to increased risk for life-threatening conditions in premature neonates.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> The long-term consequences of such perturbations for the human–microbial symbiosis are more difficult to discern, but chronic conditions such as IBD, obesity, asthma, allergy and type 1 diabetes have been associated with childhood antibiotic use and an altered intestinal microbiota.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Over the last few years, international obstetric guidelines have been revised in order to reduce the incidence of maternal and neonatal infections.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Because implementation of these adjusted guidelines has resulted in an increased use of antibiotics antenatally,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> concerns on early-life exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and associated pervasive effects on the gut microbiome development and various disorders later in life are growing.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Besides, early-life antibiotic exposure may increase the risk of multi-resistant bacterial infections in neonatal patients.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recent epidemiological and mechanistic data on the association between early antibiotic use, dysbiosis and disease support these concerns.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> One of the revised protocols leading to an increased exposure to antibiotics worldwide is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (2011) guideline for CS.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In this revised guideline, it is advised to administer maternal prophylactic antibiotics prior to skin incision, instead of after clamping of the umbilical cord. This policy has been shown to reduce the maternal risk of infectious morbidities, particularly of endometritis and wound infections.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Consequently, however, all infants born by CS are currently exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics via the umbilical cord, when adhering to this revised guideline. Although no increase in incidence of neonatal sepsis was observed,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> effects on the gut microbiota colonisation and long-term health consequences remain largely unknown. We hypothesised that exposure to antibiotics in children delivered by CS, related to the revised international guidelines, influences the microbial colonisation process and may impact health outcome. In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), we evaluated this effect by comparing the microbiome composition of CS born infants with and without intrauterine antibiotic exposure, according to the revised and previous protocol, respectively, up to 3 years.</p>

                <p>Pregnant women visiting outpatient clinics of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology during the third trimester of an uncomplicated pregnancy and scheduled for a primary CS were eligible to participate. Uncomplicated pregnancy was defined as a normotensive singleton pregnancy, with a normal-weight fetus, delivering at a gestational age ≥37 weeks. An overview of all maternal and neonatal exclusion criteria is listed in <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>. Included women were randomly allocated to be treated according to the current or the previous NICE guideline on timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration during CS. The women treated according to the current NICE guideline<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> received 1500 mg cefuroxime 30 min prior to CS (group A). Those women allocated to be treated in accordance with previous NICE guideline,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> received 1500 mg cefuroxime after clamping of the umbilical cord (group B). Randomisation was done by means of <ext-link xlink:href="www.randomizer.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.randomizer.org</ext-link> in permuted blocks of 10. A third control group of women visiting the outpatient clinic for vaginal delivery was included simultaneously during the study period, in order to compare CS with vaginally born infants (group C). The same eligibility criteria were retained for this group as for the two CS groups. Over time, the inclusion rate of the women delivering vaginally was adapted to the primary CS inclusions to facilitate inclusions in the same seasons.</p>

The DNA was extracted with minor adjustments of the manufacturer’s protocol: for disruption of the samples, the TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for 2 min at 30 Hz. To increase the DNA concentration, 50 µL of buffer solution was used instead of 100 µL for the elution. Extracted DNA was normalised to 5 ng/µL and stored at 4 °C until use for PCR amplification.</p>

                  <p>Extracted DNA from samples of days 7 and 28 was used for whole metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing to further distinguish possible differences in more detail at these time points. These time-points were chosen since the effect of the perinatal antibiotics was expected to be most pronounced with limited influence of confounding environmental factors in these samples. In contrast to meconium, at day 7, the amount of human DNA will be decreased with a concurrent increase in DNA of the limited pioneer bacterial species present in the early microbiome.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> At day 28, the diversity will be increased due to an increased abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Veillonella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> and Enterobacteriaceae.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Consequently, associations between perinatal factors and taxonomic composition are likely to be more pronounced after 1 month compared with early samples from the first week of life.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> DNA from samples collected at the age of 3 was not sequenced with WMS, since the microbiome had reached a more stable form<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and differences due to perinatal influences were expected to have disappeared by then.</p>

Final libraries were quantified using the Invitrogen Quant-iT dsDNA (high sensitivity) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a microplate reader, equal amounts of each library were pooled and then sequenced at the Integrated Microbiome Resource (Dalhousie University, Halifax NS) using 2×150 bp PE reads on an Illumina NextSeq 550 using the High Output v2.0 chemistry.

In the beta diversity plots, principal coordinates from samples of the vaginal group also clustered together at day 28, while samples of both CS groups did not (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>).

(A) Mean Shannon diversity indices calculated from the taxonomic assignments (genus level) of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses of faecal samples collected at 1, 7 and 28 days postpartum from infants of mothers delivering via caesarean section who received prophylactic antibiotics either before skin incision (group A: antenatally antibiotic exposed infants) or after cord clamp (group B: antenatally antibiotic unexposed infants). Faecal samples were also collected from a third group of vaginally born infants (group C). Samples were analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. At days 1 and 7 no significant difference was present between infants from all three groups. At day 7, mean Shannon diversity was 1.03 in group A and 1.36 in group B (p=0.23). At day 28 Shannon diversity index of vaginally born infants was significantly higher compared with both caesarean groups (p&lt;0.001). (B and C) Left side dendrogram shows results of unsupervised cluster analysis of the taxonomic assignments (genus level) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Samples collected from vaginally born infant (group C) cluster to the exclusion of samples collected from caesarean section born infants (groups A and B).

              <p>In this RCT, the effect of timing of maternal prophylactic antibiotic administration during CS on the microbiome and health state of infants up to 3 years of age was evaluated. Moreover, the findings were compared with a control group of vaginally born infants during the same time period. This study confirmed previous findings that CS delivery in general leads to a profound hit on the initial microbial colonisation. Our data suggest that maternal antibiotic administration prior to CS does not lead to a ‘second hit’ on the already compromised microbiome in CS born infants.</p>
              <p>The rate of infants born by CS continues to increase worldwide. Currently, reported rates vary from around a quarter to more than half of all infants.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> In this study, besides a decreased diversity, the abundance of numerous phyla, genera and species was significantly affected by a CS delivery. The main aberrations found in the microbiota of CS born infants included a decreased abundance of members belonging to genera <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> and an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and enterococci during the first month of life. These findings are largely in line with previous studies demonstrating a decreased abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroidetes</italic>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> decreased diversity<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and an increase in opportunistic pathogens, mainly including enterococci, in CS born infants.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> Knowledge about the development and impact of perinatal factors on species level is still limited. We confirmed findings by Saturio <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> that CS born infants have a decreased abundance of <italic toggle="yes">B. bifidum</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. catenalutum</italic>, but we did not find evidence of increased abundance in other <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> species such as <italic toggle="yes">B. adolescentis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. animalis</italic>. The abundance of numerous species, mainly of the mentioned genera and phyla, was significantly affected by the route of delivery.</p>
              <p>Alterations in microbiota colonisation have previously been associated with disturbed development of the immune system and long-term complications.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Bifidobacteria and <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic>, for example, are considered to confer positive health benefits in general on the host.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> Bifidobacteria produce acetate and lactate which act as a barrier against enteropathogenic infections. Delayed colonisation with bifidobacteria has been associated with a decreased number of memory B-cells later in infancy and with immune dysregulations,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and an consequently with increased risk for multiple non-communicable diseases later in life.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> also influence immune development, and depletion of this genus in infancy could negatively impact T-cell response. Proteobacteria comprise multiple known human pathogens. An increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria is seen in numerous clinical conditions. Furthermore, a microbiota depleted of <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> with increased abundance of Proteobacteria during infancy has been associated with long-term complications including impaired neurocognitive development.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
</p>
              <p>Besides CS itself, it has been shown that postnatal antibiotics impact the abundance of keystone microbial taxa.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Antibiotic exposure early in life decreases the diversity, the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> species and increases the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Currently, it is unknown whether the effects of maternal IAP resemble effects of postnatal antibiotics on the microbiota in CS born infants, and further increases the risk for microbiota-related long-term health complications. In vaginally born infants, maternal IAP has been shown to decrease the diversity and abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroidetes</italic> and bifidobacteria and to increase the abundance of Proteobacteria,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> which might increase the risk for negative long-term health outcomes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> It might be counter-intuitive to assume negative effects of maternal IAP are only present in vaginally born infants and not in CS born infants. This is the first RCT evaluating effects on infant microbiota colonisation of exposure to maternal IAP during CS in a randomised design using metagenomics. Despite the high concentrations of cefuroxime measured in the umbilical cord and the fact that numerous species of the human gut microbiota are susceptible to cefuroxime,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57 58</xref> we showed that intrauterine exposure to antibiotics does not result in a ‘second hit’ on the already compromised microbiome in CS born infants.</p>
              <p>Only one previous RCT investigated the effect of timing of antibiotic administration during CS on the infant microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> In that study, the effect on the infant microbiota was measured after 10 days and 9 months. In line with our findings, no differences were demonstrated in the taxonomic composition at 10 days postnatally, but a significantly decreased microbial species richness was found in intrauterine antibiotic exposed infants after 9 months. Besides 16S rRNA sequencing, we analysed samples using WMS. Both methods are substantially different and can yield quantitatively and qualitatively different results.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60–64</xref> The advantage of WMS is that it provides direct information about the presence or absence of specific microbial functions such as antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60–64</xref> Since it has been demonstrated that perinatal factors could influence the abundance of different species of the same genera in opposite directions (eg, an increase in <italic toggle="yes">B. bifidum</italic> and a simultaneous decrease in <italic toggle="yes">B. adolescentis</italic> following CS), the importance of analysis on species level, possible with WMS, is emphasised.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Previous studies showed only a weak correlation between amplicon sequenced data and WMS sequencing data and this may explain why we observed differences in results between both methods. Discrepancies between the 16S and WMS datasets might further be explained by PCR primer bias.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Since both methods have their own advantages and are therefore considered as complementary, it is considered useful to analyse samples parallel with both techniques.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60–64</xref>
</p>
              <p>Besides combined 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and WMS sequencing, which allows taxonomic analysis up to species level and analysis of functional genes and antibiotic resistance genes, other strengths of this study include the randomised controlled study design for the CS group and inclusion of the vaginally born group. Application of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria limited the risk of bias and long follow-up period provides insight on long-term microbiota development. The cefuroxime cord blood concentrations in exposed neonates provided valuable information on the degree of antibiotic exposure. Despite the short exposure period of 30 min, a median concentration of 13,7 mg/L could be found in the umbilical cord, which is above the MIC of most bacterial species.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 57 58</xref> Limitations of our trial include the relatively small sample size, hampering to draw firm conclusions regarding long-term health outcomes.</p>
              <p>A reduction of maternal infectious morbidities was the reason for revising the recommendation regarding the timing of IAP in the NICE guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 12</xref> Women receiving antibiotics prior to CS are affected in 3.9%, predominantly by endometritis and wound infections, compared with 6.9% of women receiving antibiotics after cord clamp (risk ratio: 0.57 and number needed to treat: 33.3).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Importantly, effects on neonatal gut microbial colonisation and long-term effects associated with antibiotic exposure have not been investigated before implementation of these adjusted guidelines. Notably, the majority of eligible parents preferred to be treated according to the previous NICE guidelines, considering the uncertain risk of antibiotic exposure more important than the proven protective effects on risk of maternal infection. Here, we have for the first time shown that adhering to the current NICE guidelines does not seem to significantly impact the infant faecal microbiome up to 3 years of age. Future studies should confirm the hypothesis that antenatal antibiotic exposure in CS indeed does not influence long-term health outcomes, like asthma, allergy and obesity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These studies could further reduce the uncertainty and doubts of parents and clinicians whether the beneficial protective effects for mother by the guideline adjustment do not lead to negative long-term consequences for the child and justify the guideline adjustment.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We confirmed that early-life microbiome development is strongly affected by mode of delivery. In this RCT, we observed that maternal antibiotic administration before onset of the CS according to the current guidelines, does not seem to further impact the compromised microbiota development in CS born infants. Disturbances in microbial colonisation have previously been associated with a disturbed priming of the immune system, even when these microbial disturbances are restored later in life. Since around 30 million infants are born via CS yearly,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> it is important that prospective studies, including a larger number of inclusions validate our observation that antenatally antibiotic exposure in CS born infants does not seem to impact early life microbiota development and does not have long-term health consequences.</p>
