                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Printed educational materials (PEMs) have long been used to inform clinicians on evidence-based practices. However, the evidence for their effects on patient care and outcomes is unclear. In Ontario, despite widely available clinical practice guidelines recommending antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering agents for patients with diabetes, prescriptions remain low. We aimed to determine whether PEMs can influence physicians to intensify prescribing of these medications.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, cluster randomized controlled trial was designed to ascertain the effect of two PEM formats on physician prescribing: a postcard-sized message (“outsert”) or a longer narrative article (“insert”). Ontario family physician practices (clusters) were randomly allocated to receive the insert, outsert, both or neither. Physicians were eligible if they were in active practice and their patients were included if they were over 65 years with a diabetes diagnosis; both were unaware of the trial. Administrative databases at ICES (formerly the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences) were used to link patients to their physician and to analyse prescribing patterns at baseline and 1 year following PEM mailout. The primary outcome was intensification defined as the addition of a new antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering agent, or dose increase of a current drug, measured at the patient level. Analyses were by intention-to-treat and accounted for the clustering of patients to physicians.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We randomly assigned 4231 practices (39% of Ontario family physicians) with a total population of 185,526 patients (20% of patients with diabetes in Ontario primary care) to receive the insert, outsert, both, and neither; among these, 4118 practices were analysed (<italic>n</italic> = 1025, <italic>n</italic> = 1037, <italic>n</italic> = 1031, n = 1025, respectively). No significant treatment effect was found for the outsert (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.04) or the insert (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.02). Percent of intensification in the four arms was similar (approximately 46%). Adjustment for physician characteristics (e.g., age, sex, practice location) had no impact on these findings.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">PEMs have no effect on physician’s adherence to recommendations for the management of diabetes-related complications in Ontario. Further research should investigate the effect of other strategies to narrow this evidence-to-practice gap.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">Researchers have estimated that it takes 17 years for research findings to enter usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, clinicians may deliver outdated, unnecessary, and even harmful care many years after evidence emerges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This disconnect between research and routine clinical practice is known as the evidence-to-practice gap, or the second translational gap, and prevents patients from receiving the best-known care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">Evidence-to-practice gaps are prominent in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, in Ontario, despite a universal health insurance system, medications proven to prevent diabetes-related complications are underprescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability among individuals with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], highlighting the need for knowledge translation (KT) strategies to improve the clinical management of its risk factors, such as hypertension. Antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity in individuals with diabetes more effectively than glucose-lowering agents alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, a multi-faceted treatment approach, managing all risk factors, is vital. This body of evidence has been translated into numerous clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; nevertheless, in 2007, the prescribing of relevant medications in Ontario fell short of guideline recommendations by as much as 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Many KT strategies have been proposed to help close such evidence-to-practice gaps. Printed educational materials (PEMs) are recommendations for clinical care delivered in print format to the recipient, and have long been favoured to address evidence-to-practice gaps due to their low costs and potential for wide reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Bero et al. were the first to review evaluations of this KT strategy, finding that PEMs have little to no effect on changing provider behaviour, and therefore recommended that more intensive interventions be used to alter practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, in a 2004 systematic review, PEMs were found to result in modest absolute improvements in care, ranging from 3.6 to 17%, with a median of 8.1%; thus, the authors concluded that PEMs should not be discarded, especially as costs are low and, in many situations, resources for behaviour change interventions are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clarifying this, a 2008 systematic review concluded that PEMs were ineffective when compared to other KT interventions, but when compared to no intervention, led to statistically significant improvements in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, a 2015 systematic review again concluded that PEMs do not improve outcomes, neither at the physician level, nor at the patient level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These authors suggested that the encouraging results identified in previous reviews may be due to the inclusion of specialist physicians, who might respond differently to PEMs than do primary care physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most recently, the evidence has again reversed, with a 2020 systematic review finding that PEMs have “modest, but potentially important, improvements in professional practice” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The conclusions from this review were influenced by the findings from the first two published OPEM (Ontario Printed Educational Messages) trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The third and last OPEM trial is reported here, providing more real-world randomized evidence on the effectiveness of PEMs.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Aim</title>
                <p id="Par26">The aim of the OPEM programme was to test if PEMs improve care in a larger scale within usual primary care clinical practice. The underlying purpose was to help determine whether PEMs should be routinely used by local decision makers (i.e., the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care) aiming to address evidence-to-practice gaps in primary care. We report here the third of three pragmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], multicenter, factorial, cluster randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) amongst Ontario family physicians (FPs). A cluster design was chosen to minimize contamination between physicians working together, and between patients cared for by the same physician. Further, a factorial design allowed us to simultaneously test the independent effects of two different versions of a PEM: an insert and an outsert (described in detail in methods). In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to establish whether PEMs urging intensification of antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering medications had an impact on physician prescribing of medications for diabetes-related complications, measured at the individual patient level.</p>

To prevent contamination, physicians who work in group or shared practices were identified by common address and were randomized to receive the same intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Group practices allow for patients to be seen by more than one physician; therefore, patients who received a prescription written by an Ontario FP qualified for inclusion, even if the physician wasn’t their primary care provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">Randomization was carried out at the cluster level by the study statistician using computer-generated random numbers, omitting stratification. Practices were allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a longer or shorter PEM, both, or neither. Allocation was concealed from physicians and patients who were both blinded as to the existence of the trial; physicians were obviously aware of the intervention they received but it is unlikely that patients were made aware of this by their physician. All patients who qualified for inclusion within the practices were automatically included in the study and their prescriptions analysed; no recruitment efforts were required.</p>
                <p id="Par29">The PEMs were mailed alongside the January edition of <italic>informed</italic> (see intervention section) to all Ontario FP practices on January 15, 2005.

The latter two exclusion criteria were used to ensure that the physicians had adequate experience with seniors. Furthermore, physicians who submitted a claim under a speciality other than FP during the lookback period were excluded. Physicians were excluded during the post-intervention period for the following reasons: submitting a claim under a speciality other than FP, no longer practicing, failed to be randomized, not matched to at least one patient with diabetes, missing information on personal identifiers (due to ICES constraints), and working in shared practices that were mistakenly sent multiple versions of the PEM.</p>

The outsert was a postcard-sized paper attached to the front page of <italic>informed</italic> in the bottom left corner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Bright colors and large font sizes were used to attract the eye of the reader.

                <p id="Par38">The goal of the trial was to determine whether PEMs are effective at prompting physicians to intensify their patient’s treatment regimen. A standard definition for the intensification of diabetes treatment does not exist. However, the addition of a new (i.e., not previously prescribed) agent to the patient’s treatment regimen and an increase in dose of an existing medication are often used as indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Primary</title>
                  <p id="Par39">The primary outcome is therefore defined as the intensification of a patient’s treatment regimen by adding a new drug, either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, “other” antihypertensive (e.g., angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics), or cholesterol-lowering agent (e.g., statins, fibrates, antilipemic and atherosclerosis inhibiting agents) and/or increasing the dose of a current ACE inhibitor, “other” antihypertensive, or cholesterol-lowering agent (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for a detailed description of outcome programming).</p>

Physicians may have switched their patient from one drug to another, perhaps a stronger drug, in response to the intervention. Thus, medication switches were included in the secondary outcome measurement to capture physicians who intensified their patient’s treatment regimen by making a drug switch. The secondary outcome is therefore defined as the addition of an ACE inhibitor, “other” antihypertensive agent, or cholesterol-lowering agent, the increase in dose of a current ACE inhibitor, “other” antihypertensive agent, or cholesterol-lowering agent, or the switch from one drug to another across all drug classes.</p>

Further, neither a statistically significant outsert effect, nor an insert effect, were observed after adjusting for the following physician characteristics: physician age, sex, country of medical training (Canadian vs. other), practice location (Northern vs. Southern, rural vs. non-rural), total general patient visits per year, total billings per year, and years in practice (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Percent of patients who experienced treatment intensification</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><bold><italic>informed</italic></bold> only<break/>(1025 clusters)</th><th><bold><italic>informed</italic></bold> + insert<break/>(1025 clusters)</th><th><bold><italic>informed</italic></bold> + outsert<break/>(1037 clusters)</th><th><bold><italic>informed</italic></bold> + insert + outsert<break/>(1031 clusters)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>By addition or dose increase<sup>a</sup></td><td>46.4</td><td>45.5</td><td>46.0</td><td>46.2</td></tr><tr><td>By addition, dose increase, or switch<sup>b</sup></td><td>48.7</td><td>47.9</td><td>48.4</td><td>48.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Primary outcome</p><p><sup>b</sup>Secondary outcome</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Unadjusted and adjusted intervention effects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><italic>Intervention</italic></th><th>OR (95% CI)</th><th><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Regression model 1a: unadjusted effect of insert and outsert (primary outcome)</bold></td></tr><tr><td> Outsert</td><td>1.01 (0.98, 1.04)</td><td>0.74</td></tr><tr><td> Insert</td><td>0.99 (0.96, 1.02)</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Regression model 1b: effect of insert and outsert, adjusted for physician characteristics</bold></td></tr><tr><td> Outsert</td><td>1.00 (0.97, 1.03)</td><td>0.77</td></tr><tr><td> Insert</td><td>0.99 (0.96, 1.02)</td><td>0.58</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><italic>Physician characteristics</italic></td></tr><tr><td> Physician age (per 10 years)</td><td>1.00 (0.97, 1.04)</td><td>0.94</td></tr><tr><td> Sex (reference is male)</td><td>1.08 (1.03, 1.12)</td><td>&lt; 0.0001</td></tr><tr><td> Canadian medical graduate (reference is no)</td><td>0.93 (0.89, 0.97)</td><td>&lt; 0.0001</td></tr><tr><td> Years in practice (per 10 years)</td><td>0.96 (0.91, 0.99)</td><td>0.03</td></tr><tr><td> Total visits (per 100 visits)</td><td>1.00 (1.00, 1.00)</td><td>0.23</td></tr><tr><td> Total billings (per $10,000)</td><td>1.00 (1.00, 1.00)</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td> Practice location (reference is Southern)</td><td>0.97 (0.91, 1.03)</td><td>0.32</td></tr><tr><td> Rural practice (reference is no)</td><td>0.99 (0.94, 1.03)</td><td>0.55</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Regression model 2: unadjusted effect of insert and outsert (secondary outcome)</bold></td></tr><tr><td> Outsert</td><td>1.01 (0.98, 1.04)</td><td>0.60</td></tr><tr><td> Insert</td><td>0.99 (0.96, 1.02)</td><td>0.64</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par48">The aim of the OPEM trial was to determine whether PEMs can successfully influence FPs to improve adherence to guideline recommendations for diabetes care through treatment intensification. There were no changes (neither statistically, nor clinically) in intensification of medications (with or without including drug switches) in response to either version of the PEM, with no interaction effect. Thus, while the trial was primarily designed to test the independent effects of both the outsert and the insert, we have little reason to believe that FPs who received the combination of both PEMs would have any difference in outcome. The PEMs are mostly duplicates of each other; FPs, who already face demands on their time, are unlikely to read the insert in full after reading the brief, post-card sized summary.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Over all arms, regardless of the intervention received, we found that female physicians, those who received their medical training outside of Canada, and those who had been in practice for fewer years were more likely to engage in treatment intensification (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Nevertheless, these three effect sizes were very close to one, suggesting that, while statistically significant, the effect of the aforementioned physician characteristics on treatment intensification was minimal and is unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful effects.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Our findings are consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], including our own previously published OPEM trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The failure of PEMs to bring about behavior change among physicians may be an indication that this KT strategy is largely ineffective and could be safely abandoned. PEM-based interventions are centered around the idea that evidence, once shared with an individual, prompts change. The negative findings from this and many other studies suggests that other barriers may exist. For example, physicians often struggle to “unlearn” old behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To change clinical practice, physicians must replace routine, outdated operations with new, evidence-based practices. While adding to their knowledge base can be a simpler undertaking, dismissing current practices presents a greater challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The process of change disrupts the status quo equilibrium, causing physicians to be uncertain about practices they considered to be “certain” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Physicians included in the study had been practicing as an FP for 22 years on average (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As a result, it is possible that they may have adopted standard prescribing practices for individuals with diabetes over the years and were thus hesitant to implement a change to multiple drug classes when presented with evidence in the PEMs. Furthermore, the patients themselves may act as a barrier to PEM effectiveness. A qualitative study by Parsons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] investigated why printed educational toolkits mailed to Ontario FPs failed to improve cardiovascular disease management among individuals with diabetes. The FPs believed that patient motivation and willingness to change behavior was the primary obstacle preventing them from adhering to the PEM recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p id="Par51">Our trial was randomized, and, as consent was not required, also blinded with high internal validity. It was also very large, offering a precise estimate of effect, and was designed with mostly pragmatic features to align with our pragmatic (decision-making) intention, increasing its relevance to real-world decision making in Ontario and similar settings (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for PRECIS-2 table and wheel, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The PEMs were delivered in a way that is likely similar to that of a routine large scale programme: by mail to physicians alongside a journal many of them routinely received, targeting the providers who usually care for patients with diabetes in Ontario. Outcomes were measured using routinely collected electronic health information, avoiding any distortions to usual care that might arise from data collection from physicians or patients. Lastly, while prescribing recommendations were outlined in the PEMs, the choice to prescribe was ultimately left to the physician – a naturalistic approach with no restrictions on behaviour, identical to a PEM program as might be implemented in routine practice.</p>

              <sec id="Sec23">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par52">Our study design cannot distinguish the point at which PEMs failed. Failure may be due to non-delivery, or the messages not being opened or read by the physicians. A 1997 survey revealed that Ontario physicians considered <italic>informed</italic> to be a useful source of clinical information (71% of physicians reporting received <italic>informed</italic>, and of these, 89% reported that the information was useful) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. But receptiveness may not be the same as clinical influence, and 8 years later, at the time of our trial, its influence may have declined. Further, while Canadian postal delivery is reliable, physicians may not be opening their own mail, and even if they do, may not be reading <italic>informed</italic>.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Our study is relevant only to print based educational materials delivered by mail. It is possible that physicians would have been more influenced by the PEM had it been delivered by an alternative route (e.g., fax, email). Following the shift towards electronic information as a basis for clinical decision making, electronically-delivered recommendations may have been more widely received by physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, these are seldom reported in the literature. A 2020 systematic review of PEMs identified only two studies comparing printed versus electronically delivered guidelines and found little to no difference in effectiveness between the two delivery strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. That said, the quality of evidence from these studies was graded as low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; thus, additional studies investigating electronically delivered guidelines may be warranted.</p>
                <p id="Par54">While the trial was designed with a pragmatic intention, it focused on higher volume clinicians treating older persons with diabetes. Only 5179 of the 10,863 eligible FPs practicing in Ontario were included, and although the excluded physicians were mostly inactive or saw few patients over 65 years, we cannot claim complete representativeness. The results are applicable to Ontario FPs who billed at least $50,000 in 2004, and who prescribed medications to at least 100 seniors (≥66 years old) in at least 10 months in 2004. It is possible that physicians who treat fewer individuals 66 and above and have less experience with diabetes care might have a different outcome.</p>
                <p id="Par55">In addition, the ODB claims database only contains prescriptions that have been reimbursed, which depends on whether they have been dispensed. The intervention effect might have been diluted by patients who received an intensified prescription but failed to get it dispensed. These individuals are likely to be balanced among the four groups as a consequence of randomization; thus, our estimate of the relative effect is unlikely to biased.</p>
                <p id="Par56">A discussion of the limitations would be incomplete without acknowledging the timeframe in which the study was conducted. The PEMs were mailed in January 2005, and the outcome measurement took place between 2005 and 2006. Estimates at the time of the trial suggested that prescriptions for all of ACE inhibitors, “other” antihypertensives, and cholesterol-lowering agents were at least 30% below guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One may wonder whether the results from the present study are relevant to clinical practice today. In 2015, it was found that the percent of patients aged 65 and above with diabetes in Ontario who filled a prescription for an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and a statin was approximately 60 and 72%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Further, the 2018 Diabetes Clinical Practice Guidelines still declare that diabetes-related cardiovascular complications are responsible for the greatest burden of death among individuals with diabetes and recommend treatment with appropriate medications to manage these risks, including antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, the evidence-to-practice gap continues to persist. It is, however, worth noting that, while the recommended target drug classes remain the same, some of the medications that were included as part of treatment intensification in the trial, for example atherosclerosis inhibiting agents, are not recommended today. Therefore, one must interpret the results within the timeframe of the study.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par57">Overall, in this large, randomized trial, we found that PEMs alone, whether long and narrative or brief and action focused are not effective at intensifying prescriptions for individuals with diabetes aged 66 and above in Ontario primary care. The implications for local decision makers are clear: despite their low costs and wide reach, PEMs, in the formats we tested, are not effective at bridging diabetes-related evidence-to-practice gaps in primary care in Ontario. Funding agencies should be cautious in supporting additional evaluations of these PEMs without first developing a deep and theoretically coherent understanding of the facilitators and barriers to their success. Researchers may consider conducting qualitative studies to gain perspective from the physicians on why this particular KT strategy has been repeatedly found to be ineffective, and to determine whether modifications to the design of the PEMs and/or the method of delivery may result in greater uptake, or, whether this KT strategy should be safely abandoned. In this modern era of electronic health records, one might look towards electronic interventions such as point of care reminders, on screen prompts, and electronic audit and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
