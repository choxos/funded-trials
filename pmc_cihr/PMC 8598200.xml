                  <p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for cancer-related insomnia, but its accessibility is very limited in routine care. A stepped care approach has been recommended as a cost-effective way to make CBT-I more widely accessible. However, no controlled study has yet been published about the efficacy of this approach. The goal of this noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the short and long-term efficacy of a stepped care CBT-I (StepCBT-I) to a standard face-to-face CBT-I (StanCBT-I).</p>

                  <p>A total of 177 cancer patients were randomized to: (1) StanCBT-I (6 face-to-face CBT-I sessions; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 59) or (2) StepCBT-I (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 118). In the StepCBT-I group, patients with less severe insomnia first received a web-based CBT-I (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 65), while those with more severe insomnia received 6 face-to-face CBT-I sessions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 53). In both cases, patients could receive up to three booster sessions of CBT-I if they still had insomnia symptoms following this first step.</p>

              <p>Stepped care models, beginning with a self-administered intervention followed, if needed, by a more intensive treatment, have repeatedly been proposed to help make cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) more widely accessible. Yet, thus far only small uncontrolled trials have been published. In this noninferiority randomized controlled trial that comprised 177 cancer patients with insomnia symptoms, we compared the efficacy of a stepped care approach to deliver CBT-I (StepCBT-I) with that of a standard, face-to-face CBT-I (StanCBT-I). Results indicated that the StepCBT-I produced sleep improvements that were not significantly inferior to those of the StanCBT-I. Stepped care CBT-I is not inferior to a standard face-to-face intervention and is a valuable approach to making this treatment more widely accessible to cancer patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Between 30% and 60% of cancer patients experience insomnia symptoms during their cancer care trajectory [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Insomnia tends to persist over time (29% to 64% of the patients) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] if no appropriate treatment is offered. Untreated chronic insomnia may lead to serious consequences including a higher risk of later developing other psychological disorders (e.g. depression) [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], fatigue and cognitive impairments, diminished quality of life, and increased health care consultations [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and risk for infections [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Insomnia is a highly treatable disturbance. The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in cancer patients has been supported by several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and current guidelines recommend using CBT-I as the first-line treatment for cancer-related sleep disturbances [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Up to 70% of cancer patients receiving CBT-I show a remission and sleep improvements are paralleled by reduced depression, anxiety, and fatigue symptoms and improved quality of life [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the accessibility to CBT-I is extremely limited due to a number of barriers [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Self-administered forms of CBT-I are efficacious in the general population [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, a meta-analysis indicated that sleep improvements from self-administered CBT-I were consistently of a lower magnitude than those from face-to-face CBT-I [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is in keeping with the results of our RCT conducted in women with breast cancer which revealed that a video-based CBT-I (60-min video + 6 booklets) led to significantly greater sleep improvements than a no-treatment condition, but that a 6-session face-to-face CBT-I produced greater effects than the video-based intervention on key variables including insomnia severity [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>This led us and others to conclude that self-administered CBT-I would be better used as part of a stepped care model [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In stepped care, the entry level is generally a minimal intervention, such as self-help intervention, followed by a more intensive form of treatment if needed. As a result, more intensive and expensive treatments are reserved for patients who do not benefit or are not expected to benefit from first-line treatments [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To date, only two small, uncontrolled studies have tested a stepped care CBT-I offered in the general population [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and cancer patients [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For the current study, we developed a web-based version of our video-based program as the first treatment step in view of the accumulating evidence supporting the efficacy of web-based CBT-I [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To replicate what would most likely be done in real clinical settings, the second step, offered to unremitted patients, was composed of up to three face-to-face CBT-I sessions.</p>
              <p>This noninferiority RCT compared the short- and long-term efficacy of a stepped care approach to deliver CBT-I (StepCBT-I) with that of standard professionally-administered treatment (StanCBT-I). It was hypothesized that StepCBT-I would be associated with sleep improvements (i.e. reduced insomnia severity and increased sleep efficiency [SE]) at all post-treatment time points not significantly inferior to those associated with StanCBT-I. A secondary goal was to compare treatment effects on other parameters from a sleep diary, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life.</p>

                <p>The study used a randomized controlled noninferiority trial as this is the most rigorous methodology for testing whether a novel treatment, here the StepCBT-I, is as effective as the standard treatment [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An experimental design with two groups and a 1:2 allocation ratio was used. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly assigned to: (1) StanCBT-I consisting of six weekly face-to-face sessions administered individually (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 59) or (2) StepCBT-I (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 118; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The entry level of the StepCBT-I differed depending on baseline insomnia severity: the first step was a web-based CBT-I for patients with less severe symptoms (ISI ≥ 8 and &lt;15; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 65), while six weekly face-to-face sessions of CBT-I administered individually were first offered to those with more severe symptoms (ISI ≥ 15; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 53). For both these groups, the second step, which was only offered to unremitted patients, consisted of up to three face-to-face booster sessions of CBT-I administered every 2 weeks. Study measures were collected at pretreatment (T1), immediately after the first treatment step (T2; 6 weeks) and the second treatment step (T3; 3 months), as well as at 6- (T4) and 12-month (T5) follow-ups. The last follow-up assessment was completed in November 2018.</p>
                <p>A computer-generated stratified randomization schedule was produced using SAS 9.4 PROC PLAN, under a permutated block randomization procedure with variable block sizes (6, 9, and 12 participants per block) to preserve the blind random assignment while minimizing between-groups imbalance during the trial. Stratification was performed based on baseline ISI scores (≥8 and &lt;15, or ≥15). Results were contained in individually sealed, opaque envelopes prepared by an independent research assistant prior to study initiation, to keep research personnel blind as to the sequences of the patients’ group allocation. Envelopes were opened sequentially by a research assistant after the patient’s eligibility was confirmed, in the patient’s presence so both of them learned at the same time to what group the patient was assigned.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study conducted in patients with cancer compared the short- and long-term efficacy of a standard CBT-I, administered individually by a clinician, to a stepped care approach in which the intensity of the intervention was adjusted to the initial insomnia severity and the presence or absence of remission after the first treatment phase was completed. As hypothesized, results of noninferiority analyses indicated that the efficacy of the StepCBT-I was non-inferior to that of StanCBT-I in reducing insomnia severity (ISI) and increasing SE (sleep diary). More precisely, the findings showed that between-group differences on ISI and SE improvements were falling well within the established clinical margins (e.g. all within a delta of 1.08 for the ISI vs. established margin of 4). These results indicate that a stepped care approach, that includes about half of the patients beginning treatment with a web-based intervention, provides treatment effects that are not significantly inferior to those found when using standard six face-to-face CBT-I sessions.</p>
              <p>Analyses of secondary outcomes indicated significant and mainly large time effects and no significant differences in treatment effects between StepCBT-I and StanCBT-I groups on other sleep diary variables, sleep medication usage, symptoms (depression, anxiety, and fatigue), and quality of life. This shows once again that treating insomnia efficaciously with CBT-I is associated with parallel changes in psychological distress and fatigue.</p>
              <p>This is the first randomized controlled trial on the effects of a stepped care CBT-I, although this approach has been recommended for at least a decade now as a cost-effective way to increase patient’s access to this treatment [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our results are consistent with those of a handful of previous clinical trials supporting the efficacy of stepped care models to deliver CBT for mixed psychological disorders [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], social anxiety and panic disorder [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and obsessive-compulsive disorder [<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. After the first step, 57.8% of our StepCBT-I patients were in remission from their insomnia (ISI &lt; 8; 50.6% after the web-based and 66.0% after the face-to-face intervention) and 59.3% were remitted after the second step (booster sessions; 59.7% for StepCBT-I-Web vs. 59.0% for StepCBT-I-Face-to-Face format). It Is interesting to note that the remission rate of 57.8% in StepCBT-I-Web patients is better than we previously found with a video-based CBT-I in breast cancer patients (44.3%) [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our remission rates also compare favorably with the only other study conducted in cancer patients thus far [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] which had a remission rate of 51% (26 out of 51; mean ISI score from 17.1 at baseline to 11.2 after step 1) after a first step composed of sleep hygiene and using a much more inclusive remission definition (ISI score &lt; 12). Our stepped care approach is more intensive but our results suggest that this level of intensity is needed to make sure that the largest proportion of patients is successfully treated after the first level of care.</p>
              <p>In the StepCBT-I group, as might have been predicted, the second level of care was offered to more patients from the web-based CBT-I (21/65; 32.3%) than from the face-to-face subgroup (8/53; 15.1%) and more patients from the StepCBT-I-Web (17/21; 81.0%) than from the StepCBT-I-Face-to-Face (4/8; 50.0%) accepted to receive additional treatment. Most patients received only one booster session (StepCBT-I-Web: 9/17 or 52.9%; StepCBT-I-Face-to-Face: 3/4 or 75.0%). At T3, T4, and T5, the remission rates of StepCBT-I patients were 59.3%, 64.6%, and 56.3%, respectively, and no significant difference was obtained with the StanCBT-I group (74.8%, 63.2%, and 54.7%, respectively). The remission rate of insomnia increased from 50.6% to 59.7% between T2 and T3 in those who received web-based CBT-I as their first treatment. Moreover, receiving booster sessions was associated with a greater decrease of anxiety and fatigue levels in the initially unremitted patients. Together, these findings emphasize the utility of providing booster sessions and confirm the clinical relevance of using a stepped care approach to administer CBT-I.</p>
              <p>Our study is the first to compare, with sufficient statistical power, a stepped care CBT to high-intensity care as opposed to usual care. In most clinical settings, usual care amounts to doing nothing (or almost nothing) and thus sets the bar very low for proving the equivalent efficacy of a stepped care program [<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Other strengths include the participants’ recruitment directly at the clinic, the small dropout rate, and the use of inclusive criteria, all of which increase the findings’ generalization. The fact that patients with heterogeneous complaints of insomnia (i.e. not diagnosed with an interview and no PSG to screen out patients with other sleep disorders) were eligible not only improves the study’s external validity but increases the applicability of this treatment modality in real clinical settings. On the other hand, our sample was all white, highly educated, and predominantly composed of women with breast cancer (76.7%). It will be important to replicate these findings in more diverse populations. Also, the sample represents a small proportion of all approached patients, thus affecting the study’s external validity. However, it is important to note that recruitment took place within a clinical setting offering cancer care to heterogeneous patients from all over eastern Quebec and that many patients were excluded due to older age and because they were living too far away to receive weekly face-to-face sessions. Now that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, videoconferencing is more frequently used to offer psychotherapy sessions [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], distance will become less of a barrier to participating in this type of program.</p>
              <p>In the future, it would be interesting to assess whether it is possible to offer the web-based CBT-I as the first step to a larger number of patients (e.g. all patients regardless of their insomnia severity) without overly affecting the remission rate. This would make the treatment even more cost-effective. However, it will be important to ensure that a self-administered CBT-I offered to patients with more severe insomnia, that ends up being unsuccessful, does not translate into a lower interest and motivation to move on to the second step. Another avenue for future research would be to integrate into the stepped care model a preventive intervention for good sleepers. Indeed, given the many patients who develop insomnia during their cancer care trajectory, it would be extremely relevant to assess whether it is possible to avert its onset by providing an early and minimal form of CBT-I. We previously obtained encouraging results with a preventive booklet given to good sleepers before their chemotherapy for breast cancer but the results of this pilot study need replication in larger trials [<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study has significant clinical implications as it offers an alternative model of care to treat cancer-related insomnia that is less costly, while being not less efficacious, and which can therefore be more easily implemented in routine cancer care than standard CBT-I. Implementation of such a stepped care CBT-I could contribute considerably to improving patients’ access to CBT-I and thus reduce the psychological, physical, and financial burden of cancer-related insomnia.</p>
