                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The large number of patients worldwide infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus has overwhelmed health-care systems globally. The Anti-Coronavirus Therapies (ACT) outpatient trial aimed to evaluate anti-inflammatory therapy with colchicine and antithrombotic therapy with aspirin for prevention of disease progression in community patients with COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The ACT outpatient, open-label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised, controlled trial, was done at 48 clinical sites in 11 countries. Patients in the community aged 30 years and older with symptomatic, laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who were within 7 days of diagnosis and at high risk of disease progression were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive colchicine 0·6 mg twice daily for 3 days and then 0·6 mg once daily for 25 days versus usual care, and in a second (1:1) randomisation to receive aspirin 100 mg once daily for 28 days versus usual care. Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was assessed at 45 days in the intention-to-treat population; for the colchicine randomisation it was hospitalisation or death, and for the aspirin randomisation it was major thrombosis, hospitalisation, or death. The ACT outpatient trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04324463" id="interrefs20">NCT04324463</ext-link> and is ongoing.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Aug 27, 2020, and Feb 10, 2022, 3917 patients were randomly assigned to colchicine or control and to aspirin or control; after excluding 36 patients due to administrative reasons 3881 individuals were included in the analysis (n=1939 colchicine <italic>vs</italic> n=1942 control; n=1945 aspirin <italic>vs</italic> 1936 control). Follow-up was more than 99% complete. Overall event rates were 5 (0·1%) of 3881 for major thrombosis, 123 (3·2%) of 3881 for hospitalisation, and 23 (0·6%) of 3881 for death; 66 (3·4%) of 1939 patients allocated to colchicine and 65 (3·3%) of 1942 patients allocated to control experienced hospitalisation or death (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02, 95% CI 0·72–1·43, p=0·93); and 59 (3·0%) of 1945 of patients allocated to aspirin and 73 (3·8%) of 1936 patients allocated to control experienced major thrombosis, hospitalisation, or death (HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·57–1·13, p=0·21). Results for the primary outcome were consistent in all prespecified subgroups, including according to baseline vaccination status, timing of randomisation in relation to onset of symptoms (post-hoc analysis), and timing of enrolment according to the phase of the pandemic (post-hoc analysis). There were more serious adverse events with colchicine than with control (34 patients [1·8%] of 1939 <italic>vs</italic> 27 [1·4%] of 1942) but none in either group that led to discontinuation of study interventions. There was no increase in serious adverse events with aspirin versus control (31 [1·6%] <italic>vs</italic> 31 [1·6%]) and none that led to discontinuation of study interventions.</p>

                  <p id="para50">We did a search of PubMed from Jan 1, 2020, to May 31, 2022, in English language only using the terms “colchicine” AND “coronavirus” OR “COVID” OR “coronavirus disease-2019” OR “coronavirus 2019” OR “COVID19” OR “covid-19” AND “clinical trial” OR “randomized controlled trial”. Meta-analyses did not indicate a benefit of colchicine in outpatients or inpatients with COVID-19, but the estimate obtained from the only large trial in outpatients suggested a reduction in hospitalisation or death. One randomised trial of aspirin in outpatients with COVID-19 was stopped early because of low event rates and therefore the potential benefit was unknown.</p>

                  <p id="para90">The results of the ACT study taken together with the results of our updated meta-analysis, suggest that there is no evidence to support the use of either colchicine or aspirin to prevent disease progression or death in outpatients with COVID-19. The lower-than-expected event rates in the ACT outpatient trial might reflect lower virulence of emerging COVID-19 variants, increasing immunity in the population due to infection and use of vaccination, the increasing use of effective treatments, and changing patterns of medical care.</p>

                <p id="para120">In brief, this is a 2 × 2 factorial trial in which community patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned to colchicine or control (1:1 ratio) as well as to aspirin or control (1:1 ratio). All participating trial centres obtained ethics approval before commencing recruitment and all patients provided informed consent.</p>
                <p id="para130">The Population Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, coordinated the ACT trials and was responsible for all aspects of trial conduct. A trial steering committee designed the study and approved the protocol. The steering committee met regularly to assess study progress and to discuss necessary interventions or protocol amendments as needed. During the trial, the protocol was amended by the steering committee to restrict inclusion to patients older than 30 years and increase the sample size from 2500 to 3500.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> 334 patients were aged 18–30 years (inclusive) before July 15, 2021, the date of protocol amendment.

To be included, patients younger than 70 years had to have at least one additional risk factor for disease progression, including male sex, body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, or renal disease, active cancer, or diabetes. Patients were excluded if they had advanced kidney or advanced liver disease that would preclude them from receiving study interventions, were pregnant or lactating, or had a medical indication, were already using or had a contraindication to the trial interventions.

The secondary outcome for the aspirin vs control comparison was any thrombosis (major thrombosis plus venous thromboembolism). Additional exploratory outcomes were the composite of hospitalisation or respiratory death and individual components of composites. Analyses on the effect of treatments were done in prespecified and post-hoc subgroups.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para190">All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle and included all patients from the time of randomisation. Continuous data were presented as means (SD) or medians (IQR) (depending on their distribution) and categorical data were presented as n (%). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival analysis and stratified Cox proportional hazard models with treatment group as a predictive variable and stratified by the other group of the factorial design were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% CIs. We prespecified subgroup analyses to explore whether the effect of treatment was modified by age, sex, comorbidities at baseline, and by vaccination status at time of enrolment. Analyses of timing of randomisation in relation to the onset of symptoms and timing of enrolment in relation to the phase of the pandemic were done post-hoc. The ACT outpatient trial aimed to enroll 3500 patients which would provide at least 80% power with a two-sided α of 0·05 to detect a 30% relative risk reduction for each intervention versus control assuming an overall incidence rate of the primary outcome of 7·5% at 45 days and allowing for up to 2% loss to follow-up. There was no adjustment for multiplicity of testing because there was only one primary outcome for each randomisation. We prespecified that other outcomes would be considered supportive if the results were consistent with the primary outcome. All analyses were done by means of SAS version 9.4.</p>
                <p id="para200">An independent data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) oversaw the ACT trials and did a formal interim analysis when approximately two-thirds of the target sample size had been enrolled. The interim analysis was guided by the Haybittle-Peto boundary of three standard deviations to indicate benefit. If this boundary was crossed it had to be confirmed at a subsequent analysis done at least 1 month later for the trial to be stopped for efficacy. The DSMC also examined the consistency of results across the inpatient and outpatient trials. No modification to the level of significance of the primary outcome was needed because of the extreme boundaries applied.</p>
                <p id="para210">In order to contextualise our results, we did a literature search of electronic databases (PubMed) to identify major trials of colchicine in outpatients and inpatients with COVID-19. We restricted inclusion to randomised trials involving at least 100 adults that reported mortality, which was the main outcome of interest. The data for the primary outcome in each trial of colchicine in outpatients and inpatients with COVID-19 as well as for mortality were pooled by means of a fixed effects Mantel-Haenszel model and are reported as risk ratios and 95% CIs with a p value for heterogeneity. These pooled analyses were not prespecified.

After screening patients for eligibility, in the 2 × 2 factorial study design, 3917 patients were randomly allocated to receive colchicine versus control and then randomly allocated to receive aspirin versus control. After exclusion for administrative reasons of 36 patients enrolled in Ecuador (as required by the regulator due to delayed application for ethics renewal), 3881 patients enrolled between December 2021 and Feb 10, 2022 were included in the final analyses.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para320">The ACT outpatient trial provides no evidence for a benefit of either colchicine or aspirin for the prevention of disease progression or death in community patients with COVID-19. Results were consistent for the primary and secondary outcomes, as well as in all subgroups examined, including baseline vaccination status, and timing from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to randomisation.</p>
              <p id="para330">The event rate for the primary outcome in the ACT outpatient trial was substantially lower than originally projected and continued to fall substantially during the trial. When this first became evident during the first half of the trial, the steering committee modified the protocol to increase the sample size, enrich the risk profile of the study population by restricting recruitment to patients aged at least 30 years (previously ≥18 years), and expanded the primary outcome to include thrombotic events.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The overall mortality event rate at the end of the ACT outpatient trial was 0·6%, which is not dissimilar to that observed in the COLCORONA trial (0·2% colchicine <italic>vs</italic> 0·4% in placebo), which tested colchicine in outpatients with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, the overall hospitalisation rate in the ACT outpatient trial was 3·2%, which is substantially lower than the approximately 5% rate seen in COLCORONA, and only seven patients in ACT had a thrombotic event. It is unclear whether the emergence of less virulent COVID-19 variants, vaccination, use of effective cointerventions, or changing patterns of hospitalisation might have contributed to these findings.</p>
              <p id="para340">The ACT outpatient trial results appear to be inconsistent with those of the COLCORONA trial in outpatients<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and the COLCOVID trial in inpatients,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> both of which suggested that colchicine might have benefits for prevention of disease progression in patients with COVID-19. However, the CIs are substantially overlapping and our results provide no support for the hypothesis that the lack of benefit of colchicine in the RECOVERY trial<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> is explained by an inadequate duration of colchicine treatment for 10 days or until discharge. Our conclusions regarding the lack of benefit of colchicine are supported by the results of our updated meta-analysis of randomised trials of colchicine, which provides no evidence that colchicine improves outcomes in outpatients or inpatients with COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para350">Coagulation activation and clinical thrombosis have been reported to be a prominent feature of disease progression in patients with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The ACTIV-4B trial evaluated the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies in outpatients with COVID-19 but enrolled only 657 patients before it was discontinued at the recommendation of the data and safety and monitoring board because of low event rates.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We did not do a meta-analysis of trials comparing aspirin with placebo in patients with COVID-19 because only two of the 338 patients who were randomly assigned to aspirin versus placebo in ACTIV-4B had a primary outcome and we did not identify any other trials evaluating aspirin in outpatients with COVID-19. Several other randomised trials have evaluated the use of prophylactic dose anticoagulants in outpatients with COVID-19, but all were stopped early owing to futility.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> To date, no antithrombotic therapies have been shown to be beneficial in outpatients with COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para360">The strengths of the ACT outpatient trial include the recruitment of almost 4000 patients and high levels of adherence and follow-up. The study also has limitations. First, the trial was open label which raises the possibility for ascertainment and reporting biases. For example, investigators might have had heightened suspicion for a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism in patients not receiving investigational treatment with aspirin leading to increased use of diagnostic testing. However, venous thromboembolism was uncommon, and it is unlikely that this potential bias extends to other outcomes including the need for hospitalisation or death. Second, there was no adjudication of outcome events. Although there is a belief that adjudication improves the accuracy and precision of estimates of treatment effect in randomised trials, this remains unproven.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Third, we expect that background treatment differed according to local practice and availability of other therapies, but we did not collect information on the use of monoclonal antibodies or antiviral therapies for COVID-19. Finally, the low event rate substantially limited power to reliably detect important benefits of the interventions under evaluation. However, our results are supported by an updated meta-analysis of trials in inpatients with COVID-19 and previous trials of antithrombotic therapy in outpatients with COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para370">In conclusion, the ACT outpatient trial provides no support for the use of colchicine or aspirin to prevent disease progression or death in community adults with symptomatic, laboratory confirmed COVID-19.</p>
