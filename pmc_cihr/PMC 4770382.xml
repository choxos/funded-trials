                <p>Despite its widespread clinical use, the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) remains poorly documented in elderly individuals. In this randomized, double-blind crossover study, we compared the efficacy of high-frequency (HF), low-frequency (LF), and placebo (P) TENS in a group of 15 elderly adults (mean age: 67 ± 5 years). The effect of HF-, LF-, and P-TENS was also evaluated in a group of 15 young individuals (26 ± 5 years; same study design) to validate the effectiveness of the TENS protocols that were used in the elderly group. Each participant came to the laboratory on 3 separate occasions to receive, in random order, HF-, LF-, and P-TENS. Pain intensity and pain perception thresholds were assessed before, during, and after TENS, using an experimental heat pain paradigm. For the young group, there was a significant decrease in pain intensity during and after HF- and LF-TENS when compared with baseline, with both HF- and LF-TENS being superior to P-TENS. In the older group, HF- and LF-TENS did not reduce pain when compared with baseline and no difference was observed between the 2 active TENS sessions and P-TENS. High-frequency, LF-, and P-TENS all increased pain thresholds in young individuals, whereas in older individuals, only LF-TENS increased pain thresholds. Taken together, these results suggest that TENS is effective in young, but not in older, individuals. Future studies should be conducted to confirm these results in pain populations and to identify strategies that could enhance the effect of TENS in the elderly.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic pain is a prevalent health care condition, affecting approximately 100 million adults in the United States.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The prevalence of chronic pain significantly increases with age, with more than 50% of elderly people reporting persistent pain.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> According to the American Geriatrics Society, seniors suffering from persistent pain should receive both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, the efficacy of many nonpharmacological approaches used today in older individuals has yet to be confirmed.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a nonpharmacological modality that is commonly used in rehabilitation to reduce pain.<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> The most common TENS parameters used are high-frequency, low-intensity stimulations (&gt;10 Hz, comfortable intensity; high-frequency TENS [HF-TENS]) and low-frequency, high-intensity stimulations (&lt;10 Hz, strong intensity; low-frequency TENS [LF-TENS]).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations allow depolarization of Aβ fibers, producing segmental analgesia through gate-control mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> On the other hand, the strong stimulations induced by LF-TENS depolarize Aδ and C fibers and decrease pain through activation of descending pain modulating mechanisms originating from the brain stem.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Both HF- and LF-TENS produce their hypoalgesic effect through the release of endogenous opioids, with δ-opioid receptors mediating the hypoalgesia of HF-TENS and μ-opioid receptor mediating the hypoalgesia of LF-TENS.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Past studies have shown that TENS can help reduce pain,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> analgesic consumption, and medication-related side effects.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These advantages are of particular interest for clinicians working with the elderly, a portion of the population who are often heavily medicated and prone to pharmacological side effects.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Unfortunately, studies looking into the clinical efficacy of TENS are mainly performed on young adults or on age-heterogeneous populations, and the clinical efficacy of TENS in the elderly population remains poorly documented. To our knowledge, very few studies have specifically evaluated the hypoalgesic effect of TENS in elderly participants (see, for instance, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Refs. 9</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Although interesting, these studies have important limitations (absence of placebo condition, incomplete description of the study's population or of the TENS treatments), hence precluding any final conclusion that can be made regarding the efficacy of TENS in elderly people. The aim of this study was to fill this knowledge gap and determine whether TENS is an effective treatment option for older individuals. More specifically, the objective was to compare the efficacy of HF-, LF-, and placebo (P) TENS in a group of elderly individuals. The effect of HF-, LF-, and P-TENS was also evaluated in a group of young participants to validate the effectiveness of the TENS protocols that were used in this study.</p>

                <title>2.1. Participants</title>
                <p>Fifteen young adults aged between 21 and 39 years (mean age: 26 ± 5 years; 6 men) and 15 older adults aged between 58 and 74 years (mean age: 67 ± 5 years; 6 men) were included in the study. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant and/or had a pacemaker (TENS contraindications), used opioids in the past 6 months,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> or had an existing neurological or pain condition affecting the lumbar region. Every participant was asked to refrain from consuming caffeine<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and short-term analgesics 6 hours before testing and tobacco products 2 hours before testing. The experiment took place at the Research Center on Aging of the Health and Social Services Center, University Institute of Geriatrics of Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). Subjects were recruited through local advertisements and were all French-speaking community-dwelling individuals. The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee, and each participant provided informed written consent before participating in the study.</p>

                <title>2.2. Experimental design</title>
                <p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design was used. Volunteers received 3 interventions, during 3 separate sessions (1-week interval), in random order: (1) HF-TENS, (2) LF-TENS, and (3) P-TENS. Randomization was performed using a random numbers table, controlling for presentation order. Controlling for presentation order ensured that an equal number of participants were randomized to each possible permutation level. Each time, the tonic heat pain test was performed on 4 occasions: (1) at baseline (T0), (2) during TENS (after 15 minutes of TENS; T1), (3) immediately after TENS (T2), and (4) 30 minutes after TENS application (T3). Heat pain thresholds (HPTs) were also measured at baseline, during TENS (after 15 minutes of TENS), and immediately after TENS to evaluate the effect of TENS on pain sensitivity.</p>

                <title>2.3. Tonic heat pain model</title>
                <p>Participants were seated comfortably in a massage chair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A pretesting session was first conducted to familiarize participants with the computerized visual analog scale (CoVAS; Medoc, Advanced Medical Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and to determine the temperature that would be used during the 2-minute tonic heat pain test. This pretest was performed with a 10-cm<sup>2</sup> Peltier-type thermode (Medoc, Advanced Medical Systems) applied to the thoracic region. Participants were advised that the thermode temperature would gradually rise from 32°C to 51°C (rising rate = 0.3°C/s). During the first pretest, subjects verbally reported their pain perception threshold and pain tolerance threshold. On the second pretest, subjects were given the CoVAS and advised that they would have to start moving the cursor towards the right (towards the “100” mark) when they would start to feel pain (pain perception threshold) and that the cursor would need to be at the extreme right (at the “100” mark) when pain was intolerable (pain tolerance threshold). This procedure was repeated until the subject's pain reports were consistent between trials. The temperature used during the following experimental heat pain test was determined by selecting the temperature for which the subject had rated the pain intensity at 50 of 100 (moderate pain) with the CoVAS (see <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 30</xref> for a similar approach). The decision to use a test stimulus that would produce moderate levels of pain was based on the observations of Benedetti et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> who reported that TENS is effective for mild or moderate pain, but not for severe pain.</p>

                <p>After the pretest, participants were given a 10-minute rest period before the experimental test began. The tonic pain test was performed with the application of the thermode at a constant temperature applied on the lumbar region for 2 minutes. Subjects were told that the thermode temperature could rise, remain stable, or decrease and that they would need to evaluate their pain with the CoVAS throughout the 2 minutes of the test. In fact, after a constant rise (1°C/s) from baseline (32°C) to the individually predetermined temperature, the thermode's temperature remained constant throughout the times of the test.</p>

The threshold was determined using the method of limits.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Participants were advised that the temperature of the thermode would gradually increase and that they would need to report their first pain sensation by clicking on the left button of a computer mouse (baseline = 32°C; rising rate = 1°C/s). A total of 3 HPT values were taken at each time measure. The 3 values of the same time measure were then averaged to obtain a single HPT value.</p>

Electrodes were placed on the lower thoracic and lumbar region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For HF-TENS, the frequency was set at 100 Hz and the pulse duration at 60 μs, and the intensity was adjusted to produce strong and comfortable (innocuous) tingling sensations.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> For LF-TENS, the frequency was set at 3 Hz and the pulse duration at 400 μs, and the intensity was adjusted to produce strong and painful sensations.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> For P-TENS, the frequency was set at 100 Hz and the pulse duration at 60 μs. However, the TENS apparatus was turned “OFF” using a hidden device, which disabled the electrodes without changing the display on the equipment (electric stimulation applied to built-in resistors). The participants were led to believe that there was an electric current (indication of stimulation on the TENS device), but in reality, electric current was dissipated as heat in the resistors (no electrical stimulation given to the participants). For all TENS conditions, the stimulation was applied for 25 minutes and the intensity was raised for HF- and LF-TENS, if needed, at minutes 10 and 20 of stimulation, based on the participant's sensation, to account for nerve habituation.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>

                <p>To facilitate comparisons, pain intensity ratings obtained during the 2-minute tonic heat pain test were averaged and the mean was used in subsequent analyses. The study was designed to detect a difference of 20 points on the CoVAS (clinically important difference<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>). To detect this difference in each age group, with 80% power and a 5% significance level, we determined that 15 young adults and 15 older adults had to be enrolled in the study (estimated SD of 26, based on preliminary results). Given the design of the study, power calculations were made based on within-group analyses. Within-group analyses allowed us to determine both the effect of the independent variables TIME (T0, T1, T2, and T3) and CONDITION (HF-TENS, LF-TENS, and P-TENS).

                <p>Because of the small number of subjects and because visual inspection of the histograms did not allow us to assume that the data were normally distributed, nonparametric tests were used. For each TENS treatment (HF-, LF-, and P-TENS), Friedman tests were used to compare the pain scores and the pain thresholds before, during, and after TENS application (TIME variable). This allowed us to determine whether each TENS treatment influenced pain perception. Friedman tests were also used to compare the pain scores and the pain thresholds across the 3 TENS treatments for the same time measure (CONDITION variable). This allowed us to directly compare the efficacy of HF-TENS, LF-TENS, and P-TENS. Differences were considered to be significant if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was obtained. Bonferroni corrections were applied to all post hoc multiple analyses to prevent for type I errors. All tests were performed using SPSS (version 17.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL).</p>

              <p>In this study, we evaluated the hypoalgesic effect of HF-, LF-, and P-TENS in a group of young and older individuals. The analyses of pain intensity ratings obtained during the experimental heat pain paradigm revealed a strong and significant decrease in pain for HF- and LF-TENS in young individuals. The important hypoalgesic effect noted in young adults contrasts with the absence of hypoalgesic effect noted in older participants. In this latter group, there was no change in pain for both HF- and LF-TENS, indicating that neither one of these TENS paradigms is effective for reducing experimental pain in elderly individuals. For the pain thresholds, we also observed a differential pattern of responses between young and older individuals, with young participants showing increased pain thresholds for HF-, LF-, and P-TENS and older participants showing increased pain thresholds for LF-TENS only, suggesting, once again, that the hypoalgesic effect of TENS is altered in older individuals.</p>

                <title>4.1. TENS effect in young individuals</title>
                <p>Many of the previous studies looking into the hypoalgesic effect of TENS were conducted with young or age-heterogeneous populations. For example, in their study, Chesterton et al.,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> evaluated the effect of HF- and LF-TENS on mechanical pain thresholds in a group of 240 healthy young subjects (mean age: 30 ± 7 years). The authors reported that HF- and LF-TENS similarly increased pain thresholds, suggesting that these 2 TENS protocols are effective for reducing pain in young adults. These results somewhat contrast with the results of Chen and Johnson,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> who noted a greater effect on mechanical pain thresholds for HF-TENS compared with LF-TENS. In opposition to Chesterton et al.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (who applied LF-TENS at a strong/to tolerance intensity level), Chen and Johnson<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> applied LF-TENS at a low/nonpainful intensity level. We believe that LF-TENS should be applied at strong/painful stimulation intensities.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup></p>
                <p>To our knowledge, 6 studies have evaluated the effect of TENS using experimental heat pain paradigms.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Although the quality of these studies was generally low, the majority (5 of 6 studies) found positive effects of TENS (see, for instance, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 13</xref> for a commendable review on the effect of TENS on experimental pain). The hypoalgesic effect of TENS has also been studied directly in clinical pain populations, with some studies showing positive<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and other studies showing negative<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> results. In 2007, Jonhson and Martinson<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> performed a large meta-analysis, regrouping 38 studies with various musculoskeletal pain populations, to determine whether the hypoalgesic effect of TENS is superior to that of placebo. The meta-analysis showed that TENS is more effective than placebo, with the authors suggesting that the equivocal results reported in previous studies may have been due to insufficient statistical power.</p>

<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In their studies, Grant et al.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and Ng et al.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> both reported positive effects of TENS on pain in older patients.

                <title>4.3. Effect of TENS on heat pain thresholds</title>
                <p>Previous reports have shown that HF- and LF-TENS can increase pain threshold (including HPT,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> cold pain threshold,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and mechanical pain threshold).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> In this study, we observed an increased HPT with HF-, LF-, and P-TENS in young participants and an increase in HPT with LF-TENS (but not with HF- and P-TENS) in older participants. Although our observations are somewhat in line with the results of Cheing and Hui-Chan<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (who observed increased HPT in young individuals after HF- and LF-TENS) and with the results of Chesterton et al.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (who observed increased pain thresholds in young individuals after HF- and LF-TENS), it remains difficult to explain why the results obtained with HPT differ from those obtained with the tonic heat pain test. These discrepancies can probably be explained by the different mechanisms involved. For instance, detection of HPT is believed to rely on the activity of Aδ fibers, while the pain experienced during tonic nociceptive stimuli mostly depends on C-fiber activation.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The results obtained from a study by Naert et al.,<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> who observed that tonic heat pain ratings only moderately correlated with HPT, support such an interpretation. Accordingly, our results tend to suggest that the effect of LF-TENS on the nociceptive activity of the Aδ fibers is more robust than that of HF-TENS, at least in elderly individuals.</p>

                <title>4.4. Increased baseline pain scores</title>
                <p>Although nonsignificant, analysis of baseline pain scores revealed that elderly participants tended to experience slightly lower pain before TENS application compared with young participants. In a past research report, Benedetti et al. showed that baseline pain scores could affect TENS efficacy. In their study, Benedetti et al. noted a positive effect of TENS for patients with mild or moderate pain, but not for those with severe pain. These results suggest that high pain levels can negatively affect TENS efficacy. In this study, we observed that the hypoalgesic effect of HF-TENS observed in young individuals was absent in older individuals despite the fact that the later reported slightly lower baseline pain scores than the former. Hence, the group difference in baseline pain scores does not jeopardize the conclusions regarding the absent TENS response noted in elderly individuals.</p>

                <p>The hypoalgesic effect of TENS depends on the activation of opioid and nonopioid circuits located at the spinal and supraspinal level.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Some authors have reported significant age-related changes in these spinal<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and supraspinal circuits.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> For instance, Hoskins and colleagues observed reduced spinal opioid-induced antinociception responses in older rats,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> a finding that could be explained by the age-related changes in the affinity of spinal opioid receptors.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> These findings could help to explain the blunted TENS response observed in elderly individuals.

                <title>4.6. Limitations</title>
                <p>One potential limitation that could be addressed to this study is the use of an experimental pain paradigm rather than a clinical pain paradigm. Without refuting the fact that experimental pain paradigms have less external validity than clinical pain paradigms, the former has, on the counterpart, the advantage of increasing internal validity. For example, in this study, using an experimental pain paradigm allowed us to evaluate the hypoalgesic effect of TENS in young and older individuals who experienced comparable pain (ie, nociceptive/thermal pain, moderate intensity level). We believe that recruiting young and older participants with similar pain conditions and profiles would have been a very difficult, if not impossible, task. Having 2 groups of participants with different pain profiles would certainly have reduced our ability to make clear assertions regarding the similarities/differences of young and older individuals. Nevertheless, we must keep in mind that the results of this study cannot be directly generalized to clinical pain conditions. More studies need to be conducted in pain populations before any definitive conclusion can be made regarding the effect of TENS in the elderly.</p>
                <p>Another important limitation concerns the relatively low statistical power observed for the older group. Indeed, contrarily to the analyses for the young group (73% &lt; 1 − β &lt; 100%), the analyses made in the older group reached a statistical power situated between 10% and 65%. This situation can be explained by the high variability of pain responses measured in older participants, a situation that has also been reported for other types of measures.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> The lower statistical power observed in the older group increases the chances of the occurrence of a type II error. However, one has to remember that the hypoalgesic response observed in older participants was not clinically significant (reduction in pain scores &lt;20 points). Therefore, even if statistically significant, the reduction in pain observed in elderly individuals after HF- and LF-TENS would have been of little clinical importance.</p>

              <p>In this study, we demonstrated that elderly individuals do not respond to TENS as well as young adults. In particular, we observed that, although effective for reducing pain in young adults, both HF- and LF-TENS did not significantly reduce pain ratings in the elderly. These observations can offer possible explanations for the contradictory results that are sometimes observed in the literature concerning TENS effectiveness. Clearly, more studies should be conducted to confirm the present results in pain populations and to identify strategies that could enhance TENS hypoalgesia in the elderly.</p>
