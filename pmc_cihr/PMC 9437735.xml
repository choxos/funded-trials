                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Presently, there are few population-level strategies to address SARS-CoV-2 infection except preventive measures such as vaccination. Micronutrient deficiency, particularly vitamin D and zinc deficiency, has been associated with dysregulated host responses, and may play an important role in COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We have designed a 2×2 factorial, randomised, double-blind, multi-centre placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin D and zinc on COVID-19 outcomes in Maharashtra, India. COVID-19 positive individuals are recruited from hospitals in Mumbai and Pune. Participants are provided (1) vitamin D3 bolus (180 000 IU) maintained by daily dose of 2000 IU and/or (2) zinc gluconate (40 mg daily), versus placebo for 8 weeks. Participants undergo a detailed assessment at baseline and at 8 weeks, and are monitored daily in hospital or every 3 days after leaving the hospital to assess symptoms and other clinical measures. A final follow-up telephone call occurs 12 weeks post-enrolment to assess long-term outcomes. The primary outcome of the study is to time to recovery, defined as time to resolution of all of fever, cough and shortness of breath. Secondary outcomes include: duration of hospital stay, all-cause mortality, necessity of assisted ventilation, change in blood biomarker levels and individual symptoms duration. Participant recruitment commenced on April 2021.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>COVID-19 continues to be a problem globally, with over 16 million incident cases and 200 000 deaths reported in November 2021.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Concerted global efforts have resulted in the development of vaccines, which may reduce the burden and impact of COVID-19, although suboptimal vaccine coverage and the rapid mutation of the virus continue to prolong the pandemic.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> Additionally, with limited proven treatment regimens for COVID-19 to date, it is essential to continue exploring low cost and commonly available effective interventions which can be implemented as standardised therapeutic treatment regimens at large.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This is especially important in the context of low-income and middle-income countries in South Asia and Africa, which are particularly vulnerable given weak health systems and the coexistence of malnutrition and other comorbidities. This includes India, which continues to report a substantial number of COVID-19 cases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>Observational and experimental evidence links vitamin D to an array of communicable and non-communicable diseases.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Vitamin D deficiency (VDD; serum vitamin D &lt;20 ng/mL)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> is common in urban and rural India despite the country’s sunny climate, due to environmental, sociological and biological factors,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> including skin pigmentation and cultural practices related to clothing and sun exposure. Countrywide studies suggest VDD may affect at least 70% of the Indian population. Vitamin D shows promise as a novel, cost-effective prevention and adjunctive treatment for respiratory infections. In laboratory studies, vitamin D metabolites support innate immune responses to rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–15</xref> In participants with influenza, high-dose vitamin D supplementation shortened durations of fever, cough and wheezing, particularly among those with low vitamin D levels.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased risk of acute respiratory infections and shortened duration of symptoms.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Zinc is an essential mineral that plays critical roles in gene expression, cell division and immunity.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In India, dietary predominance of micronutrient-sparse staples, limited consumption of animal foods and high consumption of zinc absorption inhibitors render the population at extremely high risk of inadequacy, which is exacerbated due to global climate change.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> About 25% of the Indian population is zinc inadequate, and 4.3 million child deaths (&lt;5 years) were attributable to zinc deficiency in 2017.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Multiple meta-analyses and pooled analyses of randomised controlled trials conducted in the USA and low-income and middle-income countries have shown that oral zinc supplementation reduces incidence of acute respiratory infections by 35%, shortens duration of symptoms and improves recovery rate.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 21–24</xref> Zinc is a potential treatment in COVID-19, due to its immune modulatory effect, as well as direct antiviral effect.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The mechanisms by which zinc may serve as adjunct therapy in COVID-19 has been recently reviewed by Skalny <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> who note that Zn<sup>2+</sup> cations, especially in combination with zinc ionophore pyrithione inhibit SARS-CoV RNA polymerase activity by decreasing replication.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
              <p>Vitamin D and zinc are safe, inexpensive and widely available therapies; therefore, experimental evidence that these nutrient supplements are effective against COVID-19 would readily support their inclusion in standard of care. Therefore, we are undertaking a randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of vitamin D and zinc supplementation on treatment outcomes among individuals with COVID-19 in India.</p>

                <p>The two study sites (King Edward Memorial Hospital and Research Centre, Pune, and Saifee Hospital, Mumbai) are established medical institutions located within the cities of Pune and Mumbai. These hospitals have been designated as COVID-19 dedicated hospitals by local municipal corporations, where people can avail COVID-19-related treatment and services. The trial is targeting a sample size of 700. The study commenced in April 2021 and study activities are expected to continue until July 2022. While we initially targeted only hospitalised inpatients at each site for the study, we broadened our target population in June 2021 to include all hospital outpatients. This was done in order to increase generalisability of results and maintain enrolment in light of decreasing COVID-19 cases.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>The original inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) men and women aged ≥18 years, (2) RT-PCR-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, (3) oxygen saturation level (SpO2)≥90 and (4) written informed consent.</p>
                <p>The exclusion criteria were as following: (1) pregnant women, (2) individuals enrolled in other clinical trials, (3) daily use of multivitamins for the past 1 month.</p>
                <p>To capture the greatest possible number and range of symptomatic COVID-19 cases and increase generalisability, we made the following alterations to our eligibility criteria from June 2021 (within 2 months of recruitment commencement): (1) added inclusion criterion of individuals with Rapid Antigen Test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (with confirmatory PCR tests performed subsequently on all such enrolled individuals), (2) removed inclusion criterion of SpO2≥90 and (3) removed exclusion criterion of recent daily multivitamin use. Since this change was made early, when few (&lt;6% of target population) participants were enrolled in the trial, we anticipate that the majority of the final study population will have been enrolled under the updated, broader criteria.</p>

                  <p>Potential participants are approached by trained site hospital staff members when they present to site hospitals. Site hospital staff members undergo intensive training and refresher training in order to ensure that potential participants are able to make an informed decision regarding participation. These dedicated site hospital staff members determine their interest and eligibility, and provide a brief introduction including key details about the study and what participation involves. The staff members read out the participant information sheet in the appropriate conversational language (English, Hindi or Marathi), and discuss the trial components and the role of the participant in the study. Information provided includes a clear outline of potential benefits and harms, the length of the follow-up period, remuneration that can be expected, future use of information and samples, and resources available to the participant such as access to study clinics. Informed consent is obtained after responding to any raised queries. As part of the process, potential participants are informed that their participation is completely voluntary and they can withdraw any time at any stage of the study without providing any reasons. The informed consent process is completed once participants provide their signature on two copies of the consent document; one copy for the trial record and another provided to participants for their reference.</p>

For randomisation, a computer-generated list was prepared by the study statistician, according to a randomisation sequence in blocks of 20 and stratified by follow-up clinic. The randomisation list assigns each participant randomisation identifier (ID) to a regimen code, with the actual regimen known only to the manufacturer and accessible to the statistician in a currently unopened, sealed envelope. Supplement bottles and envelopes are prelabelled with codes, and active tablets and placebo are indistinguishable, so that participants and all research staff including investigators remain blinded. At each site, each participant entering the trial is given the next available randomisation ID, and is provided their corresponding regimen based on the assigned regimen code.</p>

These symptoms are most commonly reported among patients with COVID-19, including in Indian populations,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> and have also been assessed as part of studies examining vitamin D and zinc in respiratory illnesses.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These and additional symptoms (including fatigue, headache, loss of smell and taste and sore throat) are captured on multiple time points, including baseline, daily hospital follow ups for admitted patients, telephone follow ups every 3 days after leaving the hospital until 8 weeks post-enrolment, the 8-week clinical assessment, and finally at a 12-week assessment call. Data on symptoms are collected using the same structured questions at each time point: (1) whether the participant has experienced X symptom today, and if so, (2) how many days in total including today the participant has experienced X symptom. Staff conducting in-person and telephone follow ups are trained uniformly using a standardised telephone script with regards to collecting this information. Metrics of individual symptoms and combination of symptoms are used to identify the time point of resolution symptoms from baseline.</p>
                  <p>Secondary outcomes include duration of hospital stay, need for assisted ventilation, individual symptoms duration, all-cause mortality and blood biomarker levels, including 25-hydroxy vitamin D, zinc, and other immunological and inflammatory biomarkers (including interleukin 6, angiopoietin-2, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, IgG and IgM). Biomarker levels are assessed using blood samples collected at baseline and at the 8-week clinical assessment. Occurrence of any other secondary endpoints between baseline to 8-week clinical assessment is recorded during follow-up calls or visits as described above. A list of collected data and blood investigations with time points at baseline, during follow-up visits or calls, and at 8 and 12 weeks is summarised in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

                  <p>An intent-to-treat analysis will be used as the primary analytic strategy. Time to primary outcome will be compared between participants randomised to vitamin D versus no vitamin D and zinc versus no zinc using Cox regression. We will investigate effect modification of either treatment effect by the other, and by third variables collected at baseline (including anthropometric status and vitamin D status). Effect modification will be assessed by including interaction terms in Cox regression models, and statistical significance assessed via likelihood ratio tests. There are no a priori effect modifiers hypothesised, and unless there is strong modification of a treatment effect, our power to detect these may be low. We will assess the success of randomisation by comparing baseline variables by treatment group using χ<sup>2</sup> and t-tests and use multivariate modelling to adjust for imbalances if needed. Additional collected information, including data on prescribed medications and other treatments, will enable an assessment of whether important factors including non-protocol interventions are balanced across intervention groups.</p>
                  <p>The effect of vitamin D or zinc on dichotomous secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar approach. The proportion of individuals experiencing hypercalcaemia will be compared between treatment groups using χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and effects of the supplements on blood biomarkers will be compared via Wilcoxon and t-tests. This study will measure numerous risk factors for COVID-19 progression and severe treatment outcomes including haemoglobin; comorbidities; medications including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and ACE inhibitors; and socio-demographic, clinical, nutritional and lifestyle-related risk factors. We will examine relationships of these factors in the placebo group first, to avoid complex questions concerning interactions between risk factors and treatments. Once we find a satisfactory parsimonious model using principles of model selection as detailed by Greenland,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> we will test and modify it if needed in the whole study population, adjusting for treatment effects.</p>
                  <p>Analyses will consider sex and gender throughout, by disaggregating findings, and attempting to elucidate the roles of sex and gender in the clinical course and immune response by controlling for potential sociodemographic, nutritional, and immunological confounders.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>With continued high incidence of global cases, COVID-19 remains a global health challenge. Alongside vaccination and other preventative measures, low-cost and efficient interventions which may help minimise the occurrence of serious disease are needed. These would be particularly valuable in low-income and middle-income countries, where health systems are more overburdened and resources much fewer. In this context, and given previous evidence regarding the role of vitamin D and zinc in the development of and recovery from respiratory infections,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 21–24 50</xref> there is a need to explore their potential value as part of therapeutic regimens for COVID-19.</p>
              <p>We report here the protocol of a 2×2 factorial randomised controlled trial, designed to generate evidence on the effect of vitamin D and zinc on COVID-19 progression. The frequent follow-up of participants and collection of a range of sociodemographic, clinical and biomarker measures alongside blood samples will enable a detailed investigation of the effect of supplementation on disease progression, including potentially important immunological and inflammatory pathways. Importantly, in comparison with other vitamin D or zinc COVID-19 intervention studies currently registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, this would be the first conducted outside of the USA or Europe and other similar high-income countries. The location of this study in two large cities, alongside the broad eligibility criteria, increases the generalisability of study results. Given the current unpredictability of COVID-19 waves, one challenge to the study is to maintain recruitment during periods where cases may be on the decline. We have taken steps to mitigate any anticipated effects of this, including broadening our eligibility criteria as described previously, and rigorous training of site hospital staff to help improve recruitment of eligible individuals. Another limitation is that we may not be able to ascertain differences in distribution of sun exposure (as a source of vitamin D) across treatment groups, although we would expect this to be similar due to randomisation. Regardless, the findings of this study will have direct relevance to many settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with weak health systems and prevalent malnutrition. Ultimately, the evidence generated as part of this trial will enhance our understanding of the role of vitamin D and zinc in COVID-19 disease, and contribute high quality evidence on the potential value of supplementation of these micronutrients for the same.</p>
