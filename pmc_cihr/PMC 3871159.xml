                  <p>Synthesis of lipid species, including fatty acids (FA) and cholesterol, can contribute to pathological disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate FA and cholesterol synthesis in individuals with type 1 diabetes, a group at elevated risk for vascular disease, using stable isotope analysis.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Individuals with type 1 diabetes (n = 9) and age-, sex-, and BMI-matched non-diabetic subjects (n = 9) were recruited. On testing day, meals were provided to standardize food intake and elicit typical feeding responses. Blood samples were analyzed at fasting (0 and 24 h) and postprandial (2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after breakfast) time points. FA was isolated from VLDL to estimate hepatic FA synthesis, whereas free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) was isolated from plasma and VLDL to estimate whole-body and hepatic cholesterol synthesis, respectively. Lipid synthesis was measured using deuterium incorporation and isotope ratio mass spectrometry.</p>

                  <p>Fasting total hepatic lipogenesis (3.91±0.90% vs. 5.30±1.22%; P = 0.41) was not significantly different between diabetic and control groups, respectively, nor was synthesis of myristic (28.60±4.90% vs. 26.66±4.57%; P = 0.76), palmitic (12.52±2.75% vs. 13.71±2.64%; P = 0.65), palmitoleic (3.86±0.91% vs. 4.80±1.22%; P = 0.65), stearic (5.55±1.04% vs. 6.96±0.97%; P = 0.29), and oleic acid (1.45±0.28% vs. 2.10±0.51%; P = 0.21). Postprandial lipogenesis was also not different between groups (P = 0.38). Similarly, fasting synthesis of whole-body FC (8.2±1.3% vs. 7.3±0.8%/day; P = 0.88) and CE (1.9±0.4% vs. 2.0±0.3%/day; P = 0.96) and hepatic FC (8.2±2.0% vs. 8.1±0.8%/day; P = 0.72) was not significantly different between diabetic and control subjects.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Individuals with type 1 diabetes are at a markedly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, despite lack of traditional risk factors <xref rid="pone.0082530-Orchard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Abnormalities in lipid and lipoprotein composition or metabolism may contribute to CVD risk, and may arise due to alterations in synthesis, absorption, or clearance.</p>
              <p>De novo lipogenesis (DNL), the synthesis of fatty acids, is assumed to be a minor contributor to plasma triglyceride (TG) levels in healthy humans, but this may not be true for all disease states. DNL is elevated in states of glucose interolance such as type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0082530-Wilke1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In these individuals, DNL has been reported to contribute significantly to both circulating TG levels and is highly associated with intrahepatic TG accumulation <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Diraison1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recent reports have indicated that up to half of individuals with type 1 diabetes have some degree of liver fat accumulation, which is associated with greater prevalence of vascular disease despite normal plasma cholesterol and TG levels <xref rid="pone.0082530-Targher1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. NAFLD development is highly associated with insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0082530-Lomonaco1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which may be more prominent in type 1 diabetic individuals than once appreciated <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Animal models of type 1 diabetes suggest reduced DNL <xref rid="pone.0082530-Feingold1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Shimomura1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but, to date, there have been no investigations of DNL in humans with type 1 diabetes. Further, the main products of lipogenesis are saturated fatty acids (FA), which may negatively influence cellular function and metabolism <xref rid="pone.0082530-Clandinin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and therefore contribute to the metabolic dysregulation observed in type 1 diabetes. The deuterium incorporation method is particularly suited to the measurement of DNL because is safe, can be used with a short measurement period (≤24 hours), rapidly equilibrates across body pools, and provides a highly sensitive and precise measurement of in vivo synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Typically when DNL is assessed, only the major product of DNL is measured (i.e. palmitate); however, using gas chromatography isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) allows for the measurement of the synthesis rate of individual fatty acids. For example, Bergman et al (2013) recently observed that individuals with type 1 diabetes had a lower amount of palmitoleic acid in plasma-TG compared to non-diabetic individuals, which was inversely related to adipocyte insulin sensitivity; these authors questioned whether this reduced content of 16∶1 was due to reduced dietary intake or hepatic synthesis and desaturation <xref rid="pone.0082530-Bergman2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore DNL may have quantitative and qualitative implications, and determination of its potential role in the increased vascular disease risk in type 1 diabetes is of importance.</p>
              <p>As stated previously, the paradox in type 1 diabetes is that these individuals are at a markedly higher risk for premature cardiovascular events compared to the general population despite lack of traditional risk factors; indeed, type 1 diabetic individuals frequently have normal plasma cholesterol levels <xref rid="pone.0082530-Orchard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Current American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend statin therapy for people with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) over the age of 40 regardless of baseline lipid levels for the purpose of CVD prevention <xref rid="pone.0082530-ADA1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes have been observed to have lower absorption and higher synthesis of cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gylling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. By contrast, type 1 diabetic individuals have been proposed to have reduced synthesis and elevated absorption of cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gylling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This discrepancy in relative cholesterol synthesis begs the question of whether statin therapy is warranted in type 1 diabetic individuals, given that it has been argued that while the benefits of statin therapy for CVD prevention is well established in type 2 diabetes, there is a lack of sufficient evidence that the same is true for type 1 diabetes as many large clinical trials have been underpowered to answer this question <xref rid="pone.0082530-Maahs1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The utility of statins for cholesterol reduction in type 1 diabetes is particularly relevant given that differences in cholesterol synthesis may predict response to cholesterol-lowering treatment <xref rid="pone.0082530-Rideout1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, determination of cholesterol synthesis in this group is clinically relevant because it may lend insight into appropriate treatment modalities. Previous studies have been conducted using sterol markers, which can be used to estimate cholesterol synthesis and absorption but are qualitative in nature <xref rid="pone.0082530-Jones2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The deuterium incorporation method is useful for studying in vivo synthetic pathways <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gremaud1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and can be used to estimate FA and cholesterol synthesis simultaneously <xref rid="pone.0082530-Diraison2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, the type 1 diabetic patients in previous studies tended to be younger, and therefore investigation of lipid synthesis in subjects with long-standing diabetes is warranted.</p>
              <p>The objective of this study was to objectively measure DNL and cholesterol synthesis in individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes who are otherwise free of diabetic complications, under simulated free-living conditions and using the deuterium incorporation method which is ideally suited to studies of lipid synthesis in short (&lt;24 h) duration. It was hypothesized that, given the labile glycemic control in this population, DNL would be elevated compared to healthy non-diabetic individuals. In addition, it was hypothesized that the objectively measured rate of cholesterol synthesis would be reduced in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy non-diabetic subjects, based on previously published literature using sterol markers.</p>

                <p>Individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes (n = 9) (duration of diabetes ranged 20–45 years; negative C-peptide (0.01±0.04 nmol/L); HbA1c 8.9±1.5%) were recruited from waiting lists for the University of Alberta Clinical Islet Transplant program. Islet transplant subjects have long-standing and labile diabetes characterized by severe recurrent hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness, but are free of unstable coronary artery disease, proliferative retinopathy and severe proteinuria <xref rid="pone.0082530-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The Clinical Islet Transplant program in Edmonton, AB is the premier site for islet transplants in Canada - patients travel from across the country and spend only a few days in Edmonton.

Blood samples were drawn and an IV catheter inserted for subsequent blood draws. Subjects consumed a loading dose of deuterium-labeled water (D<sub>2</sub>O; described below) following by breakfast. Postprandial timing initiated upon completion, and blood samples were drawn every 2 hours for 8 hours following breakfast. Lunch was provided after the 4 h sample, and take-home meals (described below) were provided for the subject to consume at home after the 8 h sample. Subjects were instructed to fast after 8 PM and returned the following morning for a 24 h blood sample.</p>

                <p>Fasting hepatic synthesis of total and individual FA was not significantly different between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>), nor was postprandial synthesis of palmitate (16∶0) (P = 0.38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Similarly, absolute amount of newly synthesized total FA was not different between control and diabetic groups (DNFA<sub>-Abs</sub>; 22.25±5.09 mg vs. 51.75±27.89 mg, respectively; P = 0.94) nor was absolute amount of newly synthesized 16∶0 (13.65±3.13 mg vs. 36.25±20.15 mg; P = 0.80). Palmitate (16∶0) is shown as a representative FA for postprandial synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>) because it is the primary product of lipogenesis; individual rates of synthesis of palmitate are provided in <bold>Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082530.s001">File S1</xref></bold>. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g002"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref>, myristic acid (14∶0) has a higher relative synthesis (i.e. a greater proportion of the total 14∶0 in VLDL-TG arises from de novo synthesis), but 14∶0 is a small contributor to overall VLDL-TG fatty acid composition, as can be appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g002"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref>. This finding underscores the fact that absolute quantity of de novo synthesized FA is determined by both synthesis rate and TG concentration. DNFA% represents the <italic>proportion</italic> of newly synthesized FA in VLDL-TG, and reflects increased synthesis or contribution from this pool as compared to other FA sources available in the liver (e.g. NEFA, previously stored TG, and newly received dietary TG). VLDL-FA composition (% total TG-FA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>) was not different between groups except for 16∶0, which was lower in diabetic compared to control subjects (P = 0.02). De novo synthesis of individual FA was not correlated with the corresponding proportion contributing to VLDL-FA composition (P&gt;0.05 for all FA). The ratio of 16∶0 to 18:2n6 has been proposed as a marker of lipogenesis. This ratio was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.13) but was marginally correlated with synthesis of 16∶0 (DFNA %) in control subjects (r = 0.62, P = 0.086) though not in the diabetic subjects (P = 0.84). Palmitate (as proportion of total VLDL-TG fatty acids) was positively correlated with saturated fat intake in control subjects (r = 0.67, P = 0.059) subjects, while it was negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake in diabetic subjects (r = −0.76; P = 0.037).</p>

                <p>Whole-body and hepatic synthesis of FC and CE was not significantly different between diabetic and control subjects (P&gt;0.05 all) at fasting or postprandial timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082530-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold><bold>A–C</bold></xref>; individual rates of synthesis are provided in <bold>Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082530.s001">File S1</xref></bold>). Similarly, fasting FC-ASR was not different between diabetic (0.49±0.1 g/day) and control subjects (0.41±0.05 g/day) (P = 0.72). There was no difference in cholesterol synthesis in type 1 diabetic subjects who were taking (n = 4; FC-FSR 8.4±2.0%) and not taking 1-thyroxine (n = 5; FC-FSR 8.3±1.6%; P = 0.99). FC-FSR was negatively correlated with plasma TC (r = −0.81, P = 0.02) and LDL-c (r = −0.83, P = 0.02) in Control subjects while VLDL-FC-FSR should a trend towards correlating with LDL-c (r = −0.63, P = 0.076), suggesting greater cholesterol synthesis correlated with lower plasma cholesterol levels. In contrast, neither FC-FSR or VLDL-FC-FSR was correlated with plasma cholesterol levels in the diabetic subjects. FC-FSR was negatively correlated with dietary intake of cholesterol in diabetic (r = −0.75, P = 0.03) but not control subjects, suggesting lower cholesterol synthesis is associated with greater cholesterol intake in these subjects. Hepatic FC-FSR was not correlated with dietary cholesterol intake in either group. FC-FSR was also negatively correlated with saturated fat intake (as % of energy) in the diabetic subjects (r = −0.73, P = 0.03) but not in controls.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The current work provides evidence that lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis are comparable in individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes compared to age-, sex-, and BMI-matched controls. The data indicates that lipogenesis is not elevated in type 1 diabetes which is in contrast to other populations that experience impaired glycemic control such as type 2 diabetes and NAFLD <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Diraison1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As such, lipogenesis likely does not contribute to the incidence of fatty liver that has been observed in these individuals <xref rid="pone.0082530-Targher1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Similarly, cholesterol synthesis in the present type 1 diabetic subjects was found to be comparable to that in non-diabetic controls, in contrast to previous studies reporting reduced cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gylling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These findings are also in contrast to type 2 diabetic individuals, who are reported to have elevated cholesterol synthesis, and suggests that the routine prescription of statin medication to all diabetic individuals <xref rid="pone.0082530-ADA1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> should be re-evaluated for type 1 diabetic individuals.</p>

                <title>De Novo Lipogenesis</title>
                <p>To the authors' knowledge this is the first investigation of hepatic synthesis of total and individual FA in humans with type 1 diabetes. The finding of similar rates of lipogenesis between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in the present study is in contrast to the rates of DNL in type 2 diabetic subjects <xref rid="pone.0082530-Wilke1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, despite a similar labeling procedure and timeframe. This discrepancy in magnitude of lipogenesis may be related to insulin resistance, because insulin resistance appears to have a greater influence on chronically elevating lipogenesis than does dietary intake. For example, individuals with insulin resistance, as occurring in type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0082530-Wilke1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and NAFLD <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, appear to have high rates of lipogenesis in both the fasting and fed states, which does not display a circadian rhythm <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> or respond to changes in dietary intake as would be expected <xref rid="pone.0082530-Wilke1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetic individuals may be more common than previously appreciated <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but is difficult to assess in these individuals as it requires multi-stage clamp techniques and does not correlate with markers of glycemic control <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Despite the potential for insulin resistance to increase lipogenesis in type 1 diabetic individuals as it does in type 2 diabetes, lipogenesis may remain lower in type 1 diabetic patients due to the restriction of total energy intake and particularly dietary carbohydrate in these individuals. This dietary restriction could serve to limit lipogenesis even in the face of insulin resistance.</p>
                <p>The low rate of lipogenesis observed in the present subjects (similar to non-diabetic subjects) is particularly interesting in this population given that it has been recently observed that a significant proportion of individuals with type 1 diabetes may have fatty liver <xref rid="pone.0082530-Targher1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In non-diabetic individuals with NAFLD, lipogenesis is elevated in subjects and contributes a substantial amount of FA to both VLDL- and intrahepatic-TG <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. By comparison, other FA sources may contribute to hepatic lipid accrual in type 1 diabetes, including adipose-derived free FA (FFA) and dietary-derived TG. Plasma FFA concentrations were not measured in the present study, and is a limitation of this investigation, but has been previously shown to be elevated in type 1 diabetic individuals along with an impaired suppression of lipolysis with insulin administration <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Bergman2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Given the unpredictable nature of glycemic control and potential for insulin resistance (due to duration of diabetes and glycemic lability) in these individuals, it is likely that plasma FFA levels were elevated in these participants as well, contributing to FA flux to the liver and the elevation in postprandial plasma and VLDL TG levels noted here. In addition, dietary fat intake was greater in the present diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic subjects. Therefore, primary sources of hepatic lipid in type 1 diabetic individuals are more likely to be derived from dietary fat and adipose lipolysis as opposed to lipogenesis. Ideally, a multiple stable isotope approach <xref rid="pone.0082530-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> to label various FA sources (lipogenesis, adipose, and dietary) could be utilized to determine the primary FA sources for VLDL- and intrahepatic-TG in type 1 diabetic subjects. Advice for individuals with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes for the purposes of reducing hepatic lipid accrual and lipogenesis would be to reduce overall caloric intake, with a particular focus on simple sugars <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Browning1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>; however, this counseling is already provided to type 1 diabetic individuals for glycemic control. Because lipogenesis does not appear to be elevated in the present cohort, clinical advice for managing lipid metabolism in type 1 diabetic patients could include modifying dietary intake to replace consumption of saturated fat with mono- and polyunsaturated fat which would be expected to have beneficial effects on insulin resistance and modify plasma, hepatic, and adipose fatty acid profiles.</p>
                <p>The greater intake of dietary fat compared to carbohydrate of the diabetic subjects could contribute to the low observed lipogenesis, as it is generally accepted that dietary fat suppresses while carbohydrate stimulates DNL. However, if this were the case it would be expected that the control subjects would have had greater rates of lipogenesis compared to the diabetic subjects, given the higher habitual intake of carbohydrate. The relationship between carbohydrate intake and lipogenesis is contingent on the overall energy intake of the diet as well as the composition. In healthy individuals, DNL is elevated when carbohydrate is consumed <italic>in excess</italic> of energy needs <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schwarz2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-McDevitt1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> or when carbohydrate provides a significantly high proportion of energy (e.g. ∼70–80% energy from CHO) <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Lammert1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Hudgins1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Hudgins2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, the elevated DNL observed during high-carbohydrate feeding can be augmented by substituting simple carbohydrate for more complex forms, such as starch and fiber <xref rid="pone.0082530-Hudgins3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. DNL can also be stimulated in the acute setting by providing a high-carbohydrate test meal comprised of mostly simple sugars (e.g. 80–100% of energy as CHO) <xref rid="pone.0082530-MarquesLopes1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Parks1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. By contrast, the test day meals used in the present study were similar in fat (as % energy) to the background diet of the diabetic subjects, but were greater than the background diet of the control subjects. It is possible that lipogenesis in the control subjects may have been reduced as a function of the test day feeding. While it cannot be excluded, this is unlikely given that food quantity was provided in accordance with habitual overall energy intake, carbohydrate was provided in both simple and complex forms, and the difference in fat intake was likely not enough to significantly depress lipogenesis in these healthy subjects. The limited time frame available for testing the diabetic subjects precluded standardization of food intake leading up to the testing period and is a limitation of this investigation. In future studies it would be advantageous to provide standardized meals to all subjects for a 3-day run-in period.</p>

                <title>Cholesterol Synthesis</title>
                <p>The present study provides evidence that the rate of cholesterol synthesis in individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes is comparable to non-diabetic subjects. The finding that cholesterol synthesis may be reduced or at least comparable to non-diabetic subjects is interesting given that the majority of individuals with type 1 diabetes are treated with statin medication aimed at reducing cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-ADA1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, statin therapy may also upregulate intestinal absorption and synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Tremblay1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. While we did not assess cholesterol absorption or the relationship between cholesterol absorption and synthesis, previous studies have suggested that type 1 diabetes have relatively reduced cholesterol synthesis but greater cholesterol absorption <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gylling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. If hepatic cholesterol synthesis in type 1 diabetes is comparable to healthy individuals, and if cholesterol absorption (and potentially intestinal cholesterol synthesis) are actually increased, perhaps a different treatment option targeting intestinal cholesterol regulation, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols, should be utilized in these patients. Because cholesterol absorption inhibitors may reciprocally increase hepatic cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, a combination of both statins and ezetimibe or plant sterols may prove to be most effective in this population. Indeed, a randomized double-blind parallel study of type 1 diabetic patients treated with statins found that the addition of plant sterols (contained in a food spread, providing 3 g/day plant sterols) further reduced serum cholesterol by 10%, LDL-c by 16%, and non-HDL-cholesterol by 15% with no effect on HDL-c <xref rid="pone.0082530-Hallikainen1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Further, one of cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of statins is the upregulation of LDL-receptors as compensation for reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Berthold1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This feature of statins may be particularly important in type 1 diabetic individuals because evidence suggests there may be impaired lipoprotein clearance in these patients, supported here by the slightly elevated postprandial plasma TG levels at 6 and 8 h, and previous findings of elevated postprandial Apolipoprotein B48 levels in these patients, indicating impaired chylomicron clearance <xref rid="pone.0082530-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Postprandial lipemia has been suggested to be particularly atherogenic in diabetes due to finding of greater remnant particle binding capacity to arterial proteins, leading to potentially greater arterial cholesterol deposition <xref rid="pone.0082530-Mangat1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Finally, given the poly-pharmacy and related financial burden already incurred by type 1 diabetic patients, a combination drug-dietary therapy, such as statins and plant sterols, may be ideal in this population <xref rid="pone.0082530-Rideout2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Therefore, the present data suggests that pharmacological agents targeting cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols, may be more effective to reduce plasma cholesterol and reduce CVD risk in type 1 diabetic individuals than agents singularly targeting cholesterol synthesis, such as statins. The outcomes of current clinical trials testing this hypothesis may provide answers (ClinicalTrials.gov registrations NCT00477204 and NCT00879710).</p>
                <p>In previous reports, cholesterol synthesis was lower in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to both non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gylling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Discrepancies between the current report and previous investigations may be due to differences in methodology as well as patient selection. Previous reports used sterol markers to estimate cholesterol synthesis, which correlate with the deuterium method <xref rid="pone.0082530-Matthan1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> but are limited to qualitative descriptions of cholesterol metabolism <xref rid="pone.0082530-Jones2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Sterol markers were not measured in the present study, which is a limitation of this investigation, but would be advantageous to include in future studies to provide additional indicators of synthesis as well as absorption. A further difference between the present study and previous investigations is that subjects in previous studies tended to be younger (age ∼30) and have better glycemic control (A1c ranged 6–8%). Finally, though not assessed in this study, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that subjects with type 1 diabetes may also be insulin resistant <xref rid="pone.0082530-Schauer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, a state which is associated with elevated cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Gylling1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082530-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, differences in glycemic control may underlie differences in the present observations, suggesting cholesterol synthesis may increase with worsening glycemic control. However, further analysis by Gylling and colleagues suggested that improving A1c in diabetic subjects actually increased markers of cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Sittiwet1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and therefore this concept requires further investigation.</p>
                <p>Despite the association of dietary saturated fat intake with plasma cholesterol levels, the effect of dietary fat on cholesterol synthesis in particular is more complex. In particular, there are few studies addressing how total dietary fat intake affects cholesterol synthesis. What has been shown is that significantly restricting total dietary fat intake (to 15% of calories) reduces cholesterol synthesis similar to that achieved by simple restriction of total energy intake (achieved through limiting primarily dietary carbohydrate) <xref rid="pone.0082530-RaeiniSarjaz1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, whereas changing dietary fat composition appears to induce more apparent differences in cholesterogenesis. Specifically, cholesterol synthesis is higher following PUFA consumption, particularly for n-6 PUFA vs. n-3 PUFA, as compared to SFA and MUFA <xref rid="pone.0082530-Jones3" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Mazier1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. It is not clear whether the greater total dietary fat intake of the diabetic subjects in the present investigation affected the observed rate of cholesterol synthesis; however, the relative proportions of saturated to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat were similar between groups and therefore are unlikely to have impacted the observed findings.</p>
                <p>In contrast to dietary fat, dietary cholesterol tends to have a neutral effect on cholesterol synthesis; however, increasing cholesterol intake can modestly reduce cholesterogenesis <xref rid="pone.0082530-Jones4" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. An inverse relationship between plasma cholesterol levels and synthesis has been reported previously <xref rid="pone.0082530-Jones5" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and appears to be especially important in individuals who have lower rates of synthesis; these individuals tend to exhibit the largest increase in plasma cholesterol after a dietary cholesterol challenge which suggests a greater role for cholesterol absorption in these individuals. The present findings do not suggest reduced cholesterol synthesis compared to non-diabetic individuals, but synthesis was observed to be inversely related to dietary cholesterol intake in the type 1 diabetic subjects; this finding would support the potential for elevated cholesterol absorption.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The limitations of this study warrant discussion. As described previously, the effect of statins to reduce cholesterol synthesis is abolished by as early as 3 days after statins are ceased <xref rid="pone.0082530-Pappu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; by comparison, LDL-cholesterol levels may not return to statin-naïve levels by 7 days of statin washout <xref rid="pone.0082530-Pappu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082530-Pfohl1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Total and LDL-cholesterol levels from patient histories were significantly higher at time of testing, but it is not possible to determine if LDL-c levels would have increased further after a longer washout period. This may explain why plasma lipid levels were similar between the diabetic and control subjects. However, diabetic individuals frequently have cholesterol levels comparable to non-diabetic individuals <xref rid="pone.0082530-Orchard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>; therefore it is unlikely that LDL-c levels in our diabetic subjects have been grossly underestimated. Nonetheless, the effects of statins on cholesterol synthesis are washed out by 7 days, and the rates of cholesterol synthesis measured from whole plasma and isolated VLDL were similar between the type 1 diabetic and control subjects. Finally, the type 1 diabetic subjects in the present study had long-standing and labile diabetes; therefore the results herein may not extend to all individuals with type 1 diabetes, particularly those with good glycemic control. However, this group was chosen because of their poor glycemic control yet relative lack of complications (renal disease, advanced cardiovascular disease) that could otherwise complicate the measurements of lipid metabolism.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The present work indicates that lipid synthesis is not significantly different in individuals with long-standing and labile type 1 diabetes compared to health non-diabetic adults. First, the data suggests lipogenesis is not elevated in type 1 diabetic individuals and likely is not a major contributor to circulating or stored triglyceride levels in these subjects, in contrast to other patient groups also at elevated risk of vascular disease, such as type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. Indeed, fatty acids arising from diet and stored adipose tissue may have a greater influence on hepatic metabolism in type 1 diabetes than in other populations where insulin resistance profoundly elevates lipogenesis as a significant source of fatty acids in the liver. Second, the finding of cholesterol synthesis and plasma cholesterol levels in type 1 diabetic individuals with poor glycemic control that are comparable to healthy non-diabetic individuals suggests that the routine use of statin medication for CVD reduction in this group should be evaluated within the context of other treatment options available which may instead modify cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols. In conclusion, the data indicates that metabolic risk in type 1 diabetic subjects may be beneficially managed by a combination of dietary and pharmaceutical interventions. Future research is required to delineate the possible interplay of lipogenesis, free fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in this group, as well as the investigation of alternative cholesterol-lowering treatments in this group for prophylaxis of vascular disease.</p>
