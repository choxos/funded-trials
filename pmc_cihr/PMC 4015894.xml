                  <title>Rationale</title>
                  <p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the lower limbs is an emerging training strategy in patients with COPD. The efficacy of this technique is related to the intensity of the stimulation that is applied during the training sessions. However, little is known about tolerance to stimulation current intensity and physiological factors that could determine it. Our goal was to find potential physiological predictors of the tolerance to increasing NMES stimulation intensity in patients with mild to severe COPD.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>20 patients with COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> = 54±14% pred.) completed 2 supervised NMES sessions followed by 5 self-directed sessions at home and one final supervised session. NMES was applied simultaneously to both quadriceps for 45 minutes, at a stimulation frequency of 50 Hz. Spirometry, body composition, muscle function and aerobic capacity were assessed at baseline. Cardiorespiratory responses, leg discomfort, muscle fatigue and markers of systemic inflammation were assessed during or after the last NMES session. Tolerance to NMES was quantified as the increase in current intensity from the initial to the final NMES session (ΔInt).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Mean ΔInt was 12±10 mA. FEV<sub>1</sub>, fat-free-mass, quadriceps strength, aerobic capacity and leg discomfort during the last NMES session positively correlated with ΔInt (r = 0.42 to 0.64, all p≤0.06) while post/pre NMES IL-6 ratio negatively correlated with ΔInt (r = −0.57, p = 0.001). FEV<sub>1</sub>, leg discomfort during last NMES session and post/pre IL-6 ratio to NMES were independent factors of variance in ΔInt (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, p = 0.001).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Lower tolerance to NMES was associated with increasing airflow obstruction, low tolerance to leg discomfort during NMES and the magnitude of the IL-6 response after NMES.</p>

              <p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the lower limbs emerges as a useful alternative training strategy in patients with COPD <xref rid="pone.0094850-Sillen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In several controlled studies, this training technique is associated with improvements in quadriceps strength, exercise tolerance and quality of life <xref rid="pone.0094850-Neder1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-Zanotti1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0094850-Abdellaoui1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-BourjeilyHabr1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0094850-Giavedoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The tolerance to NMES training, particularly the ability to tolerate progressively increasing current intensity, is an important determinant of the training response to this training modality <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For example, the increase in quadriceps strength and exercise tolerance following NMES training is related to the increase in current intensity during the training program <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-Giavedoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although issues with tolerance to NMES training have received little attention, some evidence suggests that the ability to increase current intensity during the training program is highly variable across patients and is individual-specific <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-Delitto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Learning about the reasons for the inter-individual variation in the tolerance to NMES training would be useful designing and selecting participants to NMES training intervention studies.</p>
              <p>Several factors could be invoked for the interindividual variation in the tolerance to NMES. The magnitude of cardiac and ventilatory demands during NMES may be one of them. Depending on the intensity of the stimulation, up to a two-fold increase in resting cardiorespiratory parameters values may be expected <xref rid="pone.0094850-Theurel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Electrically-induced leg muscle fatigue <xref rid="pone.0094850-Gagnon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> could increase leg discomfort during training and reduce tolerance to NMES. Subcutaneous body fat constitutes a resistance to electrical current in such a way that increasing current intensities may be more challenging in lean patients <xref rid="pone.0094850-Petrofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Finally, it is possible that the occurrence of a systemic inflammatory response following electrical stimulation could influence the tolerance to NMES but this has yet to be investigated. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that high ventilatory and cardiac demands during NMES, poor aerobic capacity, the occurrence of muscle fatigue and leg discomfort during NMES, reduced fat-mass and the magnitude of the inflammatory response after NMES would be associated with poor tolerance to increasing current intensities during NMES training.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the existing relationships between cardio-respiratory response during NMES, aerobic capacity, muscle fatigue, perception of leg discomfort during NMES, body composition, as well as systemic inflammation induced by NMES and the tolerance to NMES as defined by the increase in current intensity over the course of eight NMES training sessions.</p>

                <p>The study design is presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g002">figure 2A</xref>. Patients with mild to severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> = 56±14% predicted, body mass index = 27±5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) first completed two supervised NMES sessions (one for teaching and one for evaluation), followed by 5 sessions at home for training and one final directly supervised session for evaluation, for a total of 8 sessions. Spirometry, body composition, muscle function and peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) during an incremental shuttle walk and perception of leg discomfort during NMES were assessed at baseline (visit #1 or #2). Furthermore, the cardiorespiratory responses and perception of leg discomfort during NMES, muscle torque and muscle fatigue elicited by NMES as well as the intensity of the inflammatory response to NMES were measured during the final (8<sup>th</sup>) session (visit #3). Lastly, patients were asked before doing the first NMES session (Visit #1) whether they felt anxious or not and, after the last session (Visit #3), whether they would accept or not to use NMES training at home for muscle reinforcement. At the end of the study, the tolerance to NMES was quantified as the increase in stimulation current intensity from the second to final NMES training session (ΔInt). The study was conducted at the <italic>Institut Universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec</italic> and was approved by the ethic committee of this institution (CER20357). All patients gave written inform consent prior to study participation.</p>

During this and the second session, patients were also trained to become autonomous in using the stimulator in preparation for the home NMES training sessions. NMES training consisted in simultaneous electrically-induced contractions of both quadriceps using an electrostimulator (CEFAR Rehab4pro, Medical AB, Sweden) with the following parameters: 50-Hz frequency, 400 µs pulse duration and 7/10 seconds duty cycle (2 sec. ramp-up/1 sec. ramp-down). NMES was applied on the skin surface of upper and lower thigh using standard electrodes (50×50 cm and 90×50 cm for lower and upper thigh, respectively). Each session lasted 45 minutes. The current intensity was progressively increased during each session according to the patient's tolerance with the objective of reaching the highest tolerable current intensity. Leg discomfort was quantified using a 10-point modified Borg scale.</p>

Univariate correlation analyses were done using Spearman's correlation to identify potential determinants of the tolerance to NMES, as assessed by ΔInt. The independent variables that were associated with ΔInt with a p value&lt;0.10 were included in a multiple linear regression model. Sigmastat (Dundas Software, Germany) was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p>

                <p>At the second session, the mean NMES current intensity was 27±7 mA; this corresponded to 144±27% of the minimal current intensity needed to induce perceptible muscle contractions. All patients completed the eight sessions. Anxiety before beginning the first session was reported in 45% of the patients although 75% of them subsequently stated they would accept this training strategy for further use at home. The mean increase in current intensity from the second to final NMES session (ΔInt) was +12±10 mA (range = 0.5 to 41 mA, p&lt;0.001)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Four out of the 20 patients were unable to increase current intensity. The maximal current intensity applied at the final session correlated significantly with the force of the quadriceps contraction elicited by NMES expressed in %MVC (r = 0.77, p&lt;0.001) as well as with VO<sub>2</sub> at the end of the final NMES session (r = 0.77, p≤0.002), suggesting that the strength of the resulting quadriceps contractions and metabolic demand elicited by NMES was dependent upon the stimulation current intensity. The perception of leg discomfort averaged 4.6±1.1 and 5.4±1.5 at end of the second and last NMES session, respectively.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The present study aimed at investigating, in a detailed fashion, how patients with COPD tolerate NMES at its initiation. The main findings are that the tolerance to this intervention is variable from one patient to the other. We also explored predictors of the tolerance to NMES. Pulmonary function, reduced tolerability to leg discomfort during NMES and the IL-6 response following a NMES session were associated with reduced tolerance to the intervention. Muscle fatigue and cardio-respiratory responses to NMES were not associated with the ability to increase current intensity. Altogether, physiological variables that were assessed in the present study explained 72% of the variability in tolerance to increasing current intensity during NMES. Our investigation is clinically relevant in pointing out that not all patients with COPD tolerate well NMES and that those with advanced disease and poor tolerance to leg discomfort should be closely supervised at the beginning of NMES training program.</p>

                <title>Tolerance to NMES training in COPD</title>
                <p>We and other have reported that increasing stimulation intensity during NMES training is crucial to the success of the intervention in terms of improving muscle function and functional capacity <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-Giavedoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In one study, patients who could not increase NMES current intensity by more than 10 mA or could not reach 30 mA of current intensity during a 6-week program did not exhibit improvement in muscle function and exercise tolerance following NMES <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. One clinical implication of this is the necessity of helping patients to increase current intensity during NMES training. In the present study, while all patients started training with a perceptible contraction during NMES, a number of them doubled the current intensity from the first to the last session while others were unable to improve current intensity during the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These less tolerant patients should be targeted for a closely supervised program to ensure that they can achieve sufficient current intensity during NMES sessions.</p>

                  <title>Severity of the disease</title>
                  <p>ΔInt (+12±11 mA) after one week of NMES training was close to that previously achieved by patients with severe COPD after 6 weeks of training (+11 mA) <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In patients with mild COPD, a markedly higher current intensity (55 mA up to 100 mA) can be applied and tolerated at end of training <xref rid="pone.0094850-Neder1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-BourjeilyHabr1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This basic observation that pulmonary function may influence the tolerance to NMES current intensity is strengthened by the relationship we found between ΔInt and FEV<sub>1</sub> in the univariate and multiple regression analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094850-t006">Table 6</xref>). We cannot provide a definitive answer as to why patients with more severe disease may be less tolerant to NMES, but the associations between ΔInt, fat-free-mass, muscle strength and aerobic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g003">Figure 3B, C and D</xref>) suggest that better preserved individuals are more tolerant to NMES perhaps because of a better tolerance to the discomfort related to progressively higher current intensities. This mechanism has been put forward to explain why some patients with COPD are more tolerant to high intensity exercise than others <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev4" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094850-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In fact, the degree of acceptance to leg discomfort was one of the main contributors to the variance in the tolerance to NMES (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094850-t006">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Muscle fatigue induced by NMES</title>
                  <p>NMES can induce muscle fatigue in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0094850-Maffiuletti1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and patients with COPD <xref rid="pone.0094850-Gagnon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> but this was observed when the stimulation intensity was determined by the investigator. In the present study, we confirmed the existence of quadriceps fatigue after the last NMES training session, using stimulation intensities that were self-determined by patients. Using paired magnetic twitch stimuli, we found that low-frequency-fatigue predominantly occurred after 10 Hz magnetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094850-t003">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that contractile rather than neural properties were altered after NMES (low frequency fatigue), similarly to previous findings in healthy human <xref rid="pone.0094850-Ratkevicius1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This result could constitute a rationale for further investigation on the nature of muscle fatigue induced by NMES training. However, our findings suggest that muscle fatigue does not influence tolerance to NMES.</p>

                  <p>In contrast to healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0094850-Theurel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we did not report significant changes in cardiorespiratory response during NMES as compared to resting conditions in patients with COPD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094850-t004">Table 4</xref>). This result confirms that NMES elicits only minimally the cardiac and respiratoy systems <xref rid="pone.0094850-Sillen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and this was consistent with the low torque developed during the final NMES session (&lt;10%MVC for 80% of the patients). Despite that, the perception of leg fatigue was similarly elevated during NMES and after ISWT, confirming the advantage of NMES in providing local muscle stimulations at a low cost for the cardio-respiratory systems.</p>

                  <title>Systemic inflammation induced by NMES</title>
                  <p>Although we recently reported that systemic inflammation did not worsen after 6 weeks of NMES training <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, an acute inflammatory response may still occur after one NMES session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094850-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In the present study, we reported an increase in plasma IL-6 levels in 13 out of 20 patients after one NMES session (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094850-t005">Table 5</xref>). This observation is consistent with rodent and human studies showing that repeated muscle contractions induced by electrical current <xref rid="pone.0094850-Jonsdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> or during whole body exercise <xref rid="pone.0094850-VanHelvoort1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> is associated with elevated IL-6. We can only speculate on why an elevation in the IL-6 response to NMES could be a predictor of poor tolerance to this intervention. One possibility is that a pre-exercise glycogen depleted status in some patients might have influenced simultaneously the tolerance to NMES and the IL-6 response <xref rid="pone.0094850-Gleeson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In addition to influencing the tolerance to NMES, an exaggerated inflammatory response could also prevent gains in muscle mass and strength following this intervention by impacting on signaling pathways involved in muscle mass regulation in COPD <xref rid="pone.0094850-McCarthy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The link between inflammation and response to NMES is an area that should be further investigated.</p>

                <title>Potential limitations</title>
                <p>We acknowledge that the correlation analysis may have suffered from relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, one strength of the present study is that patients were evaluated after familiarization with NMES at home, a situation that is informative for the design of home NMES training program. We recognize that non-physiological factors (i.e. anxiety, depression) potentially influencing tolerance to NMES were not exhaustively assessed. However, the fact that the multiple regression analysis could explain almost three quarter of the variation in the tolerance to NMES indicate that frail patients with advanced disease and poor tolerance to leg discomfort during NMES should be closely monitored to assess their tolerance to NMES. We elected to evaluate patients after 8 sessions (one week) of NMES training. This duration was selected for pragmatic reasons considering that if the intervention is poorly tolerated, it would still be timely to consider implementing strategies to facilitate tolerance to the intervention while not compromising the whole program. A one-week duration of training was also chosen because we have learned in a previous 6-week NMES intervention study that patients who are poorly tolerant to NMES after the first week of treatment are unlikely to behave differently during the remainder of the program <xref rid="pone.0094850-Vivodtzev2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>NMES training was heterogeneously tolerated in patients with COPD. Some patients were unable to increase stimulation current intensity along the 8 training sessions, potentially compromising the effectiveness of the intervention. Pulmonary function, the tolerance to the leg discomfort during NMES and the IL-6 response to NMES collectively explained up to 72% of the variability in the tolerance to NMES. Considering the importance of increasing current intensity for the outcome of the NMES intervention, strategies such as direct physiotherapeutic assistance, simultaneous volitional contractions during NMES, novel NMES parameters or even therapeutic combinations should be further investigated to optimize the benefits of NMES training.</p>
