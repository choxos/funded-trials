                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Individuals with advanced cancer experience substantial distress in response to disease burden and impending mortality. Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully (CALM) is a novel, brief, manualized psychotherapeutic intervention intended to treat and prevent depression and end-of-life distress in patients with advanced cancer. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare CALM with usual care (UC) in this population.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients with advanced cancer were recruited from outpatient oncology clinics at a comprehensive cancer center into an unblinded randomized controlled trial. Permuted block randomization stratified by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score allocated participants to CALM plus UC or to UC alone. Assessments of depressive symptoms (primary outcome), death-related distress, and other secondary outcomes were conducted at baseline, 3 months (primary end point), and 6 months (trial end point). Analyses were by intention to treat. Analysis of covariance was used to test for outcome differences between groups at follow-up, controlling for baseline. Mixed-model results are reported.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Participants (n = 305) were recruited between February 3, 2012, and March 4, 2016, and randomly assigned to CALM (n = 151) or UC (n = 154). CALM participants reported less-severe depressive symptoms than UC participants at 3 months (Î = 1.09; <italic>P</italic> = .04; Cohenâs <italic>d</italic> = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.04 to 2.13) and at 6 months (Î = 1.29; <italic>P</italic> = .02; <italic>d</italic> = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24 to 2.35). Significant findings for greater end-of-life preparation at 6 months also favored CALM versus UC. No adverse effects were identified.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Findings suggest that CALM is an effective intervention that provides a systematic approach to alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with advanced cancer and addresses the predictable challenges these patients face.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The diagnosis of advanced cancer may trigger enormous distress and the challenge of living meaningfully in the face of progressive disease. Individuals in this situation face the burden of physical suffering, the threat of dependency and impending mortality, and the difficulty of making treatment decisions that have life-and-death implications while navigating a complex health care system.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Early palliative care for such individuals has been shown to produce better outcomes,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but the psychological dimensions of such care are much less systematized than those focused on symptom control and advance care planning.</p>
              <p>Ground-breaking research on supportive-expressive therapy has demonstrated positive effects on psychological outcomes in women with metastatic breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> More recently, three systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed that psychotherapy is effective in treating depressive states in individuals with advanced cancer, despite methodological limitations in most studies.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Both Dignity Therapy,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a legacy-building intervention for those near the very end of life, and Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> a group or individual intervention that promotes a sense of meaning and purpose in patients with advanced cancer, have been shown to be effective in a variety of outcomes.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We have developed a novel, brief, tailored supportive-expressive psychotherapeutic intervention, referred to as Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully (CALM) for patients with advanced cancer and a prognosis of at least 1 year.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> On the basis of relational, attachment, and existential theory, CALM provides a therapeutic relationship and reflective space, with attention to the following domains: symptom management and communication with health care providers, changes in self and relations with close others, spiritual well-being and the sense of meaning and purpose, and mortality and future-oriented concerns.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The CALM domains are addressed for each patient in a tailored, individualized manner that allows for variation in the number of sessions and time spent on each domain on the basis of the patientâs needs and health status. CALM can be delivered by a wide range of trained psychosocial oncology clinicians and cancer care providers.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In pilot trials with patients with advanced cancer, we demonstrated that CALM is feasible and found evidence of improvement in depression, death anxiety, spiritual well-being, and attachment security.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In qualitative interviews, participants reported that CALM provides a âsafe placeâ that helped them to âbe seen as a whole person by the medical system,â âgrow as a person,â and âbe able to handle death in a peaceful way.â<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We now report quantitative findings from an RCT of CALM. The primary outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms, which was selected because of evidence that depression is a final common pathway of distress in this population.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The primary end point of 3 months was chosen a priori to minimize the effects of attrition as a result of disease progression; the secondary end point was 6 months. Secondary outcomes were selected on the basis of the theoretical underpinnings of CALM and prior research<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and included diagnosis of major depression, generalized anxiety, death-related anxiety, spiritual well-being, quality of life at the end of life, attachment security, couple communication, post-traumatic growth, and demoralization.</p>

The actual number of sessions each participant received was based on clinical judgment and the patientâs ability to participate. Therapists aimed to deliver at least three sessions within the first 3 months of study enrollment. Noncompliance was defined as fewer than three sessions over the course of the trial. The primary caregiver was invited to one or more sessions when acceptable to the participant and therapist. Therapists were five masterâs degreeâlevel social workers and three psychiatrists. CALM training involved a 2-day workshop and satisfactory completion of at least two cases under supervision with G.R. and S.H., codevelopers of the intervention.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Treatment integrity was maintained through weekly group supervision, which included a review of session audiotapes and case discussion. After case presentations, G.R. and S.H. used a treatment integrity rating scale (Appendix, online only) adapted from Spiegel and Spira<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> to assess the therapists, and these evaluations were discussed to improve competencies.</p>
                <p>Participants in the control group received UC alone (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for comparison with CALM), which included routine oncology treatment and follow-up and clinic-based distress screening.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> UC did not preclude referral for specialized psychosocial oncology services, but most patients with metastatic cancer at PM do not receive psychotherapy as part of UC.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>

                <p>A sample size recalculation was conducted in February 2014 using actual attrition and compliance rates rather than pretrial estimates and without examination of treatment effects. A total baseline sample of at least 242 participants would power this trial to detect a small to medium effect size (Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>)<sup><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> of 0.405.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> With available resources, we chose to extend recruitment to reach at least 100 trial completionists per arm, which was achieved after consenting 413 participants, 305 of whom were randomly assigned.</p>
                <p>Analyses were by intention to treat. Analysis of covariance was used to examine outcome differences between trial arms at follow-up, controlling for baseline scores. The main analyses were conducted on available participants, <italic>P</italic> values correspond to two-tailed tests and Î± was set at .05. As a sensitivity analysis, we used multiple imputation with the Markov model<sup><xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> to address the issue of missing data (Appendix <xref rid="TA.1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>, online only) and report <italic>P</italic> values that tested the aggregate results of 20 imputations, which achieved 0.99 relative efficiency on the primary outcome and stabilized estimates. The imputation model included the relevant t0, t1, and t2 outcome assessments and randomization. We used the false discovery rate (FDR)<sup><xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> method to control for multiple comparisons on the secondary outcomes and report FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic> values. The FDR was applied separately to the family of tests at 3 and 6 months. The familywise FDR was set to .05. Trial analyses were independently verified by a member of the PM Biostatistics Department.

                <p>To clarify the clinical meaning of effects on the primary outcome, we conducted post hoc analyses with regard to the emergence and remission rates of depressive symptoms of at least threshold severity (indicated by PHQ-9 â¥ 8 points),<sup><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> and the proportion of patients with a PHQ-9 reduction greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 5 points<sup><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> in participants with depressive symptoms of at least threshold severity. Prespecified subanalyses were conducted for groups with low, moderate, or high death anxiety at baseline (using DADDS cutoffs of &lt; 25 and â¥ 47 points to distinguish approximately the upper and lower thirds of the sample) because these groups may differ in the processing of death-related distress.<sup><xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Finally, mixed models were conducted as supplementary analyses to examine treatment effects across outcomes, regressing each outcome on trial arm (UC, CALM), time (t0, t1, t2), and their interaction, with intercepts set as random effects.</p>

Contamination (defined as two or more psychotherapy sessions with a CALM-trained PM clinician) was 2% in control participants. Participation in at least three sessions was considered a minimal intervention. On the basis of this criterion, compliance with the intervention was 54.3% in the CALM group at 3 months (mean, 3 sessions; range, 0 to 7 sessions) and 77.5% by 6 months (mean, 4 sessions; range, 0 to 10 sessions). Of those who received three or more sessions over 6 months, 64.2% received three to six sessions and 13.3% received seven to 10 sessions; of the remaining CALM participants, 17.2% received one or two sessions and 5.3% received no sessions. The majority of sessions were delivered in outpatient clinics; a small number were delivered to very ill participants by telephone or in the inpatient palliative care unit. Mean treatment integrity ratings indicated that most therapeutic competencies were satisfactory to excellent, with the most room for improvement in the offering of interpretations (Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.1">Fig A1</xref>, online only). The overall attrition rate at 6 months (trial end point) was 25.5% (15.4% died, 6.2% were lost to follow-up, and 3.9% withdrew), with 70.9% of the CALM group and 77.9% of the UC group completing the trial. Final trial follow-ups were completed by September 2016. Mortality 1 year after trial completion was 67.5% (206 of 305 participants [109 CALM participants, 97 UC participants]).</p>

We also found a significant treatment effect that favored CALM at the 6-month end point for greater end-of-life preparation compared with UC.</p>
              <p>Among participants who were not depressed at baseline, those who received CALM were less likely to report threshold symptoms at the primary end point, which suggests that CALM may help to prevent the onset of depressive symptoms that may otherwise grow over time in individuals with advanced disease.<sup><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Although some have suggested the restriction of depression intervention trials in cancer to participants with major depression to avoid floor effects,<sup><xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> this approach may obscure effects on prevention of depressive symptoms in patients without depression.</p>
              <p>Evidence with regard to the mechanisms by which CALM exerts its effects will be reported in a separate publication. These mechanisms may include the opportunity for participants to discuss communication with health care providers, to address the effect of their disease on their self-concept and family relationships, to find or reclaim a sense of meaning and purpose in life, to express and manage fears and wishes related to the end of life, and to begin preparations for end of life. CALM addresses these concerns to alter what we have termed a final common pathway of distress that leads to depression in this population.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Such a targeted approach is consistent with the view that positive outcomes and sustained improvement are most likely to occur when the treatment of depression is directed at etiologic and pathogenic factors<sup><xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> and at subsystems of variables that interact in specific contexts.<sup><xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The study findings suggest that participants with moderate levels of distress about dying and death benefited most from CALM therapy in terms of reduction of such distress and improvement on the secondary outcomes of generalized anxiety, demoralization, spiritual well-being, and attachment security. Those with the lowest levels of death-related distress may be managing death-related concerns effectively and/or may be nonreflective about them; those with the highest levels may feel too overwhelmed to be able or willing to participate in conversations about such issues.<sup><xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Additional research is needed to clarify which patients might benefit most from CALM and to identify the optimal point in the disease trajectory for CALM to be initiated.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this study include that it was conducted at a single site in a large Canadian city with primarily English-speaking, white, well-educated participants, who may not be representative of other settings. The recruitment rate from oncology clinics is comparable to that with other psychotherapeutic interventions in similar settings,<sup><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> although this may limit the generalizability of the findings. Strengths include the relatively high intervention compliance and completion rates. More than 77% of participants randomly assigned to CALM were compliant with the intervention, and only 10% of those withdrew or were lost to follow-up over 6 months, mainly as a result of disease progression.</p>
              <p>In summary, the findings of this RCT suggest that CALM therapy may help to relieve and prevent depressive symptoms in individuals with advanced disease and help patients to address preparations for the end of life. Additional research is needed to explore the optimal timing of CALM, the specific mechanisms of therapeutic action, the most appropriate and meaningful outcome measures, and feasibility and effectiveness of CALM in diverse cultural and clinical settings.</p>
