                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Falls risk poststroke is highest soon after discharge from rehabilitation. Reactive balance training (RBT) aims to improve control of reactions to prevent falling after a loss of balance. In healthy older adults, a single RBT session can lead to lasting improvements in reactive balance control and prevent falls in daily life. While increasing the dose of RBT does not appear to lead to additional benefit for healthy older adults, stroke survivors, who have more severely impaired balance control, may benefit from a higher RBT dose. Our long-term goal is to determine the optimal dose of RBT in people with subacute stroke. This assessor-blinded pilot randomised controlled trial aims to inform the design of a larger trial to address this long-term goal.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Participants (n=36) will be attending out-patient stroke rehabilitation, and will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: one, three or six RBT sessions. RBT will replace a portion of participants’ regular physiotherapy so that the total physical rehabilitation time will be the same for the three groups. Balance and balance confidence will be assessed at: (1) study enrolment; (2) out-patient rehabilitation discharge; and (3) 6 months postdischarge. Participants will report falls and physical activity for 6 months postdischarge. Pilot data will be used to plan the larger trial (ie, sample size estimate using fall rates, and which groups should be included based on between-group trends in pre-to-post training effect sizes for reactive balance control measures). Pilot data will also be used to assess the feasibility of the larger trial (ie, based on the accrual rate, outcome completion rate and feasibility of prescribing specific training doses).</p>

                <p>Conventional balance training, where the goal is to maintain balance during the balance-challenging exercises, reduces falls in older adults,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but not after stroke.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Reactive balance training (RBT), where clients experience repeated postural perturbations (or loss of balance),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> is a novel type of exercise that aims to improve reactive balance control. RBT can prevent falls in older adults and people with Parkinson’s disease.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Our non-randomised study suggests that RBT reduces fall rates after discharge from stroke rehabilitation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In our previous study, the intervention was implemented as part of routine care, and the dose of RBT depended on client goals and preferences and length of stay, rather than being prescribed by the study protocol. Participants completed 1–12, 30 min RBT sessions (median of six sessions).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
                <p>Unlike other forms of exercise (eg, resistance training or aerobic exercise), where improvements in physical fitness take weeks or months of regular training,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> improved reactive balance control with RBT seems to occur with few repetitions, and is maintained for several months without training. Among healthy older adults, just 24 perturbations within a single session of RBT are sufficient to lead to lasting improvements (ie, 6–12 months) in reactive balance control,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and prevent falls in daily life.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> One study in people with chronic stroke found that improved reactive balance control with a single session of RBT was retained for 3 weeks post-training.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Almost doubling the dose of RBT does not appear to lead to additional benefit for healthy older adults<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>; however, it is possible that those with stroke would benefit from additional RBT as they have more severely impaired balance than healthy older adults.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While additional training may also promote sustained improvements in reactive balance control beyond 3 weeks,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref> in one study that included people with subacute stroke, reduced fall rates up to 6 months post-training were reported when 29% of participants completed only one 30 min session of RBT.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The subacute phase is a crucial period for RBT, due to the high potential for neuroplasticity in this early phase of recovery,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and to the high risk of falls early after stroke.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, there is a need to establish optimal RBT training parameters in the subacute population with stroke.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Participants will be allocated to one of three groups: one, three or six, 45 min RBT sessions. RBT will replace a portion of participants’ regular physiotherapy, so that the total amount of physical rehabilitation will not be affected by study participation, and will be approximately equal for the three groups. Each 45 min session will be entirely dedicated to RBT, and will include up to 60 perturbations. The proposed session duration and number of perturbations per session is double that of our previous subacute study, whereas the number of sessions is halved.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This previous study was conducted during inpatient rehabilitation, where patients are typically provided with 60 min of physiotherapy 5 days per week. Within this schedule, patients could easily complete 30 min of RBT, leaving 30 min per day for other physical therapies. However, as out-patient physiotherapy is only 45 min per session, the proposed dosages more easily fit into most out-patient rehabilitation therapy schedules. From our team’s previous research<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 19</xref> and experience with clinical implementation of RBT in stroke rehabilitation, we expect that participants will be able to tolerate the 45 min sessions of RBT. Rest breaks will be scheduled into each session, and will be provided when requested by participants.</p>
                <p>A research physiotherapist will oversee RBT in collaboration with participants’ regular physiotherapists to ensure consistent RBT delivery across participants. Training strategies will be individualised to each participant, based on their balance impairments and rehabilitation goals.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 19</xref> For example, if a participant has low foot clearance when executing reactive steps, then obstacles will be placed on the floor and the participant will be encouraged to step over the obstacles during voluntary and reactive stepping. If a participant has a goal to return to a specific activity then aspects of that activity will be included in the training sessions (eg, if returning to golfing is a goal, the participant may train on a compliant surface to simulate uneven outdoor terrain). Further details of the specific balance training approaches that will be used and how training will be tailored to individual participants can be found in our previous paper.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The RBT programme includes multidirectional ‘internal’ and ‘external’ balance perturbations. Internal perturbations are achieved by asking the participant to complete tasks that challenge balance control, such that they lose balance when attempting to perform the task (eg, kicking a soccer ball). External perturbations are delivered manually using a push or pull from the physiotherapist while the participant is either standing still or doing a voluntary task, like marching on the spot; when the physiotherapist is positioned behind the participant, the direction and timing of the push or pull can be unpredictable to the participant. As participants improve their reactive balance control, difficulty will be increased by shifting task requirements along a continuum from stable to mobile, and from predictable to unpredictable, and by increasing perturbation magnitude (ie, by increasing the force of the push/pull) or imposing sensory or environmental challenges.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

                <p>To assess reactive balance control, participants will be outfitted with reflective markers, and will complete 8–10 walking trials on a movable platform. There will be four force plates embedded in the movable platform. On two trials, the platform will move forward suddenly on heel strike (ie, when one of the force plates is loaded) to trigger a slip-like perturbation.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> On two other trials, the platform will move backward suddenly on toe-off (ie, when one of the force plates is unloaded) to trigger a trip-like perturbation. Each slip or trip trial will be triggered on heel-strike or toe-off, respectively, of each of the left and right limbs. The perturbation waveform will consist of a 300 ms square-wave acceleration, followed immediately by 300 ms deceleration (peak acceleration up to 1.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The platform will only move during these four trials; the remaining four to six trials will consist of unperturbed walking. The slip/trip and unperturbed walking trials will be presented in a pseudorandom order to ensure that participants cannot predict the timing, direction or perturbed limb for these trials. This unpredictability will help ensure that any changes are not simply due to practice effects on the specific task. While there may be some improvement in responses to the perturbation simply due to repetition of the task (ie, not due to training effects), previous work suggests that experiencing a single slip or trip perturbation does not lead to large and lasting improvement responses to the perturbations.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> These perturbations differ from what will be used during training, and will measure transfer of training to a novel and ecological loss of balance. Three-dimensional motion capture will record the locations of the reflective markers in space. Biomechanical stability when responding to the perturbation will be measured using an established method that considers the distance between the centre of mass and base of support<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 34</xref>; in general, a more posteriorly-located (slip) or anteriorly-located (trip) centre of mass in relation to the perturbed lower limb is considered less stable.</p>
                <p>Participants will be asked to report falls (‘an event that results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or other lower level’<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) in the 6 months postdischarge. Participants will be provided with stamped, addressed postcards to mail to the research team every 2 weeks for 6 months postdischarge. Postcards will contain a calendar, on which participants will record falls. The blinded research assistant will call participants who do not return the postcard to determine if any falls occurred. The research assistant will contact participants reporting a fall to complete a short questionnaire determining the cause and consequences of the fall. This method is considered the ‘gold standard’ for fall reporting.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p>

The one-session group is expected to show minimal improvements in reactive balance control and fall risk. Therefore, the rate of falls (number of falls per person-year) in the one-session group, reported over the 6 months postdischarge, and a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in fall rates, will be used to estimate sample size for the larger trial.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p>

We will report between-group effect sizes and completeness of data collection for responses to the slip-like and trip-like perturbations, and other outcome measures (ie, CMSA, mini-BEST, ABC Scale, PASIPD and SIPSO); the larger trial will only include outcomes with ≥80% completion rate.</p>

                    <p><italic>How feasible is it to prescribe specific dose of RBT to people with subacute stroke?</italic> The feasibility of prescribing a specific RBT dose during patients’ routine rehabilitation is not known. Participants assigned to the three-session or six-session groups or their physiotherapists may decline sessions if they feel they are not beneficial to their care. Likewise, participants assigned to the one-session or three-session groups or their physiotherapists may feel that they can benefit from additional RBT sessions. The dose will be considered feasible if the mean number of sessions and number of perturbations per session is 75%–100% of prescribed.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p><italic>What two intervention groups should be included in the larger trial?</italic> The larger trial will compare one session of RBT with a higher dose. We will use the reactive control subscale of the mini-BEST as a measure of effect of RBT on reactive balance control in each group. Scores on this subscale have been shown to improve with a high dose of RBT in people with chronic stroke.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We will calculate the pre-to-post training effect sizes for this subscale for each group (ie, mean difference in the score from admission to discharge). The minimum detectable change for the total mini-BEST score in people with stroke is 3 points<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> (ie,~10% of the maximum score). The minimum detectable change for individual subscales have not been established, but we will assume that this is 10% of the maximum score for the subscale (ie, 0.6 points). Therefore, if the pre-to-post training effect sizes are within 0.6 points for the three-session and six-session groups, then the larger trial will include the one-session and three-session groups. However, if effect sizes reveal a trend towards greater improvement for the six-session group, then the larger trial will include the one-session and six-session groups.</p>

All adverse events will be collated and evaluated biannually by the principal investigator.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s5-2">
                <title>Potential harms</title>
                <p>In a previous study, mild adverse events related to RBT in people with stroke were delayed-onset muscle soreness, fatigue or exacerbation of joint pain (11%, 7% and 32% of participants, respectively),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which did not require medical attention, but resulted in reduced intervention intensity until they resolved (typically by the following session). Of note, the frequency and severity of adverse events are similar for the RBT group and control group, who completed more ‘traditional’ balance training.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, these types of adverse events are typical of similar exercise programmes, and not specific to RBT.</p>
                <p>As the assessment and intervention includes tasks that are deliberately challenging to balance control, there is a small risk that participants, on loss of balance, will fall. Appropriate precautions will be taken to ensure patient safety during these tasks. Interventions will be administered by a trained and licensed physiotherapist who will tailor the training to the patient’s abilities. Assessments will be completed by a trained research assistant with a health sciences background. A safety harness attached to a secure point overhead will be worn for all postural perturbations to prevent a fall to the floor if the individual fails to regain stability. Additionally, the research assistant or physiotherapist can provide assistance to prevent a fall. We have administered tens of thousands of postural perturbations to over 500 individuals with varying balance abilities in previous research studies and clinical activities and no participant suffered an injury as a result of an induced postural perturbation. However, even if the participant is caught by the safety harness or researcher, there is a very small chance that participants will suffer a physical injury (eg, sprain or bruise). In the event of a minor physical injury, the physiotherapist will provide first aid, will advise the participant regarding follow-up with a medical professional (eg, family doctor) and home treatment (eg, rest, ice, compression, elevation) and will follow-up with the participant after a day or two.</p>
                <p>The physiotherapist will communicate regularly with the participant’s care team about changes in health status that could affect risk profile. Participants will be withdrawn if their health changes such that they would no longer be eligible for the study (ie, one of the exclusion criteria applies to them).</p>

              <p>A high rate of falling is common after stroke, and fall risk is highest in the first months postdischarge from rehabilitation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> RBT is a novel type of exercise that aims to improve reactive balance control, rather than ‘traditional’ balance training, which focuses on maintaining stability during voluntary movement. Time in stroke rehabilitation is limited, and physiotherapists’ report on lack of time is a barrier to implementing RBT.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The results of the proposed study will inform the design of a larger RCT to establish the optimal dose of RBT in subacute stroke. If a low dose of RBT can improve reactive balance control and prevent falls poststroke, this would allow therapists and patients to more easily include this fall-prevention intervention in rehabilitation, without sacrificing time spent working on other important rehabilitation goals.</p>
