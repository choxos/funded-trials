                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Epilepsy extends far beyond seizures; up to 80% of children with epilepsy (CWE) may have comorbid cognitive or mental health problems, and up to 50% of parents of CWE are at risk for major depression. Past research has also shown that family environment has a greater influence on children’s and parents’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health than epilepsy-related factors. There is a pressing need for low-cost, innovative interventions to improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether an interactive online mindfulness-based intervention program, Making Mindfulness Matter (M3), can be feasibly implemented and whether it positively affects CWE’s and parents’ HRQOL and mental health (specifically, stress, behavioral, depressive, and anxiety symptoms).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This parallel RCT was planned to recruit 100 child-parent dyads to be randomized 1:1 to the 8-week intervention or waitlist control and followed over 20 weeks. The intervention, M3, will be delivered online and separately to parents and children (ages 4–10 years) in groups of 4–8 by non-clinician staff of a local community epilepsy agency. The intervention incorporates mindful awareness, social-emotional learning skills, and positive psychology. It is modeled after the validated school-based MindUP program and adapted for provision online and to include a parent component.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This RCT will determine whether this online mindfulness-based intervention is feasible and effective for CWE and their parents. The proposed intervention may be an ideal vector to significantly improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents given its low cost and implementation by community epilepsy agencies.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par24">Epilepsy is a common debilitating condition characterized by spontaneous, unprovoked seizures. While the prognosis for seizure control is favorable, with 66 to 80% of children becoming seizure-free in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], it has long been recognized that the impact of epilepsy extends far beyond seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unequivocal evidence has shown that up to 80% of children with epilepsy (CWE) may face cognitive, psychiatric, and/or behavioral comorbidities, many of which go under-recognized and untreated, leaving patients with significant unmet mental health needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Importantly, such comorbidities often have a greater negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and life outcomes than do epilepsy-specific factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Neuropsychological comorbidities have also been shown to increase the frequency of outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and negatively impact seizure control after epilepsy surgery, and the response and tolerance to antiseizure medications (ASMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">It is widely acknowledged that the current standard of care is not adequately addressing emotional and behavioral comorbidities in CWE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. “Again and again it is pointed out that the comorbidities continue to be under-recognized and undertreated and that patients with epilepsy have significant unmet mental health needs. Nonetheless, there is no indication that this disappointing state of affairs will change anytime soon” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, outpatient pediatric neurology visits are focused on the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of the seizures, without adequate time or other resources to attend to the child’s or parents’ possible unmet needs. This is an important component because families of CWE fare worse than other families on quality of parent-child relationship, parenting confidence, family functioning and stress, and parental psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Parents of CWE have poorer HRQOL, with up to 50% of mothers of CWE at risk for clinical depression and 58% of parents at risk for anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Notably, our findings, along with those of others, point to family environment as an important determinant for long-term HRQOL; epilepsy-related factors, with the exception of seizure control, are seldom associated with HRQOL and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is therefore essential that interventions target parents’ well-being and HRQOL as well as the HRQOL and psychological well-being of CWE.</p>
                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>Mindfulness-based interventions</title>
                  <p id="Par26">Cognitive-behavioral therapies are increasingly popular in adult health research but their applicability and accessibility limit widespread use in CWE. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and counseling are often administered one-on-one, which is costly and often depend on difficult-to-access specialized therapists; wait times in Ontario, Canada, exceed 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although there is a risk that the mental health of children and youth can deteriorate while waiting for service, little is done to monitor wait time trends and their impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Targeting psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities may therefore be best accomplished through community organizations and in group settings. Mindfulness-based interventions may provide an ideal vector to target unmet mental healthcare needs in persons with epilepsy and their families. These group-based interventions are delivered at low cost and by non-medical staff.</p>
                  <p id="Par27">Mindfulness-based interventions are effective and have been well-validated for several adult outcomes including physical and mental health, social and emotional well-being, and cognition. Meta-analyses covering a wide spectrum of clinical populations and non-clinical populations report an overall medium effect size of 0.50 to 0.59 across these outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a recent Cochrane review of psychological interventions for people with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], three studies specifically examined mindfulness-based techniques for adults and determined positive outcomes on mental health, HRQOL, and seizure outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There has been far less research on mindfulness with children and youth; the studies that have been done are plagued with methodological limitations including small numbers and lack of randomization or control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, evidence to date indicates that mindfulness interventions for children and youth are feasible, accepted, and enjoyed by participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The few well-conducted studies on mindfulness interventions in children without physical health issues have reported reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, reduced maladaptive coping and rumination, and improved behavioral and emotional self-regulation and focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] found that mindfulness interventions were three times more effective (relative to other interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) in alleviating psychological symptoms among children with clinically diagnosed neuropsychological disorders (such as anxiety, learning disability, and externalizing disorders).</p>
                  <p id="Par28">In addition to the benefits of programs that deliver mindfulness interventions directly to children, programs that target parents appear to be effective in improving parental functioning and, in turn, promote positive child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, mindfulness-based interventions for parents of children with chronic issues (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental delays, autism) have been shown to be effective for lessening parental stress and mental health problems. Improvements in parent-child relationships and improved youth behavior management have also been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par29">Neither the Cochrane review on the impact of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], nor a recent systematic review on mindfulness interventions in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] found studies investigating mindfulness management techniques for CWE. Despite the paucity of studies of mindfulness interventions in childhood epilepsy, there is converging evidence to suggest studying a mindfulness-based intervention in children and families with epilepsy is warranted. There is research pointing to the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on psychological symptoms in adults and children, especially in those with relevant clinical issues similar to CWE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Proposed intervention: Making Mindfulness Matter (M3)©</title>
                  <p id="Par30">Based on the extant knowledge outlined above, together with a critical review of the benefits of psychological interventions, we propose a low-cost, live online intervention targeting <italic>both</italic> CWE and their parents. The intervention, Making Mindfulness Matter (M3)©, is provided to parents and children and incorporates mindful awareness, social-emotional learning skills, neuroscience, and positive psychology. M3 is delivered by non-clinician staff from a local community epilepsy agency, and integrates attitudes, skills, and behaviors related to mindfulness and social-emotional learning. Mindful awareness is paying attention to our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment in the present moment. Social-emotional learning refers to abilities such as managing thoughts, regulating feelings and behavior, making healthy choices, and taking the perspective of others. The program is delivered over an 8-week period with one 1.5-h session per week for parents and one 1-h session per week for children. Parents and children learn the same core principles: how our brains work, stress and the brain, mindful breathing, mindful sensing, mindful movement, perspective taking, optimism, and gratitude/acts of kindness. Within the parent group, the emphasis is on applying the principles and skills directly to parenting. The child program is designed for children 4–10 years of age, with each lesson including a variety of concrete ways to teach children skills based on their age/developmental level. The program has a standardized protocol, presentation slides, and scripts to be used by the facilitators leading each session. Approximately 80–85% of the program is related to learning about mindfulness, practicing mindfulness, or applying mindfulness. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides a description of the topics covered during each M3 session.

Parents also learn about neuroplasticity and the STOP model of mindful parenting.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">2</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: How our brains work under stress</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: Session two teaches how the brain works under stress. Children and parents learn to further identify which part of their brain is busy when they feel big emotions and how mindfulness and a brain break can calm their amygdala, so they can choose to respond, rather than react to stressful situations.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">3</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: Mindful awareness and mindful breathing</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: The concept of mindfulness is further explored in session 3, with children learning what is mindful or unmindful thinking and practicing how to be in the present moment. Parents learn about the effects of breathing on the brain and body and learn mindful techniques to use with their child.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">4</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: Mindful sensing</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: Further practice at being in the moment, through mindful sensing, is the focus of session 4. Both parents and children participate in a variety of activities using the five senses mindfully.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: Mindful movement</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: Mindful movement is the topic of session 5. Parents learn about the brain-body connection, and mindful awareness of their body and their children’s body during parent-child interactions. Child also learns mindful awareness of their body including how good posture relates to good thinking.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">6</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: Perspective taking</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: Both parents and children learn how perspective taking is a skill they can practice and strengthen through mindful awareness. Parents explore their child’s perspective through imagining their child is video recording all interactions and using that to understand how they should act in similar situations. Children learn perspective taking through games, books, and video.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">7</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: Choosing optimism and appreciating happy experiences</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: Choosing optimism and appreciating happy experiences are the focal points of session seven, with parents discovering that optimism can be learned and three techniques to be a more optimistic parent. Children learn about positive and negative thinking, how it affects how we feel and mindful ways to think more positive and have a growth mindset.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">8</td><td><bold>Topic</bold>: Expressing gratitude and acts of kindness</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Description</bold>: Using mindful awareness to practice gratitude and kindness are explored, with children participating in activities that encourage being thankful, and doing acts of kindness for those around them. Parents similarly learn how gratitude and kindness are linked to better mental health and stronger family relationships and that kindness starts with being kind to ourselves.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par31">M3 was modeled after the school-based MindUP program and augmented for provision interactively online and to integrate a parent component. MindUP has been used by over 6 million children in over 12 countries and has been validated in several studies that produced evidence of significant improvement in perspective taking, emotional control, optimism, cognitive control, and stress physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Children who received the MindUP program also demonstrated greater improvements in self-reported symptoms of depression and peer-rated aggression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The low-cost, online group delivery and facilitation by non-clinician staff also allow the program to be scalable to communities across Canada and increases its likely sustainability.</p>

                    <p id="Par66">The inclusion criteria, particularly with respect to seizure control, initial levels of HRQOL and mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress), and cognitive ability, are deliberately broad, and we acknowledge that this may limit the possible improvements observed following intervention. However, we believe this is justified given that the primary aim of this trial is to evaluate feasibility and to provide initial data on the potential effect of M3 on key outcomes. The impact of initial levels of HRQOL and mental health problems will be evaluated through a subgroup analyses, which will present an opportunity for a future RCT to be designed to focus on participants with poor HRQOL and mental health. Furthermore, the intervention was modeled after the MindUp program that is designed for all children (not just those with neuropsychological comorbidities).</p>
                    <p id="Par67">The age range of 4–10 years was chosen because the intervention has been validated for this age group. We recognize that study results will not generalize to individuals diagnosed with epilepsy in adolescence. Children with newly diagnosed epilepsy (e.g., diagnosed less than 6 months ago) were excluded because this period is marked with increased stress, uncertainty, and changed family dynamic. Children with progressive or degenerative conditions are expected to experience deterioration in health and thus likely in HRQOL over time. Major comorbid non-neurological conditions will most likely continue to have a major impact on HRQOL. Lastly, participants who regularly practice complementary health interventions such as meditation were also excluded. The benefit of introducing M3 to this group was thought to be minimal since such participants are regular practitioners of mindfulness or other complementary health interventions.</p>

The program will be delivered online using live, interactive sessions to groups of 4 to 8, for 1.5 h each week for the parent group and 1 h each week for the child group. For each group, we will aim to schedule the sessions in consecutive weeks and at the same time and day of the week, though some flexibility in scheduling will be allowed. Children and parents will attend separate, online sessions and at the end of the child session, the parent will be asked to join their child online for a shared mindful exercise. The M3 program will have separate sessions for younger and older children; the content of the sessions will be the same though the activities will be geared towards the participants’ age group. The research coordinator will determine, in discussion with the child’s parents, whether the child is better suited to the younger or older age group depending on the child’s developmental stage and cognitive ability. Typically, the younger group will be composed of children aged 4.00 to 6.99 years and the older group will be composed of children aged 6.00 to 10.99 years.</p>

                    <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                    <p id="Par72">Attention placebo control (APC) is preferable over treatment as usual or waitlist control for psychological interventions, to account for non-specific effects a group setting may offer such as social support/social attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However this design is rarely used in such trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Two key challenges may explain why the theoretical benefits of APCs have not been realized in practice and informed our decision to not use an APC in this current trial: (1) Disproportional drop-out has been documented; a study assessing a parent training program reported 18% and 50% attrition in the intervention and APC arms, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the reasons for drop-out were different; parents in the APC dropped out without reason or indicating a preference to be in the intervention rather than the APC arm, while parents in the intervention arm dropped out due to scheduling issues. (2) Potential for an ethical issue in a APC arm where participants’ comments and questions in discussions show a risky misunderstanding of key topics related to parenting, which should be addressed but where doing so is outside the protocol for the undirected discussion condition of the APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We view both these challenges as very likely to occur in the epilepsy population. Given that the aim of the current pilot trial is to evaluate feasibility, we will utilize a waitlist control arm and provide controls with the intervention as soon as possible, to avoid differential attrition between the intervention and control arm. For the subsequent full RCT, we are exploring possible programs to utilize as APC and are considering a cluster random allocation process where all the eligible participants recruited from each institution would be randomized as a group (cluster) to either the intervention or an APC arm where it is much easier to ensure blinding of participants to reduce the likelihood of uneven drop-out. Additionally, a specific a priori protocol could be developed for the APC to incorporate strategies for addressing misinformation about epilepsy.</p>

                  <p id="Par73">The program is delivered by non-clinician staff. We have partnered with our local community epilepsy agency, Epilepsy Southwestern Ontario (ESWO), whose staff will be provided the training required to deliver the intervention. Facilitators from ESWO will be trained on the M3 program by the team that created it, led by Dr. Karen Bax. The training will be a 2-day online, interactive session following the standardized M3 training manual. Following the training, the ESWO facilitators will co-lead the program with one established trainer. At the half point of each program, a half-day booster-training session will occur online so that the program facilitators can extend their knowledge of the program and any facilitation issues that arise can be addressed.</p>
                  <p id="Par74">The intervention will be delivered online, and a total of four facilitators will deliver each M3 session (two facilitators for the parent group, and two for the child group). Two research assistants will also be present for each online session (one for the parent group, and one for the child group). The role of the research assistants will be to report on intervention fidelity (quality of implementation; described below, in section “<xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Outcomes {12}</xref>”) and to assist with the research aspects of the sessions (e.g., facilitating the process of parents completing questionnaires online).</p>

                    <p id="Par80">The primary objective of the trial, to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the intervention, will be assessed by evaluating (a) study procedures, (b) participant feedback and adherence to M3, and (c) intervention fidelity, as described below.</p>
                    <p id="Par81">Study procedures will be evaluated by tracking (a) the number of patients contacted, (b) participating rate, (c) reasons and/or barriers for non-participation (such as the proportion of families without an internet connection and/or a computer/mobile device), (d) attrition, (e) participant burden (e.g., time to complete questionnaires), and (f) quality of questionnaire data (e.g., the proportion of missing data).</p>
                    <p id="Par82">Participant feedback and adherence to M3 will be evaluated using three measures developed for this study (see the supplementary file). The first measure, the Weekly Parent Questionnaire, is completed online by parents at the start and end of each session. At the start of the session it asks about the utilization of M3 skills outside of the scheduled intervention sessions over the past week and whether any adverse events were experienced by the parent or child. At the end of each session, it asks about skills taught in that session and suggestions for improvement. The second measure, Parent Pre-Post Assessment, is completed online by parents at the start and end of the M3 program and evaluates understanding and utilization of the skills taught by M3, as well as participants’ satisfaction with the online program. The third measure, Child Pre-Post Assessment, is completed by children with the help of a research assistant through a video call prior to the first group session and after the program is completed. The measure evaluates children’s understanding of topics discussed in the group, such as how our brain works when we are upset and what mindfulness is. These questions will be read to the children by the researcher and are rated on a 3-point scale as indicated by a smiling, neutral and frowning face.</p>
                    <p id="Par83">Intervention fidelity will be evaluated through two measures developed for this study (see the supplementary file). The first measure, M3 Adherence Checklist, is completed online, at the end of each session by facilitators and evaluates whether each planned task/activity was completed, any modifications that were made, problems that arose, and the facilitator's satisfaction with the session and the online format. The measure was designed to evaluate and document how each intervention session ran and was received by participants from the facilitators’ perspective. The second measure, Quality of Implementation, is completed online, at the end of each session by the research assistants present at each session and evaluates the facilitators’ presentation of materials, their confidence, and effectiveness at presenting materials.</p>

The QOLCE-55 generates a total HRQOL score and four subscale scores evaluating cognitive, emotional, social, and physical functioning. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better HRQOL. The primary interest will be the mean total HRQOL score at the Immediate Follow-up (week 9), adjusting for the total HRQOL score at Baseline (week 0).</p>
                    <p id="Par85">Although the QOLCE is a widely used HRQOL scale, no study has calculated the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Using the methods described by Wiebe et al.

This information will allow us to calculate the MCID for the QOLCE-55, and thereby identify the proportion of patients who experience a clinically meaningful change following intervention. The PCGRC consists of 5 items and asks participants to indicate the amount of change experienced relative to baseline in five areas (questions) that correspond to the QOLCE subscales: overall HRQOL, cognitive function (e.g., memory and thinking), emotional well-being, social activities/well-being, and physical activities/well-being.

Seven additional items will be asked to validate parents’ response on the GASE; these questions will ask about the severity of seizures, intensity of seizures, falls or injuries during seizures, severity of period immediately after a seizure, amount of antiepileptic drugs, side effects of antiepileptic drugs, and interference of epilepsy or drugs with daily activities. At baseline only, the child’s neurologist will also complete the GASE and the additional seven items. Seizure frequency will also be rated by parents through two questions asking about the number of seizures and number of seizure-free days in the past 30 days. The primary interest will be the parent-reported mean GASE score at the Immediate Follow-up (week 9), adjusting for the mean score at Baseline (week 0).</p>

We acknowledge that children’s own perceptions are important and that this trial will not capture children’s perceptions of the intervention and its impact; however, we believe this is reasonable for three reasons. First and foremost, the primary objective of this pilot RCT is not to evaluate effectiveness as reported by children; the primary aim is to evaluate feasibility, focusing on participant adherence and facilitators’ adherence and quality of implementation. Second, questionnaires are completed at home and given the children’s age (4–10 years), parents would undoubtably have to provide the child with the questionnaires and likely assist, potentially biasing their responses. Lastly, given the children’s age (4–10 years), the choice of validated self-reported questionnaires is limited and it has been proposed that children under the age of 8 years may lack the cognitive maturity and verbal comprehension capacity to provide self-reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. We are evaluating ways to best incorporate children’s self-reports in a subsequent large-scale RCT of M3.</p>

The baseline and follow-up questionnaires are estimated to take 90 min to complete. Parents will also be asked to complete a brief online questionnaire via REDCap at the start and end of each M3 session pertaining to the content of the M3 sessions and their experience with the intervention.</p>

Two weeks prior to the first M3 session of the intervention arm, participants will be sent the baseline questionnaire and asked to complete it within 1 week, which will allow for a 1-week buffer window prior to the first M3 session for the intervention arm. Once the Baseline questionnaire is completed, participants will be randomized. One week after the last M3 session for the intervention arm, all participants will be sent the Immediate Follow-up questionnaire. Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaire within 1 week, with the goal of receiving all completed questionnaires within 2 weeks.

                  <p id="Par103">Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to complete a similar questionnaire, the Extended Follow-up, 10 weeks after the end of the M3 session. For participants in the control arm, the Immediate Follow-up questionnaire is the final follow-up questionnaire they complete. To provide interested controls with the intervention as soon as possible, those interested in receiving the intervention will be placed in a queue and will be able to join the next scheduled M3 sessions. Therefore, M3 sessions may be composed of participants randomized to the intervention arm and/or controls who have completed the study (completed Baseline and Immediate Follow-up questionnaires). During the M3 sessions, all participants will complete the same online questionnaires pertaining to the content of the M3 sessions and their experience with the intervention. Once the intervention ends, those who were randomized to the control arm will not need to complete any follow-up questionnaires. Therefore, the role of the controls in the intervention would be to simply honor the commitment for everyone to receive the M3 sessions and to “fill” the group (given that 4–8 participants are needed per group). The advantage of including dyads randomized to intervention and dyads previously randomized to the control arm is that it will increase the pool of participants waiting to receive the intervention and thereby expedite the time it takes to fill each group. The other advantage is that it would ensure that dyads randomized to the control group will receive the intervention as soon as possible and ameliorate attrition in the control group.</p>

                  <p id="Par104">The sample size calculation was based on the results of our pan-Canadian prospective cohort study of children (aged 4–12 years) with newly diagnosed epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Two years after diagnosis, we observed the mean score on the QOLCE-55 to be 76.4 with a standard deviation of 14.5. To our knowledge, there are no estimates of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the QOLCE-55, and no intra-class coefficient estimates available for the impact of group-based psychological interventions in CWE. We therefore assumed a conservative ICC among participants in M3 of 0.10, an average cluster size of 6, and aimed to detect a large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], corresponding to a 11.6-point difference on the QOLCE-55 between the two study arms.

Randomization will occur as close as possible to the intervention to minimize the delay between study arm allocation and the delivery of the intervention. Therefore, once informed consent is received, the parent-child dyad will enter the queue for randomization. Given that the intervention will be delivered in groups of 4 to 8, and assuming some attrition and scheduling conflicts, once 12 to 16 participants per stratum are in queue for randomization and available for the scheduled date/time of the intervention, participants may begin the study by receiving the Baseline questionnaires (as described in the paragraph below). If there are controls who have completed the study and are in the queue to receive the intervention, at least 9 participants need to be in queue for randomization. This would ensure that a minimum of 4 participants are randomized to the control arm, which is important to fulfill our obligations to participants by providing all participants with the opportunity to receive the intervention. It would be ethically problematic if, for example, one participant is randomized and they are allocated to the control arm; this participant cannot be offered the intervention at the end of the study because at least 4 participants are needed to run the intervention sessions.</p>

                    <p id="Par132">This manuscript is based on protocol version 3.0. In Version 3.0, the intervention was modified to be delivered interactively online, as a result of the COVID19 pandemic. Twelve participants were randomized prior to protocol version 3.0 and participated in the in-person intervention. Data from these participants will not be combined with future participants who complete the intervention online. A new randomization list was generated for participants participating in the online intervention, and a total of 100 will be randomized.</p>
                    <p id="Par133">In Version 2.0, the operational process was modified for a pragmatic reason to increase the pool of participants waiting to receive the intervention and thereby expedite the time it takes to fill each group (as described in section “<xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Participant timeline {13}</xref>”). The original process (in Version 1.0) was more restrictive and used a stringent timeline, requiring that the intervention arm receives the intervention in weeks 1–8 and the control arm receives the intervention in weeks 10–17. This limited the participant pool because eligible participants had to be available during weeks 1–8 and weeks 10–17 (given that they could have been randomized to either group).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par135">This protocol describes a funded pilot RCT evaluating the feasibility of implementing an interactive online mindfulness-based intervention for CWE and their parents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first behavioral intervention targeting young children with epilepsy which is particularly important as evidence to date suggests that early identification and treatment of epilepsy comorbidities are essential as there may be a window of opportunity for early intervention in some children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Interventions must be implemented early before problems become entrenched and interfere with the development of basic cognitive, behavioral, and social skills crucial for long-term educational, vocational, and interpersonal adaptation. In addition, interventions (such as M3) targeting self-regulation and executive functioning may be most effective during the preschool and early school years given the ongoing brain development and maturation of children in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. M3 is also unique because the intervention is delivered to parents and children, providing parents and their child with a common vocabulary and skillset, and enabling them to jointly practice the skills learned. Lastly, we believe that this program provides an ideal vector to target the unmet mental health care needs of CWE and their parents, given that the program may be delivered by non-clinical staff and is delivered online in a group setting. These characteristics would allow the intervention to be implemented at low cost and by epilepsy support centers, allowing scalability to communities across the country and increasing its likely sustainability.</p>
              <p id="Par136">The primary goal of this RCT is to evaluate feasibility, with respect to participant adherence and the quality with which facilitators are able to implement the intervention. Additionally, the feedback received from the recruitment, randomization, retention, and assessment procedures, as well as the feedback from parents and facilitators will allow us to better implement this intervention in a subsequent, larger multicenter trial. The data collected will also allow for the calculation of the MCID in HRQOL scores and enable better estimates of the impact of the intervention on key outcomes. This information will be necessary for robust sample size calculations. In reaching these feasibility goals, this study will employ a short follow-up period, comparing the intervention and control arm immediately after the intervention. This short follow-up may make it difficult to identify significant improvements in HRQOL, which may take some time to develop. However, participants in the intervention arm will also report on outcomes 10 weeks after the intervention, to estimate a longer-term effect. Improvements in other domains, such as depression, anxiety, executive function, and stress, may be evident in the short term. Regardless, the information obtained from these measures will be essential in the development of our subsequently large-scale RCT.</p>
