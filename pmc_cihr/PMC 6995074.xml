                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable through vaccination and screening, yet remains one of the ‘gravest threats to women’s lives’ according to the World Health Organization. Specific high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are well-established as the primary cause of cervical cancer. Uganda has one of the highest cervical cancer incidence rates in the world (54.8 per 100,000) as a result of limited screening access and infrastructure. The integration of a self-collected cervical cancer screening program using HPV testing within existing community-based primary health care services could increase access to screening and reduce cervical cancer rates among Ugandan women.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Using a pragmatic, sequential, cluster randomized trial design; we will compare the effectiveness of two cervical cancer screening models for self-collected HPV testing: 1) community health worker recruitment (door-to-door); and 2) community health meetings. In Mayuge district, Uganda, 31 villages are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Due to the nature of this trial, blinding is not possible. Women are eligible to participate if they have no previous history of hysterectomy or treatment for cervical cancer or pre-cancer and are aged 25–49 years old. All participants receive an integrated package of cervical cancer screening and education. Samples are tested for HPV using GeneXpert point of care testing. All women who test positive for HR-HPV types are referred to a designated health centre for follow-up inspection by Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with thermal ablation. The primary outcome for the trial is the number of women who attend follow-up for VIA screening at a designated Health Centre after a positive HR-HPV test out of all women screened per arm. Secondary outcomes include: cervical cancer screening knowledge; patient-reported experience measures for self-collected cervical cancer screening; and HPV incidence.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par34">Although cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable through vaccination and screening, it continues to be responsible for unnecessary deaths among women around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called cervical cancer one of the ‘gravest threats to women’s lives’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] as it is the fourth most common cancer among women globally, with an estimated 570,000 new cases in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The vast majority (over 85%) of cases occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with sub-Saharan Africa carrying the highest burden globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Uganda, cervical cancer is the number one cause among women of both age-standardized cancer-related incidence (54.8 per 100,000) and cancer-related deaths (40.5 per 100,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Challenges to provision of effective care in Uganda include competing health needs, misconceptions about screening, and poor prevention, screening, and treatment infrastructure, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] particularly in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">Specific high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are well-established as the cause of cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nearly all sexually active women are infected with HPV during their lifetime but most spontaneously clear the infection within 24 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, approximately 12% of these acute infections become persistent and can progress to precancerous lesions or invasive cervical cancer over decades, when not detected and/or treated early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The extended natural history of HPV infection provides an opportunity for identifying effective screening programs to prevent cervical cancer.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The WHO recommends a screen-and-treat strategy to reduce incidence of cervical cancer. This strategy can include either screening with an HR-HPV test followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with thermal ablation for women who test positive on both tests, or screening with an HR-HPV test and treatment for all HR-HPV positive cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. HR-HPV testing provides the opportunity for specimens to be collected by either a clinician or the woman herself (self-collected), which may reduce individual and health system related barriers to screening, especially in low resource rural settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Compared to no screening, the benefits of these strategies outweigh the harms; HR-HPV testing, however, produces a greater reduction in cancer and related mortality than VIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">Self-collected HR-HPV testing is highly acceptable to women and care providers and has potential to be rapidly expanded through communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], particularly when offered door-to-door [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One of the identified barriers to scaling up self-collected CCS in rural LMIC settings is the shortage of health human resources. The WHO recommends a task shifting approach whereby tasks are transferred, when appropriate, from specialized workforce members to less specialized ones, such as community health workers (CHWs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CHWs are opportunely positioned to link their communities to health services which facilitates the decentralization of health care delivery to rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A systematic scoping review of CHWs roles in cervical cancer screening in LMIC indicates feasibility and acceptability of this approach, yet there is still a gap in the knowledge of how to implement this practice within community-based health services and its cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In order to optimize and ensure the elimination of cervical cancer, research conducted in LMIC that informs how to best implement self-collection in a low resource setting with high cervical cancer prevalence is needed.</p>

The majority of the population has access to health services through two level 4 health centres (HCIV) and five level 3 health centres (HCIII). Study activities take place in 31 villages found in two sub-counties in Mayuge district: 1) Buwaaya sub-country which includes the catchment population of Buwaiswa HCIII; 2) Mayuge town council (TC) which includes the catchment population of Mayuge TC HCIII. A full list of study sites can be obtained from the corresponding author. Health Centres included in this study have been supplied with the necessary equipment and materials to carry out their designated study activities. Study protocols were guided by the cervical cancer screening approaches laid out by the Uganda Ministry of Health including the purchase of a GeneXpert IV System for point of care testing. Research staff members carried out all training activities prior to recruitment.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The study involves task shifting self-collected CCS to CHWs, known locally as Village Health Teams (VHT). VHT are an existing element in Uganda’s community-based primary health care service model in rural areas and currently administer health education to communities through informal community health days. Topics for discussion at the community health days are determined through the demands of the local community or based on government defined priorities. For this trial, a total of 61 CHWs have completed a one-week training session guided by the WHO’s CHW training guidelines for CCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Training encompassed intervention procedures, recruitment strategies, effective communication, survey administration and proper documentation, epidemiology &amp; pathology of cervical cancer, as well as screening &amp; test results delivery. CHWs included in this study were recruited from the existing local health workforce and are a part of the local community in Mayuge.</p>

All women in the study villages who are approached and meet the inclusion criteria are invited to participate in a survey and self-collected HR-HPV testing. Women not meeting the inclusion criteria or those unable to provide informed consent are excluded. Any women who consent to the survey but decline self-collected CCS are referred to a HCIV in Kigandalo and are included in the study population but are not included in the primary analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For arm 1, women will be recruited by a CHW going door-to-door. For arm 2, women will be recruited during a community health day meeting. Prior to the scheduled community health day meeting, CWHs will mobilize their own communities to attend the event by going door to door and by formally disclosing the planned activities to community leaders.

                <p id="Par44">The ASPIRE Mayuge trial includes two sequential intervention arms. In both arms, participants are offered a package of self-collected cervical cancer screening and education that is integrated into community-based primary health care services, but interventions differ primarily by the model of delivery: door-to-door vs community health day. Participants who test positive for HR-HPV types follow the same pathway to care regardless of intervention allocation (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for details). Standard VIA screening involves a practitioner applying 3–5% acetic acid to the cervix during a speculum exam. The practitioner then inspects and classifies lesions as positive, negative, or suspicious. Positive lesions are treated immediately with thermocoagulation. To align with the Ugandan Ministry of Health’s approach to CCS, in the ASPIRE trial all HR-HPV positive participants attending VIA follow-up are treated with thermocoagulation at an HCIII or HCIV, regardless of VIA result. Participants with suspicious lesions are referred to UCI for biopsy and Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or cancer treatment, if necessary. Transportation allowance is provided for participants to attend their follow-up visit. At the end of the intervention, a stakeholder meeting will be held to disseminate trial results.

                <p id="Par61">Cost and person-time data used for cost-effectiveness analysis is collected from the study’s financial records and by using customized survey tools completed at each health centre and through observations of both HPV and VIA screening during each study arm. An audit of the screening logs in each study designated health center is completed at the time of arm 1 recruitment start to estimate a cluster level measure of engagement in the VIA screening program prior to initiation of the study. Focus group discussions with participants who screen positive for HR-HPV and either complete or do not complete follow-up are conducted to evaluate the acceptability of screening and barriers and facilitators to engagement in care.</p>

                <p id="Par62">A customized data management tool was developed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Data is entered into the REDCap database by a trained data entry officer and reviewed monthly for completeness. A second reviewer (one of BAP, CA, or JT) randomly selects 10% of the data for independent data quality verification. A data monitoring committee was not established for this trial as no major safety concerns are expected. Furthermore, there are no interim analyses planned and no stopping role. Weekly meetings are held with CHWs to monitor community response and collect information on any adverse or other unintended effects of trial interventions or conduct. Auditing of trial conduct occurs every 3 months by BAP.</p>

                  <title>Primary objective</title>
                  <p id="Par63">Statistical analysis will be performed in R Statistical software using the clusterPower package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with an intention to treat approach. The primary outcome rate will be computed for each cluster and each study arm and ICCs calculated to assess cluster level variability prior to the primary analysis. The primary effectiveness measure will be compared between arms by estimating a mixed effect logistic regression model with cluster as a random intercept. The model will be adjusted for all known confounders at the individual and cluster level. There is no planned midpoint evaluation as no serious safety concerns are expected.</p>
                  <p id="Par64">Apparent prevalence of HPV and STIs will be estimated in the study regions using trial data. Population prevalence of CIN2+ will be estimated based on this apparent prevalence using the reported sensitivity and specificity of the GeneXpert HPV test for this disease status (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Diagnostic test characteristics for moderate and severe cervical lesions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>CIN2+</th><th>CIN3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sensitivity</td><td>90.8%(84.7–95.0%)</td><td>92.3%(84.8–96.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>Specificity</td><td>42.6%(38.5–46.9%)</td><td>40.0%(36.1–44.0%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par65">Secondary outcomes compared between arms will be estimated in a similar manner. The effect of each study arm on HPV incidence is estimated using a multi-level logistic regression model as per the primary analysis. The effect of each study arm on CCS knowledge and patient experience will be estimated using a multi-level Poisson model, adjusted for the same individual and cluster level confounders with the addition of HPV status as an individual compounder and with person-time in follow-up as an offset.</p>
                  <p id="Par66">Planned secondary analyses include estimating the group by arm interaction of HIV and other STI status on effectiveness of each CCS model. This will be done by adding an interaction term for each comorbidity and arm in the primary model. Temporal trends in HPV incidence and follow-up will be presented graphically.</p>

                <p id="Par67">Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be estimated using a societal perspective and including all health system and out of pocket costs incurred for women participants in each arm. A decision tree model will be developed based on the patient pathway through care (See Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) in each study arm and probabilities estimated along the pathway using study data. This decision tree will inform a validated Monte Carlo simulation of HPV data and cervical cancer incidence to compare health outcomes and costs associated with each study arm. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess uncertainty around cost estimates, and model inputs such as HR-HPV test sensitivity and specificity and disease progression rates. The primary outcome used will be incremental cost effectiveness ratio and percent reduction in lifetime cervical cancer risk compared between the two study arms.</p>
                <p id="Par68">Process evaluation will be performed using a study specific logic model framework to define inputs, activities and outcomes (See Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.). Process evaluation was informed by the RE-AIM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and will evaluate reach, acceptability, fidelity and adoption of the screening programs from the participants and health workers perspectives. This analysis will utilize process data collected during implementation of each arm, such as study logs and checklists along with qualitative focus group data and follow-up knowledge and experience survey data.

              <p id="Par70">The ASPIRE Mayuge trial will provide evidence on the best model of delivery for integrated self-collected cervical cancer screening and follow-up in a rural low-resource setting. According to Mayuge District’s Development Plan II, a lack of skilled human resources and infrastructure are the main health system-related challenges faced by the district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To meet the Sustainable Development Goals, the Ugandan Government has prioritized several areas including health infrastructure development and establishing a centre of excellence in cancer treatment and related services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Such investments will help facilitate the Ministry of Health’s strategic plan to expand access to cervical cancer screening by decentralizing screening and VIA to HCIII and providing follow-up care at level IV health centres and hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par71">This approach aligns with the World Health Organization’s efforts towards achieving elimination within the twenty-first century through three key target areas: increased coverage of vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV); increased screening coverage with an HPV test and appropriate management of women who have screened positive; and reduced mortality from cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ndejjo et al.’s study exploring the uptake of cervical cancer screening among 900 women in Eastern Uganda reveals low screening rates and several challenges to screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite participants having a high level of knowledge about cervical cancer and its risk factors, only 4.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 43) reported ever being screened, 3.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 16) of whom were from Mayuge district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Barriers to screening were characterized by behaviour-related challenges, for example, negative personal perceptions about screening, as well as health system-related challenges such as long wait times, costs, and distance to health facilities.</p>
              <p id="Par72">The major challenges of implementation in real-world global health settings are unsustainable reliance on foreign donors, and the lack of infrastructure, commodities, and human resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Models proposed in research studies that are entirely funded by foreign donors may not be realistic for scale-up in low resource settings. As a result, models that leverage existing infrastructure and resources, including task shifting to community health workers, need to be explored. Process and outcome evaluation findings from this pragmatic trial will add to the literature on the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of an integrated cervical cancer screening program, and strategies to improve follow-up among those who test positive for HR-HPV in a low-resource rural setting while characterizing the lived experience of participants, health-care providers, and CHWs. Furthermore, men play an important role in health-seeking behaviours, particularly in LMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and further understanding of the relationship between knowledge and screening could help guide screening protocols. Results from this study will inform the national scale-up of cervical cancer screening in Uganda, aligning with the World Health Organization’s target of achieving cervical cancer elimination through the pillar of increased HPV screening coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
