                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Two hundred and thirty-seven postmenopausal women (mean age, 59 yr) were randomized to receive creatine (0.14 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>) or placebo during a resistance training (3 d·wk<sup>−1</sup>) and walking (6 d·wk<sup>−1</sup>) program for 2 yr. Our primary outcome was the femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), with lumbar spine BMD and proximal femur geometric properties as the secondary outcomes.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Compared with placebo, creatine supplementation had no effect on BMD of the femoral neck (creatine: 0.725 ± 0.110 to 0.712 ± 0.100 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>; placebo: 0.721 ± 0.102 to 0.706 ± 0.097 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>), total hip (creatine: 0.879 ± 0.118 to 0.872 ± 0.114 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>; placebo: 0.881 ± 0.111 to 0.873 ± 0.109 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>), or lumbar spine (creatine: 0.932 ± 0.133 to 0.925 ± 0.131 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>; placebo: 0.923 ± 0.145 to 0.915 ± 0.143 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>). Creatine significantly maintained section modulus (1.35 ± 0.29 to 1.34 ± 0.26 vs 1.34 ± 0.25 to 1.28 ± 0.23 cm<sup>3</sup> (placebo), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0011), predictive of bone bending strength, and buckling ratio (10.8 ± 2.6 to 11.1 ± 2.2 vs 11.0 ± 2.6 to 11.6 ± 2.7 (placebo), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.011), predictive of reduced cortical bending under compressive loads, at the narrow part of the femoral neck. Creatine reduced walking time over 80 m (48.6 ± 5.6 to 47.1 ± 5.4 vs 48.3 ± 4.5 to 48.2 ± 4.9 s (placebo), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0008) but had no effect on muscular strength (i.e., one-repetition maximum) during bench press (32.1 ± 12.7 to 42.6 ± 14.1 vs 30.6 ± 10.9 to 41.4 ± 14 kg (placebo)) and hack squat (57.6 ± 21.6 to 84.4 ± 28.1 vs 56.6 ± 24.0 to 82.7 ± 25.0 kg (placebo)). In the subanalysis of valid completers, creatine increased lean tissue mass compared with placebo (40.8 ± 5.7 to 43.1 ± 5.9 vs 40.4 ± 5.3 to 42.0 ± 5.2 kg (placebo), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.046).</p>

                  <p>Two years of creatine supplementation and exercise in postmenopausal women had no effect on BMD; yet, it improved some bone geometric properties at the proximal femur.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Low bone mineral density (BMD), leading to osteoporosis, places a high burden on health care systems (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although exercise programs such as resistance training and walking have been shown effective for improving BMD (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), the short-term effects are small and may not be clinically relevant.</p>
            <p>Creatine is a nitrogen-containing compound synthesized in the kidneys and liver or consumed in the diet primarily from red meat and seafood (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). When creatine combines with phosphate (as phosphocreatine), it provides a source of energy for cells, including bone cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The addition of creatine to low serum cell culture medium increases the metabolic activity and differentiation of osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone formation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Creatine supplementation also reduces bone resorption (i.e., bone catabolism) in young boys with muscular dystrophy (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and in older men during a supervised resistance training program (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
            <p>We showed in a small preliminary study that creatine supplementation combined with supervised resistance training increased femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women, with the increase in BMD reaching levels that approached those thought to clinically reduce fracture risk (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The femoral neck is recognized as the most clinically relevant site, as there is significant trauma when it is fractured (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A 5% increase in BMD is predicted to reduce fracture risk by 25% (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our previous study indicated an approximate 3.4% preservation of BMD at the femoral neck in a small group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 33) of postmenopausal women over 1 yr of creatine supplementation during a supervised resistance training program (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); therefore, we hypothesized that a longer intervention (i.e., 2 yr) may be necessary to achieve a clinically significant increase in BMD.</p>
            <p>In addition to BMD, geometric properties of bone also affect bone strength. Geometric properties around the proximal femur, assessed using hip structural analysis, are good predictors for fracture (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We recently showed that femoral neck section modulus, a predictor of bone bending strength, tended to increase (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.061) in older men who supplemented with creatine during 1 yr of supervised resistance training (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We also demonstrated that geometric properties around other bone sites (i.e., cross-sectional area (CSA) of the tibia) were improved with creatine supplementation and supervised resistance training programs in older men and postmenopausal women (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
            <p>Our primary purpose was to determine whether creatine supplementation during a longer-term supervised resistance training and walking program (i.e., 2 yr) could improve BMD at the femoral neck in postmenopausal women. A secondary purpose was to determine the effects of creatine on BMD at the lumbar spine and on geometric properties at the proximal femur. We hypothesized that creatine supplementation would be beneficial for improving BMD and bone geometric properties.</p>

                <p>This two-site randomized controlled trial was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Boards at the University of Saskatchewan and University of Regina. Participants were informed of the risks and purposes of the study before written consent was obtained. The study complied with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki—Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. The trial was registered with <ext-link xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02047864).</p>
                <p>The study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, repeated measures design at two centers: the University of Saskatchewan and University of Regina. Participants were randomized using a computer-generated allocation schedule to one of two groups (on a 1/1 ratio) for a 2-yr intervention: group 1—creatine monohydrate supplementation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 120, 0.14 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> mixed with 0.14 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> maltodextrin) and supervised resistance training plus partially supervised walking; or group 2—placebo (control; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 117, 0.28 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> maltodextrin) and supervised resistance training plus partially supervised walking.</p>

                <title>Creatine supplementation</title>
                <p>Participants were provided with the supplement in plastic Ziploc bags and instructed to mix supplements with water. The creatine monohydrate supplement (Creapure; AlzChem AG, Trosberg, Germany) was verified for purity (Cary Co., Addison, IL) and determined to be 99.9% pure with minimal contaminants (i.e., 44 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> creatinine, 28 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> dicyandiamide, and below the limit of detection for dihydrotriazine). On the days when participants performed resistance training, half of the supplement was consumed postexercise (approximately 5 min) under research assistant supervision, and the other half was consumed with a meal. On rest days when participants did not visit the resistance training facility, they consumed one-third of the supplement with each meal. Compliance was monitored by completing a supplement tracking log. The dose we chose (0.14 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>) was slightly higher than that used in our previous study (0.10 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>) where we observed an increase in femoral neck BMD in a small group of postmenopausal women (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) because this smaller dose was ineffective for increasing lean tissue mass or muscular strength, indicating a possible anabolic resistance in postmenopausal women.</p>
                <p>All participants received a supplement of 500 mg of calcium and 10 μg (400 IU) of vitamin D per day to ensure that most participants were meeting Osteoporosis Society of Canada recommendations of 1200 mg·d<sup>−1</sup> for calcium and 20 μg·d<sup>−1</sup> for vitamin D (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
                <p>A research assistant at the University of Saskatchewan with no other role in the study performed a stratified block randomization using a computer-generated allocation schedule. Randomization was performed using a fixed block size of eight (using a permuted block design with a computer random number generator). Participants were stratified as either 1–9 yr after menopause or &gt;9 yr after menopause to account for differing rates of bone loss after menopause (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
                <p>The allocation sequence was concealed from other research assistants enrolling and assessing participants. Participants were given their allocated supplement after completing all baseline assessments. Participants, researchers, and those involved in outcome assessment or resistance training supervision were blinded to the group assignment. Another research assistant oversaw all data entry during which they remained blinded to group allocations by coding of groups. Statistical analyses were performed blinded (by coding of groups).</p>
                <p>Before codes were revealed at the end of the study, participants were surveyed to assess the effectiveness of blinding by asking if they thought they were on creatine or placebo.</p>

                <title>Exercise training</title>
                <p>Resistance exercises and brisk walking were performed in-lab and supervised 3 d·wk<sup>−1</sup>. An additional 3 d of nonsupervised brisk walking was performed outside of the laboratory.</p>
                <p>Exercises performed during resistance training included hack squat, hip abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension using a multihip machine, bench press, lat pull-down, shoulder press, hamstrings curl, quadriceps (knee) extension, biceps curl, triceps extension (presses), and back extension. Participants initially took part in a 2-wk familiarization process (two supervised sessions per week, 2 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise) where light resistance was used and proper form was emphasized. After the familiarization phase, participants took part in strength assessments and then enrolled in the resistance training program that involved two sets of eight repetitions for each exercise to muscular fatigue with 2-min rest between sets for each exercise at an intensity corresponding to a load equal to or &gt;80% one-repetition maximum (1RM) (i.e., 80% of their maximal strength, for the bench press and hack squat) or the maximal amount of weight that could be lifted eight times (i.e., 8RM). Resistance was progressively increased by 2–5 kg once a participant could complete two sets of eight repetitions for an exercise. All exercises were performed on plate-loaded or weight stack machines (Lever Fitness or Hammer Strength, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada).</p>
                <p>The walking program involved 20–30 min of brisk walking per session at an intensity corresponding to 70% of age-predicted maximum heart rate (220 − age). This duration was chosen as it would ensure participants were meeting the recommendations set by the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for Older Adults of approximately 150 min·wk<sup>−1</sup> of moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Participants were educated how to take a 15-s radial pulse count to ensure they were exercising at the proper intensity. Compliance was monitored by recording and tracking exercise in training logs.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from January 2014 to July 2016, and all had completed the intervention by January 2019. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) postmenopausal women (no menstrual period in the past 2 yr, determined by questionnaire—if a participant reported being &lt;2 yr postmenopausal, menopausal status was confirmed with blood testing for luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and 2) considered at “low” and “moderate” risk of fracture according to the Osteoporosis Canada guidelines (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) preexisting kidney or liver abnormalities (determined by blood and urine tests), 2) high risk of fragility fracture according to Osteoporosis Canada guidelines (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), 3) taking bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or creatine monohydrate in the past 12 months, 4) currently taking corticosteroids, or any medication that affects bone mineral metabolism, 5) severe osteoarthritis, Crohn’s disease, or Cushing disease, 6) planning to travel during the study for greater than a 2-wk duration at one time, and 7) currently involved in resistance training (&gt;20 min per session, more than twice per week). Participants were recruited via newspaper and e-mail advertisements and posters from the cities of Saskatoon and Regina, in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada.</p>

                <title>Outcome assessments</title>
                <p>All outcomes were assessed at baseline, at the end of year 1, and at the end of year 2. Falls and fractures were recorded for an additional year after completion of the study (i.e., 3 yr).</p>
                <p>Height and mass were measured by a standard stadiometer and a calibrated electronic scale.</p>
                <p>Measurements of outcomes from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry are described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, BMD of the proximal femur (i.e., femoral neck, trochanter, Ward’s area, and total hip), lumbar spine (L1–L4 vertebrae), and total body, and whole-body lean tissue mass (excluding bone) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in array mode (QDR Discovery Wi; Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MD) using QDR software for Windows XP (QDR Discovery). DXA scanners were identical at both university centers.</p>
                <p>Hip structural analysis (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) was used to assess geometric characteristics of the proximal femur using DXA at the narrowest part of the femoral neck, the intertrochanteric region, and the femoral shaft (i.e., 2 cm distal to the midpoint of the lesser trochanter). The following were assessed at each region: cortical thickness, subperiosteal width (SPW), bone CSA, which is equivalent to the cortical area, cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), section modulus (Z), and buckling ratio. Higher CSMI and Z are associated with strength of bone in bending, and higher buckling ratio is associated with susceptibility of cortical bending under compressive loads (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
                <p>Ultrasound (Sunlight, Omnisense, 7000S; BeamMed Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) was used at the distal radius and tibial shaft to assess bone speed of sound. A higher bone speed of sound predicts enhanced architectural arrangement of bone (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This assessment was only conducted at the University of Saskatchewan site (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 160), as it was the only site with the required equipment.</p>
                <p>Strength in the lower and upper body was assessed by determining 1RM during hack squat and bench press, respectively, with methods as previously described (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
                <p>Dynamic balance was measured as the time taken to perform backward tandem walking (i.e., toe to heel) over a distance of 6 m on a 10-cm-wide board that was raised 4 cm off the ground (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
                <p>Walking speed was assessed over an 80-m course, with the instructions to walk at a fast pace (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>

                <title>Uncontrolled intervention factors</title>
                <p>Dietary intake was assessed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (Block 98.2 FFQ; Block Dietary Data Systems, Berkeley, CA). After the questionnaires were filled out, they were then sent out for analysis (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nutritionquest.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.nutritionquest.com</ext-link>; Nutrition Quest, Berkeley, CA).</p>
                <p>Physical activity outside of study requirements was assessed using a Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
                <p>Fasting blood and urine analyses and 24-h urine analysis were completed at baseline, year 1, and year 2 to measure markers of kidney and liver function (e.g., creatinine clearance, urea, albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urine specific gravity, protein, and microalbumin) and complete blood counts. Blood was centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 10 min at 20°C. All blood and urine analyses were carried out on a fully automated random access analyzer for clinical chemistry (Cobas C 311; Roche Diagnostic, Mannhein, Germany) at the Royal University Hospital (Saskatoon) and at the Regina General Hospital. Resultant values were reviewed by our physician coinvestigators. Any values outside the normal reference range were considered an adverse event.</p>

                <title>Adverse events</title>
                <p>Adverse events were collected on adverse event forms each time participants were in contact with the researchers. These included a description of the adverse event, relationship to the intervention (not related, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definite), whether it was serious (i.e., resulted in death, life-threatening, required hospitalization, or resulted in persistent disability) or nonserious, and its intensity (mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening). We paid special attention to adverse events that might be a concern with creatine supplementation, such as kidney or liver adverse events, gastrointestinal problems, and muscle cramping. As a conservative approach to the safety of participants, we had physicians review adverse events, and they made decisions on whether to reduce the creatine/placebo dose based on potential kidney or liver-related adverse events (i.e., measurement of blood and/or urine parameters that might indicate liver/kidney problems).</p>

                <title>Statistics</title>
                <p>The sample size calculation was based on a clinically significant difference of 5% in BMD at the femoral neck, which was considered our primary outcome variable. This difference would be expected to reduce fracture risk by 25% (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Based on the results of our previous 1-yr study (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), we expected that a 2-yr intervention could elicit differences between creatine and placebo groups at a clinically significant level of 5%. Baseline femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women with similar exclusion criteria is about 0.739 g·cm<sup>−2</sup> with a standard deviation of 0.093 g·cm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A clinically significant difference of 5% would result in a BMD of 0.776 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>. Using these predicted values for placebo and creatine groups (i.e., 0.739 and 0.776 with an SD of 0.093 g·cm<sup>−2</sup>), an alpha of 0.05, and a power of 80%, required a sample size of 101 per group (i.e., 202 total). In a previous 2-yr exercise training study of postmenopausal women from our laboratory, 15% were lost to follow-up (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); therefore, we required approximately 120 per group or 240 postmenopausal women for this multisite randomized controlled trial.</p>
                <p>Reproducibility of all dependent variables was determined by repeated measures 3–7 d apart on 18 participants and expressed as percentage coefficient of variation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), intraclass correlation coefficient (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), standard error of the mean (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and minimal difference to be real (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The percentage of participants from each group with a beneficial or detrimental change that exceeded the minimal difference to be real is presented in each results table.</p>
                <p>All data were checked for outliers by first plotting variables at each time point in a scatter plot. Outlier data points were then checked to see if they were greater than 2.5× the median absolute difference (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and any outliers were replaced by imputed values (see hereafter, this accounted for &lt;0.2% of all data points). Baseline variables between groups were compared using independent samples <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests. Our primary analysis was on an intent-to-treat basis; that is, all participants who were randomized were included in their original groups for analysis irrespective of their compliance with the exercise program or supplement. Separate analyses were conducted including only participants who completed the entire intervention (i.e., valid-completers analysis) and for participants who were deemed to have been adequately compliant with the intervention. Adequate compliance was chosen as consuming 50% of the creatine supplement and attending 60% of the resistance training sessions. These cut-offs were chosen because this level of creatine supplementation (i.e., 50% of 0.14 g·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>) would approximate the daily amount that is usually recommended (i.e., 5 g·d<sup>−1</sup>), and the number of resistance training sessions (approximately 2 d·wk<sup>−1</sup>) is the amount recommended by physical activity guidelines for older adults (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Any missing data were assumed to be missing at random. This included data missing because of participants who were lost to follow-up (about 13% of all data points), outlier exclusion (&lt;1% of all data points), poor positioning during hip scans (for hip structural analyses) (&lt;1% of all data points), participants who missed testing appointments (1% of all data points), and participants who decided not to take part in fitness testing because of joint soreness (2% of data points for fitness testing variables). Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data for the intent-to-treat analyses (SPSS version 29, Chicago, IL). In order to protect against type I error, outcomes were grouped into “bone density” outcomes, “bone geometric” outcomes, and “fitness testing” outcomes, with each of these groups of variables analyzed by a 2 (group; i.e., creatine vs placebo) × 3 (time, i.e., baseline, year 1, year 2) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), with repeated measures on the “time” factor. If multivariate tests were significant, univariate tests, with Bonferroni <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> tests (to correct for multiple comparisons), were used to determine differences between groups across time points. Lean tissue mass, bone ultrasound outcomes, dietary variables, and physical activity levels outside of the program were assessed with a 2 (group) × 3 (time) ANOVA with Bonferroni <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> tests to determine differences between pairs of means. Compliance to the intervention and number of falls and fractures over 3 yr were assessed with a between-groups ANOVA. Proportion of participants who were able to correctly guess which group they were in, differences in adverse events between groups, and differences between groups for percentage of participants who exceeded the minimal differences to be real were assessed by chi-square analysis. All results are presented as mean ± SD. All MANOVAs or ANOVAs were run with Statistica 7.0 (Statsoft, Chicago, IL). Significance was accepted at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> ≤ 0.05.</p>

              <p>At baseline, the creatine group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 120) had an age (mean ± SD) of 59.0 ± 5.6 yr, body mass of 73.3 ± 14.9 kg, and height of 164 ± 6 cm with corresponding values for the placebo group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 117) of 59.0 ± 5.7 yr, 71.8 ± 14.2 kg, and 163 ± 6 cm, respectively. All other baseline variables are presented in Tables <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>–<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.

Bonferroni <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analyses indicated that in the placebo group, the narrow neck section modulus decreased from baseline to year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and from year 1 to year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), the narrow neck buckling ratio increased from baseline to year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), the femoral shaft cortical thickness decreased from baseline to year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the femoral shaft section modulus decreased from year 1 to year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Bonferroni <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analyses indicated that in the creatine group, femoral shaft SPW decreased from baseline to year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and femoral shaft buckling ratio decreased from baseline to year 1 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

Univariate tests indicated a significant group – time interaction for walking time (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0008).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The main finding from this randomized controlled trial was that creatine monohydrate supplementation during a resistance training and walking program over 2 yr had no effect on BMD at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine. There was variation across groups for percentages of participants who exceeded minimal differences to be real for changes in BMD in the compliers analysis (e.g., greater percentage of participants in the creatine group exceeding the minimal difference to be real for increases in total hip BMD, but also decreases in Wards and lumbar spine BMD; Supplemental Table 5, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857</ext-link>). However, creatine supplementation preserved a number of geometric properties at the proximal femur compared with placebo (i.e., sectional modulus and buckling ratio at the narrow part of the femoral neck, and cortical thickness, SPW, section modulus, and buckling ratio at the femoral shaft). The preservation of section modulus and cortical thickness (in comparison with the decrease in the placebo group) would preserve strength in bending and compression, respectively, whereas the increased buckling ratio in the placebo group indicates an increased susceptibility of cortical bending under compressive loads (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A decrease in SPW in the creatine group relative to the placebo group at the femoral shaft is also associated with reduced risk of fracture (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Differences between groups for percentage of participants exceeding minimal differences to be real supported a positive effect of creatine on geometric properties at the narrow part of the femoral neck and femoral shaft (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Supplemental Tables 3 and 6, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857</ext-link>) but not necessarily at the intertrochanteric region (Supplemental Tables 3 and 6, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857</ext-link>). Some differences at the intertrochanteric region indicated greater beneficial changes in the placebo group (e.g., cortical thickness, CSA, CSMI, and section modulus), and some indicated greater beneficial changes in the creatine group (e.g., SPW and buckling ratio) in the compliers analysis (Supplemental Table 6, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/MSS/C857</ext-link>). At the cellular level, creatine stimulates differentiation of osteoblasts (i.e., cells involved in bone formation) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but osteoclasts (cells involved in bone resorption) are also dependent on creatine kinase, the enzyme involved in breakdown of phosphocreatine (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and therefore might also be responsive to creatine supplementation. We speculate that perhaps creatine supplementation stimulates remodeling of bone (i.e., both formation and resorption) to alter geometric properties and whether formation or resorption predominates may depend on the location of bone in the proximal femur.</p>
              <p>The lack of an effect of creatine on BMD does not support our primary hypothesis, which was based on a smaller, shorter-duration study (i.e., 1 yr) in postmenopausal women, where we observed a significant preservation of BMD at the femoral neck with creatine compared with placebo during a supervised resistance training program (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Differences between studies are likely not due to the dose of creatine, as it was higher in the current study. Characteristics of the women were similar across studies, as was the resistance training program; therefore, the difference between studies is most likely due to the smaller sample size in our 1-yr study (and therefore a chance statistical finding) or perhaps to the higher compliance with the creatine supplement in the previous study (i.e., 79% vs 56% in the current study). A lack of an effect of creatine (20 g·d<sup>−1</sup> for 5 d, 5 g·d<sup>−1</sup> for 23 wk) during supervised resistance training on hip or lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women was also observed in a shorter-duration study (i.e., 6 months) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Smaller doses of creatine supplementation (1–3 g·d<sup>−1</sup> for 1–2 yr) without resistance training were also ineffective for improving BMD in postmenopausal women (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Collectively, creatine supplementation has a very minimal effect (if any) on BMD in postmenopausal women.</p>
              <p>In contrast to its lack of effect on BMD, creatine supplementation preserved several geometric measures at the proximal femur in comparison with placebo, which could improve compressive and bending strength of bone and reduce susceptibility to cortical buckling under compressive loads in the creatine compared with the placebo group (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Compared with placebo, creatine supplementation preserved section modulus and buckling ratio at the narrow part of the femoral neck, and cortical thickness, SPW, section modulus, and buckling ratio at the femoral shaft, all changes that are associated with decreased hip fracture risk in postmenopausal women (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The changes observed in our study are however most likely below the threshold for clinical prevention of fracture. For example, a 1 SD change in geometric properties such as femoral neck or shaft cortical thickness, section modulus, and buckling ratio is associated with significant changes in fracture risk in longitudinal assessment of older women (followed for approximately 13 yr) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our changes in these variables were much less than 1 SD, indicating that a longer duration of creatine supplementation would be necessary or that creatine supplementation may need to be combined with other therapies to significantly prevent fracture. In our smaller, shorter-term studies, we showed that 1 yr of creatine supplementation during supervised resistance training tended to increase (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.061) section modulus at the narrow part of the femoral neck in older men (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), we also found beneficial effects of creatine supplementation on bone geometry (i.e., increased total area of bone at the distal and shaft sections of the tibia) during a resistance training program in postmenopausal women and older men (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Mechanistically, creatine supplementation may activate cells involved in bone formation (i.e., osteoblasts) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) or may reduce bone resorption (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Creatine may especially be effective when combined with exercise because exercise stimulates creatine uptake into muscle (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), leading to increases in phosphocreatine stores, which stimulates adenosine triphosphate resynthesis during short-term, high-intensity exercise, such as resistance training. Creatine supplementation is therefore more effective for increasing lean tissue mass when combined with resistance training than creatine supplementation alone without training (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Increased lean mass may allow for increased mechanical stress on bone, stimulating a net bone formation, which may contribute to the improved geometric properties (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our study indicated a beneficial effect of creatine supplementation combined with supervised resistance training for increasing lean tissue mass (in the valid-completers analysis) and walking speed but no effect above resistance training alone for improving hack squat or bench press strength. Previous meta-analyses show creatine supplementation combined with resistance training is more effective than resistance training alone for improving lean tissue mass, strength (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and performance of functional tests (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) in older adults. Our previous study using pQCT indicated that creatine supplementation during supervised resistance training improved muscle quality (i.e., muscle density) of the lower limb (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which is predictive of performance of functional tasks (i.e., timed-up-and-go) in older women (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>); this may contribute to the enhanced walking speed with creatine supplementation in the current study. Our finding of increased walking speed agrees with a recent study in stroke survivors that found an improvement in 6-min walking distance from creatine supplementation and supervised resistance training (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The lack of change for strength measures with creatine supplementation in the current study may be due to the large beneficial effect of resistance training alone on muscular strength, which may mask any small improvement due to creatine supplementation. Our hack squat strength measure is quite variable; this could also account for the difficulty in detecting any small effect due to creatine supplementation. We included this exercise as part of our training program, instead of leg press, which has a lower coefficient of variation in older adults (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), because we believe it provides a more direct stimulus to the hip area to improve bone status. Our previous studies indicated a lack of effect of leg press training on hip bone mineral (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) but a beneficial effect of hack squat training perhaps because of more direct loading of the hip during the hack squat (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>An important aspect of our study was that a relatively large dose of creatine over 2 yr resulted in minimal adverse events, including markers of kidney and liver function. This agrees with previous studies of older women that had shorter duration and involved lower does (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Many of the kidney-related adverse events in the creatine group were due to elevated blood creatinine levels or lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is estimated using levels of blood creatinine. Because creatinine is a metabolic by-product of creatine degradation, it is not surprising that blood creatinine levels were sometimes elevated, and this may not indicate kidney problems (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p>
              <p>A limitation of our study was the relatively low compliance with the creatine and placebo supplements, low compliance to the exercise protocols, and high attrition rate. One contributing factor for the low compliance with the supplements was the conservative approach we took when dealing with kidney or liver adverse events. For example, if a participant experienced blood or urine markers of kidney or liver dysfunction outside the normal reference range, their supplement dosage was reduced.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>In summary, 2 yr of creatine supplementation during a resistance training and walking program in postmenopausal women had no beneficial effects on BMD yet resulted in several improvements in bone geometry at the proximal femur (i.e., increased cortical thickness and section modulus, and reduced SPW and buckling ratio). These changes may be protective against hip fracture. Longer-term follow-up with larger sample sizes would be needed to confirm protection against hip fracture with creatine supplementation.</p>
