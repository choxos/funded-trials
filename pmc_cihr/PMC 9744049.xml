                  <p id="Par3">The study employed a pre-post intervention randomized controlled trial design with three groups: control (no coach, no devices), coach only, and coach + devices. Participants were 163 adults living in British Columbia, Canada, aged 65 to 98 years, with one or more chronic health conditions and access to a computer and Wi-Fi. Responses on five questionnaires assessed health outcomes pre- and post-intervention: Self-Efficacy Scale, PHQ-9, Medical Care, Patient Activation Measure and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 Questionnaire.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">Compared with the control group (no coach, no devices), participants with a coach reported decreased depression, higher activation levels and energy levels, and better handling of role limitations due to physical health, social functioning, and communication with their physician. Participants with coaches and devices showed similar improvements on these measures with further decreases in depression severity as well as improved self-efficacy, better handling of role limitations due to emotional problems, higher level of emotional well-being and general health ratings, and lower pain.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par11">Chronic pain, restricted mobility, and depressive feelings and emotions all take a toll on patients’ quality of life and health outcomes as well as the broader health care system in terms of possibly reducing hospitalization rates and associated costs. Increased ability to manage these problems, therefore, clearly has many broad benefits for individuals and society. During the past decade, research studies have consistently found that individual management and outcomes of chronic disease are enhanced through the use of peer and professionally-led self-management education (Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>; Chrvala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>; Brady et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Using another model, telephone peer coaching, clinicians, and peers have also demonstrated effectiveness in bringing about improved outcomes (Gagliardino et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; McGowan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>; Thom et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Walker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>; Wolever et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>). Peer coaching has been shown to be effective with several health conditions. A review (Elstad et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>) of 47 papers from eight countries that looked at pre/post-natal care, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, HIV, smoking cessation, mental health, and drug use reported that 83% of the studies reported significant between-group or pre-post changes showing benefits of peer support, across different age demographics.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Recently, with the advent of smart technology, the use of home-based electronic devices is becoming popular; however, digital medicine is a young field, and little of the research focuses on older adults with chronic illnesses (Denton &amp; Spencer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). The present study was conducted as part of a larger initiative of expanding digital medicine and bridging peer coaching programs with the electronic assistance aimed to assess the impacts of peer coaching, with and without the additional use of electronic devices, on a number of outcome measures in older adults experiencing chronic health conditions. A randomized controlled trial design was used to evaluate whether integrated electronic home monitoring improved health outcomes and self-management over and above only using the Self-Management Telephone Health Coach Program. This program is a free, individualized telephone program comprised of weekly 30-min calls between a participant and a trained peer self-management coach. Coaches telephone their assigned participants once a week for 12 consecutive weeks and inquire how they are managing their chronic conditions, medications, and other general life challenges. When participants identify a problem, coaches assist them in following problem-solving steps to select an action to take to resolve it. Coaches then encourage and assist participants to develop an “action plan” to complete the activity during the following week.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par13">The target population of the research was older adults with one or more chronic conditions, living in their own homes and having access to the internet and Wi-Fi. Government Health data was used to estimate that 125,805 older persons lived in this geographic area.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Several methods were used to recruit participants from this target population, including newspaper ads, posters, and flyers; radio and internet; in-person and virtual presentations to older person groups and health professionals; and collaborations with community organizations that provided coordination and assistance to older people. Persons who met the inclusion criteria (e.g., hearing, comprehension, etc.) completed a Study Consent Form and a questionnaire which served as the baseline assessment for data analyses. When the consent form and questionnaire were returned, persons were randomized to one of three study groups.</p>
                <p id="Par15">One hundred ninety-three participants were recruited to the study and assigned to one of three groups, a control group and two treatment groups (coach only and coach + devices), using a blocked randomization technique (Efird, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). This randomization method maximizes the similarity of the three groups with regard to known and unknown factors while keeping the group sizes equal at baseline. Furthermore, in longitudinal studies, randomly assigning participants across the different treatment groups as they enter the study is also desirable as this controls for external factors such as seasons/weather and historical factors (e.g., changes in government policies) that may potentially and inadvertently impact the key outcome measures. In our case, this was particularly fortuitous because the COVID-19 pandemic hit about halfway through recruitment into our study. Furthermore, we chose larger blocks of participants (blocks of 15) and pseudo-randomized the orders of assignment to always assign participants to the two treatment groups that use trained peer coaches first, to maximize the coaches’ availability and maintain their interest in the study.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Persons randomized to the control group received a participant book entitled <italic>Living a Healthy Life with Chronic Conditions</italic> (Lorig et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>) or <italic>Living a Healthy Life with Chronic Pain</italic> (LeFort et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) and were placed on a 3-month waitlist to receive a coach. Members of this group completed the questionnaire again 3 months later and received a $25 honorarium each time they completed the questionnaire.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Participants randomized to the coach-only group also received a participant book and were paired with a coach. Participants and coaches were matched based on background collected for eligibility. In this group, coaches telephoned participants and conversed for approximately 30 min weekly for a period of 3 months. Participants in this group also completed the questionnaire again 3 months after baseline, and received a $25 honorarium.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Participants randomized to the coach + devices group received the participant book and were matched with a coach, similar to the process used in the coach-only group. Each person also received three assistive devices, namely (a) a steel wrist-worn watch which collects physical activity and sleep data; (b) Body+ Scale, a scale which tracks weight, heart rate, body composition (such as bone density), and environmental data (such as weather and air quality); and (c) Nokia Sleep, a sleep-tracking pad that is installed underneath the participant’s mattress that tracks sleep cycles (deep, light, REM), sleep onset and duration, and sonority quality and provides an overall sleep quality score. Data collected by the devices is sent via Bluetooth Low Energy to a Health Mate app downloaded onto a smartphone or tablet computer.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Before the COVID interruption (prior to March 2020), the devices were installed by the devices coordinator who visited participants in their homes. After August 2020, when the study resumed following a 5-month recruitment stoppage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, devices were installed in participants’ homes through telephone and online communication between the devices coordinator and participant. Participants in this coach + devices group also completed the questionnaire again 3 months after their baseline assessment, and received a $25 honorarium.</p>

                <p id="Par20">Coach recruitment included advertising in newsletters, websites and community newspapers, posters, and brochures. Interested candidates were registered into a 2-day coach-training workshop. Each trainee received a copy of the Self-Management Health Coach Program Coach Manual (Self-Management BC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). In the training, coaching role, expectation, commitment, and core functions were explained and trainees practiced key self-management strategies, namely problem solving and action planning. Basic and complex scenarios were used to generate resolution of difficult situations. The training concluded with a review of self-compassion; effective communication techniques; a review of information in participants’ books; key community resources; potential coaching challenges; personal safety; a Coach Code of Conduct; and Key Points for Self-Management Health Coaching.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Twelve in-person workshops were delivered prior to March 2020 which trained 82 coaches. Because of COVID, participant recruitment discontinued for approximately 5 months mainly because the devices coordinator was unable to enter participants’ homes. Following the re-start in August, three additional sessions which trained 14 new coaches were delivered through virtual 2-day webinars. In total, 96 persons completed the coach training.</p>

The first regularly scheduled coach-participant phone call was scheduled by the coach coordinator. Weekly phone calls lasted a minimum of 30 min. During the 3-month intervention, either the coach coordinator or project lead called coaches three times to provide support, problem solve, and ensure program fidelity. These calls addressed difficulties coaches had getting their participants to describe problems managing their condition(s) and their medications, in their home and family environment, and in making weekly action plans describing the steps they would take to solve the problem. Coaches received an honorarium of $72 at the end of the 3 months of the study.</p>

                <p id="Par32">Four sets of analyses were conducted. First, to ensure that the randomization worked and the three groups were equivalent at baseline, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on all demographic variables and baseline outcome measures.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Second, to assess whether the device installation may have had an impact on the outcome measures, participants in the coach + devices group were split into groups based on when they enrolled in the study, either prior to the COVID shutdown (prior to March 2020) or after (August to December 2020). A set of 2 × 2 mixed-factorial ANOVAs was conducted on all outcome measures, with each pre/post outcome measure as the repeated-measures factor and the two subgroups of this group as the between-subjects factor. Although not planned for, the overall potential impact of the COVID shutdown on the outcome measures was also examined in the whole baseline sample.</p>
                <p id="Par34">The third set of analyses looked at the pre- versus post-treatment scores on each outcome measure across the three groups. A 2 × 3 mixed-factorial ANOVA was conducted to test for a statistically significant interaction effect with larger pre- to post-test changes expected in the coach-only and coach + devices groups. Because the outcome measures intend to assess different aspects of the participants’ experience, and to retain statistical power to detect group differences and reduce type II error, the ANOVA <italic>F</italic> test for each outcome measure was conducted at the 0.05 level of statistical significance. Significant interactions were followed up with post hoc <italic>t</italic> tests to compare the two treatment groups with the control group and to each other, using Bonferroni correction for type I error for two-sided familywise error at .05.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The final set of analyses examined the potential influences of four covariates on the outcome measures. Sex was included as a factor in a 3-way ANOVA, with study group and sex as between-subjects factors. Age (in years), number of health conditions, and years of education were included in repeated-measures general linear models as continuous predictors (analyses of covariance). All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.</p>

The second covariate was age and it seemed to influence social functioning; there was no correlation of age with social functioning at baseline (<italic>b</italic> = − .069, <italic>p</italic> = 0.831), but there did appear to be a positive weak relationship of social functioning with age at the conclusion of the study (<italic>b</italic> = .635, <italic>p</italic> = 0.063), such that older participants across all three groups were more likely to be engaged socially at the end of the study (could also be a type I error).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par49">The study’s participant randomization process was effective in that there were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics among the groups and there was only one difference in the social functioning subscale score of the Rand 36-item Health Survey Questionnaire at baseline. Furthermore, within the control group, participants’ scores on the outcome measures did not change statistically significantly during the intervention time interval on any of the outcome measures, indicating that any observed changes in outcomes for the two intervention groups are unlikely due to confounding variables due to time. Despite our best efforts in conducting this randomized control pre-post-test study, its limitations include differential dropout rates across the three intervention groups and the sudden appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic midway through.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Thirty persons withdrew from the study with an equal proportion withdrawing before and during COVID. Subjects who withdrew differed from those who stayed with respect to their language being non-English, having fewer chronic health conditions, and scoring lower on the SF-36 Social subscale, and marginally lower on health literacy, ability to read hospital materials, having problems learning about their medical condition and in their confidence filling out forms (likely due to the language issue). A majority of dropouts were from the coach + devices group, with almost half of these reporting they found the devices difficult to use. This differential dropout rate for the group with the devices was a study limitation that future research can take into account, and perhaps explore individual difference factors, such as familiarity and comfort with new devices, which likely play a role in using the devices for enhancing health outcomes effectively.</p>
              <p id="Par51">The impact of the COVID shutdown was seen on six of the outcome measures. Participants who enrolled after the shutdown reported fewer doctor visits and fewer trips to the emergency department in the prior 3 months, not surprising as this was mandated by the health officials at the start of the pandemic. This group also had higher baseline scores on four of the eight Health Survey subscales, namely physical functioning; role limitation due to physical health; social functioning; and general health. It is interesting that older adults who felt stronger physically, but did not differ in terms of the more emotional subscales (role limitation due to emotional problems, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, and pain), were more likely to be recruited during the pandemic. Exploring this observation, however, is beyond the scope of this study. Finally, and luckily, the method of device installation (i.e., in person by study personnel vs. by telephone instructions) that was required by the COVID shutdown did not impact the outcome scores and changes in the outcome measures for participants in the coach + devices group.</p>
              <p id="Par52">In terms of the main hypotheses of the study, several results stand out. Compared with the control group, participants who worked with a coach (only) reported decreased depression, higher activation levels, better handling of role limitations due to physical health, higher energy levels, better social functioning, and better communication with their physician. Participants who had devices along with a coach showed similar improvements on all of these measures, with even larger decreases in depression severity. In addition, participants with devices also improved in terms of their self-efficacy, better handling of role limitations due to emotional problems, higher level of emotional well-being, lower pain, and higher general health ratings. None of the covariates tested—sex, age, education level, and number of chronic conditions—contributed to the differences in outcome measures, which is consistent with the findings of another study on the effectiveness of peer coaches (McGowan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par53">Overall, participants who worked with a coach for the 3-month intervention, with or without devices, experienced improvements in several outcomes, providing evidence that the 3-month intervention works. It remains unclear, however, how the use of the three assistive devices impacted the outcome measures; that remains beyond the scope of this work. The same coaching intervention was used for both study groups, but participants in the group which also had devices had improvements on more outcome measures than the group without devices. Studies that have examined the causal link between peer coaching and outcomes have found that coaches provide practical assistance to achieve and sustain complex behaviours (Brownson &amp; Heisler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>); help people access and navigate clinical care and community resources (Rees &amp; Williams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>); and help people address complex multi-morbidities, serving as a bridge between primary and behavioural health (Colella &amp; King, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>; Dunn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>; Fisher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>). A possible explanation in this study may be that using the devices assisted persons to monitor and achieve their weekly goals, and achievement of weekly goals leads to the development of even higher levels of self-efficacy. An additional analysis will be conducted by the study Co-PI to investigate the relationship of the data collected by the three devices to outcome measure results.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par54">By employing a RCT design, the current study has advanced the understanding of the effectiveness of peer health coaches assisting older persons with chronic health conditions and that including assistive devices may provide additional benefits. Future research involving assistive devices and peer health coaches would benefit by having a devices-only group and a qualitative component to bring understanding to the relative and potentially different experiences of using assistive devices and/or being involved with a peer health coach.</p>
