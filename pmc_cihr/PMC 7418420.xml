                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Kidney failure requiring dialysis is associated with poor health outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) capture symptom burden, level of functioning and other outcomes from a patient perspective, and can support clinicians to monitor disease progression, address symptoms, and facilitate patient-centered care. While evidence suggests the use of PROMs in clinical practice can lead to improved patient experience in some settings, the impact on patients’ health outcomes and experiences is not fully understood, and their cost-effectiveness in clinical settings is unknown. This study aims to fill these gaps by evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routinely measuring PROMs on patient-reported experience, clinical outcomes, HRQL, and healthcare utilization.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The EMPATHY trial is a pragmatic multi-centre cluster randomized controlled trial that will implement and evaluate the use of disease-specific and generic PROMs in three kidney care programs in Canada. In-centre hemodialysis units will be randomized into four groups, whereby patients: 1) complete a disease-specific PROM; 2) complete a generic PROM; 3) complete both types of PROMs; 4) receive usual care and do not complete any PROMs. While clinical care pathways are available to all hemodialysis units in the study, for the three active intervention groups, the results of the PROMs will be linked to treatment aids for clinicians and patients. The primary outcome of this study is patient-provider communication, assessed by the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT). Secondary outcomes include patient management and symptoms, use of healthcare services, and the costs of implementing this intervention will also be estimated. The present protocol fulfilled the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) checklist.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">While using PROMs in clinical practice is supported by theory and rationale, and may engage patients and enhance their role in decisions regarding their care and outcomes, the best approach of their use is still uncertain. It is important to rigorously evaluate such interventions and investments to ensure they provide value for patients and health systems.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">At the end of 2018 there were over 40,000 Canadians with kidney failure requiring dialysis; a 35% increase from the previous decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Kidney failure requiring dialysis is associated with high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life (HRQL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients can experience a wide variety of symptoms ranging from physical to psychological in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These symptoms are often under-recognized by kidney care teams, which may be related to breakdown in communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a recent priority setting exercise, the top research priority for patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis in Canada was to enhance communication between patients and clinicians to maximize patient participation in decision making and facilitate self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, five of the top 10 research priorities for patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis focus on reducing symptoms and improving HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">The priorities of enhancing communication and improving symptoms and HRQL are potentially well aligned. In other chronic diseases, the incorporation of routinely measuring and reporting symptoms and HRQL improved communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Without routine symptom monitoring, this situation is unlikely to change. Further, the presence and severity of symptoms can change considerably over a short period of time in dialysis patients, emphasizing the need for regular surveillance of symptoms. Incorporation of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) into dialysis care could address this problem.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>What are PROMs?</title>
                <p id="Par24">PROMs are reports coming directly from patients about how they function or feel in relation to a health condition and its therapy, without interpretation of the patient’s responses by a clinician or anyone else [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PROMs present an opportunity to explore aspects of patients’ health that may otherwise be overlooked. They capture patients’ experiences of symptoms and impact of disease on functioning and can support clinicians to monitor disease progression and facilitate patient-centered care. It is proposed that PROMs could act to improve the quality of care in the same way as any other benchmarking tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and some suggest that PROMs have the potential to transform healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There has been an increased use of PROMs in health systems around the world, a movement initiated and led by the National Health System (NHS) in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and the Alberta PROMs and EQ-5D Research and Support Unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] are leading similar efforts to establish provincial and national PROMs strategies and support the use of PROMs in the Canadian healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>PROMs in clinical practice</title>
                <p id="Par25">Although PROMs have become widely used in clinical effectiveness research, their usefulness in clinical settings is still unclear. In the clinical context, ideally PROMs results would be fed back to clinicians who would use that information to improve patient care, much like routine clinical laboratory measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, since PROMs were generally not developed or applied for this purpose, little is known about how they perform in this context. A limited number of randomized controlled trials have examined the impact of using PROMs in clinical practice, particularly in oncology, and found that the routine measurement of PROMs, followed by reporting of results to clinicians and patients, had a positive impact on patient-provider communication, patient satisfaction with care, and HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, the periodic monitoring and discussion of PROMs led to improvement in psychosocial wellbeing, however, this benefit was not sustained after the completion of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In patients with gastrointestinal disorders, the one-time use of a disease-specific PROM had no impact on patient satisfaction, provider interpersonal skills, or shared decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">Systematic reviews of these clinical trials and others suggest that feedback of PROMs to clinicians have an impact on processes of care, may enhance patient-provider relationship, improve communication, and support shared decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; however, their impact on health outcomes is less apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Aside from these limited controlled studies examining the clinical effectiveness of PROMs themselves as an intervention, few studies have examined their value and cost-effectiveness to justify their use in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">Additionally, qualitative studies that explored practical issues surrounding the implementation of PROMs in clinical practice found that demonstrating clinical utility to clinicians is a key factor for successful and effective implementation of PROMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Other factors identified include the use of technology, having the appropriate infrastructure in place, embedding PROMs into routine workflow, improving the interpretability of PROMs data, and engaging clinicians in the planning phase of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Finally, a key element identified by clinicians is the linkage of PROMs with tools to support the clinical management of symptoms or problems identified by assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For example, if a patient identifies problems with anxiety or depression, clinicians should have readily available treatment protocols to follow to alleviate those symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although the current evidence on the impact of PROMs on patient outcomes is relatively limited and has several methodological limitations, it generally suggests that the effectiveness of PROMs depends on the function of the PROM and the type of feedback provided.</p>
                <p id="Par28">PROMs can be generic or disease-specific, and each has several advantages and disadvantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Generic measures are used to compare outcomes across different populations and interventions, particularly for cost-effectiveness studies and health system decision-makers. Disease-specific measures assess the health status of a specific patient population and may be more sensitive for the detection and quantification of changes that are important to clinicians or patients. A common recommendation in clinical research with PROMs is to combine both a generic and a disease-specific measure for use in a particular patient population, especially when PROMs are used to monitor health and how it changes over time. The presumed benefit of this combination is to broaden the scope of measurement and allow for different uses of the measures (e.g., comparison within versus across disease populations). However, evidence to support this recommendation is limited. In fact, in a study examining the usefulness of generic and disease-specific measures of health status in patients with Alzheimer’s, the EQ-5D (a generic measure) was found to be a suitable alternative to a disease-specific measure of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Another study reported that generic and disease-specific measures performed similarly in assessing changes in HRQL in patients with kidney failure requiring hemodialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There is usually some level of overlap between generic and disease-specific measures, and the need for combining both types of measures depends on the target patient population and the constructs assessed by each measure. Given the workload associated with collecting and using PROM data in clinical settings, it is imperative to explore whether one single PROM is sufficient to improve patient-provider communication, processes of care, and ultimately patient outcomes, before recommending the use of a combination of generic and disease-specific measures.</p>

                <title>Justification for PROMs in dialysis care</title>
                <p id="Par29">One of the key areas where PROMs have been implemented is in patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high in Canada (12.5% or 3 million Canadian adults) and its advanced stages can lead to kidney failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Kidney failure requiring dialysis is expensive and is associated with poor health outcomes and HRQL. To report symptom burden and HRQL alongside clinical and laboratory measures, it is imperative to measure and report what is important to patients. PROMs could be used to evaluate and monitor patients’ health, inform care planning, and facilitate the introduction of treatments for patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">Moreover, the implementation of PROMs assessments and integration into the workflow of a busy clinical setting such as dialysis clinics requires a feasible system to capture and report PROMs. This would be facilitated by the development of PROM report cards to present results to clinicians and patients in a manner that is easily understood and interpretable, analogous to clinical laboratory measures used in the hemodialysis setting. We believe that routine hemodialysis care provides the ideal setting for implementation and rigorous evaluation of a PROM intervention, and as such, we are conducting a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a PROMs intervention. Our comprehensive evaluation will assess the effectiveness of this intervention, the adoption and implementation in the busy clinical setting of hemodialysis units, as well as the cost-effectiveness of PROMs in routine hemodialysis care.</p>

              <p id="Par31">The overall aim of this study is to explore the usefulness of integrating PROM assessments in the clinical management of hemodialysis patients. Specifically, the primary objective is to determine the effects of routine measurement and reporting to clinicians of PROMs, namely, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System- revised: Renal (ESAS-r: Renal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], or the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale – Renal (IPOS-Renal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and/or the EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] on patient-reported experience, particularly patient-clinician communication, measured by the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT), for patients with kidney failure requiring hemodialysis.

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par38">To date, the effect of PROMs on patient outcomes were generally assessed in conventional parallel-group RCTs of individuals. Few convincingly demonstrated benefits to patient-important outcomes, which might be in part due to contamination effects and small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This study uses a cluster RCT design, with clustering occurring at the level of individual hemodialysis units, to reduce potential contamination between the study groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). EMPATHY is an open-label RCT, since blinding is not feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Consequently, research staff, clinicians, and all patients are aware of group allocation. Dialysis units, stratified by three regions (Northern Alberta, Southern Alberta, and Ontario), were randomly allocated using random number sequences with all units from a region randomized on the same day. Dialysis units were allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into four groups:

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par43">Groups 1–3 will collect their allocated PROM(s) from all eligible patients every 2 months, for 12 months (a total of 7 assessments). PROMs are administered by pen and paper or through an electronic platform on a tablet in accordance with hemodialysis unit resources. In Alberta, the electronic medical records (EMRs) generate a PROM report card with a symbol scheme for nurses to follow up with clinical management where applicable. The symbol scheme comprises of a check mark for no problems/symptoms (ESAS-r: Renal = 0, IPOS-Renal = 0, EQ-5D-5L = 1) a caution sign for mild problems/symptoms (ESAS-r: Renal = 1–3, IPOS-Renal = 1, EQ-5D-5L = 2) and a stop sign for moderate-severe symptoms/problems (ESAS-r: Renal = 4–10, IPOS-Renal = 2–4, EQ-5D-5L = 3–5). The PROM report card is printed and added to the patient’s medical chart for review by clinicians (i.e., nurses, nephrologists, and allied health professionals). The report displays each patient’s most recent PROM scores in comparison with their previous scores, much like lab test results. A sample PROM report card is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In Ontario, EMRs do not have report card capabilities and units store the paper-completed PROM questionnaires in the patient’s medical chart, along with previously completed questionnaires for review by clinicians and the patient. In all locations, PROMs are accompanied by treatment aids for some symptoms assessed (pain, pruritus, restless legs, sleeping problems, tiredness, nausea, shortness of breath, anxiety, and depression). Patients are also offered a copy of their PROM report card (if possible) and patient-facing self-management guides for symptom management. This trial is intended to generate evidence on the implementation within the health systems. While we will aim to maintain the study design and key elements of the intervention as consistently as possible, we will allow for the interventions to be tailored to local health systems, accommodating considerations such as the clinical work flow, information systems and capabilities, and internet/WiFi access (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Our intention was to enroll all eligible dialysis units within the province of Alberta, and a sample of eligible units in Ontario. Therefore, we did not calculate an optimal sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance. From 44 dialysis units, we will be utilizing data from approximately 3000 patients. Based on an estimated intraclass correlation of 0.1 and a standard deviation for the CAT (primary outcome measure) of 0.74 (based on pilot data from HD patients in Alberta), this will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.23 with a two-tailed test at typical level of significance, α = 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. While this is a small effect size for the primary outcome, we are nonetheless confident in the design, given that this is a pragmatic quality improvement study, involving 44 dialysis units from three renal programs with several secondary objectives related to patient experience and outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par70">The primary analysis will assess change in the overall CAT score, between study groups from baseline to 12 months using a linear mixed effects model, with the mean CAT for the dialysis unit at baseline as a fixed effect covariate, and dialysis unit (cluster) as a random intercept. Ideally, analysis should use individual patients’ baseline CAT and follow-up CAT rather than the unit mean baseline CAT to compute change over time. However, due to concerns by the regional renal programs to maintain anonymity of experience data as well as the natural drop-in and drop-out of patients in the dialysis units due to patient deaths and initiation of new patients onto dialysis, individual CAT surveys were made completely anonymous. As such, our primary analytic plan will be based on changes in mean CAT score at the unit level, from baseline to 12 months. The primary analysis will be based on all of the PROMs intervention groups combined compared to the control (no PROMs intervention) group as fixed effects. Any units that drop-out after randomization but prior to initial data collection will be excluded. We will employ last observation carried forward methods to impute missing data where appropriate. As one of our secondary objectives, assessing differences between specific and generic PROMs, we will compare the individual interventions groups (i.e., ESAS-r: Renal /IPOS alone, EQ-5D-5D alone, or the combination) to the control group.</p>
                <p id="Par71">As part of our secondary analyses, we will also compare the proportion of patients reporting symptoms/problems on the ESAS-r: Renal or IPOS-Renal and EQ-5D-5L and the management of such symptoms/problems. Through clinical records, we will link PROMs scores with the use of specific symptomatic treatments as per the treatment aids. We will obtain medication lists, allied health referrals, and chart notes to capture how symptoms are being treated. Because the PROMs data will be collected as part of the clinical record, and linked with individual patient-level data, we will be able to analyze these data using logistic mixed-effects regression models adjusting for individual patient-level covariates. Each renal program (i.e., AKC-N, AKC-S and ORN) will be analyzed separately then we will use meta-analyses to analyze the data from each renal program.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par80">The evaluation of PROM interventions such as those described in this protocol can be challenging given the nature of clinical practice in busy hemodialysis units, the variations in organization and clinical workflow across units, as well as regional programs. We will study the implementation of PROM interventions in real-world health settings. Thus, we will adopt a pragmatic approach and accept the necessary variations in implementation, while attempting to retain as many of the core elements of the interventions across the programs. Furthermore, given the desire to maintain anonymity of patient-reported experience, our primary analytic strategy will be limited to comparison of the outcome measures at the group level. These pragmatic approaches to the design of this implementation study limit the rigour of the evaluation of the efficacy of PROM interventions, but on the other hand, enhance our evaluation of real-world effectiveness. Along with the planned qualitative assessments, the information gained from this implementation trial will provide valuable information for the regional dialysis programs in enhancing and sustaining the PROM interventions in the most appropriate manner.</p>
              <p id="Par81">A question that is often raised with the implementation of PROM programs is the choice of the measures. We are choosing to implement a combination of specific and generic measures. While a secondary objective is to compare these types of measures, it is possible that the differences (e.g., breadth or scope) between measures matter less than either approach simply serving as a mechanism for engaging patients and clinicians in a more focused discussion on symptoms or problems. This is the intention with our primary analytic strategy of combining the intervention groups to compare against the control group with no PROM intervention. There may be other reasons, beyond the patient-clinician interaction, however, that guide decisions on the choice of measures. For example, programs may be interested in evaluating the overall quality and efficiency of services, and may therefore be interested in a measure that provide data to support economic evaluation. In this case a generic preference-based measure such as the EQ-5D provides an overall index score compatible with that purpose, which may not be available with measures assessing symptom burden.</p>
              <p id="Par82">A further question faced by clinical programs is the choice of any particular measure for either generic or specific health status. Indeed, within our trial protocol, we will have two different instruments assessing symptom burden. The ESAS-r: Renal will be used in AKC-North and the ORN, based on previous use of this measure in dialysis and other programs locally and across Canada; the IPOS will be implemented in AKC-South, where there was no previous PROM collection, and as a choice informed by regional patient engagement. Similarly, we chose to use the EQ-5D-5L as a generic measure, which was recommended for this patient population in a review paper that was available at the time we planned our interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. A more recent review of measurement properties for PROMs for adults with chronic kidney disease recommends the KDQOL-SF or KDQOL-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The authors note, however, that the available evidence for the reliability and validity of these measures is limited, calling for further research to close this information gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Nonetheless, as we noted earlier, it may be that subtle differences between measures matter less than implementing any measure and linking these with actionable clinical pathways to alleviate bothersome symptoms and improve patients’ well-being.</p>
              <p id="Par83">Incorporating PROMs into clinical practice seems like an entirely appropriate strategy to engage patients and enhance their role in decisions regarding their care and outcomes. However, how this is best done is uncertain and requires a substantial allocation of healthcare resources. It is important to rigorously evaluate such interventions and investments to ensure they provide value for patients and health systems. The results of this trial will guide the use of PROMs in Alberta and Ontario dialysis units. These results will also inform the use of PROMs in routine dialysis care nationally and internationally and potentially for the care of other chronic disease patient populations. Dissemination of findings will be undertaken through meetings, reports, academic papers, and conference presentations.</p>

              <title>Funding</title>
              <p>EMPATHY was independently peer-reviewed and funded by Can-SOLVE CKD Network, supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research under Canada’s Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (reference #SCA-145103). This large network supports a large number of research projects, including the EMPATHY Trial and provides basic infrastructure and resources. The EuroQol Research Foundation provided funding for the qualitative sub-study undertaken in AKC-N through the University of Alberta; the Kidney Foundation of Canada provided funding for the qualitative sub-study undertaken in AKC-S through the University of Calgary.</p>

              <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
              <p id="Par84">Ethics approvals for the study were granted from all required institutions, including the University of Alberta (Health Research Ethics Board Pro00077850) and the University of Calgary (Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board REB18–0672). The ORN received ethics approvals from various regional authorities including Timmins and District Hospital Ethics and Research Committee, Bluewater Health Research Ethics Committee (2019-RES-01), Halton Healthcare Research Ethics Board, Joint Group Health Centre/Sault Area Hospital Research Ethics Board (2019-12-02), and Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (1717). All ethics review boards approved the study to be conducted under a waiver of consent. This was considered appropriate because PROM collection was occurring already, or was planned to be implemented, as determined by the renal programs; the intervention (linking the PROM to patient/provider discussion) is of minimal risk to patients, and all treatments are ascribed based on the provider judgment, not by study protocol; seeking informed consent would not be feasible in the framework of making this part of routine clinical care; seeking informed consent would likely bias participation resulting in inaccurate estimations of effect which would render the results of the trial uninformative for the use of these measures as part of routine care. The University of Alberta’s Health Research Ethics Board and the University of Calgary’s Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board separately approved the qualitative sub-studies (HREB #Pro00085021, CHREB #REB18–1786, respectively).</p>
