                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Normal saline (NS) and Ringerâ€™s lactate (RL) are the most common crystalloids used for fluid therapy. Despite evidence of possible harm associated with NS (eg, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, impaired kidney function and death), few large multi-centre randomised trials have evaluated the effect of these fluids on clinically important outcomes. We conducted a pilot trial to explore the feasibility of a large trial powered for clinically important outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title>
                  <p>The primary feasibility outcome was study fluid protocol adherence. Secondary feasibility outcomes included time to Research Ethics Board (REB) approval and trial initiation. Primary (composite of death or re-admission to hospital in first 90 days of index hospitalisation) and secondary clinical outcomes were analysed descriptively.</p>

                  <p>Among 24â€‰905 included patients, mean age 59.1 (SD 20.5); 13â€‰977 (56.1%) were female and 21â€‰150 (85.0%) had medical or surgical admitting diagnoses. Overall, 96â€‰821 L were administered in the NS arm, and 78â€‰348â€‰L in the RL arm. Study fluid adherence to NS and RL was 93.7% (site range: 91.6%â€“98.0%) and 79.8% (site range: 72.5%â€“83.9%), respectively. Time to REB approval ranged from 2 to 48â€‰days and readiness for trial initiation from 51 to 331â€‰days. 5544 (22.3%) patients died or required hospital re-admission in the first 90 days.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Other than the administration of oxygen, crystalloid fluids including normal (0.9%) saline (NS) and Ringerâ€™s lactate (RL) are among the most common interventions administered to hospitalised patients.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> These fluids may be used as a life-saving measure to re-establish haemodynamic stability, for rehydration, to replace fluid losses and to maintain intravascular volume.</p>
              <p>In observational studies, NS as compared with RL and other balanced crystalloid fluids have been associated with acute renal injury hypothesised due to its higher chloride concentration and resultant metabolic acidosis that can occur with NS administration.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â€“5</xref> However, RL and other balanced crystalloid fluids with buffers have the potential to cause metabolic alkalosis<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> and theoretically, cause arrhythmias, tetany, coma and seizures.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8â€“10</xref> The lactate in RL may accumulate in the setting of liver failure and may influence clinical diagnoses and clinical decision making.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11â€“13</xref> Moreover, RL has a lower osmolarity in comparison to NS and when administered rapidly in large volumes could theoretically reduce plasma osmolarity and increase the risk of oedema formation,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which raises potential concern for patients with cerebral oedema.</p>
              <p>Two large single centre multiple cross-over trials conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the emergency department (ED) for patients who did not require admission to the ICU, found that balanced crystalloid fluids as compared with NS were associated with lower major adverse kidney events at 30 days which is a composite outcome of mortality, new renal replacement therapy or persistent renal dysfunction.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 15</xref> In contrast, two large multi-centre randomised trials (BaSICS, n=11â€‰052â€‰and PLUS, n=5037)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> examined the efficacy of NS as compared with a balanced crystalloid (RL and Plasma-Lyte 148, respectively) on the primary outcome 90-day mortality. Neither of these trials detected differences in 90-day mortality; in BaSICS, the mortality rate was 22.0% versus 21.8%; in PLUS, mortality was 27.2% versus 26.4%. Renal function did not differ between the fluid groups in either trial, although the PLUS trial was stopped early due to recruitment challenges and insufficient funding during the pandemic. In a systematic review of 13 critical care trials to January 2022 and 35â€‰884 participants, there were no detectable differences in renal function. In low risk of bias trials, there was no significant difference in mortality for the 0.9 saline as compared with balanced crystalloid group (28.2% and 27.9%, respectively; relative risk (RR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.01)), nor renal function.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15â€“28</xref> However, authors concluded that there is a high probability balanced crystalloids reduce death since the CIs ranged from a 9% relative reduction to a 1% relative increase in death.</p>
              <p>Crystalloid fluids are not limited to use in the ED or the ICU, but are administered to the majority of patients admitted to the hospital and throughout their care. To address this evidence gap, we designed a cluster cross-over randomised trial to compare a hospital-wide policy/strategy which stocked NS or RL as the main crystalloid resuscitation fluid with the aim to have all admitted patients throughout the hospital receive the same crystalloid fluid from the time they enter hospital to hospital discharge with a primary composite outcome of death or re-admission to hospital in the first 90 days. With the FLUID design, the evidence generated will apply at the level of the hospital and healthcare system and for the majority of hospitalised patients.</p>
              <p>As a necessary first step, our team conducted the FLUID pilot trial to examine feasibility related to study fluid protocol adherence, time to REB approvals and time to readiness to initiate the trial.</p>

                <p>FLUID was designed in collaboration with the FLUID executive committee and endorsed by the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group. The study protocol was published <ext-link xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmjopen-2018-022780" ext-link-type="uri">https://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmjopen-2018-022780</ext-link>.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p>
                <p>FLUID was a pragmatic, open-label, hospital-wide cluster randomised cross-over trial (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) conducted in three tertiary care hospitals and one community hospital in Ontario, Canada. Cluster randomisation was justified in accordance with the Ottawa Statement,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> because randomising and following each individual patient admitted to the hospital would have been logistically challenging and financially infeasible. Having the same study fluid available throughout the hospital was essential to minimise contamination and maximise adherence, as study patients could be potentially exposed to both fluids across multiple clinical areas, prescribed by various clinicians. FLUID relied exclusively on health administrative data that is housed at the ICES in the province of Ontario, Canada for the description of patient baseline characteristics and clinical outcome measures. ICES is an independent, non-profit research institute whose legal status under Ontarioâ€™s health information privacy law allows it to collect and analyse healthcare and demographic data, without consent, for health system evaluation and improvement.</p>

                    <p>FLUID pilot trial study design: study fluid for the first study period was stocked from 1 to 3 weeks before initiation of the week 1 run-in period. No patients admitted during the week 1 run in-periods were included in the analysis. The week 1 run-in period familiarised hospital staff (physicians, nurses and trainees) with the FLUID operations, including the FLUID automatic substitution order prior to initiation of the two active 12-week study fluid periods (weeks 2â€“13 post week 1 run-in periods), where all patients with index hospitalisations were included. To ensure patients who were admitted close to the end of each study period received the same study fluid, a run-out period (week 14) was enabled through stocking of the same fluid on all the shelves throughout the hospital for following. No patients admitted during the week 14 run-out period were included in the analysis. We also allowed hospitals up to 3 weeks (weeks 15â€“17) to swap out the study fluid and cross over to the other study period fluid before the second study period week 1 run-in began. Patients admitted during the swap out time were not included in the analysis. Usual care began week 15 post the second study period.</p>

Both NS and RL with or without the addition of electrolytes were stocked in the hospitals and administered in the usual way as 500 or 1000â€‰mL boluses or continuous intravenous infusions as specified by the treating physicians at the participating hospitals in an open-label fashion. The allocated study fluid was the dominant fluid stocked (at least 80%) throughout the hospital for the duration of both study periods. Other fluid products did not undergo substitution during the study periods.</p>
                <p>Participating sites were randomised sequentially. The allocation of hospitals to begin with NS versus RL was determined by computer-generated random numbers at the coordinating centre prepared by a statistician not familiar with the sites. For each study period, week 1 served as a run-in, weeks 2â€“13 as the study period time during which time all patients with index admissions to the study hospital were included for analysis. Week 14 served as a run-out week during which time the study fluid remained stocked in the hospital for use by patients admitted during weeks 2â€“13. After the 1-week run-out period, hospitals had up to an additional 3â€‰weeks to cross-over to period two study fluid.</p>

                <title>Strategies to minimise contamination</title>
                <p>The risk of contamination due to non-adherence to the study fluid was minimised through six mechanisms. (1) An automatic substitution order for the study fluid was invoked during the trial study periods: nurses were authorised by the senior management team or by a specific order at each participating hospital to perform an automatic substitution for the study fluid when the alternate fluid had been ordered by the treating physician. The automatic substitution could have been overridden if the treating physician indicated â€˜no substitutionâ€™ in the physicianâ€™s orders. (2) The hospital ward shelves were stocked with at least 80% study fluid for the duration of the study periods. (3) Bright signage prominently placed where NS and RL were stored helped to remind nurses about the automatic substitution. (4) The other resuscitation crystalloid fluid was available only in small quantities (less than 20% available on the shelves of non-trial resuscitation crystalloid fluid). (5) A 1-week run in prior to initiation of study period 1 and 2 to ensure the allocated study fluid was adequately stocked throughout the study hospital and (6) a 1-week run out at conclusion of study period 1 and 2 to minimise the occurrence of patients being exposed to two different kinds of fluids during the same hospitalisation.</p>

                <title>Approach to safety</title>
                <p>NS and RL are usual care resuscitation crystalloid fluids in clinical use for decades. Thus, participation in this trial posed no greater risk than that of routine care.</p>
                <p>In advance of FLUID trial start-up at each participating hospital, several communication strategies were implemented to ensure all key stakeholders (staff physicians, trainees, nurses) were educated about FLUID,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">BMJ Open</italic> 2018;8;e022780.doi.1136/bmjopen-2018-022780). These communication strategies ensured that physicians and nurses knew there was a small amount of the non-allocated study fluid available for use throughout the hospital if the treating physician chose to opt out of using the study fluid for a given patient. Opting out occurred if the treating physician had a strong clinical reason to not use the allocated study fluid (eg, severe hyperkalaemia, severe metabolic alkalosis or acidosis, burn injury or severe brain injury).</p>
                <p>An independent safety committee reviewed a blinded by group safety analysis of the primary clinical outcome (death or requirement for hospital re-admission at 90 days) as well as any serious adverse events considered related to the study fluids that were reviewed at morbidity and mortality rounds or reported to safety management committees at participating sites after completion of the pilot trial to determine if there were any serious safety signals.</p>

                    <p>Adherence to the study fluid was measured not at the individual patient-level, but according to the aggregate use of the study fluid throughout the hospitals (all hospital wards, monitored units, and departments) using the hospital inventory system; monitoring fluid exposure or adherence according to individual patients was not feasible due to the sheer number of hospital admissions.</p>
                    <p>Successful adherence to the FLUID protocol was defined as a total of at least 80% of the prescribed study fluid for each study group being administered across all four participating hospitals combined and by individual hospitals over the 12-week study periods. The 80% adherence threshold was agreed to by our research team and the Canadian Critical Care trials group as FLUID was designed as a hospital-wide real world intervention strategy and after accounting for strong clinician preferences and contraindications, and adherence of 80% would be sufficiently high to justify going forward to the large trial. Adherence was monitored at 2-week intervals over the 12-week (weeks 2â€“13) study periods and described according to each study group across all four participating hospitals combined and according to major fluid user groups (ED, medicine, surgery, operating room (OR), postoperative assessment unit (PACU), obstetrics, ICU.</p>

Two of the four pilot centres met this target and initiated the study at 66 and 51 days after REB approval, respectively. At one centre the trial was initiated after 331 days; a decision was made to delay study initiation at this site until completion of enrolment at a sister hospital due to limited storage space for the large volumes of fluid. At another centre, study initiation was 102 days post-REB approval and purposefully delayed by an additional 12 days to accommodate for ward closures over a major holiday period.</p>

              <p>The FLUID trial design is innovative in its use of a pragmatic cluster randomised cross-over design, a waiver of patient informed consent to include all hospitalised patients, hospital based randomisation and the use of routinely collected electronic administrative health data to determine study outcomes. Our pilot trial confirmed that a large FLUID trial powered to evaluate death or re-admission to hospital within 90 days as the primary outcome is feasible based on study fluid adherence, REB approval time and readiness to initiate the trial. The REB approval target of 3 months was met for all four study sites. However, for three of the four centres, the REB approval process was centralised which avoided delays. In the large trial, a centralised REB process will be implemented where feasible. The FLUID pilot experience allowed our team to identify and address several logistical challenges associated with trial start up (eg, stocking of fluids, holiday closures).</p>
              <p>The study fluid interventions were implemented at the hospital level using a hospital policy or strategy, with the aim to answer our study question at the hospital level. Our overall study fluid adherence targets were met. The ability to opt out provided treating physicians with autonomy and ultimately their patient trust and was a key requirement for the use of a waiver of patient informed consent in FLUID. With ethics expertise and guidance on our team, the REBs agreed that FLUID met Tri-Council Guideline criteria<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which allowed for waiver of consent, which if not granted would have rendered this trial design infeasible. An extensive preparation and tailored education communication plan was developed for each participating hospital prior to the roll out of FLUID. As part of the preparation, collaboration with inventory services ensured at least 80% stocking of the study fluid in every in-patient cart in the participating hospitals and the receipt of inventory reports every 2 weeks related to these carts to facilitate adherence measurements. The trial was designed so that from the point of hospital entry until hospital discharge, whenever a clinician ordered RL or NS, the patient received the allocated study fluid. There was a run-out period at the end of period 1 and 2 to further reduce any contamination that may have occurred for patients who were enrolled near the end of each study period. Overall, prespecified study fluid protocol adherence targets were met. In the future large trial, we will target specific geographic regions in the hospital where adherence in the pilot was less than 80% for additional pretrial communication and educational enhancement strategies (eg, medicine wards).</p>
              <p>The generation of recent evidence will help inform the design and subgroup analyses for future large pragmatic balanced crystalloid versus NS crystalloid trials. For example, a subgroup analysis of three trials and 1896 in patients who had sustained traumatic brain injury from a systematic review of 13 critical care trials found the use of balanced crystalloids as compared with NS was associated with a trend toward harm (RR 1.26, 95%â€‰CI 0.98 to 1.60),<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> potentially related to the lower osmolarity and risk of cerebral oedema formation with balanced crystalloid fluids. Based on these data, balanced crystalloid versus NS trials going forward need to carefully consider the exclusion of patients with acute brain injury from different causes as well as different severity of injuries. In addition, recent evidence generated from systematic reviews of small trials and subgroup analyses of large trials suggest balanced crystalloids as compared with NS may reduce death from sepsis and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 38</xref> and represent important subgroups to examine in the future large FLUID trial.</p>
              <p>The FLUID trial identified potential limitations. Adherence to RL as measured by fluid inventory reports was lower than NS. Reasons include lower adherence by treating clinicians, but could also be explained by the use of NS for non-fluid therapy reasons (eg, medication delivery, catheter patency and flushes, coadministration for blood products, surgical wound washouts and during dialysis). These reasons for lower adherence may have overestimated adherence to NS and underestimated adherence to RL. However, non-adherence will be accounted for in the power calculation for the large trial. Finally, cluster cross-over trials are vulnerable to period effects if the timing of trial initiation and cross-over are not controlled and balanced between the randomisation sequences. Ideally, all sites in the large trial should be randomised either at one time or in batches.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Due to the logistical issues, we were unable to initiate all centres at the same time during the pilot trial but will put measures in place to ensure balanced allocations on time in the large trial.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The FLUID pilot trial suggests that a future large pragmatic multi-centre trial is feasible. The large trial will determine whether RL as compared with NS reduces death or requirement for hospital re-admission by an absolute difference of 1%. In contrast to trials that have generated evidence in specific populations with fluid interventions limited to geographic locations in the hospital (ICU, ED), the results of FLUID will apply broadly to patients who are admitted throughout the hospital. As such FLUID will provide important evidence-based guidance at the hospital and system level as to what fluid(s) could be predominantly stocked for use throughout the hospital and the associated healthcare resources required for such supply. Finally, our trial will also inform the usual care arm for future large crystalloid trials of similar design and build capacity for the conduct of similar trials in the future.</p>
