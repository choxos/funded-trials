              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Performing physically demanding work in hot environments and/or while wearing protective clothing increases thermal strain, which has been associated with decrements in cognitive function, such as reduced short-term memory, recall, and discrimination [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; reaction time, reasoning, and vigilance [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; and arithmetic ability [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In some cases, however, improved cognitive performance has been observed during short duration continuous aerobic exercise (i.e., 60% VO<sub>2peak</sub>, 10 min duration; choice-discrimination) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], during intense exercise (i.e., at/above anaerobic threshold; short-term memory) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and after bouts of continuous exercise of 20 and 40 min in duration (i.e., 70% VO<sub>2peak</sub>; mathematical computations) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Attempts to reconcile these conflicting reports in the literature have proposed that they are due to variances in the participant groups (e.g., hydration status, level of heat acclimatization, and degree of sleep deprivation) and/or in the methodology (e.g., environmental conditions, mode of exercise, and type of difficulty of cognitive test) between studies. Although cognitive performance has been examined during and following exercise in the heat, the analysis is typically done using either change in hydration or exercise rate (e.g., exercise at a % of VO<sub>2peak</sub>, absolute work rate, or completion of predetermined work tasks) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as the independent variables. In addition, the above studies were conducted in young, healthy, active individuals (some middle-aged participants in Heckler and Croce [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Thus, no study has examined cognitive performance during exercise in the heat as a function of age or following intermittent exercise at a constant rate of thermal drive, which matches the work load required in many occupational settings [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where attention and vigilance are crucial for worker safety.</p>
              <p>Age-related decrements in heat loss responses of sweating and skin blood flow are known to compromise the thermoregulatory efficacy of older adults [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of older workers in occupations which require physically demanding tasks to be performed in the heat and/or while wearing protective clothing and the need for attention/concentration in operating equipment (e.g., deep underground and surface mining, hydroelectric utilities, steel and chemical plants, and others). Age-related decrements in heat loss responses are not always reflected in measurements of local heat loss responses (e.g., sweat rate) and core temperature [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that health and safety heat stress guidelines are based on core temperature [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it must be recognized that increases in thermal strain and thus potentially age-related differences in cognitive performance [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] may still be present in older adults. However, the extent to which age-related differences in thermoregulation impact cognitive performance (e.g., information processing and attention) is currently unknown, particularly under conditions that restrict evaporative heat loss (i.e., humid heat and insulative protective clothing) which can result in increases in thermal strain. Furthermore, in attempts to mitigate thermal strain in workers, ventilation systems delivering large, and in some instances thermally conditioned, air volumes have been utilized in deep underground mining [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such ventilation systems are required to limit the increase in environmental temperature due to the various energy transformations and heat sources within a mine while also providing a flow to promote worker cooling. The supply of suitable ventilation has been shown effective in reducing thermal strain (i.e., core temperature) in lab studies during exercise in heat in active young adults (i.e., 25–30 years) while wearing minimal clothing [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, in a recent report, increased air velocity was shown to be effective during intermittent exercise in humid heat in young (i.e., ~25 years) and older (i.e., ~60 years) males while wearing work coveralls [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It remains unknown, however, whether ventilation-mediated reductions in thermal strain impact cognitive performance in young and older adults.</p>
              <p>The primary purpose of this study was to examine the influence of aging and increased air velocity on attention and speeded information processing, following intermittent exercise in humid heat under low (0.5 m·s<sup>−1</sup>) and high (3.0 m·s<sup>−1</sup>) air velocity work conditions in young (24.1 ± 0.5 years) and older (59.4 ± 1.2 years) males. Given that cognitive stress and/or increased mental workload have been shown to increase sweating (termed psychological sweating), identifying the effects of tasks which require sustained attention and working memory on thermoregulatory and cardiovascular responses would be applicable to occupations which require concentration and attention under potentially stressful conditions [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the secondary purpose of the study was to examine the influence of increased attentional requirements and increased working memory loads on thermal and cardiovascular responses. Accordingly, thermal and cardiovascular responses, and performance on a test requiring attention and speeded information processing, were compared for young and older males following intermittent exercise in humid heat (35°C, 60% relative humidity [RH]) under low and high air velocity conditions. The low velocity may be considered similar to that typically employed in industrial settings, such as mining for general occupational hygiene related exposure control, whereas the higher air velocity (i.e., 3.0 m·s<sup>−1</sup>) would be supplied to mitigate heat stress in workers. To be consistent with the required absolute work rate in many occupational settings [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], including deep underground mining, and a moderate-to-heavy work rate as defined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a fixed rate of heat production of 400 W was utilized during exercise to maintain an equal heat load and therefore a similar level of thermal strain between groups. It was hypothesized that increased air velocity would be less effective in reducing both thermal and cardiovascular strain, as well as any cognitive decrements, in the older males as compared with young males. It was also hypothesized that psychological sweating in both young and older males would be present as a result of increased attention and working memory demands but might not be as evident during the low air velocity condition compared to high air velocity condition due to increased skin wettedness as a result of a reduced capacity for the evaporation of sweat.</p>

                <title>2.1. Participants</title>
                <p>Upon receiving approval from the University of Ottawa Health Sciences and Science Research Ethics Board, 9 young and 9 older healthy, active, nonheat acclimated, nonsmoking males, matched for height, mass, and body surface area, were recruited for the study. None of the participants had a history of respiratory, metabolic, cardiovascular, and/or hypertension disease, or skin conditions, and none were on any medication related to these conditions. All participants were moderately educated (at minimum) individuals from the general population and university communities with a wide range of occupations (e.g., students, construction, government, and general labour employees). Some participants from each group had moderate levels of scientific background due to prior research participation. All participants were informed of the experimental procedures, associated risks, and discomforts prior to providing written consent. Participant characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>2.2. Experimental Design</title>
                <p>All participants completed one preliminary screening session and two experimental sessions. During the preliminary session, participants underwent a progressive incremental test on a semirecumbent bike (one minute stages with 20 W incremental increases) to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) (AMETEK models S-3A/1 and CD 3A, resp., Applied Electrochemistry, AEI Technologies, Pittsburg, PA, USA). Participants cycled until they could no longer maintain the predetermined cadence or stopped due to volitional fatigue. During the VO<sub>2peak</sub> exercise test, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring was performed in the older participants (age &gt; 50 years) (Pulse Biomedical Inc., Norristown, PA, USA). Blood pressure was measured at every 2nd stage or every 2 min. Percent body fat was calculated using the Siri equation [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], following the measurement of body density by hydrostatic weighing.</p>
                <p>The two experimental sessions followed a minimum of 2 weeks after the preliminary session and were separated by a minimum of 72 hours but performed at the same time of day. Prior to arriving at the laboratory, participants were instructed to eat a normal breakfast and drink water ad libitum, while refraining from caffeine and exposure to thermal stimuli for 12 and 24 hours prior to each session, respectively. Participants were also asked to refrain from alcohol and exercise for 24 hours prior to each session. Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants provided a urine sample, inserted the rectal temperature probe, sat for a 20-minute thermoneutral resting baseline, and were instrumented with a heart rate monitor and skin temperature sensors. Participants donned underwear (<italic>I</italic>

Participants subsequently entered the thermal chamber (Can-Trol Environmental Systems Limited, Markham, ON, Canada) regulated at 35°C and 60% RH with an air velocity of 0.5 (low, first experimental session) or 3.0 (high, second experimental session) m·s<sup>−1</sup> where they rested for 30 min while baseline measurements were obtained. They then performed four 15-minute bouts of cycling at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production of 400 W, a moderate-to-heavy intensity as defined by the ACGIH [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], separated by 15-minute rest periods with a final resting recovery of 30 min in duration. This rate of heat production is comparable to the absolute work rate required in occupational settings (e.g., mining) that are often performed in hot environments [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

                  <p>To establish a fixed rate of metabolic heat production of 400 W, the ergometer resistance was adjusted based on the concurrent measurements of expired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations (AMETEK models S-3A/1 and CD 3A, resp., Applied Electrochemistry, AEI Technologies, Pittsburg, PA, USA). Metabolic heat production was taken as the difference between metabolic energy expenditure and the resistance, in Watts, on the ergometer. Metabolic energy expenditure (<italic>M</italic>) was calculated from 30-second average values for oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>), according to the following equation.<disp-formula id="EEq1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:malignmark/><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Watts</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:maligngroup/><mml:malignmark/><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>∗</mml:mi><mml:mfenced open="[" close="]" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>RER</mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">0.7</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">0.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>∗</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext>RER</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">0.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>∗</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">60</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula>where RER is the respiratory exchange ratio (CO<sub>2</sub> produced/O<sub>2</sub> uptake), <italic>e</italic>

              <p>Cognitive function, specifically attention and capacity of information processing, was compared using an abbreviated version of the PASAT, in young and older males prior to and following intermittent exercise, performed at a fixed rate of heat production of 400 W. This rate of heat production is equivalent to a moderate-to-high workload according to the ACGIH guidelines [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The young and older males performed similarly on the PASAT (i.e., absolute number of correct responses and relative to age norms [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) prior to and following intermittent exercise while wearing work coveralls in both the low and high air velocity conditions. This was paralleled by similar thermal (i.e., <italic>T</italic>
<sub>re</sub> and LSR at both skin sites) and cardiovascular (i.e., percent of maximum heart rate) responses between the age groups in both air velocity conditions. In addition, neither the young nor the older males demonstrated decrements in performance on the PASAT in either air velocity condition despite the high air velocity significantly reducing thermal (i.e., <italic>T</italic>

                <title>4.1. Effects of Age and Air Velocity on Cognitive Performance</title>
                <p>While previous studies have reported decrements in cognitive performance, such as impaired short-term memory, recall, and vigilance, during exercise in the heat in young individuals [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], no study has examined potential age-related differences in cognitive function during work in humid heat. Reductions in the rate of information processing have been strongly linked to age-related changes in cognitive function [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; however, young and older adults perform similarly on tests such as the PASAT that require overlearned arithmetic skills in conjunction with rapid information processing and sustained attention [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It was hypothesized that when subjected to thermal stress the older males might demonstrate impairments in attention and speed of information processing on a test resistant to the effects of age-related cognitive decline (PASAT). However, the young and older males demonstrated a similar cognitive performance (i.e., attention and information processing) under heat stress during both the low and high air velocity conditions. Given that the population group used in the current study likely had different work experience, heat exposure backgrounds, and/or education levels as compared to some industry workers, it would be of great benefit to the occupational stakeholders if this study were repeated under field conditions and/or in the laboratory with industrial workers. Similar cognitive performance was observed between the age groups with the exception of a time effect for the older males, whereby the number of correct responses on the PASAT was significantly higher at end exercise and end recovery compared to baseline. Such an improvement in performance 30 min following exercise may be due to a practice effect over time which has previously been noted for this test [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The practice effects might be expected to be of a larger magnitude (despite repeated practice) due to the abbreviated quarter of the items available in the computer test being repeated at each session providing multiple exposure to a small subset of the items. It is perhaps not surprising that, given some practice, the older males were to benefit from these repeated exposures more than the young males as it has been hypothesized that generational differences in the overlearning of addition tasks may influence performance on this test [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Overall, the similar cognitive performance at the end of exercise between age groups was paralleled by similar thermal (i.e., <italic>T</italic>
<sub>re</sub> and LSR at both sites) and cardiovascular (i.e., percent of maximum heart rate) responses in both the young and older males within each of the air velocity conditions. The lack of a significant difference in cognitive performance following exertional heat stress is consistent with other studies reporting minimal or no changes in cognitive function when fluid replenishment was provided to avoid dehydration [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or with dehydration levels of 2.6% or less body mass loss [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Alternatively, Szinnai et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] suggested that when dehydration is developed slowly, as in the case with the current study over the duration of 2-3 hours, healthy individuals are better able to accommodate to the increased tiredness and reduced alertness (e.g., exercise arousal effect) which mitigates any reductions in the capacity of information processing mechanisms. In the current study, % body mass changes were similar between the young and older males following the low (2.4 ± 0.2 and 2.7 ± 0.3%, resp.) and high (1.8 ± 0.1 and 1.9 ± 0.2%, resp.) conditions, similar to or lower than the changes reported by Szinnai et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This was despite the high air velocity being effective in reducing the level of dehydration in both age groups (detailed hydration status changes have been previously published [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]).</p>
                <p>The increase in air velocity during the high condition was also effective in reducing thermal (i.e., <italic>T</italic>
<sub>re</sub>, LSR at both skin sites) and cardiovascular (i.e., heart rate, percent of maximum heart rate) strain equally in both young and older males; however, the benefits of the high air velocity condition were not reflected in cognitive performance. Interestingly, Morley et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] detected alterations in cognitive performance only at or beyond 1 hour after exercise, following 50 min of continuous treadmill exercise (i.e., walking 4.5 km·hr<sup>−1</sup>) in young, active adults (~28 years) wearing thermal protective clothing. These alterations in cognitive performance were at a high physiological stress where visceral temperatures were ~39.0°C and heart rates were ~170 bpm at the end of exercise. Thus, at the levels of thermal strain (i.e., <italic>T</italic>
<sub>re</sub> at end exercise of 38.0–38.3°C) and dehydration (i.e., 1.8–2.7% body mass loss) observed in the current study, young and older males were able to maintain attention during the conduct of speeded information processing without significant decrements in performance. This was despite anecdotal feedback from the participants in both groups that the PASAT was perceived as being more difficult during the low compared to high air velocity condition and the apparent presence of a practice effect for the older males. Decrements in cognitive performance, and potentially age-related differences, might have been observed with greater levels of dehydration (i.e., &gt;3.0%), at greater levels of thermal strain (i.e., <italic>T</italic>
<sub>re</sub> ≥ 39.0°C), with longer duration intermittent exercise, and/or with the completion of a full cognitive test battery that manipulates task difficulty, as compared with the partial administration of the PASAT used in the current study.</p>

                <title>4.2. Evidence of Psychological Sweating</title>
                <p>Eccrine sweating is most commonly associated with exercise and exposure to heat, in which thermal stressors are driving the glandular responses; however, nonthermal stresses, such as mental stress, anxiety, fear, and pain, can also result in increased sweating, also known as psychological sweating [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Administration of the PASAT has been demonstrated to be a reliable method of inducing psychological stress in the laboratory [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Older studies suggested that psychological sweating is only observed on the skin of the hands and feet [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and can be inhibited by thermal stimulation when both thermal and psychological stimuli are present [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Conversely, more recent studies have shown a larger distribution of psychological sweating in thermoneutral individuals [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and when stimulated by passive heating [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Novel to the current study was the observation of psychological sweating following exertional heat stress given that the local sweating at both the forearm and upper back skin sites increased significantly as a result of the PASAT administration in both young and older males 30 min following the final exercise bout in the high air velocity condition. Therefore, the current findings dispute previous research which suggested psychological sweating to be inhibited by thermal stimuli [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and concurred with more recent research that both thermal and psychological sweating can occur simultaneously [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Despite the similar sweat rates measured at both skin sites at the end of exercise prior to the PASAT, between the low and high air velocity conditions, the effectiveness of evaporative cooling was evident in the high air velocity condition as reflected in the significantly reduced core temperatures in both young and older males. Thus, for occupations that require sustained attention, vigilance, and ongoing information processing during work in the heat, it may be plausible that increased psychological sweating may subject workers to an increased sweat loss and thus risk of dehydration, when the environment permits effective evaporative heat loss from sweating.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Young and older males demonstrated similar performance on a test of attention and speeded information processing, paralleled by similar thermal and cardiovascular responses, prior to and following intermittent exercise at a fixed rate of heat production (400 W, moderate-to-heavy work as defined by the ACGIH guidelines) while wearing standard work coveralls in humid heat (35°C, 60% RH) within each of the low (0.5 m·s<sup>−1</sup>) and high (3.0 m·s<sup>−1</sup>) air velocity conditions. Young and older males also demonstrated similar cognitive performance between the low and high air velocity conditions despite the high air velocity significantly reducing thermal (i.e., <italic>T</italic>
<sub>re</sub> and LSR at both skin sites) and cardiovascular (i.e., heart rate and percent of maximum heart rate) strain equally in both young and older males. The psychological sweating in the young and older males at the end of recovery in the high but not the low air velocity condition may be indicative of a greater risk for increased dehydration under conditions which permit effective evaporative heat loss from sweating. Thus, no significant decrements in attention and speeded information processing were observed, with age or altered air velocity, following intermittent exercise in humid heat.</p>
