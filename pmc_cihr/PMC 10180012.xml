                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>Self-management education and support (SMES) interventions have modest effects on intermediate outcomes for those at risk of cardiovascular disease, but few studies have measured or demonstrated an effect on clinical end points. Advertising for commercial products is known to influence behavior, but advertising principles are not typically incorporated into SMES design.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>This randomized trial studied the effect of a novel tailored SMES program designed by an advertising firm among a population of older adults with low income at high cardiovascular risk in Alberta, Canada. The intervention included health promotion messaging from a fictitious “peer” and facilitated relay of clinical information to patients’ primary care provider and pharmacist. The primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalizations for cardiovascular-related ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. Rates of the primary outcome and its components were compared using negative binomial regression. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (EQ-5D [EuroQoL 5-dimension] index score), medication adherence, and overall health care costs.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>We randomized 4761 individuals, with a mean age of 74.4 years, of whom 46.8% were female. There was no evidence of statistical interaction (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.99) or of a synergistic effect between the 2 interventions in the factorial trial with respect to the primary outcome, which allowed us to evaluate the effect of each intervention separately. Over a median follow-up time of 36 months, the rate of the primary outcome was lower in the group that received SMES compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.00]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.047). No significant between-group changes in quality of life over time were observed (mean difference, 0.0001 [95% CI, −0.018 to 0.018]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.99). The proportion of participants who were adherent to medications was not different between the 2 groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.199 for statins and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.754 for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers). Overall adjusted health care costs did not differ between those receiving SMES and the control group ($2015 [95% CI, −$1953 to $5985]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.320).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>For older adults with low income, a tailored SMES program using advertising principles reduced the rate of clinical outcomes compared with usual care. The mechanisms of improvement are unclear and further studies are required.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Self-management behaviors such as medication adherence, dietary modifications, and engaging in physical activity are important components of management for many chronic diseases.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Despite evidence supporting these practices, a large Canadian survey found that fewer than half of those who receive advice on self-management reported being adherent.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Interventions have been developed to promote adherence to prescribed medications and self-management practices, targeting domains that are known to contribute to adherence, such as participant knowledge, motivation, and capability.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Some of these interventions have proven modestly successful,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> particularly those that provide offerings beyond education,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and are often termed self-management education and support (SMES).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although certain SMES strategies improve adherence and modestly affect intermediate outcomes such as glycemia or blood pressure,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> few studies have evaluated the effects of SMES on clinically relevant outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The provision of information or advice by providers is often insufficient to motivate health behavior change and may inadvertently make people less likely to adopt the recommended changes.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Many of the SMES programs that use traditional approaches to patient education have failed to demonstrate a positive effect on clinical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This suggests that an alternative or novel approach to providing SMES may be warranted in order to have the desired effect on patient- and population-level health outcomes.</p>
            <p>Advertising for commercial products is known to influence consumer behavior and counter resistance among potential consumers by using principles such as “forced exposure,” “branded content,” “distraction/indirect messaging,” and “self-affirmation.”<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> It was hypothesized that a novel SMES program incorporating these and other advertising principles would influence health behaviors and improve clinical outcomes.</p>
            <p>We sought to determine the effect of a novel tailored SMES program on cardiovascular-relevant outcomes, adherence, quality of life, and health care costs in older adults with low income at high cardiovascular risk. The goal was to design and test a new approach to providing health-related information on the basis of advertising and marketing principles.</p>
            <sec sec-type="methods">
              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>ACCESS (Assessing Outcomes of Enhanced Chronic Disease Care Through Patient Education and a Value-Based Formulary Study) tested the effect of a novel brand engagement and SMES program on health outcomes, quality of life, and health care costs for older adults with low income at high cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, factorial randomized controlled trial design was used to test the effect on cardiovascular outcomes, mortality, and hospitalizations for cardiovascular-related ambulatory care sensitive conditions over a 3-year follow-up period. The trial is reported according to CONSORT guidelines (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064189" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link>). This was a factorial trial; the other intervention included elimination of copayments for high-value medications for cardiovascular prevention. The findings of this intervention are reported separately.</p>
              <p>Minimal changes were made to the study protocol after commencement.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The data used for outcome ascertainment in this study belong to Alberta Health and are protected by the Health Information Act and therefore cannot be released to third parties outside the study team. The other trial data (surveys) could be made available upon request. This study was approved by University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, and all participants provided informed consent.</p>
              <sec>
                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>ACCESS recruited community-based participants living in the province of Alberta, Canada. Alberta has 4.5 million residents with universal public health insurance that fully covers the costs of physician and hospital services. Most people access primary care from family physicians. Some patients also have access to support from dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, or disease educators through their primary care networks,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and all can be referred to specialist programs, which may include education. SMES programs are accessed in an ad hoc fashion and at patient discretion.</p>
                <p>Potential participants were recruited by signs in physician offices and pharmacies across Alberta, letters sent to patients with recent health system interactions (hospitalization or from a cardiac catheterization registry), and through advertising on television, radio, and social media.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Interested individuals called the study recruitment line, which was staffed by professional customer service representatives, who answered basic questions and administered eligibility questions. Contact information for those who were interested and eligible was forwarded to the study coordinating center, which then contacted participants to complete intake questions, obtain informed consent, and arrange for completion of baseline study questionnaires (by mail or electronic means, as per participant preference). After these were received by the study coordinating center, participants were randomized (see below).</p>

                <title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
                <p>Inclusion criteria were ≥65 years of age; coverage by provincially sponsored seniors’ medication insurance; high cardiovascular risk on the basis of one or more of coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure, or 2 or more of current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol level; and household income &lt;$50 000 CAD per year. Exclusion criteria included additional private insurance coverage, receiving medications administered by a nurse or facility, or the inability to participate in self-management modules because of cognitive impairment. Participants had to be able to converse in English or have a close family member or friend willing to read study materials (surveys and SMES materials) to them. Those who were not fluent in English and did not have such a proxy were not eligible.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The SMES program was codeveloped by a social impact creative design firm (Emergence Creative). The education and support in the program were delivered through the voice of a fictional peer named Moxie to encourage participant engagement.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Self-reported baseline information (including use of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers [ACEis/ARBs] and self-reported adherence, chronic conditions [eg, heart disease/stroke, diabetes, smoking], and beliefs about the necessity of medication and concerns about medications<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>) was used to tailor messaging for participants. Using these characteristics, participants were assigned to 1 of 50 prespecified tailored tracks that determined their specific weekly mailed message. Messages were presented on branded professional trifold cards with information about health conditions or medications, including suggestions for chronic disease self-management and preventive care (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064189" ext-link-type="uri">Expanded Methods</ext-link> in the Supplemental Material). Mailers typically included a story to catch readers’ attention and then related this information to some aspect of health, well-being, or chronic disease self-management.</p>
                <p>At prespecified times, participants were sent tangible goods, including a reusable tote bag (3 months), a health tracker book (6 months), and a pedometer (12 months), to promote healthy behaviors and sustain engagement. Participants who expressed interest were also given access to a secure tailored web site with information about their conditions, medications, and health behavior recommendations on the basis of their baseline study questionnaire (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064189" ext-link-type="uri">Expanded Methods</ext-link> in the Supplemental Material). Personalized web pages included health information and cards or quizzes to help drive engagement with the material. In addition to receiving the weekly trifold mailers, these participants also received thrice-weekly emails with health tips and invitations to visit their personalized web page.</p>
                <p>The intervention also included a facilitated relay component within the first 3 months of study initiation,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> which used letters sent to participants with instructions to take them to their physician and pharmacist in order to relay information on use/nonuse of guideline-indicated medications (statins and ACEis/ARBs) together with information on participants’ indications for treatment. If a participant self-reported not taking a statin or an ACEi/ARB, then the letter encouraged patients and providers to discuss these decisions and provided evidence supporting the use of these medications in this patient population.</p>

                <title>Control Arm</title>
                <p>The control arm for the SMES program was usual care. Those who were randomized to usual care continued to have access to their regular health care providers and any chronic disease supports available through their care team or accessed independently. In addition, the study team arranged for control participants to receive a generic health-related magazine every 3 months.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for cardiovascular-related ambulatory care–sensitive conditions, each defined using validated algorithms applied to administrative data (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064189" ext-link-type="uri">Table S2</ext-link>). Recurrent events for a given participant were considered in this composite outcome. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary end point, major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death [a post hoc outcome]), medication adherence, overall quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D [EuroQoL 5-dimension] index score), and health care costs.</p>

                <title>Sequence Generation, Allocation Concealment, and Blinding</title>
                <p>Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 fashion (using variable block sizes) by a computer-generated randomization program, ensuring concealed randomization. Four treatment groups were generated (copayment elimination only, SMES only, both, and control). Randomization was stratified by age (&lt;70 years or ≥70 years), annual household income (&lt;$30 000 or ≥$30 000), and sex (male or female).</p>
                <p>Full blinding was not possible, but control participants received a quarterly health-related magazine to mimic a basic health education intervention. To reduce risk of ascertainment bias, administrative data codes defining the primary and secondary outcomes were specified in advance (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064189" ext-link-type="uri">Table S2</ext-link>), and analysis was conducted in a blinded fashion until all outcomes were finalized.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Data Collection</title>
                <p>The primary outcome, medication adherence, and health care cost outcomes were assessed using provincial administrative health data (including vital statistics, pharmacy claims, physician claims, hospitalizations, emergency department and outpatient visits, and all health care costs).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> This data set has been used for many observational studies<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and for assessing outcomes in a randomized controlled trial of &gt;20 000 individuals.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Each component of the primary outcome was assessed using validated algorithms applied to administrative health data,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> all with positive predictive values and sensitivity &gt;70%<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064189" ext-link-type="uri">Table S2</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>To estimate medication adherence, 2 commonly prescribed classes of covered medications that guidelines recommend for use in nearly all patients eligible for this study were assessed (statins and ACEis/ARBs).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> This was assessed from the date of the first dispensation of the medication to the date the participant withdrew from the study using the proportion of days covered (number of days dispensed/number of days between prescription renewals).<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Participants with medications dispensed to cover ≥80% of observed treatment days were considered adherent.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Quality of life was assessed by survey, completed at baseline, and at the end of the study using the EQ5D-5L index score and applying Canadian-specific weightings to generate the index score of utility.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> By convention, the utility index score is anchored at 1.0 for full health and 0.0 for death; participants who died during follow-up were assigned a score of 0.0.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Potential intermediate patient-reported outcomes, to help assess mechanisms for intervention effectiveness, were also collected by survey at baseline and end of study, including smoking status, depression, acetylsalicylic acid use (because this could be purchased over the counter), difficulty in accessing health care, and self-reported “carelessness” about taking medications. Furthermore, health care utilization was assessed, including overall emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and primary care continuity.</p>
                <p>Total health care costs included medication costs, all-cause hospitalizations, emergency department visits, day medicine, physician visits, diagnostic imaging, and laboratory testing. Case-mix grouper methods and ambulatory case-costing methods were used to estimate hospital and outpatient costs, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The costs associated with creating and administering the SMES intervention were also considered and included.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>We initially tested the use of a Poisson model to test the main effects of the intervention on the primary outcome. However, there was evidence of overdispersion (greater variance than mean) threatening the assumptions of the Poisson model, reflected by a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of &lt;0.0001 from the likelihood ratio test of the dispersion measure α being equal to 0. Therefore, as prespecified, a negative binomial model was used to test the main effects of the impact of the intervention on the rate of the primary outcome,<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> controlling for the variables upon which randomization was stratified (age, sex, and income).<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Given that this was a factorial trial with 2 distinct interventions, receipt of the other study intervention (copayment elimination) was controlled for by including this as a covariate in the models. Multiple comparisons for the secondary outcomes were accounted for using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Prespecified secondary analyses included time-to-event analysis with Kaplan-Meier plots and applying the cumulative incidence function to account for the competing risk of death using the method of Fine and Gray.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Between-group differences in the binary medication adherence variable (proportion of days covered &gt;80% for statin and ACEi/ARB use) were assessed using log binomial regression (generalized linear models with a log link). Mixed models were used to compare end of study EQ-5D index scores. In secondary analyses, multiple imputation for missing EQ-5D data was used, with the method of multiple imputation by chained equations.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Mixed-effects models were fitted using random intercepts with an unstructured within-patient covariance structure to analyze the change in EQ-5D index scores from baseline to study end.</p>
                <p>Several intermediate and patient-reported outcomes are ordinally scaled in nature (eg, smoking status, primary care continuity, and body mass index category). These were therefore modeled using cumulative logistic regression assuming proportional odds.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> These analyses were also adjusted for the same variables as the primary analysis.</p>
                <p>All analyses used the intention-to-treat principle. Subgroup analyses were done using prespecified groups including age, income, sex, and type of chronic conditions.</p>

                <p>We assessed 8870 potentially eligible individuals and excluded 2793, with another 1316 not completing enrollment, leaving 4761 participants who were randomized (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Most participants (37%) were recruited from health care providers, followed by those who received study information after a health system interaction (33%); from television, radio, or social media advertising (12%); or by word of mouth (18%).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Participants were followed for a median of 36 months, and primary outcome data were available for 99.6% of participants; the remainder emigrated from Alberta. There was a greater number of people who withdrew from the study in the SMES group (n=317) compared with the control group (n=141). Recruitment occurred between November 2015 and June 2018, with follow-up ending on March 31, 2021 (the end of the fiscal year for administrative data).</p>

                <p>Using a negative binomial model, there was no evidence of statistical interaction (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.99) or of a synergistic effect between the 2 interventions in the factorial trial (self-management intervention and copayment elimination) with respect to the primary outcome, which allowed us to evaluate the effect of each intervention separately. Of participants in the SMES and control groups, those who received SMES had a significantly lower rate of the composite primary outcome than those who did not receive SMES (incidence rate ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61–1.00]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.047; Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We designed, implemented, and evaluated a novel SMES program on the basis of principles used in commercial advertising. Among older adults with low income at high cardiovascular risk, the intervention reduced the rate of the primary outcome, which was primarily driven by lower risk of hospitalizations for cardiovascular-related ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. The intervention did not improve quality of life or reduce health care costs. Whereas there was no between-group difference in adherence to statins or ACEis/ARBs, those who received SMES were slightly more likely to initiate statin treatment, potentially reflecting the effect of the facilitated relay component in encouraging participants to initiate indicated treatments.</p>
              <p>Whereas SMES interventions have been shown to improve intermediate clinical measures such as A1C level and blood pressure,<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> few studies have measured the effect of SMES on clinical end points.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A recent review of SMES including 22 trials in patients with coronary artery disease found that only 2 studies examined effect on myocardial infarction and only 5 evaluated hospitalizations.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The largest of these studies followed 3500 individuals and reported no difference in mortality at 2 years, <sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> but may have been limited by its traditional approach to SMES, which involved in-person education from a nurse. Other studies that have shown clinical benefit generally included participants who were at considerably higher risk than those in this study (those with recent myocardial infarction or with heart failure), and also used relatively high-intensity interventions such as regular in-person education or on-demand telephonic support.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our intervention appears to be the first positive study of a SMES program that could be deployed at scale, with potential important contributions to public health if such interventions were available to people who are managing chronic medical conditions. Hospital admissions are a major driver of health care spending,<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> although cost saving was not demonstrated within the 3-year observation period of the study. This may be attributable to the fact that hospitalizations for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions only account for a small portion of total hospitalizations, in which there was no difference between intervention groups.</p>
              <p>We postulate that the SMES program was successful because of its novel approach. The branding and messaging were developed by an advertising firm, leading to an intervention that was unique in its feel and consistent with the paradigm of social marketing.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Although seldom used in health care, social marketing has demonstrated success in the management of other health conditions.<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Whereas the content of the intervention was comprised of evidence-based self-management advice which was approved by the clinicians on the team, its novelty was in the delivery, branding, and storytelling of the messages, which were tailored to participants’ characteristics. We found that 80% of recipients reported that the SMES program was helpful, chiefly because it enhanced knowledge, provided helpful reminders, and improved confidence in self-management abilities.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> The finding of reduced clinical end points without significant differences in intermediate explanatory outcomes suggests that the SMES program may have influenced other aspects of chronic disease self-management that were not measured, such as physical activity, dietary practices, or social connectedness. Furthermore, the slight increase in the number of participants who had ever filled a prescription for statins might suggest that the facilitated relay component of the intervention helped encourage participants to start taking indicated cardioprotective medications. Patient empowerment is an important contributor to outcomes for people with chronic health conditions,<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> and it is possible that the intervention helped participants feel more confident and empowered in their interactions with health care providers. However, because questions to document these mechanisms were not asked, further research is recommended to understand how best to affect patient behavior and outcomes with these interventions. Although the results were not statistically significant, the intervention was associated with a slight increase in the number of deaths. All the potential ways these kinds of behavioral interventions may affect patients is not known, nor is the potential for unintended consequences. Although these appeared minimal in the current study, further study on this topic is necessary.</p>
              <p>Although this study has important strengths, including its large size, complete follow-up for the primary outcome, and randomized design, it also has limitations. First, the content of the SMES was tailored to the characteristics of trial participants (older adults with low income at high cardiovascular risk), so its benefits may not be generalizable to other populations; in particular, in settings where access to health care providers or medications may differ from in Canada (because financial barriers may preclude individuals from benefitting from the SMES intervention). However, advertising and marketing principles could be used to develop tailored messages that are applicable to other settings and populations. Second, because of pragmatic and financial constraints, the study intervention was only offered in English, limiting its use to a smaller group, although proxies were permitted to aid participants, if available. Third, there was a greater number of people in the SMES group who withdrew compared with those in the control group. This was likely because the study was more omnipresent in the lives of those in the SMES group, whereas controls were contacted infrequently by study personnel (only for scheduled follow-up surveys), and some would have been disappointed not to have received the other intervention in the factorial trial (copayment elimination). However, follow-up was still high for survey outcomes for both study groups (≈75%), and data on the primary outcome were available for &gt;99.6% of participants through administrative data. Finally, because the intervention did not demonstrate significant differences in intermediate outcomes that might explain the overall improvement in the primary outcome, further investigation is required. The SMES intervention included multiple components, and it is not possible to identify the specific elements responsible for the observed benefits, nor the dose or duration necessary.</p>
              <p>Among older adults with low income at high cardiovascular risk, a novel SMES intervention on the basis of advertising principles led to a significant reduction in the risk of clinical outcomes compared with usual care, driven by lower risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular-related ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. Future studies should determine whether these findings are generalizable to other populations and settings, the mechanism of improved outcomes, as well as assessing how advertising principles can be used to amplify the effects of other clinical and public health interventions related to behavior change.</p>
