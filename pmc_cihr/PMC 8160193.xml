                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is an asymptomatic condition that can lead to catastrophic events of rupture or dissection. Current guidelines are based on limited retrospective data and recommend surgical intervention for ATAA with a diameter of greater or equal to 5.5 cm. Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance is the first prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial that compares outcomes of patients undergoing early elective ascending aortic surgery to patients undergoing medical surveillance.</p>

                  <p>Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with an asymptomatic ATAA between 5.0 cm and 5.4 cm in diameter are eligible for randomisation to early surgery or surveillance. Patients in the surgery group will be followed at 1 month after discharge, then annually for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years. Patients in the surveillance group will be followed annually from their index clinic visit for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at follow-up. A sample size of 618 subjects (309 in each group) will achieve an 80% power at a 0.047 significance level.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is known as ‘silent killers<italic>’</italic>, as they are usually indolent until presentation with aortic rupture or dissection. Aortic rupture is nearly always fatal, and acute type A aortic dissection has a 20% mortality within the first 24 hours and 50% at 1 week when treated medically.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Even when patients undergo emergency surgery, mortality for acute type A dissection repair remains high at 19.7%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Elective ATAA replacement can prevent the future occurrence of acute aortic events. However, elective surgery is invasive and carries risks (1%–2%) of mortality and stroke.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therefore, the management of ATAA is predicated on recognising the threshold at which risks of surveillance outweigh risks of surgery.</p>
              <p>The natural history of ATAA is incompletely understood. Aneurysm size is the most widely accepted criteria for predicting risk of acute aortic events and determining surgical threshold.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Using a retrospective cohort of patients, Elefteriades and colleagues from Yale University observed a 15%/year risk of aortic dissection, rupture or death at aortic size of ≥6.0 cm compared with 7%/year between 5.0 nd 5.9 cm<sup>3</sup>. Driven primarily by this data, current guidelines recommend surgery at an ascending aortic diameter of ≥5.5 cm in the absence of connective tissue disorders, familial aortopathy or rapid growth (&gt;3 mm/year).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> We have performed a meta-analysis of observational studies reporting natural history of ATAA, which included 8831 patients and &gt;31 000 patient-years of follow-up.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mean aortic diameter in these studies was 4.3 cm (range 3.6–5.6 cm), and the pooled incidence of all-cause mortality was 1.99%/patient-year. In addition to providing an estimate for risk in small aneurysms, this meta-analysis confirmed that there is little prospective data and no randomised trials to inform current guidelines, which lead to over 10 000 elective proximal aortic surgeries performed annually in North America.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, the number of patients needed to be treated with elective repair to prevent one adverse outcome is unknown.</p>
              <p>While the risk of aortic dissection grows as aneurysm size increases, data from the International Registry of Aortic Dissection revealed that patients presenting with acute type A dissection have a median aortic diameter of 5.3 cm, suggesting that over 50% of aortic dissections occurs in aneurysms with diameters &lt;5.5cm.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Other large cohort studies have corroborated these findings that the majority of aortic dissections tend to occur at diameters less than 5.5 cm.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Therefore, patients who do not meet guideline criteria for surgery still bear a significant burden of health risk and quality-of-life concern.</p>
              <p>In contrast, treatment guidelines for abdominal aorta aneurysm are founded on extensive data and are widely accepted by the surgical community.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Multiple large, multicentred randomised control trials that included 127 891 men and 9342 women established the natural history of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (&lt;5.5 cm) as well as proper surveillance for patients at risk of this life-threatening disease.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref> In addition, by comparing long-term outcomes of patients randomised to either the surveillance group (surgery if aneurysm size &gt;5.5 cm or growth rate &gt;1.0 cm per year) or the early surgery group, the trials have shown that for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAAs) under 5.5 cm, the risk of early surgery outweighs the risk of rupture during surveillance and that women have higher risk of rupture than men.</p>
              <p>Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance (TITAN: SvS) aims to be the first randomised controlled trial to guide evidence-based management of the growing population with indolent but lethal silent killers of ascending aortic aneurysms. In addition to a multicentre prospective clinical database, the trial will also include a core imaging lab and a quality of life analysis.</p>

                  <p>Age between 18 and 80 years, ascending aorta or aortic root aneurysm between 5.0 cm and 5.4 cm in maximal diameter on a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Individual surgeons have preferences as to whether large versus small, bicuspid versus trileaflet, men versus women, young versus elderly should have different thresholds for intervention. However, there are insufficient data to justify these clinical impressions, as reflected in current guidelines, which do not recommend different thresholds for these subgroups.

                <p>In the surgery group, patients will undergo replacement of the aneurysmal aortic segment between 5.0 and 5.4 cm with a Dacron graft, within 12 weeks of randomisation.

                <p>In the surveillance group, patients will undergo protocol-driven imaging studies. If patients have progression of aortic or other cardiac disease, they will undergo treatment as per established guidelines. The patients will undergo a CT scan of the chest at the first clinic visit then annually for the duration of the study. All CTs will be uploaded to a core CT imaging lab where the image will be reviewed by dedicated cardiovascular radiologists. If the aneurysm grows beyond 5.5 cm or the patient develop symptoms, the surgeon will consider the patient for surgery.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The study hypothesis is that a strategy of early surgery will lead to lower all-cause mortality at follow-up compared with surveillance. A framework, proposed by Barthel <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for sample size calculation incorporating <italic>nonproportional hazards</italic> (PH) and treatment changes including <italic>cross-over</italic> between treatment arms was used for determining the sample size. The framework is based on using piecewise exponential distributions to model the survival distributions. The approach has been implemented in the programme Analysis of Resources for Trials. For tractability, five periods will be taken of equal length (1 year) with the number of patients at risk and occurrence of events in the two groups separately for each period. Modelling survival distributions over each of the periods allow us to take nonPH into account and cross-over that may vary over the time periods.</p>
                <p>The event rate in the surveillance group is based on findings from the meta-analysis on the natural history of ascending aortic aneurysms. We found that the all-cause mortality was 1.99%/year in a cohort with small aneurysms (mean aortic diameter of 4.3 cm). In contrast, the Yale University group, the largest single-centre cohort, reported a 5.5%/year incidence of mortality in patients with ascending aortic aneurysm between 5.0 and 5.9 cm. We anticipate that the annual incidence of the primary outcome in the surveillance group will be between 1.99% and 5.5% and, therefore, <italic>an estimate of 3% will be used</italic> for the sample size calculation. For the surveillance group, survival probabilities per period are (1–0.03) k (ie, 0.9700, 0.9409, 0.9127, 0.8853, 0.8587) and incorporating 10% cross-over probabilities are 0.9718, 0.9465, 0.9227, 0.9002, 0.8786.</p>
                <p>In the surgery group, we estimate that the 30-day mortality can vary between 1% and 2%. Data from large volume aortic centres in the literature as well as from the nominated principal investigator (PI)’s institution support a 30-day mortality of 1%. We have <italic>assumed a conservative 30-day mortality estimate of 2%</italic>. Following ascending aortic replacement, we anticipate a <italic>1%/year incidence of nonaortic mortality</italic> in the surgical group. This has been corroborated in a review of long-term outcomes following aortic surgery at the Ottawa Heart Institute where survival in study eligible patients (n=506) following aortic surgery was 93%±2% at 10 years. For the surgery group, survival probabilities per period are (1–0.01) k (ie, 0.9900, 0.9801, 0.9703, 0.9606, 0.9510).</p>
                <p>A two-sided log-rank test with a sample size of 278 subjects per group achieves an 80% power at a 0.047 significance level (accounting for one interim analysis) to detect a difference in the proportion surviving in the early selective surgery group of 0.99 compared with the proportion surviving in the surveillance group of 0.97. This assumes uniform accrual over a</p>
                <p>3-year period followed by minimum of 2 years of follow-up. An anticipated loss to follow-up rate is 10%, and to account for this loss, the total sample size will be <italic>618 subjects</italic> (556/0.9), <italic>309 in the surgery arm and 309 in the surveillance arm.</italic> With the sample size of 618, and with the expected no loss in the perioperative period, for the primary safety outcome of perioperative stroke, the power is 80% to detect a difference in perioperative stroke of 2.5%, a difference that is considered clinically important to detect.</p>

All CT scans will be uploaded to a CT imaging core lab (University of Calgary) where images will be reviewed and reported by a study radiologist using TeraRecon (Aquarius iNtuition, California). In patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease that did not meet exclusion criteria, non-contrast CT will suffice given the consistent expertise at the core lab. Local CT readings will be used to determine inclusion into study. All subsequent aortic readings will be done by the imaging core lab. To ensure concordance and to examine variance between study site and core lab aortic measurements, baseline CT scans will also be reviewed by the core lab and measurements compared with study site measurements. In case of aortic or cardiac disease progression, the patient will undergo guideline-directed surgical therapy. Similarly, patients will be followed for a minimum of 2 years or until the study ends.</p>

Baseline information as indicated above, including a full history, vitals, complete physical examination, and an initial CT scan will also be obtained in the first clinic visit as per the standard of care. Patients will be clinically followed each year with a CT scan to monitor the status of their ascending aortic aneurysm, until the end of the study, the occurrence of an aortic event (aortic dissection or aortic rupture) or death.</p>

                  <p>The patient groups will be compared on the time-to-the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, using the log-rank test and described using Kaplan-Meier curves. If there are baseline differences, the Cox PH model will be used to compare groups adjusting for baseline variables. The interaction of treatment by stratification variables will be evaluated within the model. The assumption of PH will be assessed using the log-negative-log plot of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, a plot of Schoenfeld residuals as a function of time and consideration of the interactions of selected covariates with time. If the PH assumption is violated, then modification of the model for non-PH will be considered including adding interaction of covariate(s) with function of time and stratification models. For interactions with function of time, an interaction is added of a covariate for which the PH assumption is violated. If the interaction is statistically significant, the effect of the given covariate is not constant over time and including the interaction in the model enables interpretation of the parameter estimate taking this into account. For the stratified model, subgroups based on a categorical variable chosen in that it interacts with time and the PH assumption is violated for this variable will be considered.</p>

For the continuous outcome of quality of life, a 2-way analysis of variance will be considered with the between factor time (elective surgery group vs surveillance group) and the within factor time (1 vs 3 years). If there are any clinically important imbalances in baseline variables, then an analysis of covariance will be used to compare patient groups over time on quality of life adjusting for these baseline variables. For the other secondary dichotomous outcomes, proportions will be calculated and when comparisons are made between the patient groups, they will be compared using the cχ<sup>2</sup> test. If there are baseline differences, then a logistic regression model will be used to compare the patient groups adjusting for these baseline variables. In the surveillance group, the point estimates and 95% CIs will be calculated for the incidence of elective ascending aortic surgery and the annual ascending aortic growth rate.</p>

                <p>Patients with ascending aortic aneurysm between 5.0 and 5.4 cm will be randomised to surgery or surveillance. Therefore, patients randomised to the surgical arm will be subjected to the risks and discomforts of elective ascending aortic surgery. In experienced centres, the operative mortality and risk of postoperative stroke rate at an experienced centre for composite aortic root replacement is 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, and 0% and 1% for root sparing ascending aortic replacement.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23</xref> At the nominated PI centre, 303 consecutive patients undergoing elective ascending aortic surgery (with or without aortic root replacement), 30-day mortality and stroke occurred at rate of 1.2% and 1%, respectively (unpublished data). Notably, in our survey of current clinical practice, about half of the respondents offer surgery at 5.0 cm and half at 5.5 cm for the same patient characteristics. Thus, due to clinical equipoise and practice variation, the number of trial eligible patients in the community receiving SvS would approximately be equal, thereby not increasing overall risk to patients. Therefore, post-trial care will continue to be consistent with that recommended by current guideline, and the patients will be followed accordingly.</p>
