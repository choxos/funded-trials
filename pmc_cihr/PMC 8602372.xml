                <p id="Par1">Supplementation with micronutrients, including vitamins, iron and zinc, is a key strategy to alleviate child malnutrition. However, association of gastrointestinal disorders with iron has led to ongoing debate over their administration. To better understand their impact on gut microbiota, we analyse the bacterial, protozoal, fungal and helminth communities of stool samples collected from a subset of 80 children at 12 and 24 months of age, previously enrolled into a large cluster randomized controlled trial of micronutrient supplementation in Pakistan (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00705445). We show that while bacterial diversity is reduced in supplemented children, vitamins and iron (as well as residence in a rural setting) may promote colonization with distinct protozoa and mucormycetes, whereas the addition of zinc appears to ameliorate this effect. We suggest that the risks and benefits of micronutrient interventions may depend on eukaryotic communities, potentially exacerbated by exposure to a rural setting. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings and their impact on health outcomes.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Malnutrition is a global health crisis with 149 million children stunted and 45 million children wasted under the age of 5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With increased vulnerability to infection, undernourished children are at elevated risk of death, not least from diarrheal diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of gut microbiota in malnutrition, with microbiome immaturity (bacterial communities that are underdeveloped with respect to age) representing a key factor in disease development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Beyond bacterial communities, parasites such as hookworm, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, and <italic>Entamoeba</italic> have been associated with severe diarrheal disease and intestinal malabsorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, much less is known regarding the role of other, potentially commensal, eukaryotic gut microbes in undernutrition. Of particular interest is their ability to interact with and alter bacterial communities. For example, indole-producing gut bacteria were found to confer protection against <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection, while deworming treatments targeting helminth endemic communities reduced the abundance of protective Clostridiales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Mouse studies further showed that helminths and protozoa influence bacterial communities by modulating the host immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. While the number of published gut microbiome studies has increased rapidly over the last decade, few have explored the composition of eukaryotic gut communities and their potential interactions with bacteria. Previously, we applied 18S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence surveys to systematically characterize eukaryotic microbiota in severely malnourished Malawian children and identified a high prevalence of protozoa including commensals and pathobionts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We furthermore associated <italic>Blastocystis</italic> colonization with increased gut bacterial diversity.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Global health programs targeting vulnerable child populations include the use of micronutrient supplements, consisting of vitamins as well as essential minerals zinc and iron, that have been demonstrated to improve growth and reduce morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Such supplements are thought to address deficiencies that can impair immune responses to infectious pathogens and impact gut bacterial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. While beneficial, supplementation, especially with iron, may also promote unintended growth of pathogens with the potential to disrupt the gut environment, particularly where the host is unable to restrict micronutrient bioavailability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. For example, it has been shown that surplus iron promotes the growth of enteropathogens and induces intestinal inflammation in infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, while known to reduce the duration of childhood diarrheal episodes, zinc supplementation has been associated with increased duration of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The impacts of complementary foods introduced between 6 and 24 months of age on gut bacteria, and the potential of tailored formulations, often fortified with micronutrients, to alleviate undernutrition by promoting specific bacterial taxa were recently reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The success of such strategies may also depend on understanding their effect on eukaryotic microbiota and their potential to modulate the gut environment.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In this work, we attempt to understand the impact of micronutrient supplementation on the complex interactions between eukaryotic and bacterial microbiota in the maturing infant gut. We perform 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA amplicon surveys on stool samples obtained at 12 and 24 months of age from 80 children, previously recruited as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) conducted in Pakistan. The trial investigated the impact of micronutrient powders (MNP) containing vitamins and iron with or without zinc on growth and morbidity in 2746 children, and has shown an excess of significant diarrheal and dysenteric episodes among children receiving MNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We show that diverse protozoa, helminths, and fungi colonize the gut of both undernourished children and those within a healthy weight range. Children receiving MNPs have reduced bacterial diversity, while vitamins and iron are associated with increased carriage of specific protozoa and mucormycetes, an effect mitigated by the addition of zinc. Modeling of microbiota interactions reveals a complex landscape of associations with supplementation, place of residence (i.e., urban or rural), age, and nutritional status.</p>

                <p id="Par6">A subset of 80 children (160 paired stool samples at 12 and 24 months of age) were selected from the parent cRCT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00705445">NCT00705445</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> for profiling of gut eukaryotic and bacterial communities in this study (control (<italic>n</italic> = 24), MNP (<italic>n</italic> = 29), and MNP with zinc (<italic>n</italic> = 27); Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The cohort includes children from both urban (Bilal colony) and rural (Matiari district) study sites. Children were stratified by weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) at 24 months into two groups: a reference WLZ group with WLZ &gt; −1 (mean 0.2, 95% CI [−0.1, 0.4]) and an undernourished group with WLZ &lt; −2 (mean −2.9, 95% [CI −3.2, −2.7]). Participant characteristics are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, and details of subject selection are outlined in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. For comparison, summary characteristics of all participants in the parent trial followed to 24 months of age are included in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The WLZ growth trajectories of the children selected for microbiome profiling as the reference WLZ group approximately tracked the upper 50th percentile of the original cohort, while the undernourished group started around the lower 50th percentile and gradually dropped over time ending at the bottom 80th percentile of the cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This drop in the WLZ of the undernourished children was driven by poor weight gain (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). While diarrheal episodes were a primary outcome of the parent trial, with an incidence between 3.73 and 4.32 per child year during the intervention period (2.80 and 3.13 after the intervention had ceased)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we excluded children with reported diarrhea prior to stool collection for the purpose of microbiome analysis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of the parent micronutrient supplementation trial and participant characteristics selected for microbiome profiling.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The timeline of the parent cRCT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00705445">NCT00705445</ext-link>), including enrollment, intervention, and follow-up.

                <p id="Par7">To investigate the carriage of eukaryotic organisms within the developing infant gut, we applied 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing to all 160 stool samples. We generated a total of 11,639,233 paired amplicon reads (median 70,642) of which 7,167,464 were high-quality reads and clustered into OTUs, and 4,386,494 could be classified as a eukaryotic microbe (median 22,932; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The remaining reads were assigned as plant (Embryophyta, 1,600,136), mammalian (312,235), arthropod (211,284), bacterial (322,725), or remained unassigned (433,435). We identified a total of 859 microbial eukaryotic OTUs (median 66; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which included 438 protozoan, three helminth, and 418 fungal OTUs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Fungi, dominated by Mucoromycota and Ascomycota, accounted for 71% of all reads.

                <title>Micronutrient supplementation without zinc is associated with increased carriage of protozoa and mucormycetes</title>
                <p id="Par9">Having generated profiles of eukaryotic communities within each sample, we were interested in identifying any links between these communities and variables captured in the parent study. Applying generalized linear models (GLMs), we tested for associations between protozoan and fungal richness (number of OTUs) and four explanatory variables: micronutrient supplementation, nutritional status, age, and rural versus urban residence. Children residing in the rural study site had increased protozoan richness compared to those from the urban setting (GLM, β = 11, 95% CI [5.3, 16.6], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Differences were attributed to the higher carriage of predominantly alveolate taxa, particularly <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (Fisher’s Exact, OR 4.9, 95% CI [2, 11], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), species known to cause enteric symptoms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). When stratifying by age group, only <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and two OTUs classified as unknown Conoidasida, with 93% sequence identity to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, reached statistical significance at 24 months, with 2.4 and 9.6-fold higher carriage, respectively, in children from rural settings (Fisher’s Exact, OR 8.1, 95% CI [2.5, 29], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, OR 15.2, 95% CI [2, 670], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
                <p id="Par10">While we observed trends in increased fungal and protozoan richness in the undernourished cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), only the tapeworm <italic>Hymenolepis nana</italic> was detected with overall significantly higher frequency in undernourished children (Fisher’s Exact, OR 6.2, 95% CI [2, 23], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). At 12 months, <italic>H. nana</italic> detections were only 2 and 3% in reference WLZ and undernourished children, respectively. However, by 24 months, carriage increased to 8% in reference WLZ and 43% in the undernourished group (<italic>ns</italic> after multiple testing correction). We also observed trends of increased carriage of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporida</italic> (coccidians), represented by 46 OTUs in total, in undernourished children (74% versus 65% at 12 months, <italic>ns</italic>; 71% versus 61% at 24 months, <italic>ns</italic>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Furthermore, undernourished children receiving MNPs with zinc had significantly fewer protozoan OTUs relative to undernourished children in the control and MNP arms (GLM, β = −15.19, 95% CI [−29.27, −1.12], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), suggesting a possible inhibitory effect by the metal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par11">We next compared the phylogenetic compositions of protozoan and fungal populations. The fungal composition was not associated with any of the variables studied here, however, analysis of protozoan compositional differences, based on unweighted UniFrac scores, revealed four distinct clusters of samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Differences were significantly explained by place of residence (adonis, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and micronutrient supplementation (adonis, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), where protozoan communities in children supplemented with MNPs differed significantly from those in control and MNPs with zinc arms (MNP vs. CTL, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; MNP vs. MNP with zinc <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Cluster 1 in particular was enriched in MNP samples, <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> (6, <italic>n</italic> = 105) = 26.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Key drivers of compositional differences included <italic>Tritrichomonas</italic>, detected exclusively in samples within clusters 1 and 4 (correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and an OTU assigned to an unknown alveolate found exclusively in clusters 1 and 2 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). These organisms were highly prevalent in both age groups, at 42 and 45% (<italic>Tritrichomonas</italic>) and 20 and 21% (unknown alveolate).</p>
                <p id="Par12">To better understand this association between protozoan community structure and micronutrient treatment, we systematically compared protozoan, as well as fungal, carriage among supplementation groups. We identified significantly higher carriages of seven phylogenetically distinct protozoa and six fungi in children receiving MNPs without zinc, relative to those that were given zinc (six protozoa and six fungi relative to the control group; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Indeed, we noted a trend where MNPs with zinc reduced carriage of microbial eukaryotes to or below that observed in the control samples. For example, <italic>Gregarina</italic> and an uncharacterized alveolate, which contributed to the previously observed differences in beta diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), were detected with 1.8 and 3.8-fold higher frequency in the MNP group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with no differences between samples from the control and MNP with zinc groups. Similarly, the carriages of three mucormycete genera (<italic>Rhizomucor, Actinomucor</italic>, and <italic>Mucor</italic>) were 1.3, 1.5, and 1.8-fold higher, respectively, in the MNP group compared to the control (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with no significant differences between the control and MNP with zinc groups. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> was the only genus with significantly reduced carriage in children receiving MNPs with zinc, with 11 and 23-fold reductions compared to CTL and MNP groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); however, we observed non-significant reductions in other organisms such as <italic>Cercomonas</italic> and <italic>Mucor</italic> (2 and 1.4-fold, respectively) suggesting possible species-specific effects. Despite previous reports of the impact of zinc on helminths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we did not detect significant differences in the carriage of the tapeworm <italic>Hymenolepis nana</italic> among treatment arms.</p>

Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were found to dominate with just two OTUs (both assigned to <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>) accounting for over 50% of all reads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Age was the primary determinant of bacterial richness (GLM, β = 43.65, 95% CI [31.98, 55.31], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and evenness (GLM, β = 0.80, 95% CI [0.59, 1.02], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), as well as patterns of taxonomic composition as measured by Bray–Curtis and weighted UniFrac dissimilarities (adonis, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Regression of compositional differences in each child at 12 and 24 months using partial correspondence analysis indicated that 56% of Bray–Curtis and 59% of weighted UniFrac changes may be attributed to age. By correlating the abundances of bacterial taxa with the first two axes of the Bray–Curtis ordination, we identified the candidate drivers of community differences as the two dominant <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species, with opposite abundance patterns perhaps suggesting succession of one species by the other.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Bacterial microbiota change with age and supplementation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Relative abundances of bacterial phyla in 12 (top) and 24 (bottom) month old children based on 16S data. <bold>b</bold> Rarefaction curves comparing mean species richness by age, micronutrient supplementation, nutritional status, and place of residence (site).

                <p id="Par15">Interestingly, gut bacteria were also influenced by micronutrient supplements.

Supplementation tended to reduce overall bacterial richness with an effect that reached significance in the MNP group (GLM, β = −14.66, 95% CI [−29.01, −0.31], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and influenced taxonomic composition as measured by weighted UniFrac (adonis, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.03) but not Bray–Curtis dissimilarities. Specifically, phylogenetic variance, defined as dispersions from the group centroids, differed among groups (two-way ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with significantly smaller differences among 12-month-old children receiving MNPs and MNPs with zinc (Tukey HSD post hoc, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). This may suggest that micronutrients support or restrict the growth of select taxa.

MNPs with zinc were associated with significant changes in an additional 46 taxa, and 29 taxa were altered in MNP samples (DESeq2, Wald test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These included a seven-fold increase in <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> abundance in 12-month-old MNP-supplemented children, increases in several Lactobacilli, and a 1.3-fold reduction in one <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> OTU (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>).

                <title>MNPs may destabilize microbial interactions in undernourished infants</title>
                <p id="Par16">In the previous analyses, we were concerned with global changes in community structure, as well as individual taxa. To explore interactions between taxa and how these may change in response to developmental, nutritional, or environmental perturbations (i.e., age, nutritional status, supplementation, and locality), we constructed microbial interaction networks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interactions between taxa were inferred from pairwise associations (i.e., co-occurrence or mutual exclusion), based on their abundance in children grouped by one or more explanatory variables. Based on these associations, graphical networks were built depicting a community of eukaryotes and bacteria as nodes, with associated taxa (those thought to influence one another’s growth) linked by edges. We compared the network topologies to evaluate putative differences in microbial communities. We found that the numbers of interactions held by taxa (node degree) were significantly higher in the older age group irrespective of treatment, nutritional status, or place of residence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), consistent with the development of more complex communities as the child matures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The greatest difference, with a 2.5-fold increase (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), was noted in the networks of children in the MNP arm, which had the fewest taxon interactions at 12 months (MNP vs. CTL, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; MNP vs. MNP with zinc, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), but achieved parity with the control and MNP with zinc groups by 24 months (MNP vs. CTL, <italic>ns</italic>; MNP vs. MNP with zinc, <italic>ns</italic>), 6 months after supplementation had ceased. Cross-kingdom interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes represented 20 to 30% of all network interactions at 12 months, falling to between 15 and 24% by 24 months of age, a decrease that was significant in undernourished children (Fisher’s Exact, OR 2.1, 95% CI [1.3, 3.3], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Supplementation influences microbial interactions.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Density of microbial interactions at 12 and 24 months of age, calculated as the number of significant associations (node degrees) each microbe has with other taxa within a sample group.

                <p id="Par17">The impact of supplementation on the microbial interactions appeared to further depend on the health of the host. When split by nutritional status, we observed important differences in the microbial networks of 12-month-old undernourished infants supplemented with micronutrients compared to the control and reference WLZ groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–e</xref>). Within control groups, the microbial networks of undernourished infants and those within the reference WLZ group had similar levels of connectivity, with non-significant differences in degree distribution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) and betweenness centrality scores (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). While children in the reference WLZ group receiving either supplement were associated with small but significant reductions in microbiota betweenness (MNP, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; MNP with zinc, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), greater reductions were observed in supplemented undernourished children (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Since betweenness provides a measure of the degree of coordination within a network, these findings suggest that micronutrient supplementation, with or without zinc, may result in microbial communities that are less organized at 12 months of age. This is further illustrated by the network visualizations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), where, in addition to changes in network density, we also identified shifts in taxa with the highest betweenness values (which can be interpreted as those taxa most likely to mediate important coordinating roles within the communities). For example, within the control group, Clostridia, two species of Mucoromycota and the ciliate <italic>Bromeliothrix</italic> occupy central roles in the network of reference WLZ infants, while in undernourished infants, these central roles are held by <italic>Trichosporon</italic>, <italic>Longamoeba</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella</italic>. In supplemented reference WLZ groups, Bacilli exhibit the highest betweenness values in the absence of zinc, while these are replaced by Proteobacteria in the communities from infants receiving MNPs with zinc. However, within undernourished infants receiving either supplement, microbial networks appear largely fragmented (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), with dramatically lower degree distributions and betweenness compared to the control group, (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) suggesting that micronutrient powders may have a disruptive effect on a fragile microbial community. Comparison of microbial networks by location of residence further showed an increased density of interactions within each rural group (control or supplemented) compared to the urban groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), however, our ability to detect microbial interactions in the urban cohort may have been hampered by a lower representation of participants from this district. Low participant numbers precluded us from successfully generating networks at 24 months, where numbers of microbial taxa are greater. Data from additional timepoints are needed to confirm the potentially destabilizing effects of MNPs throughout the intervention and the putative recovery after the intervention has ceased.</p>

                <title>Micronutrient supplementation and place of residence impact cross-kingdom microbial interrelationships in the early infant gut</title>
                <p id="Par18">Based on our findings described above, we hypothesized that the effects of supplementation on microbial communities at 12 months could also indirectly influence later microbial profiles. We further hypothesized that early exposure to eukaryotes (before or at 12 months of age) could alter age-related differences in the bacterial microbiome. To explore these complex interrelationships, we generated an integrated model of cross-correlations among microbial profiles and explanatory variables using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The identified relationships, indicated by arrows, are composites of direct and indirect effects, where indirect effects estimate the impact of an upstream factor (e.g., supplementation) on a downstream element (e.g., eukaryotes at 24 months) via an intermediate (e.g., bacteria at 12 months). We found that micronutrient supplementation influenced components of eukaryotic and bacterial composition at 12 months (path coefficient −0.27 ± 0.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; path coefficient −0.27 ± 0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), with possible indirect carryover effects to microbial composition at 24 months (i.e., supplementation may influence microbial profiles at 24 months via its early impact at 12 months; indirect effects of −0.11, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Consistent with our findings above, abundances of <italic>Mucor</italic> and <italic>Euglyphida</italic> correlated with supplementation at 12 months (cross-correlation coefficients −0.35 and −0.34, respectively; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Eukaryotic profiles at 12 months of age were associated with changes in abundance of certain bacteria at 12 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, arrow 1; path coefficient 0.27 ± 0.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and, these changes, in turn correlated with shifts in eukaryotic composition at 24 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, arrow 4; path coefficient 0.21 ± 0.095, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Place of residence also significantly influenced microbial profiles, with the greatest effects observed on eukaryotic profiles (12 months, path coefficient 0.52 ± 0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 24 months, path coefficient 0.48 ± 0.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Children from the rural community had increased levels of several alveolates, including <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, at both ages (cross-correlation coefficients: 12 months, 0.40; 24 months, 0.69). These children also had higher abundances of several <italic>Clostridium</italic> OTUs at both ages and sustained higher levels of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> at 24 months. A stratified analysis of reference WLZ and undernourished children did not reveal groups to have significant differences in their correlation structure with variables (i.e., path coefficients were not significantly different between groups). However, the stability of path coefficients could not be confirmed in our cohort using bootstrapping, a robust second-step validation procedure that iteratively recalculates path coefficients from a random sample of participants. With our sample size, bootstrapping produced large standard errors likely resulting from unevaluated interactions and/or diverse microorganism carriage (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>). This may also suggest that the stochastic presence/absence of certain eukaryotes could be important in driving the supplement-related changes in the microbiome. Nevertheless, given the consistency with our earlier findings, this model supports the need to further investigate the influence of MNP supplementation on the relationships of eukaryotic and bacterial communities in the developing gut of vulnerable infants who carry diverse eukaryotic organisms.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Graphic representation of the cross-associations among demographic variables, micronutrient supplementation, and microbiota at 12 and 24 months.</title><p>Interconnected arrows indicate the tested cross-correlated paths between: place of residence (site), supplementation, and the community patterns of bacterial and eukaryotic OTUs summarized as latent PLS scores.

Here, we have shown that the gut microbiota of both undernourished children and those within a healthy weight range includes a diverse group of protozoa, helminths, and fungi, each with the capacity to impact host health. We have also shown that supplementation with MNPs, a strategy used to improve growth and alleviate micronutrient deficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, may influence the development of the microbiome in these susceptible populations.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Consistent with previous studies, we found that bacterial communities became more complex with age. Eukaryotic communities, however, were not significantly impacted by age but instead were associated with micronutrient supplementation and place of residence. Only the tapeworm <italic>H. nana</italic> was identified at significantly higher levels in undernourished children. While <italic>H. nana</italic> infection is usually asymptomatic, high egg burdens in children have previously been associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, with exacerbated morbidity in children &lt;5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We associated rural habitation with significantly more diverse protozoan communities and, in particular, increased prevalence of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. An important cause of infant mortality and childhood malnutrition, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection is attributed to unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation often associated with rural settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. While approximately half of all children enrolled in the parent trial had access to piped drinking water (41 and 52% in the urban Bilal colony and rural Matiari sites, respectively), only 4% of children in the Matiari district had access to underground sewage, compared to 95% in the Bilal Colony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, consistent with a lack of wastewater sanitation resulting in higher parasite carriage. While the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), the largest childhood diarrhea study to date, with 22,568 children enrolled across seven developing countries in Asia and Africa, reported <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> as a leading cause of death in 12–23-month-old children with moderate to severe diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, we found a high prevalence of this parasite in the absence of diarrhea (80 and 83% at 12 and 24 months in the Matiari district, and 60 and 33% in the Bilal urban colony). As our detection is based on 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we may have detected a broader group of species with variable pathogenic potential compared to the GEMS study, which applied a specific oocyst antigen immunoassay. Alternatively, our findings may indicate a high prevalence of asymptomatic infections, with symptomatic infections resulting from additional unknown factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The prevalence of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in our cohort was also higher than previously reported in non-diarrheal stools, using oocyst antigen testing, in the neighboring Naushero Feroze District (5.1% between 12 and 21 months of age), where <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> contributed to 8.8 diarrheal episodes per 100 child-years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par21">A major focus of our study was to estimate the effect of micronutrient supplementation on the gut microbiota. We found that children receiving supplements without zinc were associated with distinct eukaryotic communities, featuring an increased prevalence of multiple protozoa and fungal taxa, including species with known potential to cause symptomatic infections and disrupt the gut microbiome; however, the addition of zinc to these supplements alleviated these increases, while significantly reducing the prevalence of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and overall protozoan richness. These findings are consistent with a previous report which suggested that zinc has a parasite-specific protective effect against infection and ensuing diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Fungal diversity was not impacted by age, supplementation, place of residence, or nutritional status. However, the predominance of Mucoromycota, particularly in children receiving MNPs without zinc, is of concern, as these organisms are responsible for rare but lethal invasive fungal infections that have previously been reported in low birth weight infants and malnourished children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Although incidence of infections is rising globally, rates of mucormycoses are particularly high in Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Consequently, sequestration of free iron by host proteins such as lactoferrin is a key defense mechanism to limit growth of pathogens, including Mucorales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Iron deficiency has furthermore been suggested as protective against malaria infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, and provision of supplements containing iron in endemic regions has been cautioned against due to increased malaria-related hospitalization and mortality of children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While a deficiency in zinc has been associated with impaired immune function and susceptibility to enteroinfections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, supplementation in the context of enteric pathogens was shown to have parasite-specific outcomes. Provision of zinc alone can increase the incidence of <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> and duration of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> infections, but it has also been shown to reduce the duration of associated diarrheal episodes as well as lower the prevalence of <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Interestingly, asymptomatic <italic>Giardia</italic> infections in children in Tanzania were associated with reduced rates of diarrhea and fever, an effect which was lost in children receiving vitamin and mineral supplements, including both iron and zinc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that while iron, vitamins, or both, may promote growth and survival of commensal and potentially pathogenic eukaryotes, resulting in a shift in eukaryotic community structure and disrupting the gut environment, the addition of zinc may reduce the ability of at least some eukaryotic microbes to infect and persist. The findings of reduced bacterial diversity in 12-month-old infants receiving micronutrient supplements, together with elevated levels of <italic>Escherichia–Shigella</italic> and reduced beneficial <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, are also consistent with previous reports, where reductions in beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and increased enterobacteria in infants receiving iron-containing micronutrients were linked to an elevated risk of inflammation and diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The parent cRCT associated <italic>Aeromonas</italic> infection with increased diarrhea in MNP-supplemented groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We did not detect this bacterium in our data, possibly due to the exclusion of diarrheal samples.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The impact of micronutrient supplementation also extended to the structure of the microbial communities. Microbial networks, representing significant correlations in the co-occurrence or mutual exclusion of specific bacteria and eukaryotes, revealed higher network connectivity in the control groups, with the networks generated from the undernourished infants receiving both types of supplements revealing a more fragmented structure. This fragmentation suggests a destabilization of species interactions within the developing gut microbiota in undernourished infants. Possibly contributing to this disruption of community associations is the presence of specific eukaryotic microbes, as evidenced by the increased carriage of a number of protozoan and fungal taxa in children receiving MNPs, and/or the expansion of pathogenic bacteria. These microbes may interfere with the maturation of commensal bacteria through predation, competition for resources, and/or modulation of host immunity. In undernourished infants, the cumulative effect of increases in pathogenic organisms on community structure may be more pronounced than in infants within a healthy weight. Enteropathogens <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, for example, were shown to have a greater impact on growth in protein-deficient mice during co-infection, an effect which was dependent on the resident gut bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Taken together, our data showing increased carriage of eukaryotic microbes and increased abundance of <italic>Escherichia–Shigella</italic> in children supplemented with micronutrients, as well as a potential loss of organization in microbial interactions in supplemented undernourished children, may offer at least a partial explanation for previous reports of increased duration and severity of diarrhea as well as increased intestinal inflammation in children supplemented with micronutrient powders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Due to the relatively small numbers of samples, we were unable to generate separate networks for the three treatment arms for 24-month-old children, or further segregate the networks by place of residence. We note that supplementation ceased at 18 months of age, consequently the acute effects of these supplements may have dissipated prior to 24 months. Moreover, micronutrient interventions may impact undernourished children differently in settings associated with high <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> burden, for example. Networks constructed from small sample sizes also have a greater propensity for prediction of spurious interactions and a reduced capability to detect true associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In absence of sample limitations, network reconstructions from larger balanced groups, with additional timepoints, could improve our ability to discern key microbial linkages impacted by interventions during different stages of growth and weaning. We note that lack of spike-in controls in this study did not allow us to estimate the absolute abundances of microbiota. In future studies, such an approach could confirm whether supplementation, for example, influences the relative representation of eukaryotes and bacterial cells in the gut. The notable absence of <italic>Giardia</italic>, a parasite typically prevalent in this demographic, is likely due to mismatches to the 18S rRNA sequencing primers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Parasite diagnostic data from the trial did identify <italic>Giardia</italic> in 37 infants at 12 months and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in seven, but noted no significant increases in either of the supplemented groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Prevalence was nearly two-fold higher at the rural site, consistent with our findings for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, emphasizing the need for location-specific investigations of the effects of micronutrient supplements. In addition to potential intraspecies variation, our detection of high sequence diversity in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> OTUs specifically, and eukaryotic taxa in general, may be exaggerated by a high proportion of non-overlapping amplicon reads, a consequence we have attempted to minimize through manual curation. Regardless, we report that eukaryotic microbiota are abundant members of the gut microbiome even in infancy, and given the known role of parasitic pathogens in diarrheal disease and the association of fungi with obesity and inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, their role in malnutrition should be further studied.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Our integrated model of microbial relationships and influencing external factors recapitulated a number of key earlier findings, including the impact of micronutrients and locality on gut eukaryotes. Furthermore, it supports the notion that complex cross-kingdom interactions may influence the gut bacterial composition and provides a valuable framework to dissect the direct and indirect effects of eukaryotic infections or nutritional interventions on the maturing gut microbiome. The instability observed in the pathway coefficients of the model, when participants were randomly resampled, is likely the result of the heterogeneous and stochastic nature of eukaryotic carriage (i.e., random exclusion of participants carrying eukaryotes with the strongest responses to supplementation or locality) and ultimately our small sample size. However, given the current debate concerning the use of MNP supplementation and its role in gastrointestinal disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, such a framework is expected to play a key role in identifying scenarios where MNP supplementation may require more cautious thinking.</p>
              <p id="Par26">This study demonstrates that micronutrient powders impact the infant microbiota, with potentially disruptive effects driven through the promotion of specific organisms during the early stages of microbiome development. These findings are of relevance to micronutrient supplementation strategies, especially those targeting vulnerable children in low-resource settings.</p>

In brief, a total of 2746 children (control (<italic>n</italic> = 947), MNP without zinc (<italic>n</italic> = 910), and MNP with zinc (<italic>n</italic> = 889)) were enrolled in the parent cRCT at 6 months of age (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Participants in the control group received health promotion messaging surrounding recommended feeding practices, whereas participants randomly assigned to MNP groups received the same messaging and were given a 14-day supply of MNPs (replenished every 2 weeks between 6 and 18 months of age). Families were instructed to mix one sachet of MNPs per day into the child’s regular foods. MNPs contained vitamins A, C, D, folic acid, and microencapsulated iron, with or without 10 mg zinc.

Routine stool samples were collected from participants at enrollment, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Caregivers were provided with a stool collection kit (plastic diaper, collection container, spatula, and gloves) and training on how to self-collect stool, document the time of defecation, store the sample in a shaded area of the household and notify study staff. Stool samples were picked up at participants’ homes within 1 h of defecation and immediately transported to the field research office in a 2–4 °C cold box. Stool was divided into up to eight aliquots (~800 mg to 1 g per aliquot), of which 5–6 were marked for future analyses. Aliquots were then transported to Aga Khan University (AKU) within 4–6 h and frozen without additives at −80 °C.

As the intra-individual correlation of richness and evenness at 12 and 24 months was low, we implemented generalized linear models (GLMs) using the glm function in R to test for group differences, using diversity values averaged from 100 independent rarefactions at read depths of 25,000 (bacteria) or 1000 (protozoa and fungi). Read depths were chosen to ensure sufficient sampling of OTUs while maintaining a representation of samples, a concern for eukaryote data where read depths were highly variable (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). A read depth of 1000 for eukaryotes resulted in a loss of 11 (of 160) samples, while a read depth of 25,000 for prokaryotes resulted in a loss of ten samples.
