                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Glutamate transmission is implicated in drug-induced behavioural sensitization and the associated long-lasting increases in mesolimbic output. Metabotropic glutamate type 5 (mGlu5) receptors might be particularly important, but most details are poorly understood.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We first assessed in mice (<italic>n</italic> = 51, all male) the effects of repeated dextroamphetamine administration (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on locomotor activity and binding of the mGlu5 ligand [<sup>3</sup>H]ABP688. In a parallel study, in 19 stimulant-drug-naïve healthy human volunteers (14 female) we administered 3 doses of dextroamphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.) or placebo, followed by a fourth dose 2 weeks later. We measured [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 binding using positron emission tomography before and after the induction phase. We assessed psychomotor and behavioural sensitization using speech rate, eye blink rate and self-report. We measured the localization of mGlu5 relative to synaptic markers in mouse striatum using immunofluorescence.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We observed amphetamine-induced psychomotor sensitization in mice and humans. We did not see group differences in mGlu5 availability following 3 pre-challenge amphetamine doses, but group differences did develop in mice administered 5 doses. In mice and humans, individual differences in mGlu5 binding after repeated amphetamine administration were negatively correlated with the extent of behavioural sensitization. In drug-naïve mice, mGlu5 was expressed at 67% of excitatory synapses on dendrites of striatal medium spiny neurons.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Limitations</title>
                  <p>Correlational results should be interpreted as suggestive because of the limited sample size. We did not assess sex differences.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Together, these results suggest that changes in mGlu5 availability are not part of the earliest neural adaptations in stimulant-induced behavioural sensitization, but low mGlu5 binding might identify a higher propensity for sensitization.</p>

              <p>Altered glutamate neurotransmission has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including addictions and schizophrenia.<xref rid="b1-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Repeated exposure to addictive drugs and emotionally relevant stimuli such as stress can elicit responses that become progressively larger, a process called sensitization.<xref rid="b3-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="b5-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Sensitized psychomotor responses are commonly used to index incentive sensitization, the strengthening of the appetitive motivational properties of a stimulus or event.<xref rid="b6-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These effects are considered to be central to the aberrant salience hypotheses of addiction<xref rid="b6-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and psychosis.<xref rid="b8-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> One hypothesized locus for these drug-induced changes is at cortical glutamatergic projections onto striatal medium spiny neurons that modulate responses to addictive drugs and emotionally relevant environmental stimuli.<xref rid="b10-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>The metabotropic glutamate type 5 (mGlu5) receptor makes important contributions to the development of sensitization in male laboratory rodents. Mice lacking mGlu5 (mGlu5 knockout) do not develop behavioural sensitization to cocaine,<xref rid="b12-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators diminish the development and expression of sensitization to cocaine and dextroamphetamine (Amph) in rats.<xref rid="b13-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="b15-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Signalling through mGlu5 can also modulate drug and non-drug associative learning.<xref rid="b16-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the context of drug reward, mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators also reduce self-administration of Amph and cocaine, extinction of cocaine seeking, and drug and cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behaviours following extinction. <xref rid="b18-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="b20-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Conversely, exposure to relatively extensive cocaine administration regimens decreased mGlu5 levels in the nucleus accumbens.<xref rid="b18-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b21-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In humans, positron emission tomography (PET) studies with the specific mGlu5 allosteric ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 identified reduced mGlu5 availability in male and female tobacco smokers<xref rid="b23-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and in cocaine-dependent men and women following a brief period (days or weeks) of abstinence. <xref rid="b24-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These findings raise the possibility that mGlu5 could contribute to the altered responses to drugs and environmental stimuli that develop following a repeated drug regimen.</p>
              <p>Based on these observations in both animal models and clinical populations, allosteric modulators of mGlu5 are currently being investigated for the treatment of addiction.<xref rid="b26-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="b28-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Determining if and how mGlu5 availability changes during a sensitization-inducing regimen can inform our understanding of disease etiology and aid in future medication development. The first objective of this study was to test in both mice and humans whether the long-lasting sensitization of behaviourally activating effects produced by repeated exposures to the psychostimulant Amph was related to changes in mGlu5 availability. The second objective was to use immunofluorescence to localize mGlu5 at the level of the synapses of striatal medium spiny neurons. We predicted that Amph treatment would induce changes in mGlu5 availability in the striatum and prefrontal cortex of humans and mice, and that these changes would be associated with greater psychomotor activating responses to Amph.</p>

                  <p>We used male C57BL6 mice (2 to 6 months old) for all experiments in rodents. We used tissue from 3 wild-type mice, 1 mGlu5 knockout mouse (mGlu5-KO; Jackson Laboratory; Grm5 Null/Knockout #003558), and 1 transgenic B6.Cg-Tg (Drd1a-tdTomato)6Calak/J mouse for immunofluorescence experiments.

                  <p>We used 2 Amph sensitization regimens in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-46-1-e1">Fig. 1A</xref>): a 3-dose pretreatment regimen intended to reflect the relatively mild sensitization effects expected in humans; and a 5-dose pretreatment regimen more similar to those found in the existing literature.<xref rid="b4-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We treated the mice with 2 mg/kg Amph or saline (i.p.) daily for 3 days (<italic>n</italic> = 15 for saline, <italic>n</italic> = 12 for Amph) or 5 days (<italic>n</italic> = 12 per group), as previously described. <xref rid="b11-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A 6-day latency followed the induction phase. On day 7 post-induction, mice were given the same treatment they had received previously (i.e., saline or 2 mg/kg Amph). A fifth group of mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6) received 3 injections of saline pretreatment and a challenge dose of Amph. All procedures were carried out during the light cycle, and we measured locomotor activity after each dose (Appendix 1). Animals were killed immediately after the final behavioural session, between 1400 and 1600 h. Their brains were collected, frozen in 2-methylbutane (−30°C) and stored at −80°C.</p>

In 3 consecutive sessions 48 hours apart (days 1, 3, and 5), participants received Amph or placebo. We measured subjective responses, eye-blink rate, speech rate,<xref rid="b32-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> motor response (Actiwatch AW-16, Philips Respironics) and physiologic responses to the drug for 2.5 hours after administration (Appendix 1). Three weeks after the first dose, participants received a final challenge dose or placebo (day 21) — the same treatment they received in the initiation phase. This drug treatment regimen has been reported by our laboratory and others to induce sensitization of striatal dopamine release and behaviour in humans.<xref rid="b3-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b33-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Sensitization was operationally defined as a greater response to the drug on day 21 compared to day 1.

                  <p>Participants underwent PET scans between 1000 and 1330 h on days 1 and 21, immediately followed by pill administration. On a separate day, we performed MRI scans for anatomic coregistration.

                <title>Immunofluorescence</title>
                <p>To better understand the role of mGlu5 in the striatum, we performed immunofluorescence experiments on unfixed, frozen coronal sections of mouse brain to localize this receptor relative to synaptic markers. Detailed procedures are presented in Appendix 1. Brain sections taken at the level of the striatum from wild-type or mGlu5-KO mice were incubated with mGlu5 mouse antiserum (1:700; EMD Millipore MABN139) in the presence or absence of VGLUT1 guinea pig antiserum (1:2500; EMD Millipore AB5905) and PSD95 rabbit antiserum (1:2000; Abcam ab18258). To visualize mGlu5 on a subset of medium spiny neurons, we performed immunofluorescence experiments on sections from a Drd1a-tdTomato mouse, which expressed a modified DsRed fluorescent protein under control of the mouse Drd1a promoter. We acquired triple-label and Drd1a-tdTomato mouse images on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880 with airyscan detector; Carl Zeiss). We used Imaris software version 8.0.2 (Bitplane AG) to render fluorescent labelling as surfaces and to perform colocalization analysis. We performed distance analysis using the DiAna plugin<xref rid="b36-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> for ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).</p>

                  <p>Groups were similar in terms of age, sex, smoking status and stimulant drug history, although participants randomized to the placebo group had slightly higher novelty-seeking scores (<xref rid="t1-46-1-e1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                  <p>A significant treatment × session interaction emerged for speech rate (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,48</sub> = 4.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). This reflected a significant increase in speech rate after the fourth dose compared to the first dose of Amph (<italic>t</italic><sub>8</sub> = −4.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) but not of placebo (<italic>t</italic><sub>9</sub> = −0.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-46-1-e1">Fig. 2C</xref>). Drug treatment did not affect eye-blink rate or motor activity as measured by Actiwatch counts (data not shown).</p>
                  <p>We observed significant main effects of treatment on activating responses (alertness, mind racing and energy VAS; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,17</sub> = 9.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) and feelings of euphoria/high (excitement, rush, high and euphoria; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,17</sub> = 14, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), but not on anxiety (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,17</sub> = 0.023, <italic>p</italic> = 0.88) or conscious motivation (drug liking and wanting to take again; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,17</sub> = 0.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.67; Appendix 1, Table S1). An absence of some drug effects was not surprising given the relatively low doses and our population of healthy drug non-users. For the activating effects, a subscale × treatment interaction was also present (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,34</sub> = 4.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.021). We performed planned comparisons within each group based on a priori hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-46-1-e1">Fig. 2D</xref>). Among the activating effects subscales, ratings for mind racing were significantly greater on day 21 (fourth dose of Amph) than on day 1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>9</sub> = −2.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.035), although these findings did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Activating VAS summary scores (<italic>t</italic><sub>9</sub> = −2.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) and ARCI Amph scores (<italic>Z</italic> = −1.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) showed trend-level effects reflecting higher scores on day 21.

                  <p>Plasma Amph concentration increased, and blood pressure, heart rate and serum cortisol levels were significantly elevated following each drug administration (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but these did not differ across sessions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.25; Appendix 1).</p>

                  <p>We found that [<sup>3</sup>H]ABP688 binding sites were not present in brain slices from the mGlu5-KO mouse or in the presence of 10 μ<italic>M</italic> MPEP, a selective mGlu5 antagonist. This finding indicated that the ligand bound specifically to mGlu5. We then measured [<sup>3</sup>H]ABP688 binding sites on coronal sections from the mice that underwent behavioural tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-46-1-e1">Fig. 3A</xref>). The regional distribution of mGlu5 was similar in mice and humans. We found that [<sup>3</sup>H]ABP688 binding sites were highly abundant in the septum, dense in the striatum and relatively abundant in the cingulate and prelimbic cortex in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-46-1-e1">Fig. 3A</xref>), consistent with previous work.<xref rid="b37-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In the salinetreated animals, binding was significantly different across the 3 regions quantified (<italic>F</italic><sub>25,1</sub> = 47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), reflecting higher binding in the striatum and nucleus accumbens than in the prelimbic cortex (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We found no difference in mGlu5 binding in the dorsal striatum or nucleus accumbens in animals pretreated with 3 Amph doses compared to saline-treated controls (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-46-1-e1">Fig. 3B and C</xref> and Appendix 1, Table S2). We found that mGlu5 was significantly reduced in the dorsal striatum in animals pretreated with 5 Amph doses compared to saline-treated controls (<italic>t</italic><sub>19</sub> = 2.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.038). We observed a nonsignificant trend toward a decline in the nucleus accumbens of Amph-treated mice (<italic>t</italic><sub>19</sub> = 1.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.086; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-46-1-e1">Fig. 3B and C</xref>).

                  <p>We used PET with [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 to assess mGlu5 binding availability across the brain before and after stimulant sensitization (<xref rid="t2-46-1-e1" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-46-1-e1">Fig. 3D to G</xref>). As we observed previously in a larger sample,<xref rid="b38-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> the overall BP<sub>ND</sub> was higher in men than women (<italic>t</italic><sub>15</sub> = −2.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015) by an average of 26% across regions (Appendix 1, Figure S4). A single day 1 scan in each of the Amph and placebo groups was excluded because of low injected activity and high injected mass, respectively (Appendix 1), resulting in a final sample size for primary PET comparisons of 9 Amph-treated participants and 8 placebo participants. Detailed test–retest analyses of variability in the placebo group have been reported previously.<xref rid="b39-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p>

                  <p>We analyzed individual differences in drug response in humans by assessing correlations between BP<sub>ND</sub> values and speech rate, VAS mind racing scores and ARCI Amph scores. We observed no correlation between day 1 BP<sub>ND</sub> and response to dose 1 or change in response from day 1 to day 21 (Appendix 1, Fig. S5). However, the extent of the change in mind racing ratings was negatively correlated with BP<sub>ND</sub> on day 21 in the dorsal striatum (<italic>r</italic> = −0.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-46-1-e1">Fig. 4C</xref>), ventral striatum (<italic>r</italic> = −0.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.037; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-46-1-e1">Fig. 4D</xref>), prefrontal cortex (<italic>r</italic> = −0.70, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-46-1-e1">Fig. 4E</xref>; Appendix 1, Table S3), insula (<italic>r</italic> = −0.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.037) and cingulate (<italic>r</italic> = −0.67, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034; Appendix 1, Figure S6). We observed no correlation in the occipital cortex (<italic>r</italic> = −0.29, <italic>p</italic> = 0.91; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-46-1-e1">Fig. 4F</xref>); this relationship appeared to be specific to the striatum and regions of the cortex implicated in stimulant drug responses and sensitization. We observed nonsignificant trend-level associations with ARCI Amph scores in the prefrontal cortex only (<italic>r</italic> = −0.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07), and we found no correlation between BP<sub>ND</sub> and change in speech rate (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.16; Appendix 1, Fig. S7). Associations with mind racing were also present in partial correlations with sex included as a covariate (prefrontal cortex <italic>r</italic> = −0.70, <italic>p</italic> = 0.036; dorsal striatum <italic>r</italic> = −0.58, <italic>p</italic> = 0.010; ventral striatum <italic>r</italic> = −0.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.040) but no longer reached conventional levels of significance in the insula (<italic>r</italic> = −0.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056) or the cingulate (<italic>r</italic> = −0.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.057).</p>
                  <p>To explore this effect further, we created subgroups by median split, comparing BP<sub>ND</sub> values in people who showed a high change on mind racing scores from day 1 to day 21 (sensitizers) with those whose scores changed little (non-sensitizers). In the associative striatum, equivalent to the dorsomedial striatum in mice, BP<sub>ND</sub> increased in non-sensitizers (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, <italic>Z</italic> = −2.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.043) but not in sensitizers (<italic>Z</italic> = 0.0, <italic>p</italic> = 1.0). On day 21, BP<sub>ND</sub> was higher in non-sensitizers than in sensitizers (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>U</italic> = 2.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.032; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-46-1-e1">Fig. 4G</xref>). This finding suggests that those with a lower propensity for behavioural sensitization experienced drug-induced increases in mGlu5 availability in the associative striatum.</p>

                <title>Distribution of mGlu5 in the rodent nucleus accumbens</title>
                <p>Relationships between mGlu5 availability and sensitization were consistent across species in the striatum. Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence experiments to explore the localization of mGluR5 in mouse striatum relative to synaptic markers. We first validated an mGlu5 antiserum by comparing its labelling in the striatum of wild-type mice and mGlu5-KO mice. In wild-type mice, mGlu5 immunopositive puncta were widely distributed across the neuropil of the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5A</xref>) and the dorsal striatum (not shown). These immunopositive puncta were absent in mGlu5-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
                <p>Using confocal microscopy and surface reconstruction, we then examined the subcellular localization of mGlu5. Receptor distribution was widespread across the nucleus accumbens and frequently apposed close to both VGLUT1- and PSD95-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5C to H</xref>). Colocalization analyses showed that mGlu5 fluorescent labelling was present at 67 ± 27% of VGLUT1/PSD95-positive sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5H and I</xref>). These structures represent putative excitatory synapses. Conversely, 50 ± 14% of mGlu5-positive puncta were located at these VGLUT1/PSD95-positive sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5H</xref>), whereas 35 ± 1.3% of mGlu5-positive puncta were located in proximity to PSD95 alone and 15 ± 13% of mGlu5-positive puncta were associated with neither PSD95 nor VGLUT1 labelling. These data suggest that approximately half of the total striatal mGlu5 is associated with VGLUT1-expressing synapses, and half with other excitatory synapses (possibly VGLUT2-positive thalamostriatal synapses), modulatory sites or inhibitory synapses. In the dorsal striatum, 46% of VGLUT1–PSD95 pairs also expressed mGlu5, and 49% of mGlu5 were close to these markers (not shown). Distance analyses showed that on average, mGlu5 was located closer to PSD95 (median edge-to-edge distance 150 ± 12 nm) than to VGLUT1 markers (median distance 190 ± 18 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5J</xref>). This finding was consistent with a predominantly postsynaptic localization of mGlu5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5K</xref>, inset). Finally, we investigated the distribution of mGlu5 in D1-positive or -negative (putatively D2-expressing) medium spiny neurons from the nucleus accumbens. We performed immunofluorescent detection of mGlu5 on brain sections from Drd1a-tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5L</xref>). Immunofluorescent mGlu5 puncta were densely expressed along neurites that did not express D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5M to M‴</xref>, green mGlu5 labelling separate from red D1 labelling) and along D1-positive neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5N to N‴</xref>, mGlu5 labelling colocalized with D1 labelling). These data show that mGlu5 is strategically localized on dendritic spines of medium spiny neurons to modulate excitatory inputs into the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5K</xref>).</p>

              <p>In the present work, we measured mGlu5 availability during Amph sensitization in rodents and in healthy humans. An Amph regimen sufficient to induce mild behavioural sensitization was not associated with statistically significant changes in mGlu5 availability. Reductions in receptor binding in the mouse striatum were seen following a slightly more extensive stimulant treatment. Together, these results suggest that although changes in mGlu5 availability develop with continued drug use, these changes are not necessary for the process of sensitization. In both humans and mice, lower mGlu5 availability after drug treatment was associated with greater behavioural sensitization to Amph.</p>
              <p>Lower mGlu5 availability has been observed following cocaine self-administration sessions in rodents<xref rid="b40-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and in people with moderate to severe cocaine use disorders.<xref rid="b24-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Fewer studies have examined the effects of sensitization regimens themselves, in either rodents or humans. In laboratory animals, one Amph sensitization experiment reported reduced mGlu5 mRNA,<xref rid="b41-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> while another found no difference in protein or mRNA levels.<xref rid="b42-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The present work suggests that regimens of 3 to 5 moderate doses encompass the threshold minimum number of Amph exposures necessary to induce clear changes in mGlu5 availability. This work also presents the first study of mGlu5 binding during sensitization in humans. Because the drug regimen used here is sufficient to induce sensitized striatal dopamine release in humans,<xref rid="b3-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the present results raise the possibility that dopamine sensitization may occur independently of changes in mGlu5 availability. Therefore, changes in mGlu5 binding availability might not be a component of initial brain changes associated with behavioural sensitization. The reduced mGlu5 binding seen in people who are cocaine-dependent and in rodent models during stimulant withdrawal or abstinence could be a compensatory response to heightened striatal excitability after sensitization.</p>
              <p>In both mice and humans, a pattern emerged in which individual differences in striatal mGlu5 were negatively correlated with Amph-induced behavioural sensitization. In rodents, low post-drug mGlu5 binding was associated with greater initial and sensitized locomotor response to Amph. In humans, this relationship was seen in that subjective psychoactivating drug effects (mind racing) covaried with binding in the cortex and striatum and was not observed with either baseline receptor availability or initial drug response. In the associative striatum, subgroup analyses suggest that this may have been related to a failure in sensitizing individuals to upregulate mGlu5 after drug exposure, although this should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. Together, these relationships raise the possibility that low endogenous mGlu5 activity could mark or contribute to an individual’s propensity for sensitization, a trait associated with greater drug-seeking behaviours in animal models.<xref rid="b43-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Low mGlu5 early in drug use could therefore be relevant to risk for Amph addiction. The present work suggests that impaired glutamate signalling or a hypoglutamatergic baseline state after the initiation of drug treatment could contribute to elevated responses to Amph, similar to what has been described for cocaine<xref rid="b45-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> but not methamphetamine.<xref rid="b46-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Notably, in contrast with our finding that low mGlu5 binding is associated with greater sensitization to Amph, blocking mGlu5 signalling in rodents reduces sensitization and reinstatement in cocaine-treated animals. <xref rid="b12-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="b15-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b47-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="b49-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This might reflect different effects of cocaine versus Amph, influences of mGlu5 signalling on reward-related learning rather than sensitization in itself, or an important distinction between the normal variation observed in healthy, drug-naïve participants here and the effects of nonphysiologic pharmacological manipulations of mGlu5 signalling. The roles of mGlu5 in risk for drug-related behaviours in healthy people and in drug-induced plasticity require further study. Pharmacological reduction of mGlu5 activity also leads to impairments in synaptic plasticity and associative learning, including the acquisition and extinction of cocaine seeking and conditioned place preference. <xref rid="b16-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b19-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b50-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> This suggests that mGlu5 activity is involved in establishing and updating drug-related associations. We speculate that low mGlu5 availability could contribute to an impaired ability to modulate drug responses and associations, leading to more rigid behaviours in the presence of drug-related stimuli. This model is consistent with the proposition that positive allosteric modulators at mGlu5 could be an effective adjunct to cue-exposure therapy by facilitating the extinction of drug-cue associations and the learning of new goal-directed behaviours.<xref rid="b26-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b52-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p>
              <p>Immunofluorescence experiments suggest that strategic expression of mGlu5 at excitatory striatal synapses could underlie some of these relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5K</xref>). Previous studies report mixed results regarding localization of mGlu5, including its expression in presynaptic terminals and neuronal cell bodies in the striatum.<xref rid="b53-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="b55-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> In line with our findings, electron microscopy studies of mGlu5 in rats and primates previously suggested that mGlu5 is frequently localized in dendritic spines in the nucleus accumbens, in close proximity to synapses.<xref rid="b56-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="b57-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> The estimated distance between VGLUT1–PSD95 pairs in this study (130 nm) was similar to the 100 nm distance calculated on individual dendritic spines,<xref rid="b58-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> suggesting that our data provide a reasonable estimate of the distribution of mGlu5 at the level of striatal synapses. Our finding that mGlu5 is expressed at approximately two-thirds of excitatory VGLUT1-positive synapses (PSD95- and VGLUT1-positive sites) was in line with that of a previous study, in which mGlu5 labelling was observed on approximately 40% to 50% of cortical inputs and 70% of amygdalar inputs to dendrites in the nucleus accumbens.<xref rid="b56-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> In the present work, VGLUT1-positive sites accounted for half of all mGlu5 labelling. Roughly one-third of mGlu5 labelling was colocalized with PSD95-positive, VGLUT1-negative structures. These sites may represent thalamostriatal inputs, which express VGLUT2 instead of VGLUT1.<xref rid="b59-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-46-1-e1">Fig. 5L to N</xref> shows mGlu5 labelling along the dendrites of medium spiny neurons in both direct (D1-positive) and indirect (D1-negative) pathways. This expression pattern was consistent with the receptor’s role in mediating associative learning by facilitating glutamatergic activity and plasticity.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The human PET study used BP<sub>ND</sub> as an outcome measure, although previous studies have found evidence of specific binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 in the cerebellum.<xref rid="b60-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> We previously found that BP<sub>ND</sub> correlates well with volume of distribution (V<sup>T</sup>) values derived using an arterial input function;<xref rid="b61-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> nevertheless, changes in cerebellar mGlu5 may have masked (or amplified) observed effects in this study. In the human study, variability in BP<sub>ND</sub> was high, although lower than in previous studies.<xref rid="b62-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> This finding, combined with the modest sample size, limited the study’s power to detect more subtle changes in mGlu5 binding. Further, novelty seeking scores were higher in the placebo group than the Amph group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04; Appendix 1, Table S1), which may have limited our ability to induce sensitization with this moderate regimen.<xref rid="b3-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> An Amph dosing regimen that produced relatively mild acute and sensitized psychomotor effects likely compounded this issue (i.e., only modest changes in mGlu5 binding might be expected from a modest drug regimen). This is also relevant to behavioural measures in humans: although we observed a robust increase in speech rate on day 21 in the Amph group, sensitization effects on subjective self-report scales were mild or at trend level in most cases and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Nevertheless, because our mouse experiments with lower overall variability yielded results that were highly consistent with our findings in humans, they gave greater confidence in both the negative and positive results.</p>
                <p>In comparing across species, several protocol differences should be noted. We measured receptor binding before the challenge dose in humans and immediately after the final dose in mice, allowing for the possibility that acute effects of Amph on glutamate or on mGlu5 affected binding measures. We observed no difference in mGlu5 binding after acute Amph in a group of saline-pretreated animals (Appendix 1, Fig. S3), concordant with previous studies, <xref rid="b41-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> but this distinction between the 2 protocols should be kept in mind. Conversely, making primary comparisons in the mouse study between saline/saline-treated and Amph/Amph-treated animals to best compare with the human study was atypical for sensitization studies and may limit comparison with other literature. Second, measurements taken in vivo in humans and postmortem in animals are subject to different influences; binding in the human study could conceivably have been influenced by stress or other physiologic factors. Similarly, binding comparisons in animals were performed between subjects, not within subjects. A parsimonious explanation is that the relationship between sensitization and mGlu5 binding is consistent across species, although we do not rule out the possibility that the convergent observations arose from different influences and mechanisms in the 2 species. Finally, the use of only male mice was an important limitation, given baseline sex differences in mGlu5 binding in humans.<xref rid="b38-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The human study was not sufficiently powered to detect sex differences in sensitization effects on mGlu5, but these might exist. Female rodents show a greater propensity to develop behavioural sensitization to psychostimulants, <xref rid="b63-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> and estradiol interacts with mGlu5 to potentiate cocaine sensitization.<xref rid="b64-46-1-e1" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>These studies suggest that large changes in mGlu5 availability are not a component of the earliest neural adaptations contributing to Amph sensitization. Nevertheless, the experiments in mice indicate that they may begin to develop with higher levels of drug exposure. Further, low mGlu5 following initiation of drug use was associated with a tendency to develop stronger drug responses, which may be associated with greater drug-seeking behaviours. Expression of mGlu5 at the majority of excitatory corticostriatal inputs may contribute to these effects.</p>

Locomotor activity after dose 1 and challenge in animals given 3 or 5 pre-challenge doses of 2 mg/kg Amph (i.p.). Locomotor activation is presented as the sum of the distance travelled in 90 minutes after amphetamine injection (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]). C and D: humans.

Values represent mean ± SEM area under the curve (AUC) of the scores on each subscale during the drug session. Alertness, mind racing and energy were considered activating effects; excitement, rush, high and euphoria were considered euphoric/high effects; drug liking and wanting to take again were considered conscious motivational effects.

H: surface reconstruction of G, showing sites of VGLUT1–PSD95 colocalization, presumed to represent excitatory synapses (circles). mGlu5 is commonly located at these sites (arrowheads), at sites expressing PSD95 but not VGLUT1 (arrows), and at sites not expressing either marker (asterisks). I: left panel, 67% of VGLUT1–PSD95 pairs (putative synapses) had mGlu5 labelling; right panel, of all mGlu5 labelling, 50% occurred at VGLUT1–PSD95 sites, 35% at sites expressing PSD95 but not VGLUT1, and 15% at sites not expressing either label. J: Mean (± standard error of the mean [SEM]) distance between pairs of labels. K: widespread expression of mGlu5 on dendritic spines facilitates glutamatergic inputs to striatal medium spiny neurons. Inset: distance analysis demonstrating predominantly postsynaptic localization of mGlu5. L: mGlu5 labelling (green) and nuclei (blue, Hoechst stain) on sections from Drd1a-tdTomato mice (D1+ neurons in red).
