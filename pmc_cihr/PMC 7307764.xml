                  <title>Importance/Background</title>
                  <p>Movement-controlled video games have potential to promote home-based practice of therapy activities. The success of therapy gaming interventions depends on the quality of the technology used <italic>and</italic> the presence of effective support structures.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Aim</title>
                  <p>This study assesses the feasibility of a novel intervention that combines a co-created gaming technology integrating evidence-based biofeedback and solution-focused coaching (SFC) strategies to support therapy engagement and efficacy at home.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Following feasibility and single-case reporting standards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pilotfeasibilitystudies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40814-016-0105-8">CONSORT</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-17382-001">SCRIBE</ext-link>), this was a non-blind, randomized, multiple-baseline, AB, design. Nineteen (19) young people with cerebral palsy (8–18 years old) completed the 4-week home-based intervention in France and Canada.</p>
                  <p>Participant motivations, personalized practice goals, and relevance of the intervention to daily activities were discussed in a Solution Focused Coaching-style conversation pre-, post-intervention and during weekly check-ins. Participants controlled a video game by completing therapeutic gestures (wrist extension, pinching) detected via electromyography and inertial sensors on the forearm (Myo Armband and custom software).</p>
                  <p><italic>Process feasibility</italic> success criteria for recruitment response, completion and adherence rates, and frequency of technical issues were established <italic>a priori</italic>. <italic>Scientific feasibility</italic>, <italic>effect size estimates and variance were determined for Body Function</italic> outcome measures: active wrist extension, grip strength and Box and Blocks Test; and for <italic>Activities and Participation</italic> measures: Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Self-Reported Experiences of Activity Settings (SEAS).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Recruitment response (31%) and assessment completion (84%) rates were good and 74% of participants reached self-identified practice goals. As 17% of technical issues required external support to resolve, the intervention was graded as <italic>feasible with modifications</italic>. No adverse events were reported.</p>
                  <p>Moderate effects were observed in Body Function measures (active wrist extension: SMD = 1.82, 95%CI = 0.85–2.78; Grip Strength: SMD = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.65–1.91; Box and Blocks: Hedge’s g = 0.58, 95%CI = -0.11–1.27) and small-moderate effects in Activities and Participation measures (AHA: Hedge’s g = 0.29, 95%CI = -0.39–0.97, COPM: r = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.13–0.82, SEAS: r = 0.24, 95%CI = -0.25–0.61).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>A definitive RCT to investigate the effectiveness of this novel intervention is warranted. Combining SFC-style coaching with high-quality biofeedback may positively engage youth in home rehabilitation to complement traditional therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Interactive computer play (ICP) is <italic>“any kind of computer game or virtual reality technology where the individual can interact and play with virtual objects in a computer-generated environment”</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is an attractive way to augment traditional therapy and align with children’s interest. Eight of 10 young people with Cerebral Palsy (CP) enjoy playing video games recreationally [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cerebral Palsy (CP) is neuromuscular disability impacting approximately 2.11 per 1,000 live births in high-resource settings [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CP presents with positive and negative motor signs including: spasticity, weakness, impaired selective motor control and sensory deficits [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ICP has been used to improve balance [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], gait symmetry [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], upper limb strength [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and other functional abilities in people with CP. Perhaps the largest study to date in this field is the ‘Move it to improve it’ (MITII) randomized controlled trial that used web-based therapy at home to improve occupational performance and visual perception in children with unilateral CP [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These types of studies have shown moderate evidence towards improving balance and overall motor skill but weak evidence towards improving upper extremity skills, joint control, gait and strength [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In part, the success of ICP-based therapies in the home has been thwarted by the challenge of (i) delivering high quality feedback that informs individuals with CP on any progress towards therapy goals as a therapist would in a clinic setting [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and (ii) sustaining engagement in the intervention over an extended period. Children with CP and their families have expressed a desire for more accurate feedback within ICP [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and reported the challenge of sustaining intrinsic interest in ICP therapies in the home.</p>

                <title>High quality feedback</title>
                <p>Improving feedback quality in ICP can increase practice engagement and efficiency at home [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Biofeedback, where a people receives information about their body state (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. heart rate, foot speed, muscle activity) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], can help increase awareness and control by informing them how their body is functioning [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Echoing families’ remarks, a recent systematic review found that most interventions using biofeedback do so in a way that positions the people in a passive role in their practice and builds dependency, hindering motor learning progress [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
                <p>Working with young people with CP and clinicians, we recently co-created an evidence-based biofeedback strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s001">S1 File</xref>). The implementation improves biofeedback use (efficiency, effectiveness, engagement) by offering autonomy, varying feedback presentation (e.g. visual, audio), and being proportionate to the person’s ability [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These mechanisms serve to improve the effectiveness of ICP therapies. They help direct the person to higher-quality movements at home where practice is completed without therapist supervision and provide a stronger cognitive link between game-focused (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. scoring points) and therapy-focused (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. decreased compensatory movements) goals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

                <title>Sustaining engagement</title>
                <p>Low adherence is a primary concern in home-based interventions, historically ranging from 34–67% [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A recent review consistently found engagement and adherence difficult to maintain [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To improve adherence and engagement, an intervention must closely align with participants values and sustain their intrinsic motivation [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Intrinsic motivation is influenced by both the ICP technology (feedback, activity personalization), and the intervention design (therapist interaction, social support). Solution-focused coaching in pediatric rehabilitation (SFC-Peds) is a model of coaching recommended for youth with disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. SFC-Peds builds intrinsic motivation to generate personal interest in health behaviour changes [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In SFC-Peds, coaches collaborate with children to help them envision their “preferred future” [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Through this process, children develop therapy goals and a supporting plan that aligns with their priorities.</p>

                <title>Aim</title>
                <p>The success of an ICP intervention is influenced both by the technology used and the supports provided. In this project, we investigate the combination of a novel ICP technology integrating evidence-based biofeedback and Solution Focused Coaching strategies to promote home-based practice of hand/arm exercises. The ICP is a video game where participants complete therapeutic hand gestures to control game actions on-screen. The approach aims to provide a motivational, goal-based environment to address muscle weakness and selective motor control. This paper addresses intervention feasibility as articulated by Thabane et al (2010) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This framework highlights that the aim of feasibility testing can be related to one or more of the following four classifications: process, resources, management and scientific. The objective here is to support development towards future randomized controlled trials and not to define statistical or clinical effectiveness of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we concentrate on two of the four feasibility classifications:</p>
                <p>First, we assess <italic>process feasibility</italic> of the biofeedback-enhanced therapy video game intervention protocol for young people with CP. The objective here is to determine the ability to enroll participants, enable home-based practice, and retain their activity during a 1-month intervention. To this purpose, <italic>a priori</italic> success criteria were established for the recruitment and response rates, adherence, and frequency of technical difficulties impeding home practice [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>Second, we assess the <italic>scientific feasibility</italic> of the intervention by estimating the effect size and variance for six person-centred outcome measures for the hand and wrist. The measures are aligned to the Body Functions and Activities and Participation chapters of the ICF (international classification of functioning disability and health) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>A randomized, multiple-baseline, single-case experimental design (SCED) with two phases was applied. SCED designs can provide strong evidence wherein participants serve as their own controls for the purpose of within-subject comparison [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. SCED research typically involves collecting a representative baseline phase through repeated measurements of an outcome of interest (Phase 1) that is then compared with the intervention phase (Phase 2). In a randomized SCED design, the time lapse between Phase 1 and Phase 2 is randomly allocated for each participant to further mitigate threats to internal validity [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SCED designs are increasingly used in clinical intervention research, particularly when sample size is limited, SCEDs can provide a rigorous approach to generate higher quality evidence [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this feasibility study, the Single-Case Reporting Guideline in Behavioural Interventions (SCRIBE) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) methodologies were used (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s002">S2 File</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s003">S3 File</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Participants, researchers and assessing therapists were not blind to treatment phase. One methodological change occurred during the first week of enrollment. Inclusion criteria was expanded to include those with mixed tone and mild dystonia since it was found that they could control the game effectively and the potential therapeutic value was confirmed by clinicians. Procedural fidelity was maintained by following a standard operating protocol outlining the activities and resources for each phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s004">S4 File</xref>). Ethical approval was obtained by Holland Bloorview’s Research Ethics Board (approved July 27, 2018, amended November 23, 2018, to include participants with mixed tone and mild dystonia) and the French national Comité de protection des personnes (CPP) (approved July 6, 2018). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.</p>

                  <p>Participants met once with the researcher and Occupational Therapist (60 minutes) in clinic. In a Solution-focused Coaching style [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] conversation, they discussed: motivations for participating, personalized scheduling and practice goals, how the intervention connects to daily activities. By the end of this conversation, participants established Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) goals [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Caregivers were present if desired. The dialogue was intended to improve cognitive engagement and consequently, home-play adherence [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therapists and researchers guiding these conversations received one day of formal training and practiced scenarios with a certified SFC coach. Fidelity to the coaching style was maintained by following a conversation checklist developed with the certified SFC coach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s004">S4 File</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Following the coaching conversation, a therapist assessed bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA)) and gross manual dexterity (Box and Blocks (B&amp;B)). The researcher visited each participant’s home for multiple baseline testing of wrist extension and grip strength (3–6 visits, 30-minutes sessions). The number of baseline sessions was ‘data-driven’ to establish stability in the primary measure of effectiveness: active wrist extension–open fingers (AWEO). Stability was defined as 80% of phase 1 data within interquartile range [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. After baseline, participants waited a computer-generated randomized number of days (between 1–10 days) to begin the intervention.</p>

In the SFC-Peds style conversation, therapists helped participants identify which gesture to practice based on the daily activities that were established to be important to them. All but two participants practiced wrist extension. In the game, participants are rewarded by making the gesture at the correct time with high quality (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. high forearm extensor activity and isolated hand movement).</p>

Participants start with the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion, the forearm pronated to the extent possible and the upper arm alongside the trunk. With the forearm fixed by the assessor, the child performs three wrist extensions per side [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Positive values indicate extension above neutral wrist position and values are recorded to the nearest five degrees, the minimal detectable difference [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the relevant population passive movement tests show very good test–retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC): 0.81–0.94) and moderate inter-rater reliability (correlation coefficients between 0.48–0.73 [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Second, <bold><italic>grip strength</italic></bold> was measured using a modified sphygmomanometer to evaluate relative changes in grip capacity [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The child sits with the arm adducted, the elbow flexed at 90 degrees and the forearm and wrist in neutral position (if possible). Participants maximally squeeze the device three times per side.

Post-hoc analyses showed small to no relationship between practice time and functional change scores (B&amp;B, r = 0.19; AHA, r = 0.20; COPM, r = 0.30; SEAS, r = 0.08). Four weeks of the intervention showed a small effect in AHA score (Hedge’s g = 0.29, 95%CI = -0.39–0.97). AHA scores ranged between 32–77 at pre-test and 40–79 at post with a median change of +1.5 logit units. There was a moderate effect for COPM Performance scores (r = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.13–0.82). Median COPM change was +1 post intervention ranging from -2–5. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s008">S1 Table</xref> for COPM Goals.

              <p>This study assesses the feasibility of novel intervention combining Solution Focused Coaching strategies with biofeedback-enhanced movement-controlled gaming. Most but not all <italic>a priori</italic> success criteria were met, as such the intervention approach is <italic>feasible with modifications</italic>, most notably in the refinement of the technology to mitigate technical issues. Clinical outcomes of the intervention were promising with moderate effects in Body Function measures and small-moderate effects in Activities and Participation measures.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and adherence</title>
                <p>This study shows comparable recruitment and retention rates to similar interventions. When reported, previous home-based ICP interventions have shown 37–46% recruitment of eligible participants and 66–90% retention through the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Adherence was relatively high compared to other studies which have shown participants complete 53–78% of practice goals during intervention periods 4–20 weeks long [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Few studies transparently report relevant metrics of the practice (timing, duration intensity) which makes it difficult to quantify and compare the therapy dose between studies. Standardized reporting in this area would facilitate meta-analyses needed to strengthen the evidence for home-based gaming interventions. At the observed effect size, 0.29, in bimanual performance (AHA change score), 127 participants would be required for the definitive RCT assuming alpha significance set to 0.05 and a desired power = 0.9. AHA change score was chosen to estimate the sample size instead of active wrist extension capacity since it measures functional bimanual performance and has a more direct relationship with ability to perform activities of daily living.</p>

                <title>Implementation</title>
                <p>It is important to note that this is the first investigation of the novel home-based gaming intervention and accordingly focused on <italic>process</italic> and <italic>scientific feasibility</italic>. Specifically, the study focuses on determining the extent to which the intervention could be used at home and estimating the effect size and variance it might have. Towards conducting a complete RCT, more studies and development would be needed to ascertain real-world feasibility, addressing resources and management. This includes a proper health economics analysis and evaluation of the logistic organization with respect to an institute’s existing therapeutic practices. It should also be noted that participants in Canada and France were off treatment blocks but visited their care provider for regularly scheduled check-ups, either annually or quarterly. Two participants, B and F, took additional weekly therapy sessions outside of the rehabilitation centre and one participant, J, attended the school at the rehabilitation centre and would see the occupational therapist as needed.</p>

                <title>Motivation</title>
                <p>We expect that the coaching and biofeedback strategies helped maintain participants’ engagement in the intervention. Biofeedback was linked to a variety of short- and long-term goals in the game. Participants’ motivations were linked to game biofeedback. Participants regularly chose to review their progress and adapted their movements in response to game feedback (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s001">S1 File</xref>). The Solution Focused Coaching strategy helped to maintain cognitive engagement in the intervention, reiterating how the game addressed functional goals. The positive, self-directed rhetoric was more effective with participants who believed that the game addressed their functional goals. Five of 19 participants did not reach their practice goals. These participants showed a novelty effect, with little interest after 1–2 weeks with the new game. These participants commented that they felt the activity did not align with their functional goals (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>Spread thumb easier to use joystick when playing video games</italic>) indicating a lack of cognitive engagement. Participants who were less convinced of the relevance of the task found it more difficult to participate in the coaching conversations and verbalize how their success in the game could translate to daily activities. In such cases, we explored alternative motivation strategies (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. parent-identified rewards for adhering to practice goals, or leader boards playing to a competitive nature). The SFC strategy required flexibility in the conversation and training structure. We would recommend it as a tool to engage participants but would not rely solely on SFC. Overall our learning in this study defends the importance of ensuring that home-based ICP therapy activities align with individual motivations and goals to support cognitive, affective and behavioural engagement in the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

                <title>Body function</title>
                <p>Active wrist extension is moderately to highly related to manual abilities [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In the current study, 12 of 17 participants increased active wrist extension by at least 5 degrees. These findings are consistent with other home-based supplemental therapy activities. Comparatively, [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found 6±3 degrees improvement in wrist extension across 30 young children with CP after 24 weeks at 3 * 60 minutes/week and [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] saw 18±12 degrees change with four participants after 30 minutes * 5 sessions of EMG-based neurotherapy. Note, the wide range in practice time and different nature of the interventions may contribute to the inconsistency between studies.</p>
                <p>Wrist extension capacity is also directly related to grip strength [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Accordingly, we saw 18% average improvement in non-dominant grip strength relative to the dominant side across participants. However, normative data for children’s grip strength, as compared to the dominant side using the modified sphygmomanometer are not available. For comparison, [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported an average 15% grip strength improvement after 12-weeks hand function training in 15 children with CP. [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] observed a median 25% change from 5 participants pre-test values after 8-weeks of single joint resistance training combined with Botulinum toxin A injections.</p>
                <p>Post-hoc analyses showed differences in Body Function effect based on CP severity. Participants with more severe involvement (MACS level II) had greater gains in active wrist extension (8±10°) and smaller gains in grip strength (-8±7%) compared to participants at MACS level I. Statistical confirmation is not advised based on sample size and variance. More severely affected participants, those at MACS II had below neutral maximum wrist extension. Therefore, there was more opportunity for amplitude improvement, but without being in an extended posture, it is difficult to optimize grip strength.</p>
                <p>[<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] established through path analysis from records of 136 children with CP that grip strength indirectly contributes to manual ability (Abilhand-Kids) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] via its influence on gross manual dexterity (B&amp;B) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Consequently, active wrist extension and grip strength may indicate changes in manual ability relevant to daily activities. Despite this, we recognize the increased focus and relevance towards Activity and Participation measures [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Accordingly, the Activity and Participation measures were included in this early-stage feasibility study.</p>

                <title>Activities and participation</title>
                <p>There were small effects in Activities and Participation related measures (AHA, COPM). A minority of participants met or exceeded clinically meaningful thresholds (3/19 for AHA and 8/19 for COPM), while the majority showed non-clinically significant positive changes. The small effect is most likely due to low dosage and the nature of the activity. Further considering this relatively small dose across all participants, it is not surprising to see small correlations between practice time and functional change scores. The biofeedback video game practices specific functional movements but it is not an activity-based intervention (e.g. Constraint Induced Movement Therapy) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Since practical manual ability is not the simple summation of skill and structure it would be unreasonable to expect gross transfer to daily tasks. However, considering the need for diverse and engaging rehabilitation strategies and the relative low risk of harm of this ICP intervention it may be a useful supplement to activity-based interventions. It may help accelerate Body Function changes (e.g. active wrist extension, grip strength) to facilitate manual ability improvements. This question could be addressed in future clinical trials.</p>
                <p>The SEAS questionnaire showed that participants experience was consistent during the 4-weeks. This corresponds with observations during the weekly check-in conversations. Only in the five participants who experienced a novelty effect, as described above, did we observe a decrease in the sub-scale score, Psychological Engagement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234767.s009">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

              <sec id="sec035">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Due to resource limitations, a single game was built which may not have optimally appealed to the wide range in ages (8–18 years) and interests of the participants. General interest in video games or this game was not an inclusion criterion. Considering the impact personal motivation has on adherence and the vast differences in personal preferences, it is essential to match participants to activities that interest them. Greater choice and game variety, while challenging to implement in rehabilitation protocols, would help maintain novelty and interest in the activity. Collaboration with independent game developers can improve feasibility by offering content with relatively quick and flexible modification abilities, as was the case in the current study with the adapted commercial video game (Dashy Square) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p>
                <p>Methodologically, there was risk of bias in assessment scoring as clinicians and researchers were not blinded to the participant phase. Bias in goal setting is also possible as parents, clinicians and researchers were present when the participants set their practice and COPM goals. Further, COPM responses are subjective and can be influenced by mood and environment. For instance, one participant successfully completed her goal for the first time at the post-intervention assessment but scored the performance lower than at baseline. For these reasons we use multiple measures to capture Activities and Participation experiences. Next, level-change groupings (small, moderate, and large) for active wrist extension were based on a minimal detectible difference of five degrees [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, similar level-change groupings in grip strength were undeterminable since minimal detectible differences for grip strength, as compared to the dominant hand, do not yet exist for young people with CP. Scores are reported as a percent of the dominant side since improved capacity for bimanual activities is a primary goal for many young people with CP. For context, raw score increases in the affected hand's grip strength averaged 17 mmHg and all but two participants saw an improvement of greater than 10 mmHg. A minimal detectible difference of seven mmHg and a within-subject Standard Error of Measurement of three mmHg has recently been reported in individuals with Parkinson's Disease using a similar modified sphygmomanometer test [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. These visual analyses summaries are not provided as a definitive evaluation but to aid the reader in their interpretation of the effect size in this single-case design intervention [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further, while AB designs are useful for evaluating feasibility, return-to-baseline, or withdrawal designs would improve the strength of evidence of treatment effects [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The SEAS questionnaire was a practical tool to implement in the home to gauge self-reported experience. For a comprehensive evaluation, future work should consider qualitative interviews and content analysis [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The Solution Focused Coaching approach is designed to encourage collaborative development, led by the participant but does acknowledge the potential for external influence [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here we kept fidelity of the SFC approach by referring to a checklist, but this could be improved by video review and completing a fidelity questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>Logistically, the protocol may benefit from increased clinician involvement. Occupational Therapists remarked that that they could have helped guide home-based training by observing participants playing at weekly visits or by video. Finally, this study used the AHA as an outcome measure focusing on the non-dominant hand’s involvement in bimanual activities. Other measures of manual performance (i.e. Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function) [<xref rid="pone.0234767.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have been proposed and used more widely. Changing this metric could facilitate cross-study comparison.</p>

              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript describes a technically sound piece of scientific research.</p>
              <p>The statistic analysis has been conducted rigorously</p>
              <p>The data support the conclusions and I totally agree with the resource limitation well described at paragraph 430</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: General comment</p>
              <p>The authors present the results of a study to assess the feasibility of an at-home video game intervention. However, the authors seem to mix a bit the purposes of this study and the paper is difficult to follow. The main aim is to determine the feasibility (adherence, complications) but then the authors also assess the motor functions of the partcipants before and after the intervention. Then they used unusual methods for presenting the results. The article would become more readable if the authors only present the results of the feasibility part and shorten the presentation of the pre-post results since it’s not the aim of this particular study. A table with the results of the different tests before and after the intervention with results of the statistics would be more suited and easy to interpret, the other analysis can be moved to supplementary materials.</p>
              <p>Specific comments</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>Line 45: The authors should precise the inconsistency in the existing studies and what is currently missing to strengthen their study.</p>
              <p>Line 68: patient instead of client</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>Intervention: Was the total amount of training (defined during the self-defined practice) significantly different between the participants? The total duration of training should be presented in the results.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Table 1: only 2 patients have physiotherapy sessions? It seems low compared to the recommendation. Should be discussed.</p>
              <p>Table 2: 19 patients but for the technical issues 6/39? Please clarify</p>
              <p>Figure 2 – 3: Forest plots are a very unusual way of presenting individuals' data making the interpretation confusing! How did you compute CI for the SMD based only on 1 individual data? What’s the point of using a random effect model since it’s a controlled study? Participants should all have the same weight. A simple t-test (or Wilcoxon if the data are not normaly distributed, which is not precised) is more adapted (eventually with line plots if you want to present individual’s results).</p>
              <p>Figure 4: again visual analyses, the authors state that there did not compute the significance but still present a lot a statistics, this is a bit confusing.</p>
              <p>Was there any difference between the experiments in France and in Canada?</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>Body function: Against it is a bit confusing to read “In the current study, all but two participants increased active wrist extension” since no proper statistics were done.</p>
              <p>“Accordingly, we saw 18% average improvement with +5% gains in 12/19 participants.” Idem, what about the 7 other participants?</p>
              <p>Since it is a feasibility study the author should discuss the feasibility of implementing such kind of interventions in “real life” conditions. Do they think it is possible to have the pre-session and the different control sessions organized in practice (and who is going to pay for that). This is particularly important since apparently only 2 of the 19 participants have physiotherapy sessions (so basically no intervention).</p>

              <p>The following response can also be found in the 'Response to Reviewers.docx'</p>
              <p> Editor’s comments </p>
              <p>1 The coherence between the study declared goal and the actual presentation of results has been questioned, as well as the way in which the results are presented, and the significance evaluated- Please address these concerns properly. </p>
              <p>Thank you for your comments. In our responses to reviewer 2 you will see that their concerns regarding the presentation of the results and the evaluation of significance have been addressed. </p>
              <p>In summary, regarding the main aim of this study, we assess feasibility according to recommendations from Thabane et al 2010, and the CONSORT extension for reporting feasibility studies (Eldridge et al 2016). This framework highlights that the aim of feasibility testing can be towards assessing any of four classifications: process, resources, management and scientific. “Scientific” here refers to treatment safety and estimation of treatment effect and its variance. Motor function assessments were completed for this reason. </p>
              <p>It is also worth noting that statistical analyses were intentionally not conducted. In fact, the feasibility reporting guide we follow specifically discourages emphasizing statistical significance in studies of this type mainly due to low powered samples. We therefore follow the Single-Case Reporting Guideline In BEhavioural Interventions (SCRIBE), which recommends the presentation of a mixed ‘visual and statistical’ approach (Manolov et al 2014). The methods are considered complementary rather than mutually exclusive. We acknowledge that there is no universal gold-standard for single-case design studies, and it is for this reason we provide a mixed analysis approach.</p>
              <p>Separating primary and secondary aims seems to have caused this confusion. To clarify, we have explicitly stated which aspects of feasibility criteria we address and have: </p>
              <p>- Added context around feasibility to the introduction</p>
              <p>- Re-organized the methods to show that the current investigation focuses on process and scientific feasibility.</p>
              <p>- Added a summary table of results as Reviewer 2 requested</p>
              <p>You can find the specific changes made to the manuscript in the response to Reviewer 2, general comments # 1 and 3.</p>
              <p>2 Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>

              <p>Thank you for reviewing this. We apologize for the confusion here. We think this may be because the ‘Last Update’ date was posted June 18, 2019. This update was related to an annual renewal of the study protocol on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry.</p>
              <p>The trial, registered at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03677193">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03677193</ext-link> indicates that this study was first posted September 19, 2018. Further, the initial release date according to the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System was dated July 31, 2018. Note, this is before the start of the study enrollment. </p>
              <p>Please see the screenshots at the bottom of this document to confirm (Appendix A). If for some reason, the study still appears to be registered after recruitment began, we will indeed contact the registry directly to correct the error. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The trial registration number may have also been incorrect. We have verified that the proper registration number is in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>4 As per the journal’s editorial policy, please include in the Methods section of your paper:</p>
              <p>1) your reasons for your delay in registering this study (after enrolment of participants started);</p>
              <p>2) confirmation that all related trials are registered by stating: “The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered”. </p>
              <p>Regarding item 1) as described in response #3, above, the study was registered July 31, 2018 on ClinicalTrials.gov. The first participant was enrolled on September 29th, 2019.</p>
              <p>Regarding item 2) the required statement was added to the section: Methods, Design.</p>
              <p>5 Please also ensure you report the date at which the ethics committee approved the study as well as the complete date range for patient recruitment and follow-up in the Methods section of your manuscript, and clarify why the protocol is dated 23 November 2018. Methods have been adjusted accordingly and now read as follows: </p>
              <p>“Ethical approval was obtained by Holland Bloorview’s Research Ethics Board (approved July 27, 2018, amended November 23, 2018, to include participants with mixed tone and mild dystonia) and the French national Comité de protection des personnes (CPP) (approved July 6, 2018).” – Section: Methods, Design</p>
              <p>“Recruitment in Canada took place from September-November 2018. … Recruitment in France took place from November 2018 - January 2019.”- Section: Methods, Participants, Recruitment</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 comments: </p>
              <p>1 The manuscript describes a technically sound piece of scientific research.</p>
              <p>The statistic analysis has been conducted rigorously</p>
              <p>The data support the conclusions and I totally agree with the resource limitation well described at paragraph 430 </p>
              <p>Thank you for your kind remarks.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2 </p>
              <p>General comments </p>
              <p>1 The authors present the results of a study to assess the feasibility of an at-home video game intervention. However, the authors seem to mix a bit the purposes of this study and the paper is difficult to follow. The main aim is to determine the feasibility (adherence, complications) but then the authors also assess the motor functions of the participants before and after the intervention. </p>
              <p>We would first like to thank Reviewer 2 for their detailed comments. </p>
              <p>Regarding the main aim of this study, we assess feasibility according to recommendations from Thabane et al 2010, and the CONSORT extension for reporting feasibility studies (Eldridge et al 2016). This framework highlights that the aim of feasibility testing can relate to any of four broad classifications: process, resources, management and scientific. Scientific here refers to treatment safety and estimation of treatment effect and its variance. Motor function assessments were completed for this reason. We decided to separate the scientific, effect size and variance, estimate to the secondary aim as we used six outcome measures (since no single measure addresses all aspects of capacity and participation). However, we apologize, as this seems to have caused confusion. To clarify, all the reported outcomes, including those related to motor function are made towards assessing feasibility of the intervention. </p>
              <p>It is also worth noting that for this reason, statistical analyses were intentionally not conducted. In fact, the feasibility reporting guide we follow discourages emphasizing statistical significance in studies of this type (Thabane et al 2010, Eldridge et al 2016). The goal here is to inform future randomized controlled trial (RCT) research and not verify the significance of the response, as the study is underpowered to do so.</p>
              <p>We have made changes in the main text to clarify our use of the feasibility framework: </p>
              <p>“This paper addresses intervention feasibility as articulated by Thabane et al (2010) [18]. This framework highlights that the aim of feasibility testing can be related to one or more of the following four classifications: process, resources, management and scientific. The objective here is to support development towards future randomized controlled trials and not to define statistical or clinical effectiveness of the intervention [18]. In this study, we concentrate on two of the four feasibility classifications: </p>
              <p>First, we assess process feasibility of the biofeedback-enhanced therapy video game intervention protocol for young people with CP. The objective here is to determine the ability to enroll participants, enable home-based practice, and retain their activity during a 1-month intervention. To this purpose, a priori success criteria were established for the recruitment and response rates, adherence, and frequency of technical difficulties impeding home practice [18]. </p>
              <p>Second, we assess the scientific feasibility of the intervention by estimating the effect size and variance for six participant-centred outcome measures for the hand and wrist. The measures are aligned to the Body Functions and Activities and Participation chapters of the ICF (international classification of functioning disability and health) [19,20].” – Section: Introduction, Aim</p>
              <p>2 Then they used unusual methods for presenting the results. The article would become more readable if the authors only present the results of the feasibility part and shorten the presentation of the pre-post results since it’s not the aim of this particular study. </p>
              <p>As indicated in the comment above, we assess feasibility according to recommendations from Thabane et al 2010, and the CONSORT extension for reporting feasibility studies (Eldridge et al 2016). This framework highlights that the aim of feasibility testing can relate to any of four broad classifications: process, resources, management and scientific. Scientific here refers to treatment safety and estimation of treatment effect and its variance. Motor function assessments were completed for this reason. All the reported outcomes, including those related to motor function (the pre-post results) are made towards assessing feasibility of the intervention.</p>
              <p>To clarify this, we have: </p>
              <p>- Added context around feasibility in the aim (please see the quoted text in the comment above). </p>
              <p>- Re-organized the methods to not distinguish the work in terms of primary and secondary aims, but in reference to process feasibility and scientific feasibility. You will see this change throughout the aim, methods and results of the manuscript. </p>
              <p>3 A table with the results of the different tests before and after the intervention with results of the statistics would be more suited and easy to interpret, the other analysis can be moved to supplementary materials. </p>
              <p>For clarity, we have provided a table of the results of the different tests. Please see Table 3 under the section: Results, Scientific Feasibility. </p>
              <p>Please note, as we followed the CONSORT extension for reporting feasibility studies (Eldridge et al 2016) and the Single-Case Reporting Guideline In BEhavioural Interventions (SCRIBE), we have intentionally not reported significance tests. We do however report the combined statistical and visual analysis along with estimates of effect size and their variance in the form of 95% confidence intervals where appropriate. </p>
              <p>We hope the reviewer can understand the choice to use this methodology, and not to focus on statistical significance. The goal here is to inform future RCT research and not verify the significance of the response, as the study is underpowered to do so. To this point we have added the following statement: </p>
              <p>“At the observed effect size, 0.29, in bimanual performance (AHA change score), 127 participants would be required for the definitive RCT assuming alpha significance set to 0.05 and a desired power = 0.9. AHA change score was chosen to estimate the sample size instead of active wrist extension capacity since it measures functional bimanual performance and has more direct relationship with ability to perform activities of daily living.” – Section: Discussion, Recruitment and adherence</p>
              <p>Specific comments </p>
              <p>Introduction </p>
              <p>1 Line 45: The authors should precise the inconsistency in the existing studies and what is currently missing to strengthen their study. </p>
              <p>The statement has been changed to: </p>
              <p>“These types of studies have shown moderate evidence towards improving balance and overall motor skill but weak evidence towards improving upper extremity skills, joint control, gait and strength [9]” - Introduction.</p>
              <p>2 Line 68: patient instead of client</p>
              <p> We have removed the use of the terms: patient and client throughout the manuscript. Our institution’s convention is to use client instead of patient, however we realize this is not true everywhere. To be as inclusive as possible we have used the term participant, person or individual where </p>
              <p>Methods </p>
              <p>3 Intervention: Was the total amount of training (defined during the self-defined practice) significantly different between the participants? The total duration of training should be presented in the results. </p>
              <p>Individual practice did vary across participants. While the average amount of training was 16±4 days over the 1-month intervention, 7/19 participants were outside 1 standard deviation from this mean. Similarly, while participants practiced an average of 17±9 minutes/day, 10/19 participants were outside 1 standard deviation from this mean. </p>
              <p>Individual total amount of training can now be seen in Table 3 under section: Results, Scientific feasibility. We have also added the following statement: </p>
              <p>“System usage varied across individuals but averaged 4±1 days/week (8-24 days total), 17±9 minutes/day (37-333 minutes total), and 163±59 gesture repetitions/day (997-5698 total).” - Section: Results, Participant and recruitment characteristics</p>
              <p>Results </p>
              <p>4 Table 1: only 2 patients have physiotherapy sessions? It seems low compared to the recommendation. Should be discussed. </p>
              <p>We have added the following to the discussion: </p>
              <p>“Participants in Canada and France were off treatment blocks but visited their care provider for regularly scheduled check-ups, either annually or quarterly. Two participants, B and F, took additional weekly therapy sessions outside of the rehabilitation centre and one participant, J, attended the school at the rehabilitation centre and would see the occupational therapist as needed.” - Section: Discussion, Implementation </p>
              <p>Both Canada and France have publicly funded healthcare but services for individuals in our recruitment demographic (older age group and mild to moderate impairment) are not as frequently utilized. As such, it is not uncommon to see older children and teenagers with CP only occasionally be on active blocks of manual therapy training. </p>
              <p>5 Table 2: 19 patients but for the technical issues 6/39? Please clarify </p>
              <p>Technical issues could be reported multiple times during the 1-month intervention. For instance, a participant might report a technical issue once in the first week and twice more in the third week. As such, it is possible to have more technical issues than participants enrolled.</p>
              <p>To clarify this metric, we have added the following text to Methods, Outcomes #4:</p>
              <p>“Participants may report multiple issues during the 1-month intervention.”</p>
              <p>6 Figure 2 – 3: Forest plots are a very unusual way of presenting individuals' data making the interpretation confusing! How did you compute CI for the SMD based only on 1 individual data? What’s the point of using a random effect model since it’s a controlled study? Participants should all have the same weight. A simple t-test (or Wilcoxon if the data are not normally distributed, which is not precised) is more adapted (eventually with line plots if you want to present individual’s results). </p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing this out. As described in the response to this reviewer’s general comments numbers 1 and 3, we are not presenting statistical tests such as t-tests or Wilcoxon to conform with the CONSORT feasibility testing and SCRIBE Single-Case design reporting frameworks.</p>
              <p>We do however acknowledge that this is an unusual presentation of individual results. Given the individual outcomes are now reported in Table 3, we have removed Fig 2 and Fig 3 and reported group level SMD and confidence intervals descriptively (Section: Methods, Scientific feasibility). </p>
              <p>7 Figure 4: again visual analyses, the authors state that there did not compute the significance but still present a lot a statistics, this is a bit confusing. </p>
              <p>As described in the response to this reviewer’s general comments numbers 1 and 3, significance tests comparing pre and post outcomes were not conducted in accordance with the CONSORT feasibility testing and SCRIBE Single-Case design reporting frameworks.</p>
              <p>However, statistical analyses were conducted to establish effect sizes and variances as recommended by CONSORT feasibility testing and SCRIBE Single-Case design reporting. SCRIBE recommends the presentation of a mixed ‘visual and statistical’ approach (Manolov et al 2014). The methods are considered complementary rather than mutually exclusive. We acknowledge that there is no universal gold-standard for SCED design studies, and it is for this reason we provide a mixed analysis approach.</p>
              <p>8 Was there any difference between the experiments in France and in Canada? </p>
              <p>No, the experiments in France and Canada were completed the same way. The same researcher trained the participants, completed all in-home assessments and measures of range of motion and grip strength. The only difference was in recruitment where:</p>
              <p>“In Canada, eligible participants were also identified through the hospital’s centralized recruitment database, connect2research. In Canada the researcher telephoned potential participants after sending an invitation letter by mail. Then, the researcher screened interested participants and obtained written informed consent. In France, the developmental pediatricians invited eligible individuals to participate. They obtained written informed consent from interested participants.” </p>
              <p>This is currently expressed in the section: Methods, Participants, Recruitment. </p>
              <p>Discussion </p>
              <p>9 Body function: Against it is a bit confusing to read “In the current study, all but two participants increased active wrist extension” since no proper statistics were done. </p>
              <p>This statement has been further specified for clarity and now reads: </p>
              <p>“In the current study, 12 of 17 participants increased active wrist extension by at least 5 degrees.” – Section: Discussion, Body Function</p>
              <p>Additionally, we have added the following to the methods: </p>
              <p>“...values are recorded to the nearest five degrees, the minimal detectable difference [42].” – Section: Methods, Outcomes</p>
              <p>10 “Accordingly, we saw 18% average improvement with +5% gains in 12/19 participants.” Idem, what about the 7 other participants? </p>
              <p>5 participants had a grip strength change of &lt;5%, 2 participants did not complete enough assessments to calculate grip strength or range of motion during the intervention (see Table 3 under the section: Results, Scientific feasibility). </p>
              <p>To provide additional context, the discussion has been changed to the following: </p>
              <p>“Accordingly, we saw 18% average improvement in non-dominant grip strength relative to the dominant side across participants. However, normative data for children’s grip strength, as compared to the dominant side using the modified sphygmomanometer are not available”. – Section: Discussion, Body Function</p>
              <p>Further, we have added the following limitation: </p>
              <p>“Next, level-change groupings (small, moderate, and large) for active wrist extension were based on a minimal detectible difference of five degrees [42]. However, similar level-change groupings in grip strength were undeterminable since minimal detectible differences for grip strength, as compared to the dominant hand, do not yet exist for young people with CP. Scores are reported as a percent of the dominant side since improved capacity for bimanual activities is a primary goal for many young people with CP. For context, raw score increases in the affected hand's grip strength averaged 17 mmHg and all but two participants saw an improvement of greater than 10 mmHg. A minimal detectible difference of seven mmHg and a within-subject Standard Error of Measurement of three mmHg has recently been reported in individuals with Parkinson's Disease using a similar modified sphygmomanometer test [71]. These visual analyses summaries are not provided as a definitive evaluation but to aid the reader in their interpretation of the effect size in this single-case design intervention [23].”– Section: Discussion, Limitations</p>
              <p>11 Since it is a feasibility study the author should discuss the feasibility of implementing such kind of interventions in “real life” conditions. Do they think it is possible to have the pre-session and the different control sessions organized in practice (and who is going to pay for that). This is particularly important since apparently only 2 of the 19 participants have physiotherapy sessions (so basically no intervention). </p>
              <p>The reviewer raises an important concern. We have added the following text to address the reviewers question surrounding ‘real life’ implementation: </p>
              <p>“It is important to note that this is the first investigation of the novel home-based gaming intervention and accordingly focused on process and scientific feasibility. Specifically, the study focuses on determining the extent to which the intervention could be used at home and estimating the effect size and variance it might have. Towards conducting a complete RCT, more studies and development would be needed to ascertain real-world feasibility, addressing resources and management. This includes a proper health economics analysis and evaluation of the logistic organization with respect to an institute’s existing therapeutic practices.” – Discussion, Implementation. </p>
              <p>Main points related to process feasibility are in the discussion under the sections: Recruitment and adherence, Motivation and Limitations. To further comment on scientific feasibility, as described by Thabane et al 2010, we discuss Body Functions and Activity and Participation outcomes in the discussion as well. </p>

              </p>
              <p>1 This is a very nicely done, and well-reported study, on an important topic. I only have a few comments; overall, I enjoyed reading the paper and commend the authors on their clear presentation of the results.</p>
              <p> Thank you for your comments we appreciate your suggestions and the time spent reviewing.</p>
              <p>2 l.72 "participants'" not "participant's" The plural is implied later in the sentence with pronoun "their." Throughout the paper, the authors should check pronoun agreement between subject and verb. In a number of places, a singular subject is followed by a plural pronoun; e.g., he...their (sorry, ex-grammar teacher).</p>
              <p> Thank you for this comment since English language grammar is not a particular strength of our group. The manuscript has been reviewed for pronoun agreement and the corrections have been made as needed, including editing l.72 from “participant’s” to “participants”.</p>
              <p>3 l. 145. Why is "Normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing" an EXCLUSION criteria? Is that correct?</p>
              <p> This is indeed a typo. That item has been moved from the exclusions to the inclusions as it should be. Thank you for noticing the mistake.</p>
              <p>4 In several places, the authors give an abbreviation, followed by the full name that is being abbreviated in parentheses (ll.100-01, ll.164-65, ll.170-71). This order should be reversed (as it is elsewhere in the paper).</p>
              <p> The location of abbreviations have been corrected to appear in brackets after the full name at each of the lines identified by the reviewer.</p>
              <p>5 Table 3 summarizes Reps, Minutes Active, and Minute in System using means and standard deviations. Judging by the size of the standard deviations relative to the means, these do not appear to be normally distributed, and would be better summarized with medians and interquartile ranges to give a more accurate picture of the data distributions.</p>
              <p> Table 3 has been updated to include median and interquartile range as the reviewer suggests giving a more accurate picture of the data distributions.</p>
              <p>6 25% of the participants did not reach their goals due to a loss of interest. This seems fairly high. Did the authors factor this into their assessment of feasibility? I know they talk about the need to vary programs for different ages and over time to avoid this, but is THAT feasible? I.e., how much money and time go into designing and implementing a single game?</p>
              <p> The reviewer addresses an important aspect here. Adherence is a central issue. In the current study we found that adherence was relatively high compared to other studies which have shown participants complete 53-78% of practice goals, as compared to 75% in the current work. (l.381-383). From a feasibility perspective, the reviewer also raises a salient issue. The cost of activity development relative to the expected use and benefit will dictate quantity and quality. We mitigated some of this cost and improved feasibility by finding a suitable game and subsequently collaborating with directly with the developer. We have expanded the limitations section to include this point and it now read as follows: </p>
              <p>“…greater choice and game variety, while challenging to implement in rehabilitation protocols, would help maintain novelty and interest in the activity. Collaboration with independent game developers can improve feasibility by offering content with relatively quick and flexible modification abilities, as was the case in the current study with the adapted commercial video game (Dashy Square). [71]” – l.472.</p>
