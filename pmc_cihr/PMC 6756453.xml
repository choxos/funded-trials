                  <p>The purpose of this randomised trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a decision support intervention for serious illness decisions (the Plan Well Guide decision aid; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.PlanWellguide.com">www.PlanWellguide.com</ext-link>) in increasing the engagement of substitute decision-makers (SDMs) in the patient’s advance care planning process (ie, ‘ACP engagement’), specifically the SDM’s confidence and readiness for the role in the future.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is a parallel group randomised controlled trial. We aim to enrol 90 participant dyads: patients aged 65 years and older attending outpatient healthcare settings and with indicators they would be at high risk of needing future medical decisions and their SDM. The intervention is the Plan Well Guide decision aid, administered to the patient by a facilitator, with the SDM present. The primary endpoint is change after 3 months in the SDM’s ACP engagement using a validated measure of behavioural change (SDM’s knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy and readiness) to enact the role. The secondary endpoints are (1) ACP engagement of the patient measured by a validated survey; (2) change in SDM decisional conflict regarding involvement in future decision-making and (3) postintervention patient decisional conflict regarding preference for life-sustaining treatments. Primary and secondary continuous outcomes will be analysed using the linear regression. The mean difference and 95% CIs will be reported.</p>

              <title>Background rationale</title>
              <p>During serious illness or at the end of life, there is often a need for decisions to be made about the use of various medical treatments, such as whether to accept life-sustaining treatments. A sizeable proportion of seriously ill older adults will experience a time when they lack the capacity to make their own medical treatment decisions, thus shifting the decision responsibility to a surrogate or ‘substitute’ decision-maker (SDM).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The ability of SDMs to make decisions consistent with their loved one’s wishes is generally poor and needs improvement.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> In order to ensure the patient’s prior expressed values and wishes are followed, patients and their SDM would ideally have engaged in a process to increase their ‘decisional readiness’.</p>
              <p>Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals and preferences regarding future medical care. The goal of ACP is to help ensure that people receive medical care that is consistent with their values, goals and preferences during serious and chronic illness.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In prospective and randomised trials, ACP significantly increases the likelihood that clinicians and SDMs understand and apply a patient’s previously expressed wishes when making medical treatment decisions,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref> reduces hospitalisation at the end of life, results in less intensive treatments at the end of life (according to patients’ wishes) and increases the use of hospice services.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite knowledge of the benefits of ACP, studies continue to document deficiencies in the quality or quantity of communication and decision-making during serious illness.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref> Patients are seemingly able to express a preference related to the use of life-sustaining treatments, however, they report considerable decisional conflict about the preference, and there is a lack of alignment between stated values and preferences.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> In our survey of mostly well older adults in primary care, approximately one-third indicated that they would want only comfort care and not life-sustaining treatment if they became seriously ill and only 8% indicated a preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> suggesting that preferences may not be informed by the outcomes of various treatments for different populations. Other studies have documented the lay public’s significant overestimation of the probability of survival after CPR<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and a lack of understanding of palliative care.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These knowledge gaps may partly contribute to the creation of advance directives that do not reflect patients’ values and informed preferences and are therefore unhelpful to guide clinical decision-making<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> or the SDM in his or her role.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

              <p>Decision aids are tools developed and promoted to increase high-quality decisions in healthcare by clearly communicating treatment options, and the benefits, harms and outcomes associated with each option, in a manner that is easily understood by lay persons. Many decision aids include a component of values clarification to help the patient construct preferences about the outcomes of treatment options in relation to their own values. In randomised studies, decision aids have generally been found to be helpful to increase patients’ knowledge and the congruence between the decision and the patient’s values, for a range of screening and treatment decisions.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A systematic review of decision aids to help older patients who were facing serious illness found shortcomings. Of the 17 studies reviewed, five included a values clarification process, only one of which made trade-offs explicit, and none explicated the general difference between the intent and approaches of resuscitative/intensive care vs medical care versus comfort care.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
              <p>SDMs can experience prolonged emotional difficulty after making decisions for a loved one when they are unsure if they have followed the loved one’s wishes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Both patients and clinicians have identified the need to prepare SDMs as a key focus in ACP.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref> ACP tools should ideally help to prepare the SDM as well as the patient,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and these approaches should be evaluated for their effectiveness to prepare SDM. The purpose of this randomised trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a decision aid (the Plan Well Guide tool; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.planwellguide.com">www.planwellguide.com</ext-link>) administered with a patient in the presence of the patient’s SDM, in increasing the SDM’s engagement in ACP, defined here as knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy and readiness for enacting their role in the future.</p>

              <title>Research aims and study hypotheses</title>
              <p>The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Plan Well Guide decision support intervention to increase the SDM’s engagement in ACP with respect to their loved one (the patient) after being present while the patient uses the decision aid. The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of the Plan Well Guide decision support intervention to increase ACP engagement of the patient and to describe patients’ decisional conflict associated with his or her stated current preference for life-sustaining treatments after using the Plan Well Guide.</p>
              <p>The primary outcome will be evaluated in the SDM who accompanies the patient. A separate randomised trial of the patient’s decisional outcomes is reported elsewhere (unpublished) (registration at clinicaltrials.gov; NCT03434626). We will use a validated ‘SDM ACP Engagement Survey’ measure that asks about SDM engagement related to that role for a loved one.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Our primary hypothesis is that the SDM’s presence while the patient is guided through the Plan Well Guide will result in increased engagement in behavioural change processes concerning ACP in relation to being involved in the loved one’s future decision-making, as measured in the SDM (see the Outcomes and Measures section), compared with usual care. Our secondary hypotheses are that compared with usual care, the intervention will result in increased ACP engagement in the patient, and improved decisional self-efficacy of the SDM, compared with usual care.</p>

              <p>The methods are described according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials reporting guidelines.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This is a parallel group randomised controlled superiority trial with a delayed intervention control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Outcomes are measured at baseline before randomisation and at 12 weeks postrandomisation. Participants in the delayed intervention arm will be offered the intervention at the end of their follow-up period.</p>
              <p>Participants are dyads consisting of a patient and the patient’s identified SDM. Eligible consenting patients and SDM complete a baseline questionnaire by interview with a research assistant and are then randomised together to the immediate Plan Well Guide decision support intervention arm or the delayed intervention arm (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). It is possible that both people in the dyad will be eligible as patients may be each other’s SDM. If both wish to participate as the SDM (ie, one dyad will count as two study participants), they will be randomised to the same group. At baseline, patients in both groups will receive a booklet on ACP created by the provincial Hospice Palliative Care Association, which describes the provincial legal context of ACP.</p>

                <title>Study settings</title>
                <p>Recruitment will occur in outpatient settings in one area (Hamilton, Burlington) in Southern Ontario, Canada including family practice, cardiology outpatient care and cancer pain and symptom management. The city of Hamilton (population 500 000) has two multisite general tertiary hospitals. There are approximately 400 family physicians in the city. Most people in Canada and Ontario have a regular primary care provider and a primary care referral is required to access specialist consultation.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In all of these settings, there are patients presenting with chronic conditions that would be expected to shorten life expectancy and at some point require decision-making, and who could, therefore, benefit from engaging in ACP.</p>

              <sec id="s3-2">
                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Participants are patients aged 65 years and older attending ambulatory healthcare settings (family physicians, cancer clinic, cardiology clinic and respirology clinic) who could benefit from ACP as judged by their clinician and the patient’s identified SDM. In order to compare results to other studies of ACP tools using similar methods and measures, eligible patients will be 65 years of age and older.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> To be eligible the SDM must be 18 years or age or older. In addition to the age criterion and in keeping with recommendations for when clinicians should consider ACP conversations,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> clinicians are asked to identify patients they consider ‘high risk’ for probability of a decline in health that may require hospitalisation. Each physician or clinic will establish their high-risk criteria based on age, comorbidities, change in health status or recent hospitalisations.</p>
                <p>Additional eligibility criteria include being cognitively able to consent to research (as perceived by the referring clinician’s judgement), able to communicate in English, and having adequate hearing and vision (with aids) to be able to interact with the research staff. Exclusion criteria include cognitive impairment that precludes giving informed consent and inability to communicate in English. When the research assistants contact patients to explain the study in full and obtain informed consent, they will also ensure that the patient is suitable from a cognitive and language perspective, using their judgement of the patient’s understanding of the study explanation. Efforts will be made to include patients with hearing or visual impairments by arranging for data collection to occur in person rather than on the telephone if the patient requires.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Patients will be recruited prospectively by the clinicians involved in their care, when the patient attends a study site for an outpatient visit. Privacy laws impede the ability of researchers to obtain patient names from healthcare settings without the patient’s prior consent, therefore, creation of a sampling frame from clinic records to contact patients is not possible, and it is not feasible for the clinicians in the study sites to contact lists of patients. Clinicians will be provided with the scripted language to introduce the study during clinic encounters and ask potentially eligible patients if they would be willing to be contacted by the researchers to learn more. Posters about the study will be provided to clinics for advertising. At regular intervals determined with each clinic (approximately weekly), names and contact information of patients who have agreed to be contacted will be forwarded to the research team.</p>
                <p>Research assistants will telephone patients who have agreed to be contacted. At this point, the research assistant will confirm eligibility, explain the study using the research ethics board approved information sheet, and obtain initial verbal consent to participate. The patient will then be asked to approach the person they believe would be their SDM and ask this person for permission to be contacted by the research assistant. The research assistant will then contact the prospective SDM by telephone to confirm eligibility, explain the study and obtain verbal consent. Consent refusals, and reason, will be recorded in a screening log.</p>

                <title>Study intervention</title>
                <p>The main component of the intervention is the guided use of the Plan Well Guide. A trained research nurse will run the interactive decision aid for the patient and SDM on a laptop computer and complete the structured paper-based values clarification and preference questions with the patient when prompted by the decision aid. The output of the decision aid is a structured ‘Dear Doctor’ letter, which is given to the patient for their own use. The research nurse who facilitates the use of the Plan Well Guide may assist the patient through their deliberations about the values and preferences questions and review the information from sections of the tool as needed until the patient is comfortable expressing a preference but will not provide advice about person medical decisions. If questions of this nature arise, the research nurse will remind the patient of the ‘Dear Doctor’ letter to be used as a discussion aid with the patient’s physician. The patient and SDM are informed verbally and in writing that this summary letter does not represent consent to treatment and has no legal standing and that the intent is to inform possible future decision-making.</p>
                <p>The Plan Well Guide was designed with input from 24 older adult patients in primary care practices who had serious health conditions. In addition, 42 healthcare professionals with expertise in critical care medicine, nursing, geriatrics, family medicine and palliative care participated in the focus groups, webinars, and interviews and provided input on the decision aid.</p>
                <p>The Plan Well Guide (1) describes why preparation for decision-making is important, the difference between serious illness and terminal care, and the significance of making decision under conditions of uncertainty, (2) defines personal values, why these are important in decision-making and how trade-offs are sometimes required, (3) provides education on typical end-of-life trajectories and discusses conditions of uncertainty under which healthcare decisions are often made (4) provides education about different approaches to care in hospital (resuscitative/intensive care, medical care and comfort care) and (5) guides the patient through a values and preference elicitation process, explicitly linking values to preferences using rating scales.</p>
                <p>The tool describes treatment options (resuscitative/intensive care, medical care and comfort care) in detail with information about the nature, location, harms, benefits and associated outcomes of the different options, using verbal information, text and visual images (eg, photographs of hospital rooms). The information included about outcomes of the different treatment options is supported by the medical literature and expressed in probabilistic terms and presented visually.</p>
                <p>Since the treatment options are preference sensitive and preferences should be aligned with values, a short value clarification tool is used that includes an explanation of values and their relationship to treatment decisions, and examples of different end-of-life values (adapted from Scheunemann <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The presentation explains how certain values compete or conflict with each other, and patients are asked to rate on seven-point Likert-type scales (1) the degree to which quality of life is more or less important to them compared with quantity of life and (2) whether a natural death versus a machine-supported death is more important. To aid in future clinical decision-making and to make the linkage between values and preferences more explicit, a system of grids is used by the research nurse to map the ratings of importance on the values questions to the treatment approach (intensive, medical and comfort) which would most align with the values. The grids are used to provide structured guidance to the patient helping them link their stated values to reasonable treatment preferences. If the patient indicates a preference for CPR, a CPR information video is shown to provide detailed information about the benefits and risks of this procedure.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> If the patient feels there is discordance in the treatment preference highlighted on the grids (eg, the first grid suggested the preferred medical option was comfort care and the second grid indicated medical care), the research nurse reviews the patient’s values, and which values are most important to determine if they would like any changes. The final step is to elicit a treatment preference for the use of life-sustaining treatments. A taxonomy describing different levels of the use or non-use of life-sustaining treatments is used, which was developed with input from medical experts and has been used extensively in our prior research.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 31 40</xref>

                <title>Outcomes and measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcome will be evaluated in the SDM. We will use a validated ‘SDM ACP Engagement Survey’ measure of behavioural change that conveys SDM engagement (knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy and readiness) for their role with respect to the patient.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The survey is based on a previously validated patient ACP Engagement Survey, which measures the same ACP behavioural change as well as several ACP actions, including identifying the SMD, identifying values and goals for medical care, and documenting one’s wishes. Validity, reliability and responsiveness of the patient ACP Engagement Survey and validation of short versions have been previously described.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 41 42</xref> The patient version was adapted to a version for SDMs by modifying the language of items to reflect the SDM’s perspective, and reducing items and confirming factors through psychometric analyses using data from 65 respondents who were family members of patients in a hospital inpatient setting.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The version contains 17 items, with three factors that explained 91% of variance.</p>
                <p>Key secondary outcomes include change in ACP engagement of the patient, using a 15-item version of the patient ACP Engagement Survey. Details of the methods and properties have been published.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> This shorter version was created from a longer original version by systematically eliminating questions based on face validity, item non-response, redundancy, ceiling effects and factor analysis. The 15-item version demonstrated responsiveness to change, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92 and correlation of the mean score to the original version was 0.91.</p>
                <p>We will use an adapted version of the SURE-Decisional Conflict Scale<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> with modified wording appropriate for the SDM and on a five-point scale (not at all confident to very confident). This survey augments the primary outcome measure of SDM ACP engagement and provides an opportunity for further validation (ie, concurrent) of the primary outcome measure survey.</p>
                <p>Other secondary outcomes to be measured after the intervention, only in those who receive it include global rating of satisfaction with the Plan Well Guide decision support intervention and endorsement of the tool, using Likert-type scales. At the end of the Plan Well decision support intervention, we will also evaluate decisional conflict in the context of life-sustaining treatment using the SURE-Decisional Conflict Scale.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
</p>
                <p>To describe the sample, baseline information collected will include age, sex, living location, education level, health literacy, language spoken and single item global ratings of quality of life and self-reported health.</p>

              <p>One of the most important aspects of preparing for future healthcare decisions is the education and engagement of SDMs, so that they understand the authentic values and informed preferences of their loved one. If this phase II randomised trial demonstrates that the decision aid improves SDM engagement in ACP through increased confidence and readiness to be involved in decision-making if needed in the future for their loved one, this tool should be evaluated to determine its effectiveness at improving SDM that leads to care consistent with a patient’s values and wishes.</p>
              <p>Our trial has several strengths. This trial is novel in that it specifically targets the SDMs of patients who are likely to benefit from ACP and uses a measure of SDM engagement in ACP in relation to the patient for whom they may need to make medical decisions in the future. Participants are being recruited from a variety of outpatient settings in a pragmatic way that mirrors how ACP might be undertaken in these clinical settings. We are using a delayed intervention process as a control to allow all participants to eventually receive the intervention if they wish. The trial also has potential limitations. It is not possible to blind participants to group allocation. The Plan Well Guide is facilitated by a research nurse and the effects may differ if it is self-administered. The tool is scripted and structured with the intention of non-facilitated use; however, the interactive online version was not available when this trial began. The decision aid intervention has not been translated to languages other than English or adapted for varying cultures, therefore, study participants may represent the typical Caucasian English speaking more educated population as found in many previous studies of ACP.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Successful models of adapting ACP tools for other populations exist<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and should be considered in the future.</p>
