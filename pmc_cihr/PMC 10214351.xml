                <p id="Par1">Access to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus was limited in poor countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a low-cost mRNA vaccine, PTX-COVID19-B, was produced and evaluated in a Phase 1 trial. PTX-COVID19-B encodes Spike protein D614G variant without the proline-proline (986–987) mutation present in other COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of the study was to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PTX-COVID19-B vaccine in healthy seronegative adults 18–64 years old. The trial design was observer-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, and tested ascending doses of 16-µg, 40-µg, or 100-µg in a total of 60 subjects who received two intramuscular doses, 4 weeks apart. Participants were monitored for solicited and unsolicited adverse events after vaccination and were provided with a Diary Card and thermometer to report any reactogenicity during the trial. Blood samples were collected on baseline, days 8, 28, 42, 90, and 180 for serum analysis of total IgG anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)/Spike titers by ELISA, and neutralizing antibody titers by pseudovirus assay. Titers in BAU/mL were reported as geometric mean and 95% CI per cohort. After vaccination, few solicited adverse events were observed and were mild to moderate and self-resolved within 48 h. The most common solicited local and systemic adverse event was pain at the injection site, and headache, respectively. Seroconversion was observed in all vaccinated participants, who showed high antibody titers against RBD, Spike, and neutralizing activity against the Wuhan strain. Neutralizing antibody titers were also detected against Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants of concerns in a dose dependent manner. All tested doses of PTX-COVID19-B were safe, well-tolerated, and provided a strong immunogenicity response. The 40-µg dose showed fewer adverse reactions than the 100-µg dose, and therefore was selected for a Phase 2 trial, which is currently ongoing.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) worldwide pandemic that started in 2019 continues to affect multiple countries around the world where access to vaccines is limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">To provide an alternative prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, Providence Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (PT) developed an mRNA vaccine, PTX-COVID19-B, composed of a lipid nanoparticle containing modified mRNA that encodes for full-length Spike (S) protein with glycine in position 614 (G614). By March of 2020, the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 was the predominant strain worldwide and this substitution has prevailed in current, more transmissible variants of concern (VOCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The recently described crystal structure of the full-length G614 S trimers indicates that G614 variant forms a more stable S trimer with one receptor binding domain (RBD) remaining in the up conformation longer than D614 in the pre-fusion state. The study posited that G614 S trimer stability could provide a superior immunogen for eliciting neutralizing antibody responses, largely targeting the RBD and N-terminal domain, which stay exposed longer than with the D614 S trimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the study suggests that full-length G614 S protein vaccines could have a relative increase in potency because this change compensates for the lack of engineered stabilizing proline-proline (986–987 position) mutations present in other COVID-19 vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies showed PTX-COVID19-B was safe, highly immunogenic, and completely protected animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Based on the preclinical results, PTX-COVID19-B was authorized by Health Canada to enter clinical trials in December of 2020.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Reported here are findings of the Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PTX-COVID19-B vaccine in healthy seronegative adults aged 18–64. Our previous mouse studies indicated that immunizations with 10–20 μg of PTX-COVID19-B did not show any safety signal and could induce strong immune responses, therefore 16 μg was selected as the starting low dose for the Phase 1 trial. Mid and high doses were selected by increasing two and a half times the previous dose resulting in 40 μg and 100 μg respectively. The study began in January 2021 and enrollment was completed in April 2021. The safety database was locked, and analysis was performed on data up to day 42 after the first dose in May 2021. Immunological data is reported up to week 26 (day 180).</p>

                <p id="Par6">PTX-COVID19-B vaccine is an off-white, sterile, preservative-free, frozen suspension for IM injection. It was produced as a multidose vial containing 2 mL of 0.2 mg/mL and supplied as a frozen suspension. Preparation of the vaccine for 16-µg, and 40-µg, dose was done by diluting the vaccine with saline to obtain 0.5 mL injection volume. No dilution was required for the 100-µg dose. Stability of PTX-COVID19-B was performed on vials stored at − 80 °C, − 20 °C for one year and the results indicate that at both temperatures the release specification stays constant. Stability for the vaccine stored at refrigerated conditions of 2–8 °C showed no changes in any of the release parameters for up to 3 months.

After the first vaccination by day 28, neutralization activity was present in all participants sera of the three cohorts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Moreover, after the second vaccination pVNA levels increased 16-fold for the low dose, and 30-fold for the mid and high dose. The mean neutralizing antibody titers in PTX-COVID19-B vaccinated groups were at least eightfold higher at all doses compared to control serum samples from convalescent patients, indicated as human convalescent serum or HCS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The anti-S and anti-RBD antibody levels correlated with the neutralization units in all three assays (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par21">Vaccination with PTX-COVID19-B in 45 subjects of ages between 18- and 64-year-old did not result in any overt safety signal. Local reactions were mild after the first vaccine dose in general. Moderate to severe local pain was observed in a small number of participants (Cohorts 1 6%, and 26.7% for Cohorts 2 and 3). Similarly, systemic reactions were mild for most of the participants. Moderate headaches were observed in 6.7% of Cohort 1 and 13.3% of Cohort 2 participants. Moderate muscle pain was reported in 6.7% of Cohort 3 and 13.3% of Cohort 1 and severe pain was reported in 6.7% of Cohort 2.</p>
              <p id="Par22">After the second dose moderate pain at the injection site was similar to the first vaccine injection (13%, 0% and 26.7% for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). However, moderate, and severe redness was observed in participants of Cohort 3 (33%). Also, moderate head aches and fatigue increase in Cohort 3–26% and 33% respectively whereas Cohort 2 showed systemic events only in 7.1% of the participants. These post second dose AE results let us to conclude that 16 μg and 40 μg would be preferred doses for vaccine development. Since the study is small, safety needs to be confirmed in follow up clinical trials with a larger number of participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">PTX-COVID19-B induced antibody titers against RBD and Spike remain high and above the values of COVID-19 convalescence serum over a period of 6 months (day 180) after initial vaccination, especially in the 40 μg and 100 μg dose cohorts, indicating a durable systemic antibody response.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Neutralizing antibody was observed in 100% of the vaccinated participants after the first immunization at day 28 regardless of the dose level. We speculate that this early induction of neutralizing antibody may be beneficial for vaccinees since it may provide early protection against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The neutralization serum activity post second immunization, determined using the Pseudovirus assay, was lower for the VOCs compared to the G614 strain. Fold titer reduction against Alpha was 2, against Delta was 3 in all three dose cohorts and against Beta was 4 in the 40 μg and 100 μg cohort. Some studies report similar findings with individuals vaccinated with approved mRNA vaccines, where the fold reduction against Alpha is 2, against Delta is 3–4 and more than 10 for Beta variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These results suggest that vaccination with PTX-COVID19-B induced antibody response that could cross protect against VOC, Alpha, Beta and Delta.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Studies proposing predictive models of COVID19 vaccine efficacy using data from approved vaccines, indicate that neutralizing antibody titers above twofold the value of HCS are predictive of over 80% efficacy protection against SARS-CoV2 ancestral strain infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This small phase 1 trial showed that PTX-COVID19-B induced neutralization titers, that are more than 8, 16 and 44 fold higher than convalescent sera at 16 μg, 40 μg and 100 μg respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that PTX-COVID19-B could potentially be an efficacious vaccine candidate against Wuhan derived strains. Moreover, the strong immunogenicity of PTX-COVID19-B indicates that the full-length expression of Spike without the proline-proline stabilization, can produce a good Spike target for vaccine development. All these potential advantages of PTX-COVID19-B candidate vaccine need to be further evaluated in follow-up clinical trials.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The 40-µg dose was selected to progress into a Phase 2 clinical trial, because it had the right balance between the immune response and satisfactory reactogenicity profile.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Critical limitations of this trial include a small study population and limited ethnic diversity as compared with the general population. Additionally, as a Phase 1 safety trial, the study population did not include those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including older adults and immunocompromised individuals that may mount a weaker immune response to vaccination.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Although several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved globally (most under emergency or interim use), issues remain with supply and delivery of vaccines to combat emerging variants. Additional safe, effective, and easily deployable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed to meet the challenge for global immunization required to end the pandemic. Based on the reported results, PTX-COVID19-B vaccine is a promising candidate that warrants testing in the next phase of trials. A Phase 2 comparator trial of PTX-COVID19-B and Comirnaty in 525 healthy adults with the 40-µg dose has been performed and data is being analyzed for a future report. T cell responses were evaluated in a significant number of participants of the Phase 2 trial to complete the immune response profile of the vaccine.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The sera from subjects vaccinated with PTX-COVID19-B did not cross neutralize Omicron Spike expressing pseudovirus (data not shown). These results were expected since Omicron Spike from the new VOC differ in more than 30 amino acids from D614G Spike. Based on the performance of the mRNA and LNP of PTX-COVID19-B, future booster vaccine development is planned with updated Spike versions of circulating strains.</p>

Diluted samples as well as calibrators and controls were added to MSD plates (multi-spot wells) coated with either the S or RBD SARS-CoV-2 antigens to capture human IgG antibodies present in the samples. Bound IgG antibodies were then detected using sulfo-TAG labeled anti-human IgG antibody. The human IgG antibody concentration was determined by interpolation of the ECL count on the calibration curve. The assay was validated and performed under GLP conditions at CIRION (Laval, Quebec; V-PLEX® SARS-CoV-2 Panel 2 Kit). Analysts knew timepoints but not dose levels or regimen of the samples. To convert the results from MSD arbitrary units (AU/mL) to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard in binding antibody units (BAU)/mL, a conversion factor of 0.0272 was applied for anti-RBD IgG concentrations and 0.00901 for anti-S IgG concentrations. Additionally, anti-S and anti-RBD IgG measurements for 21 control serum samples from convalescent patients with a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA diagnosis (mentioned in the test as Human Convalescent Sera or HCS) were also performed (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The HCS samples provided by the laboratory were obtained as a donation from volunteers. No demographic or time from infection were provided.</p>

                  <title>Anti-S ELISA</title>
                  <p id="Par39">An indirect binding ELISA was also performed to determine if the elicited antibodies could bind the S protein. The SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion S antigen was adsorbed onto a 96-well microplate and standard ELISA procedure was followed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG specific antibody (primary antibody) and anti-human IgG antibody (secondary antibody) conjugated to peroxidase. The absorbance of each well was measured using a spectrophotometer at a specific wavelength (450/620 nm). A standard on each tested plate was used to calculate the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S according to the unit assigned by the standard (ELU/mL). The assay was validated and performed under GLP conditions at Nexelis a Q<sup>2</sup> Solutions Company (Laval, Quebec). To convert the results to the WHO International Standard in BAU/mL, a conversion factor of 1/7.9815 was applied. Additionally, anti-S IgG ELISA measurements for 28 control serum samples from convalescent patients with a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA diagnosis (mentioned in the test as Human Convalescent Sera or HCS) were also performed. Demographics, time from infection or any personal data from HCS donors were not provided by the laboratory.</p>

                  <p id="Par40">To evaluate the neutralizing effect of the sera from participants treated with PTX-COVID19-B, a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay developed and validated at Nexelis, Canada to quantify the titer of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The assay used rVSV particles containing modified S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan strain) for which the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail were removed. The pseudoparticles contained a luciferase reporter for quantification in relative luminescence units (RLU). The dilution of plasma required to achieve 50% neutralization (NT50) when compared to the pseudoparticle control was interpolated from a linear regression using the two dilutions flanking the 50% neutralization. To convert the NT50 titer to the WHO International Standard in IU/mL, a conversion factor of 1/1.872 was applied. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies for 28 control samples from Human Convalescent Sera (HCS) were assessed in the pseudovirus (rVSV) neutralization assay.</p>

                  <title>Pseudovirus neutralization lentivirus-based assay</title>
                  <p id="Par41">To determine neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu1 (D614G) and the VOCs, a pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudotyped lentivirus at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, Ontario). Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral assays were performed as previously described with minor modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The pseudotyped virus used in this assay is a lentivirus expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu1 (D614G), or the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), or Delta (B.617.2) variants. Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus particles were generated and used at a virus dilution resulting in &gt; 1000 RLU over control. For the neutralization assay, human sera were serially diluted and incubated with diluted pseudovirus at a 1:1 ratio for 1 h at 37 °C followed by transfer to plated HEK293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were then lysed, and Bright Glo luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added for 2 min prior to reading with a PerkinElmer Envision instrument (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The ID50 were calculated in GraphPad Prism 9 using a nonlinear regression algorithm (log[inhibitor] versus normalized response—variable slope). The assay was performed in the same manner for all VOCs tested.</p>

                <title>ACE2:S neutralization assay</title>
                <p id="Par42">The neutralizing antibody response was analyzed at days 8, 28, and 42 using a S-ACE2:S blocking assay which has an ECL readout on the MSD platform. The assay measures antibodies that block the binding ofACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD antigens. Blocking antibodies bind to S protein in the plate and prevent the binding of ACE2 labeled with MSD-Sulfotag. A reference standard, included in the kit, was used to generate a standard curve. Neutralizing antibody concentrations in samples were calculated by backfitting the measured signals for samples to the standard curve. Correcting for dilution provided the final neutralization antibody concentration in undiluted samples. In this assay, 1 unit/mL corresponded to neutralizing activity of 1000 ng/mL of antibody that can bind to S protein.</p>
