                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Few studies have examined how maternal body mass index (BMI), mode of delivery and ethnicity affect the microbial composition of human milk and none have examined associations with maternal metabolic status. Given the high prevalence of maternal adiposity and impaired glucose metabolism, we systematically investigated the associations between these maternal factors in women ≥20 years and milk microbial composition and predicted functionality by V4-16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (NCT01405547; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01405547">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01405547</ext-link>). Demographic data, weight, height, and a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test were gathered at 30 (95% CI: 25–33) weeks gestation, and milk samples were collected at 3 months post-partum (<italic>n</italic> = 113).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Multivariable linear regression analyses demonstrated no significant associations between maternal characteristics (maternal BMI [pre-pregnancy, 3 months post-partum], glucose tolerance, mode of delivery and ethnicity) and milk microbiota alpha-diversity; however, pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with human milk microbiota beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.037). Women with a pre-pregnancy BMI &gt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese) had a greater incidence of Bacteroidetes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 3.70 [95% CI: 1.61–8.48]) and a reduced incidence of Proteobacteria (0.62 [0.43–0.90]) in their milk, compared to women with an overweight BMI (25.0–29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) as assessed by multivariable Poisson regression. An increased incidence of <italic>Gemella</italic> was observed among mothers with gestational diabetes who had an overweight BMI versus healthy range BMI (5.96 [1.85–19.21]). An increased incidence of <italic>Gemella</italic> was also observed among mothers with impaired glucose tolerance with an obese BMI versus mothers with a healthy range BMI (4.04 [1.63–10.01]). An increased incidence of <italic>Brevundimonas</italic> (16.70 [5.99–46.57]) was found in the milk of women who underwent an unscheduled C-section versus vaginal delivery. Lastly, functional gene inference demonstrated that pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with an increased abundance of genes encoding for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway in milk (coefficient = 0.0024, <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &lt; 0.1).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Breastfeeding is the recommended method of feeding for all infants irrespective of whether the country of origin is low, middle, or high-income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Human milk is a rich source of nutrients and bioactive components, such as the antimicrobial proteins lactoferrin and lysozyme, and contains an array of oligosaccharides which serve as a source of prebiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is now well accepted that human milk contains a rich supply of bacteria (~ 10<sup>6</sup> bacterial cells/mL), which are believed to play an important role in postnatal colonization of the infant’s gastrointestinal tract (gut) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Microbial composition of the gut, in turn, is associated with maturation of an infant’s gut and immune system, and aberrant gut microbial compositions have been linked to a number of short- and long-term health outcomes including diarrhea, respiratory tract infection, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">There is a limited understanding of the stability of the human milk microbiota in the face of environmental influences. Despite the high prevalence and known impact on other milk constituents, no study we are aware of has examined the association between maternal glucose tolerance status, either gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, and the milk microbiota. Only a few studies to date have cross-sectionally examined other maternal factors, such as maternal BMI and mode of delivery, on the microbiota composition of mature human milk (collected from 1-week to 6-months post-partum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, the findings from the few available studies are inconsistent likely due, in part, to the small number of study participants, and differing methods of milk collection and analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Table S1). Of the limited studies conducted, maternal BMI and mode of delivery have been associated with the mature milk microbiota; however, many of these reports relied on small cohorts and thus their findings require replication in larger studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further, most studies were unable to employ multivariable statistical modelling to adjust for multiple potential maternal factors of interest simultaneously. Lastly, none of these studies carried out functional inference analyses to determine if maternal BMI and mode of delivery also perturb the milk microbiome’s potential metabolic activities or predicted functional capabilities.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Therefore, we set out to fill these knowledge gaps in the field by taking advantage of milk samples and clinical metadata that had been previously collected from women enrolled in a prospective cohort study to investigate the impact of metabolic abnormalities and maternal nutrition in pregnancy on human milk composition (NCT01405547). The objective of this current study was to investigate the associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (healthy, overweight, or obese), 3-month post-partum BMI, maternal glucose tolerance status in late pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], or normoglycemia), mode of delivery (vaginal delivery, unscheduled Caesarean delivery [C-section], or scheduled C-section), and ethnicity (white, Asian, or other [South Asian, Black, other]) on the microbial community composition and predicted functional capabilities of human milk at 3 months post-partum. This research will help to elucidate the modulatory potential of human milk microbiota in the face of physiological perturbations.</p>

Fifty-six (49.6%) mothers fed their infants their own milk exclusively at the time of milk collection (versus 57 [50.4%] mixed feeds), and 61 (53.9%) samples were from a complete breast expression (versus 52 [46.0%] from incomplete breast expression). The mean (± SD) age of the mothers was 34.2 ± 4.2 years (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with a pre-pregnancy BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of 24.3 ± 4.6, which is within a healthy BMI range (18.5–24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). A modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) administered at 30 weeks’ gestation (95% CI: 25–33 weeks) revealed that 24 (21.2%) women had GDM, 20 (17.7%) had IGT, and 69 (61.1%) had healthy glucose metabolism (normoglycemic). Among women with a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI, 12 and 16 had IGT and GDM, respectively. Among women with an overweight pre-pregnancy BMI, 5 had IGT and 5 had GDM (10 total). Lastly, among women with an obese pre-pregnancy BMI 3 had IGT and 3 had GDM (6 total; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Table S2). Sixty-four (56.6%) mothers delivered their infants vaginally, compared to the 49 (43.4%) who underwent a C-section.

                <p id="Par30">We carried out functional inference analyses using Piphillin to assess if there were any differences in predicted functional capabilities of the milk microbiota based on the maternal clinical data. In contrast with the bacterial taxonomic results, the relative abundance of the 20 top KEGG pathways across all milk samples was fairly consistent (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>, Fig. S3). We analyzed the association between maternal clinical data and KEGG ortholog (KO) beta-diversity as well as examined the association between maternal clinical parameters and differentially-expressed KEGG pathways (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>, Table S10; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>, Table S11; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>, Table S12).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par31">Our results suggest that maternal factors, and most consistently maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, are associated with the microbial composition of human milk. This is the first study to include maternal glucose tolerance status in the investigations of the association between maternal BMI and the milk microbiota (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Table S1). Gestational diabetes is associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in the mother. According to a recent systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis, the risk of GDM increases by 4% for every unit increase in BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While some negative health outcomes associated with GDM are related to maternal adiposity and vice versa, others are thought to be independently related to chronically impaired glucose metabolism. Thus, it is important to investigate the impact of maternal BMI and GDM together on the composition of the milk microbiota. Our results show a significant interaction between pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational glucose intolerance on the differential abundance of <italic>Gemella</italic> in human milk. This suggests that associations between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and the human milk microbiota are differentially impacted by maternal glucose tolerance status.</p>
              <p id="Par32">We did not find any differences in alpha-diversity based on our maternal characteristics; however, we did find statistically significant differences in beta-diversity, with human milk microbiota separating, or non-randomly clustering, based on pre-pregnancy BMI even after adjustment for other covariates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, Fig. S1; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Fig. S1; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>, Table S5). The human gut microbiota has been reported to cluster as a function of body size, but this has not yet been reported for the human milk microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results demonstrating an association between maternal BMI and microbial composition is consistent with other smaller scale studies on human milk microbiotas (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Table S1). Cabrera-Rubio et al. (2012) examined the association between maternal body size and the differential abundance of human milk genera in a study of healthy Finnish women (<italic>n</italic> = 18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. They reported an increase in <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in human milk collected from obese women, which mirrors the findings in our study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, Table S6).</p>
              <p id="Par33">Mode of delivery was also associated with changes in the human milk microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, Table S6). For example, we observed greater differential abundance of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in human milk from women who underwent a scheduled C-section versus vaginal delivery (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, Table S6). Our results are similar to that reported by Cabrera-Rubio et al. (2012, 2016). These two small cross-sectional cohorts of healthy Finnish women (n = 18, 10) showed a non-statistically significant increase in <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in milk observed among women who delivered their infant via a scheduled C-section versus a vaginal delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The proposed mechanism whereby mode of delivery alters the milk microbiota is via the infant oral cavity, which is colonized during either vaginal delivery or C-section; from here, retrograde inoculation of bacteria can occur from the infant’s oral cavity into the mammary gland via the suckling process with direct breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Understanding how an infant’s gut microbiota and overall health is impacted by differences in the milk microbiota based on mode of delivery remains uninvestigated. Future studies profiling the human milk microbiome, infant salivary microbiome and gut microbiome with repeated clinical follow-up over time would help answer these questions.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The results of our multi-ethnic cohort revealed associations between ethnicity and specific bacterial taxa. Ethnicity and/or geographic location have been shown to be factors in determining various microbiomes of the body including the gut, oral cavity, respiratory tract, skin, and urogenital tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Ethnicity and geographic location typically come with an overlay of dietary variation, making the impact of each variable challenging to separate. Only a few studies to date have assessed associations between ethnicity and the milk microbiota; however, the ethnic/geographic groups differed from our study as they generally examined Europe, Africa and the United States, making it challenging to compare findings (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>, Table S7; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>, Table S9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">We used a functional inference approach to characterize the microbial genetic potential in human milk. In agreement with what has been reported for other human-associated microbiotas, the functional capacity of the human milk microbiota is more stable than its taxonomic composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We then assessed whether there were specific predicted pathways that were suggested to be associated with maternal characteristics and found that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, specifically the obese sub-category, was significantly associated with an increase in the “Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” predicted KEGG pathway. Microbes produce secondary metabolites, which are small, bioactive molecules, not necessary for growth or development but are instead involved in microbe-host or microbe-microbe interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Indeed, many of the genes in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway encode for the biosynthesis of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We assessed whether any individual genes (KO terms) involved in the predicted “Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” pathway were significantly associated with BMI using MaAsLin2; however, no statistically significant associations were found. We hypothesize this may mean it is the culmination of many genes together that are leading to the enrichment of the “Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” pathway, and not one individual gene. However, these observations require confirmation in future studies.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Human milk is considered a low biomass sample and, for this reason, may be more affected by sample processing than higher biomass samples, such as stool. To address this concern, we used PCoA plots to visualize clustering, or lack thereof, of our milk samples and negative controls (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">17</xref>, Fig. S5). Our negative controls were seen to cluster away from the samples, suggesting that our results do not arise from technical contaminates, which was confirmed using Adonis analyses to statistically corroborate that our samples clustered away from the negative controls (Weighted UniFrac R<sup>2</sup> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001; Bray-Curtis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">17</xref>, Fig. S5).</p>
              <p id="Par37">Strengths of the current study include the varied ethnicity of women included, clinical examination via an OGTT, and enrichment of the cohort with women of varying body sizes who had abnormal glucose tolerance status. These strengths allowed for a more fulsome investigation using multivariable statistics to determine how each maternal factor is independently associated with the milk microbiome. Despite our larger sample size as compared to most earlier studies, we did not have sufficient sample size for adjustment of all covariates of interest (e.g., maternal diet) and thus were not able to perform the granular analyses needed to fully investigate the sub-groups within each metadata category. Future research should strive for larger sample sizes providing greater statistical power in order to capture more potential confounders. Additionally, although an acceptable sequencing depth was reached, rare but important microbes may still have been missed as our methods may not have been sensitive enough to pick up on certain important microbes. The compositional nature of data generated from next-generation sequencing also remains a challenge since it is limited to assessing relative (versus absolute) abundance; in other words, it holds the assumption that if one bacterial taxa increases, another bacterial taxa must conversely decrease, regardless of how the absolute abundance of these taxa may be changing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Lastly, although interesting, the use of Piphillin to determine associations between metadata and predicted pathways is only hypothesis generating and requires confirmation using a combination of shotgun metagenomics, metabolomic profiling or comparison of matched human milk samples. Moreover, the microbes identified in the milk from the present study likely include bacteria from the mother’s skin microbiota as her breast was not disinfected prior to milk sampling. Practically, however, mothers do not disinfect their breast prior to pumping and storing milk for their infant, nor do they disinfect prior to breastfeeding. Therefore, the human milk microbiota as collected in the current study is likely a more accurate depiction of what the infant would receive. Finally, our study is limited by its cross-sectional analytic design and thus we cannot assess how the milk microbiota changes over time. It is possible that the associations we identified between maternal factors and microbial composition in milk are not transitory and change across the course of lactation.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par38">Our study found that human milk has a highly personalized microbiota with high inter-individual variability. Expressed human milk at both the phylum and genus levels appear to be related to maternal metabolic and obstetrical factors. Surprisingly, glucose tolerance status was significantly associated with fewer microbiota parameters than anticipated. Most consistently, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, despite glucose tolerance status, was associated with the differential abundance of various taxa in human milk and potentially the production of bacterial secondary metabolites as well. To understand the clinical significance of these findings, future research should explore how differences in the microbial composition of human milk impact infant’s microbial colonization and overall health.</p>

Contrary to standard obstetrical practice, all women completed a 3-h 100 g OGTT in the current study during their first study visit regardless of whether or not they completed a GCT. The OGTT involved having blood samples drawn at fasting, 30, 60, 90, 120- and 180-min post-glucose load. Women were then diagnosed with either GDM, IGT, or as normoglycemic based on the following glycemic thresholds: 1) GDM diagnosis = 2 or more of the following: fasting blood glucose ≥5.8 mmol/L, 1-h blood glucose ≥10.6 mmol/L, 2-h blood glucose ≥9.2 mmol/L, or 3-h blood glucose ≥8.1 mmol/L, or 2) IGT diagnosis would exceed only one of the previous thresholds, or 3) normoglycemic = normal OGTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>

Of note, 6 mothers with a pre-pregnancy BMI between 18.0–18.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were placed in the “healthy BMI” group for all analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Beta diversities and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were also ascertained in phyloseq and statistical significance based on maternal characteristics was determined using the adonis function in vegan (version 2.5–3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Adonis assesses the amount of variation explained by each metadata variable, such as maternal BMI or glucose tolerance status; all variables were run individually and together in adonis to adjust for one another. The interaction term between BMI and glucose tolerance status was also tested and removed if non-significant. Four patient samples were missing the post-partum BMI data and thus we used their pre-pregnancy BMI for the post-partum analyses. Again, the significance level was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
                <p id="Par48">Multivariable Poisson regression models (PROC GENMOD) were run in SAS version 9.4 to assess differential abundance at the phylum and genus levels based on maternal characteristics. The Benjamini-Yekutieli cut point approach was used to account for multiple testing. A <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.022 at the phylum level (5 tests) and <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.017 (10 tests) at the genus level were considered statistically significant for the overall group effect. If the overall group-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value was significant, pairwise comparisons were conducted and a pairwise <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

                <title>Piphillin: functional analysis of human milk microbiota</title>
                <p id="Par49">Piphillin, a metagenomics inference tool, was used to infer functional capabilities in milk samples (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://piphillin.secondgenome.com/">https://piphillin.secondgenome.com/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In this study, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>) was used as a reference database to retrieve gene copy numbers and create a gene feature table from the 16S rRNA sequence data. Statistically significant associations between maternal characteristics and KEGG pathways were assessed in three ways: 1) examining the association between maternal characteristics and KO beta-diversity using Adonis in R (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 2) investigating metadata associated with differentially-expressed predicted functional pathways using MaAsLin2 in R (<italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &lt; 0.1) and 3) investigating metadata associated with individual genes (KO) found in the differentially expressed functional pathways from step 2.</p>
