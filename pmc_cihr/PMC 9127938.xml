                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Perinatal stroke injures motor regions of the brain, compromising movement for life. Early, intensive, active interventions for the upper extremity are efficacious, but interventions for the lower extremity remain understudied.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of ELEVATEâEngaging the Lower Extremity Via Active Therapy Earlyâon gross motor function.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT), with the Immediate Group receiving the intervention while the Delay Group served as a 3-month waitlist control. A separate cohort living beyond commuting distance was trained by their parents with guidance from physical therapists. Participants were 8Â months to 3Â years old, with MRI-confirmed perinatal ischemic stroke and early signs of hemiparesis. The intervention was play-based, focused on weight-bearing, balance and walking for 1Â hour/day, 4Â days/week for 12Â weeks. The primary outcome was the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). Secondary outcomes included steps and gait analyses. Final follow-up occurred at age 4.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Thirty-four children participated (25 RCT, 9 Parent-trained). The improvement in GMFM-66 over 12Â weeks was greater for the Immediate than the Delay Group in the RCT (average change 3.4 units higher) and greater in younger children. Average step counts reached 1370-3750 steps/session in the last week of training for all children. Parent-trained children also improved but with greater variability.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Early, activity-intensive lower extremity therapy for young children with perinatal stroke is feasible and improves gross motor function in the short term. Longer term improvement may require additional bouts of intervention.</p>

              <p>Perinatal stroke is a cerebrovascular event that occurs between gestational age of 20Â weeks and 28Â days postnatal, and has an incidence between one in 1600 to 2300 live births.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It is the leading cause of hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP), which may involve weakness, spasticity and impaired coordination in the affected upper and lower extremity.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The life-long gross motor impairments contribute to long-term musculoskeletal complications, impaired gait, reduced physical activity and participation.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>

              <p>Current clinical practice for lower extremity function in young children with CP is often passive in nature, typically waiting until clinical signs appear, then focusing on static stretching, the traditional Neural Developmental Therapy (NDT), bracing with ankle-foot orthoses and botulinum toxin injection of spastic muscles,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr15-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> a âwait-and-seeâapproach.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Yet targeted walking training in school-aged children improves walking performance in children with CP.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The passive, infrequent and delayed approach to treatment of the lower extremity for young children with hemiparetic CP is in contrast to evidence from animal models of early brain injury, which demonstrates the importance of early, intensive rehabilitation.</p>
              <p>Inactivating the primary motor cortex in kittens during a critical period of development impairs the development of motor circuits and motor function.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Initiating motor training of the affected limb while kittens are young improves motor function and the integrity of motor circuits, whereas training at an older age is less effective.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Critical periods of lower extremity motor development in the human may occur before the age of 2Â years because post-mortem studies have shown mature myelin on the corticospinal tract at the lumbar neurological level around this age.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Since mature myelin is associated with reduced neuroplasticity,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> we suggest that plasticity would be greatest prior to the emergence of mature myelin.

                    <p>A waitlist control, single-blind, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at 2 centers (Edmonton and Calgary, Canada). The experimental design is represented in <xref rid="fig1-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Children were stratified by city, then randomized to train immediately (Immediate Group) or delay training for 3Â months (Delay Group). Children in the Delay group did not undergo an alternative intervention, but served as a waitlist control by continuing with their usual care for the 3Â month delay period. Usual care in the participants in this study typically consisted of 1Â hour sessions of occupational and/or physical therapy approximately 1â2 times/month. Children in an additional parallel cohort who lived beyond commuting distance were trained immediately by their parent or guardian (Parent-trained Group) with guidance from a PT. These children were not part of the RCT but were included to increase accessibility and to assess the feasibility of the intervention when delivered by a parent. Data from this cohort are descriptive and were assessed separately from the RCT. Final follow-up occurred within 3Â months of each childâs fourth birthday.<fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="fig1-15459683221090931"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental Design and MethodsA) A schematic diagram of the experimental design indicating the RCT component (top two rows) and the Parent-trained Group (third row).

                    <p>The ELEVATE (Engaging the Lower Extremity Via Active Therapy Early) intervention was 1Â hour/day, 4Â days/week for 12Â weeks. The intervention was delivered by 1 of 2 PTs (DL or KB) in a laboratory at the University of Alberta (Edmonton) or a satellite campus in Calgary. In the Parent-trained cohort, the intervention was delivered by the childâs parent in their home, guided by 1 of the 2 therapists. This included weekly support by phone and monthly in-person collaborative training session between the therapist and parent when children returned to the laboratory for assessments. If parents requested more frequent in-person training, it was accommodated.</p>
                    <p>The intervention was intensive, child-initiated, play-based movement of the lower extremities, as described in the protocol.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The intervention occurred primarily over ground on various surfaces, including linoleum, carpet, mats, grass, and sidewalks. Children occasionally walked on a treadmill for parts of the training sessions if that was their preference. Children wore soft-soled slippers and no orthotics while training to enhance the use of muscles in the feet and around the ankle. Activities included ascending and descending stairs and ramps, walking on stable and unstable surfaces, stepping over obstacles, balancing in standing, kicking, and squatting to pick up items (<xref rid="fig1-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Manual support from the therapist was provided as needed to facilitate 60Â minutes of child-initiated activity. To increase exercise intensity and to augment movement error,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> weights were placed on the dorsum of the foot and the ankle of the affected leg of children with sufficient endurance to stay active for 50 to 60Â minutes. Weights were added to the affected foot and ankle, which makes a childâs gait more asymmetric and the amount of weight was increased when the childâs gait became more symmetrical. Children with cerebral palsy adapt to weights in a similar way to uninjured children.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Using weights allowed for specific strengthening of the musculature in the affected lower extremity. Commercially available weights in increments of 110Â g were used for the ankle, and one-quarter-inch chain links, â¼20Â g each, were affixed to the dorsum of the foot with elasticized fabric (<xref rid="fig1-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).

Sixty-six tasks spanning 5 dimensions were scored, including lying and rolling, sitting, crawling and kneeling, standing, and walking/running/jumping. Reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change have been established for children â¥6Â months of age.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> GMFM-66 assessments were performed by pediatric PTs who were blinded to the childâs group assignment. GMFM-66 assessments were performed twice at baseline, separated by a week and monthly thereafter (throughout the study period, see <xref rid="fig1-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The 2 baseline assessments were averaged for each participant.</p>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Step Counts</italic>: Step counts were assessed using the StepWatch activity monitor (Orthocare Innovations, Seattle, WA). Full-day step counts were recorded at the beginning, middle, and end of each study period (delay, training, and follow-up) as a measure of activity outside training sessions. Parents placed step counters on the ankle of the childâs affected leg for waking hours (excluding water activities) for a target of 6Â days and documented activities and time of day in a log. Counts from a minimum of 2 full days of recording were averaged. Step counts were also measured using the StepWatch during every training session to quantify the amount of activity on the affected lower extremity for both therapist-trained and parent-trained children.</p>

Experimenters for these outcomes were not blinded. Children walked with soft-soled slippers, played with toys on a table in front of them and received manual support on their lateral thorax, as needed. Gait assessments were performed once at baseline and monthly thereafter throughout the study.</p>
                    <p>A custom-built split-belt treadmill, with a force plate under each belt, was used in Edmonton. A commercial treadmill (TR1200B; LifeSpan, Salt Lake City, UT) without force plates was used in Calgary. Walking kinematics were captured either with the 3-D Investigator (NDI, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) in Edmonton or the Motion Analysis System using 12 Eagle-4 cameras (Santa Rosa, CA, USA) in Calgary. Markers were placed at the top of the iliac crest, greater trochanter, knee joint line, lateral malleolus, and head of the fifth metatarsal, bilaterally.

                <p>The CONSORT diagram (<xref rid="fig2-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), shows 83 potential participants were referred (45 in Edmonton, 38 in Calgary) and screened by a research PT. Twenty-four did not meet inclusion criteria, the most common reasons being no deficits observed (n = 14), other neurological complications (n = 3) or not ischemic perinatal stroke (n = 3). A further 25 potential participants declined to enroll in the study, with the most common reason reported by parents being a prohibitive time commitment (n = 16). Thirty-four children (21 in Edmonton, 13 in Calgary) were accepted into the study. One participant in the Immediate Group withdrew before the intervention began due to the childâs unwillingness to participate in assessments. This participant was excluded from the analysis because no data were collected. The total number of participants included in the Delay, Immediate, and Parent-trained Groups in the first 3-month period was 13, 12, and 9, respectively. One child withdrew following the 3-month delay because the family moved out of the province. One child in the Immediate Group missed the assessments at the end of training due to a family issue unrelated to the study so their data were not included in the statistical analysis, but the child returned for 3-month follow-up assessments. Ten children in the Delay Group participated in training following the delay period. One child switched from the Delay Group to the Parent-trained Group after completing the delay period because the family moved out of town. No participants in the Immediate or Parent-trained groups withdrew during the intervention phase. All but 1 child in the Delay group completed the 3Â months of training following the control period. All participants in the Immediate Group completed monthly follow-up for 3Â months following training. The study design did not initially include 3-month follow-up for the Delay and Parent-trained Groups but was amended midway to monitor their function following the training. Hence, 3-month follow-up was conducted for only 8 participants in the Delay Group and 3 participants in the Parent-trained Group. Twenty-five children completed a 4-year-old follow-up GMFM-66 assessment. The most common reason for loss to follow-up was scheduling difficulties. Other reasons included refusal to subject child to further assessments, moving out of town following the study and inability to collect data due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

This change is higher than previously reported minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) of 1.7 (medium) and 2.7 (large),<sup><xref rid="bibr33-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> although these MCIDs were established in an older population of children and included children with unilateral and bilateral CP. By the end of the training, children who were walking independently were taking an average of approximately 3000 steps (2862) with their affected lower extremity in 1Â hour of training, and children who were walking with assistance were taking an average of approximately 2000 steps (1881). There was also a trend for improved symmetry in walking with training, but this was not statistically significant. These results demonstrate that it is possible to engage young children in intensive training of the lower extremity resulting in significant improvement in gross motor function in the short term.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Despite randomization there was a difference in age between the control and intervention groups. Since intervening at an earlier age could be more efficacious, a multivariable statistical modeling was used to account for the age difference. Another limitation is the relatively small number of participants (n = 25 in RCT), and equipment limitations that only allowed weight-bearing in walking to be assessed at 1 site. Further, step counts were used to measure dosage of the intervention, but the training also included other active while stationary skills such as standing balance and squatting, which are not reflected in step counts. Usual care for these children typically consists of 1Â hour sessions of occupational and/or physical therapy approximately 1â2 times/month; however, this was not systematically tracked throughout the delay period in this study. Finally, 1 3-month bout of intensive training may not be sufficient to have a significant impact on long-term motor function. Determining the ideal time for additional training is needed.</p>

                <title>Nature of Motor Intervention</title>
                <p>The premise of this study is based on enhancing neuroplasticity in the developing nervous system. The development of the nervous system is driven by activity, so a child-initiated, activity-based approach was used. This approach incorporates principles such as specificity, repetition, and intensity to promote experience-dependent plasticity.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Novak and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr35-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> indicated that there is clear evidence for rehabilitation approaches that improve function and those that do not; interventions that use volitional active movements at high intensity to practice task-specific training of real-life activities enhance motor outcomes. Intensive rehabilitation has been shown to result in greater improvements in gross motor function than non-intensive treatment and the effect tends to be stronger for children under 2Â years of age.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We observed this trend for larger improvements in GMFM-66 scores when training was initiated before 2Â years old (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/15459683221090931" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material Figure 2</ext-link>). However, other reasons besides the greater neuroplasticity of a young nervous system should not be discounted, including the natural reduction in improvement of the GMFM-66 with age,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> the greater challenge in directing children around the age of 2Â years old, and the difficulty of enhancing lower extremity function in independently walking children. Differentiating between these factors is difficult.</p>
                <p>ELEVATE was tailored to each child to continually challenge their functional ability. For example, children walked on different surfaces with as little support as needed and tasks were made progressively difficult (e.g., walking in different direction or at different speeds, ascending stairs and ramps). Improvements in function only continue when difficulty of the training is increased.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The challenge in ELEVATE included increasing the number of repetitions (steps) and the presumed activity of the muscles (e.g., use of weights and progressively increasing task difficulty to challenge balance and gross motor skills).</p>
                <p>We provided ample opportunities for children to develop motor skills through a variety of sensorimotor experiences, analogous to approaches used by the Neuronal Group Selection Theory.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> For example, children in our study trained on many walking surfaces. Motivation was increased and reinforced throughout the training using play and positive feedback. Motivation and child-initiated movement are essential to enhance neuroplasticity, so task-specific training that is rewarding and enjoyable may promote higher intensity of training and spontaneous, child-initiated practice of skills outside of training sessions. We speculate that the continued improvement during the follow-up period suggests the children continued to use their newly learned skills. Indeed, the full-day step counts (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/15459683221090931" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material, Figure 1</ext-link>) suggest that children in the Immediate and Parent-trained Groups continued to increase in daily steps and GMFM scores (<xref rid="fig3-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), while the Delay Group showed less improvement in both. The differences may be related to the personal characteristics of the children.</p>

                <title>Early Intervention</title>
                <p>The children entered this study as young as 8Â months old, when typically developing children increase their lower extremity strength as they begin to pull to stand and increase weight-bearing. Lower extremity muscle volume is comparable between typically developing children and those with CP until 15Â months of age.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The change after 15Â months is likely related in part to reduced use as typically developing children begin to walk independently around 12Â±3Â months and involves thousands of steps per day, while those with CP are less active and have fewer opportunities to develop lower extremity strength.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Although it is unclear whether physical activity prevents contractures, early rehabilitation focusing on using the full range of motion may help, since decreased muscle extensibility has been observed as early as 25 to 30Â months of age, with contractures developing before the age of 3.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Several training-based protocols have been reported or are underway for young children (e.g., GAME, HABIT-ILE, small steps, baby-CIMT, baby-bimanual, reviewed in <sup><xref rid="bibr15-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>). While most of these early interventions target the upper extremities, some have included the lower extremity.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Here, we show that early, activity-based intervention focused on the lower extremity is feasible and can improve gross motor function.</p>
                <p>As the efficacy of early interventions is established, early diagnosis of perinatal stroke, and CP in general, is increasingly important (reviewed in <sup><xref rid="bibr44-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="bibr45-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr46-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>).

Some of the difficulties parents encountered in the past included compliance pressure and feeling a lack of confidence.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-15459683221090931" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Here, it was especially challenging for parents with children already independently walking, as seen from the step counts during training (<xref rid="fig4-15459683221090931" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Training families to administer early interventions at home could empower them with the skills to facilitate their childâs rehabilitation while also enhancing their accessibility to a PT. Parents of 2 participants in the Parent-trained Group requested closer contact with the PT. This included more frequent visits than the monthly in-person training. Interestingly, the same 2 children showed the greatest improvement in gross motor function among children in the Parent-trained Group. Thus, more frequent in-person parental support from the therapist may be beneficial.</p>
