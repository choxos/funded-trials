                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) is an important component of the End-TB strategy. However, the number of individuals who successfully complete LTBI treatment remains low as there are losses at all steps in the LTBI âcascade-of-careâ. The reasons for these losses are variable and highly dependent on the setting. We have planned a trial of a standardised public health approach to strengthen the management of household contacts (HHCs) of newly diagnosed patients with pulmonary TB. Assessing costs related to approach is a secondary objective of the study.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomised trial will be conducted in 24 randomisation units (health facilities or groups of health facilities) in five countries. In Phase 1, at intervention sites, we will conduct a standardised assessment of the current LTBI programme, with a focus on cascade-of-care endpoints. Standardised open-ended questionnaires on practices, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding TB prevention are then administered to key patient groups and healthcare workers. At each site, local stake-holders will review study findings and select solutions based on their acceptability, cost and effectiveness. In Phase 2, intervention clinics will implement the selected solutions, along with contact measurement registries and regular in-service LTBI management training. Control sites will continue their usual LTBI care with no explicit evaluation, strengthening or training activities. The primary study outcome is the number of HHC initiating LTBI treatment per newly diagnosed active TB patient, within 3 months of diagnosis of the index patient. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, using a Poisson regression approach.</p>

                  <p>Ethics approval from the MUHC ethical review board (ERB) was obtained in November 2015. During the study standardised tools will be developed and made publicly available. Key study findings and novel methodologic contributions will be detailed in publications and other dissemination activities.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is estimated that almost 2âbillion people globally are infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Modelling studies have projected that even with the implementation of new diagnostic and treatment tools, the goal of TB elimination by 2050<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> will not be achieved without the treatment of persons with latent TB infection (LTBI), the reservoir for new TB cases.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>The WHO has recently endorsed treatment for LTBI as an important TB control strategy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Treatment for LTBI is known to be highly effective under programmatic conditions,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref> however for treatment to be effective, individuals who are most at risk of developing TB need to be identified, screened and offered treatment. People who live with infectious TB patients (household contacts; HHC) are at especially high risk of becoming infected with TB and subsequently progressing to TB disease. Once individuals initiate treatment for LTBI, 61% complete treatment for LTBI,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> however contacts of newly diagnosed TB patients may be lost prior to initiating treatment for a variety of reasons, including: failure to identify those who should be screened; incomplete assessment and subsequent medical evaluation; providers failing to recommend preventive therapy to eligible contacts; and contacts refusing to accept treatment. Cumulatively, all of the losses that occur in the cascade <italic>prior</italic> to treatment initiation result in a greater loss than the proportion lost once treatment has been initiated.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>As most individuals with LTBI are asymptomatic, and so do not spontaneously seek medical attention, health systems must implement contact investigation programmes to identify and screen exposed contacts. In several published evaluations of large-scale LTBI treatment programmes, dropouts and losses have been documented at every stage of the LTBI cascade-of-care, in both high<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11â14</xref> and low-income countries.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>
</p>
              <p>Although the types of health system bottlenecks and patientsâ barriers in the LTBI cascade are well established,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the specific problems vary between and within countries. This means that site-specific evaluations are important to understand which problems lead to important losses during the cascade-of-care,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and what local solutions may be relevant and effective.</p>
              <p>We will conduct a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial (ACT4) over 20âmonths, to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardised public health intervention.</p>
              <p>The primary objective will be to estimate the increase inÂ the number of HHCs initiating LTBI treatment per newly diagnosed index patient, within 3 months of diagnosis of the index patient. The secondary study objective is to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of the LTBI programme evaluation and strengthening approach. In preparation for this trial, a pilot study was conducted to assess study feasibility and refine study tools in 12 health facilities in Brazil. Results from the Brazil pilot will be published as a separate manuscript.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This is a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial in 24 randomisation units (health facilities or groups of health facilities) in Benin, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia and Vietnam. Detailed information about study sites can be obtained from the authors at the coordinating centre. Health facilities randomised to the intervention group will receive a 20âmonth public health intervention. The intervention consists of a first phase of standardised LTBI programme evaluation, followed by a process of stake-holder consultation and local selection of solutions (transition phase) followed by programme strengthening through implementation of these solutions (phase 2) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). This is achieved through structured initial and in-service training and re-evaluation of progress using simple analytic tools based on LTBI management registries. During this time, control sites will continue programmes as usual with no explicit LTBI strengthening related activities.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation of health facilities will take place before the start of phase 1. The randomisation sequence will be stratified by country and restricted to ensure an approximate balance of annual number of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB randomised to each arm within each country. Because the number of TB patients is not the same at all sites within each country, and between countries, a total of 1000 randomisation sequences will be generated using a computer programme developed by the study biostatistician. These 1000 sequences will be examined to verify if the number of expected index cases (and hence the expected number of HHCs) are approximately equal (48%â52%âbalance) overall in the two arms. Randomisations that result in reasonable balance will be selected, and in a final step, one of these sequences will be randomly selected from this subgroup of balanced randomization sequences. The study biostatician will not inform the coordinating centre of the randomization sequence until the start of phase 1. The coordinating centre will then notify sites as to which health facilities are randomised to intervention or control.</p>

                <p>As the study is a cluster randomised trial, and the unit of randomisation is the health facility, it will not be possible to blind health facilities staff, patients with TB disease and their HHCs to their study allocation. In order to minimise bias, the study biostatician will be blinded to study arm throughout any analysis of study outcomes. We will limit contamination at control sites by collecting outcome data from pre-existing sources and minimising interaction of research staff with health facility staff.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome will be the number of HHCs initiating treatment per newly diagnosed TB index patient within 3â4 months from index patient diagnosis (see detailed explanation below). A new TB index patient will be microbiologically confirmed using AFB smear, culture, and/or molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, depending on local protocols. A HHC will be defined as someone who slept in the same house at least one night per week, or spent more than 1âhour in the house at least 5âdays per week, on average, over the preceding 3 months. The house will be defined as the dwelling, or buildings, which the family unit occupies and uses regularly. In all sites treatment initiation for HHCs will be defined as clinical or pharmacy records indicating that a prescription has been issued or, in clinics were medications are given directly to patients, a HHCs being issued LTBI medication by a healthcare worker.</p>

                <title>Activities and data gathering in all health facilities</title>
                <p>Primary study outcome: the primary study outcome will be recorded at all intervention and control health facilities for the full duration of phase 1 (6 months) and for the last 6 months of phase 2, using a standardised form that is available from the coordinating centre. In each of the 6âmonth periods, the total number of index patients, the number of their contacts who were recorded in clinic documents, and the number of these HHCs who initiate LTBI therapy will be collected from existing clinical records, in both the control and intervention arms. Although the data sources will vary by site, the procedures to measure these outcomes will continue unchanged at intervention and control health facilities throughout the study. We will include all HHCs, of all ages that were identified, for new TB index patients diagnosed within the two 6âmonth intervals. For TB index patients diagnosed towards the end of each 6âmonth period in most sites we will allow up to three additional months for the HHCs to be started on LTBI treatment. In the Canadian sites 4 months will be allowed as HHCs tracing involves a baseline and 8-week post-exposure assessment prior to treatment initiation. HHCs started on LTBI treatment more than 3 months (or four in Canadian sites) after the diagnosis of the last index TB patient will not be considered to have achieved the primary study outcome.</p>
                <p>Trial implementation costs and LTBI related health system costs: throughout the trial, costs related to the implementation of the LTBI programme evaluation and strengthening will be measured in each setting, using time and activity logs for research staff, investigators, healthcare workers and management staff involved in implementation. Country specific budgets will be used to obtain expenditures related to services, supplies and materials. To estimate LTBI related health system personnel costs, time and motion studies<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> will be conducted at the start of phase 1 and the end of phase 2. Other information will be obtained at the level of the health facility using a costing questionnaire.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation of the LTBI programme at baseline using a cascade-of-care analysis: in phase 1, a standardised LTBI programme evaluation will be conducted at each intervention health facility to identify local barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment initiation, from the healthcare workers and usersÂ´ perspective. This will inform the selection of solutions applied in phase 2. Two tools will be used: (1) the LTBI cascade-of-care analysis and (2) interviewer-administered questionnaires.<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>LTBI cascade-of-care analysis: existing data sources will be used â including registries of contact investigations, tuberculin testing or LTBI treatment, or individual medical records including but not limited to treatment cards of TB patients on which their contacts are listed. The eight steps outlined in the schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) will be used as a framework for cascade-of-care data collection. Key steps in the framework are as follows: (i) the number index TB patients, (ii) the number of their HHCs who are identified as eligible for symptom screening and LTBI testing; (iii) the number of HHCs who are questioned about symptoms only, and the number who complete LTBI testing; (iv) the number of those tested who are positive; (v) the number of contacts with positive LTBI tests who have a medical evaluation, (vi) the number of HHCs with positive LTBI tests who complete medical evaluation, (vii) the number of contacts that were recommended to initiate treatment for LTBI and (viii) the number of patients who ultimately accept the recommendation to start therapy.

Four groups will be interviewed; (i) index TB patients (ii) HHCs of index TB patients, (iii) parents of young (&lt;5 years) child-aged HHCs of index TB patients and (iv) healthcare workers). At each intervention health facility approximately 10â20 participants from each of these groups will be asked to consent to participating in the study.

                  <p>This information will be shared with stakeholders in each country and intervention health facility during a series of meetings which will have the goal of selecting the most appropriate solution(s). Criteria for selection of solutions will include: evidence of efficacy from published studies, anticipated feasibility and sustainability at participating health facilities, acceptability by healthcare workers and patients, and affordability. Site specific solutions will be reviewed with key programme staff. The specific preparation required will depend on the solutions chosen. As part of the planning for phase 2 it is essential to establish what âstrengthened LTBI managementâ means in each site. Points to consider in the planning process include ensuring health care workers (HCW) have sufficient training in LTBI related topics. Meetings will be arranged with key stakeholders to confirm that they are in agreement with the project, understand the trainings that are essential to the success of strengthening, and the importance of not âcontaminatingâ control sites with study related material.</p>

Topics will include: how to identify HHCs and conduct a contact investigation, initial assessment of contacts, medical evaluation and LTBI diagnosis (including how to administer and read Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)). Procedures for medical evaluation- to exclude active TB and to decide who should receive latent TB treatment will also be included. Treatment for LTBI will be discussed, although the choice of the LTBI regimen is entirely up to the TB programme. Material to use in sessions will be developed as part of the study. Initial training sessions involving key staff can be organised to âtrain the trainerâ, with subsequent sessions led by those trained to larger groups of HCW. Clinical materials (including TST material and supplies) will also need to be available at each health facility. Additional educational materials for patients can be distributed as needed.</p><p>A specific registry for the management of contacts with LTBI will be developed.Â The registry will support data collection and management of HHCs who progress through the cascade, using an index case cohort approach. An important part of the training will be to review how to use the new registry - for clinical management, and to assess progress in LTBI management (ie, repeat cascade analysis, see below). The registry will help reinforce the steps in contact investigation and LTBI management.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implementation of solutions.

Within 1âweek of the initial training, research staff will visit each intervention health facility to review all steps in contact investigation and LTBI diagnosis and treatment. Clinic staff will be asked to perform TST on contacts two to 3âdays before each scheduled in-service training visit by research staff. During these in-service training visits, the research staff will read the TST results together with the clinic staff, thereby providing reinforcement of teaching, and quality control of initial TST readings.</p><p>In-service training visits will be conducted weekly for the first month and then reduced to twice a month for the next 2âmonths.

                <p>For each randomisation unit, the number of HHCs expected to initiate treatment per index TB patient was generated in a simulation exercise, using a Poisson distribution with a rate that depended on the effect of the intervention, the effect of time and a normally distributed random effect for each randomisation unit. We varied the potential effect of the intervention from 5, 10, 15, 30 contacts initiating treatment per 100 index TB patients. The variance of the random effect was set at 0.7, 1.4 and 2.8. These variances resulted in approximate ICCs (intraclass correlation coefficients) of 0.16â0.40. We generated 500 datasets for each distinct combination of data generation parameters (12 scenarios).</p>
                <p>Using this approach we estimated power as the number of generated datasets that resulted in a statistically significant value. As shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, we will have 73%â75%âpower to detect a statistically significant (alpha=0.05) effect of the intervention if the increase in the number of HHCs initiating LTBI treatment (between phases 1 and 2), is at least 10 per 100 index TB patients. However, we will have more than 96% power to detect a significant effect of the intervention, if it results in at least 15 more HHCs initiating treatment per 100 index TB patient.</p>

                  <title>Primary analysis</title>
                  <p>An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, using a Poisson regression approach. We will use a marginal Poisson regression model with identity link (see Breslow<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> for specification), estimated via generalised estimating equations, and using robust standard errors, to account for clustering at the level of the randomization unit. Because the number of randomization units is less than 40, we will use a correction for few clusters.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Using an identity link will allow us to describe the effect of the intervention in terms of a rate difference.</p>
                  <p>The dependent variable will be the number of HHCs who initiated treatment for LTBI per index TB patient. Two time points will be included â Phase 1: the 6âmonths before the programme strengthening begins, and Phase 2: during the last 6âmonths, after programme strengthening has been implemented. The model will include terms for the intervention, study phase, and the interaction between study phase and intervention. The primary focus of the analysis will be the interaction term, which is interpreted as the difference in the change from phase 1 to phase 2 in the number of HHCs starting LTBI treatment per index TB patient between the intervention and control arms (ie, a difference of differences).</p>
                  <p>When using the identity link, it is possible that the model predicts valuesÂ &lt;0. If our model predictions are not greater than 0 or in the case of convergence problems, we will consider (i) a Poisson regression model with fixed intercepts for each site<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> or (ii) using a log link and log(TBi) as the offset. Overdispersion will be investigated and accounted for if necessary.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p>
                  <p>In secondary analyses, we will adjust the model for level of economic development at the country level. We will also stratify findings by low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) and Canadian sites in order to adjust for potential between country differences such as treatment duration and estimate the effect of the intervention separately in each country. In additional analyses, using methods described above, we will compare the outcomes in phase 1 toÂ phase 2, separately in the intervention and control arms.</p>

                  <p>For the secondary objective, resource use related to the implementation of the ACT4 approach and the downstream increases in LTBI-related clinical care will be estimated. This will be essential to inform those considering implementation of a similar LTBI evaluation and strengthening package in other settings and the scale up of the approach. We will consider all resources related to the programme evaluation and strengthening over the full duration of the study. The perspective of the evaluation will be from the health system. Information on costs in the following categories will be based on: (1) <italic>material, services and supplies</italic> âcentral and site expenditures, as well as health facility budgets, (2) <italic>in-country research personnel</italic> âsite budgets, salary scales and TAM studies to estimate time spent on relevant activities, (3) <italic>Montreal Coordinating Centre personnel</italic>- time spent on various activities, and central research budgets; (4) <italic>in-country TB management personnel</italic> âÂ in-depth interviews to create a narrative of time spent on relevant activities, (5) <italic>health centre management personnel</italic> â based on a similar narrative and (6) <italic>health centre clinical personnel</italic> âÂ TAM studies and health facility salary scales. Salary scales for management and clinic staff will be used to estimate personnel costs based on their time. Additional costs related to LTBI clinical care will beÂ estimated using an ingredients based approach to calculate per visit costs at each step of the cascade, together with information on the number of contacts being seen at different cascade steps at each site.</p>
                  <p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the LTBI evaluation and strengthening package versus the status quo. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to examine the robustness of the findings. We will also consider the impact of varying key cost parameters such as salaries for HCW and TB management personnel (using reported ranges) and personnel time devoted to LTBI programme strengthening for different categories of staff.</p>

                    <p>The research question considered in this trial is oriented towards improving patient outcomes and experiences throughout the LTBI cascade or care. Patients were not specifically included in the study development and design however they are integral to its execution. The study is designed to incorporate information from patients with active TB, their contacts and parents of child contacts, by interviewing them in order to learn about their barriers and needs. This information is used to select solutions that are implemented in phase 2 of the study. Study results will be disseminated to participating clinics who may choose to share information with patients and study participants. The intervention was not assessed by patients themselves prior to initiation of the trial.</p>

                  <title>Ethics</title>
                  <p>Ethics approval was first obtained from the McGill University Health Centre ethical review board. The study began in each participating site after local ethics approval. Any protocol amendments should be circulated to sites once approved by the coordinating centres ERB. They must then be approved locally at each site.</p>
                  <p>For phase 1 of the study, individual informed consent will be obtained for the questionnaires and confidentiality will be ensured. For the cascade indicators and or study outcomes, consent is not required because data are aggregated and anonymously collected in each clinic. Likewise, for phase 2 informed consent will not be required for any individuals. Instead, public health administrators and TB control managersâ approval will be sought for use of aggregate health facility data.</p>

                  <title>Dissemination</title>
                  <p>During the study standardised tools will be developed. These tools will be made publicly available through sites such the Find TB Resources website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.findtbresources.cdc.gov">http://www.findtbresources.cdc.gov</ext-link>). Trial results will be disseminated within each country as the investigators in all countries have close links to the leadership of their national TB programmes. The Contact Management Registries and reporting procedures are designed for easy uptake by NTP programmes and staff. Study findings and novel methodological contributions will be detailed in scientific manuscripts for publication. Data generated from the study will be made publicly available by request from the coordinating centre, 1âyear after publication of the main results.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Many studies have considered the importance of contact investigation for HHCs<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and assessed methods to improve treatment completion for TB and LTBI,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> but none have focused on strengthening the <italic>entire</italic> cascade of LTBI care. This protocol describes a unique public health intervention that aims to strengthen an LTBI programme according to its specific needs. The approach is standardised yet can be integrated into any setting and any stage of programme strengthening. This type of public health approach has been used successfully in other settings. In Senegal and Mali, hospital staff were trained to conduct maternal mortality review, which in turn reduced maternal mortality.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In Nepal, the facilitation of womenâs group meetings was shown to improve birth outcomes.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In both studies, the intervention was a structured evaluation; the actual changes that improved outcomes were site-specific.</p>
              <p>Treatment initiation was selected as the trial primary end-point as the majority of loss in the LTBI cascade occurs before individuals begin treatment<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and improving treatment adherence has already been the focus of many research studies.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> Treatment initiation is an outcome that can be evaluated much more quickly than treatment completion which fits better with the approach used in the trial of ongoing adjustments in real-time as part of a cycle of evaluation.</p>
              <p>If the approach is found to be both successful and cost-effective, optimising the approach and ensuring that is sustainable will be essential. To assess its sustainability and refine some of the more complex tools used in the main study, we plan to provide the intervention to control sites after the study is complete. This add-on also minimises the ethical difficulties of withholding the interventions from one group â as eventually all groups will have the potential benefits of the trial.</p>
              <p>The launch of this study is timely as it coincides with calls from the WHO to expand LTBI programmes in LMIC countries.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> As part of our study we will tailor tools to make them harmonise with WHO policy. For example, the LTBI registry used will incorporate LTBI indicators adopted by the WHO. We believe the results of this study will help low and middle-income countries prepare for the major shift in TB prevention that lies ahead.</p>
