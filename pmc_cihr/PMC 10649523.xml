                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Inflammation is a key mediator in the development and progression of the atherosclerotic disease process as well as its resultant complications, like myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and cardiovascular (CV) death, and is emerging as a novel treatment target. Trials involving anti-inflammatory medications have demonstrated outcome benefit in patients with known CV disease. In this regard, colchicine appears to hold great promise. However, there are potential drawbacks to colchicine use, as some studies have identified an increased risk of infection, and a non-significant trend for increased all-cause mortality. Thus, a more thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism of action of colchicine is needed to enable a better patient selection for this novel CV therapy.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The primary objective of the Canadian Study of Arterial Inflammation in Patients with Diabetes and Recent Vascular Events, Evaluation of Colchicine Effectiveness (CADENCE) trial is to assess the effect of colchicine on vascular inflammation in the carotid arteries and ascending aorta measured with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or pre-diabetes who have experienced a recent vascular event (acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/MI, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke). Secondary objectives include determining colchicine’s effect on inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)). Additionally, we will assess if baseline inflammation imaging or biomarkers are associated with a treatment response to colchicine determined by imaging. Exploratory objectives will look at: (1) the difference in the inflammatory response to colchicine in patients with coronary events compared with patients with cerebral events; (2) the difference in the inflammatory response to colchicine in different vascular beds; (3) the relationship of FDG-PET imaging markers with serum biomarkers and (4) assessment of quality-of-life changes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and design</title>
                  <p>CADENCE is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to determine the effect of colchicine on arterial inflammation as assessed with imaging and circulatory biomarkers, specifically carotid arteries and aortic FDG uptake as well as hs-CRP and IL-6 among others. Patients with T2DM or pre-diabetes who have recently experienced a CV event (within 30–120 days after an ACS (ie, ST-elevation MI (STEMI) or non-STEMI)) or TIA/stroke with documented large vessel atherosclerotic disease will be randomised to treatment with either colchicine 0.6 mg oral daily or placebo. Participants will undergo baseline clinical evaluation including EQ5D assessment, blood work for inflammatory markers and FDG PET/CT scan of the ascending aorta and left and right carotid arteries. Patients will undergo treatment for 6 months and have repeat clinical evaluation including EQ5D assessment, blood work for inflammatory markers and FDG PET/CT scan at the conclusion of the study. The primary outcome will be the change in the maximum target to background ratio (TBR<sub>max</sub>) in the ascending aorta (or carotid arteries) from baseline to follow-up on FDG PET/CT imaging.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>Colchicine is an exciting potential new therapy for CV risk reduction. However, its use is associated with side effects and greater understanding of its underlying mechanism of action is needed. Importantly, the current study will determine whether its anti-inflammatory action is an indirect systemic effect, or a more local plaque action that decreases inflammation. The results will also help identify patients who will benefit most from such therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and its complications, like myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and cardiovascular (CV) death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Given its aetiologic role, inflammation is now emerging as an important treatment target for CV risk reduction.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> A number of trials have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapies may improve outcomes in patients with CV disease. The CANTOS Trial<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> demonstrated CV benefit in patients treated with canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin (IL) 1-beta. The intervention was more effective in patients who achieved a greater reduction in the inflammation biomarker high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP). However, two factors severely limit the use canakinumab to a large number of patients: its cost and the associated increased risk of sepsis. Indeed, canakinumab has been demonstrated to not be cost-effective for a CV risk-reduction indication.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus, the search for a cost-effective anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce CV events continues. Studies including the LoDoCo2 trial<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and COLCOT<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> have also demonstrated CV outcome benefit in patients with known atherosclerotic coronary disease who are treated with colchicine. Despite its proven efficacy, the mechanism whereby this drug reduces CV events remains unknown. The true anti-inflammatory properties of colchicine are also largely unknown, although they are believed to include inhibition of neutrophil function via an antitubulin effect, and inhibition of the NLRP<sub>3</sub> inflammasone.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for several inflammatory conditions including pericarditis,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> gout<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and familial Mediterranean fever.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, colchicine has several side effects, predominantly gastrointestinal upset, that limit its tolerability and reduce patients’ compliance. Additionally, recent CV trials showed a non-significant trend toward an increase in all-cause mortality with colchicine therapy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6 11</xref> Thus, further investigations into colchicine mechanisms of actions are warranted. Although the recent trials showed a reduction in CV events with colchicine, there was no correlation with baseline and follow-up serum markers of inflammation. Hence, it is possible that colchicine may be acting to reduce inflammation within the atherosclerotic plaque, rather than at a systemic level.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of Canadian Study of Arterial Inflammation in Patients with Diabetes and Recent Vascular Events, Evaluation of Colchicine Effectiveness (CADENCE) is to investigate the biological effect of the medication colchicine, compared with placebo, on the inflammatory activity of atherosclerotic plaque (measured by <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT at baseline and 6 months) in the carotid arteries and ascending aorta in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or pre-diabetes and recent vascular events (acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/MI, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke). Specifically, we will look at whether colchicine acts in a systemic anti-inflammatory fashion or whether its mechanism of action is more of a local effect at the plaque level. FDG PET/CT has demonstrated to be an efficient and practical proxy method to assess inflammation in the aorta.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Prior studies have demonstrated that therapies that reduce aortic FDG uptake also predict clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref></p>
              <p>The secondary objectives of this study are to explore (a) whether baseline inflammation imaging (FDG PET/CT) and/or inflammatory biomarker (hs-CRP and IL-6) levels can identify which patients are most likely to have a positive response to colchicine, as indicated by the reduction in FDG uptake over a period of 6 months and (b) the correlation between response to colchicine as measured by reduction of inflammation as proxied by imaging with FDG PET/CT and hs-CRP at baseline and during a 6-month follow-up.</p>
              <p>Our exploratory objectives are to investigate (a) if there are local differences (ie, in the carotid arteries vs aorta, respectively) in the anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine therapy in patients who have suffered recent coronary events (ACS/MI) compared with those with recent cerebrovascular events (TIA, stroke); (b) if other systemic inflammatory biomarkers (eg, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, monocyte chemoattractive protein (MCP)-1, others) predict a response to therapy; (c) the relationship of the inflammatory response as proxied by imaging with FDG PET/CT to: (1) systemic inflammation biomarkers; (2) monocyte activation; (d) the treatment effect of colchicine on clinical outcomes such as major adverse CV events and all-cause mortality and (e) the effect of colchicine on patient quality of life measures.</p>

                    <p>On arrival an IV will be inserted in the arm. FDG (2–3 MBq/kg) will be injected intravenously. After the FDG injection patients will have a 2–3 hour wait period. During the first hour, the patient will be asked to sit quietly followed by a 1–2 hour wait period when the patient can move about, talk and read. The waiting period will allow the uptake of FDG by normal tissues and/or areas of inflammation, while there is a decrease in the remainder of the background activity (ie, blood pool) creating an ideal target-to-background ratio.</p>
                    <p>After scout imaging to check proper positioning, a low-dose CT scan will be done for attenuation correction (AC) of the PET data. A respiratory-gated PET scan will be acquired in 3D mode over three bed positions to span the common and internal carotid arteries and the thoracic ascending aorta. High-resolution (3–5 mm) images of FDG uptake (Bq/mL) will be reconstructed using iterative statistical reconstruction with no post-filtering. The prep at baseline will be replicated at follow-up including the time of scan whenever possible.</p>

For the aorta, this begins 1 cm above the aortic valve plane and continues to the base of the aortic arch. For the carotid arteries, it starts 2 cm below the bifurcation up to 2 cm above it in the internal carotid artery.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Maximum FDG uptake (Bq/mL) is then measured and will be normalised to the injected activity and body-weight in order to determine the standardised uptake value (SUV, g/mL).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The target-to-blood ratio (TBR) is calculated by taking the SUVs of the artery wall, and normalising the values to the background venous activity (superior vena cava or internal jugular for aorta or carotid arteries, respectively).

                <p>There are no previously published studies evaluating FDG over time in patients with T2DM or pre-diabetes who have suffered recent CV events (our study population) on which to base a definitive sample size calculation. We evaluated the ascending aorta as a non-culprit region in patients from our prior study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> with diabetes and recent events where the aorta was in the field of view (n=6): TBR<sub>max</sub>=3.38±0.60.

                <p>Based on the literature and feedback from experts, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in TBR<sub>max</sub> reduction is 10%–15%. This is feasible since FDG differences between treatments in prior studies was also 10%–14%.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Taking a conservative approach based on our TBR<sub>max</sub> values in our patients with T2DM with recent events, for a 10% reduction compared with placebo with a power of 80%, alpha 0.05, we will need 50 patients per group. Considering 10% withdrawal, and 2% of patients who complete baseline measures but do not start study drug, 115 patients will be recruited (12/115 (10.4%) withdrawal and 3/115 (2.6%) not starting drug), both similar to the LoDoCo trial.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Prior studies have included 21–34 patients/group.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21 37 38</xref> Thus, our sample size is expected to enable us to address our hypothesis.</p>

Descriptive statistics (proportions, means, medians, SD, IQR) will provide summaries of study characteristics and insight into their distributional properties to determine if underlying assumptions of the planned analysis are satisfied. Additionally, we will create diagnostic plots and both graphically, as well as numerically, check to ensure that the assumptions of our regression model are satisfied. Our data will be analysed with an intention-to-treat analysis. Additionally, a per protocol analysis will be conducted as a key secondary analysis. No interim analyses are planned.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome (change in FDG TBR) will be compared between the colchicine and placebo arms within a multiple regression model that includes type of vascular event (cardiac or cerebral) as a covariate.</p>
                <p>To evaluate whether inflammation imaging or biomarker levels predict the inflammation response measured as the change in TBR<sub>max</sub> on FDG PET/CT (as a secondary objective), we will conduct a regression analysis with baseline vascular TBR<sub>max</sub>, baseline vascular SUV and inflammatory biomarkers included as covariates. The regression coefficient will be tested using the Wald test and 95% CI of the coefficient will be calculated. A Pearson correlation analysis to evaluate the association of the inflammatory response, as proxied on FDG PET/CT, to the change in hs-CRP levels from baseline to 6 months after treatment with colchicine will be conducted.</p>
                <p>Several sources of bias and confounding exist within the trial. As a sensitivity analysis, for assessing the robustness of the primary analysis, if clinically significant differences between arms in pertinent baseline prognostic variables (eg, hypertension, HbA1C, diabetes vs pre-diabetes) are identified, multiple regression analysis will be conducted to compare FDG TBR between arms adjusting for these variables. As an exploratory analysis, we will look for interactions between treatment assignment, age, sex, vascular bed (carotid arteries vs aorta), time from CV event, type of vascular event (coronary (ACS/MI) vs cerebrovascular events (TIA, stroke)) and the medication classes of sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists as covariates within the model both to assess for meaningful interactions of these variables with the primary outcome, but also to ensure the results remain stable after adjustment and ensure our results remain stable after adjustment for these potential confounders. Similar regression analysis strategies will be considered if other biomarkers are also associated with an imaging response to colchicine. We will assess the relationship between the inflammatory response to colchicine on FDG/PET imaging with MACE by conducting a logistic regression analysis with MACE as the outcome variable and the change in vascular TBR<sub>max</sub> as a covariate. We will also explore patient-centred quality of life outcomes between colchicine and placebo groups with Student’s t-tests. Any missing data will be considered missing at random.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Vascular inflammation is an important contributor to the progression of atherosclerosis and its resultant vascular sequelae, like MI, stroke and CV death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 40 41</xref> An increasing evidence base has demonstrated that it is a novel therapeutic target for CV risk reduction. Colchicine has emerged as a novel anti-inflammatory agent for CV risk reduction. However, concerns have recently been raised regarding the adverse side effects of colchicine beyond its known gastrointestinal side effects, including a non-significant increase in the rate of infections and all-cause mortality. Thus, further research regarding the underlying mode of action will hopefully elucidate the role of colchicine and which patients may be best suited to receive this anti-inflammatory agent. Hence, our goal is to help clarify the underlying mechanism of action of colchicine, using a proxy of inflammation such as FDG-PET imaging as well as levels of circulating biomarkers, to assess local vascular anti-inflammatory vs systemic anti-inflammatory activity.</p>
              <p>Our study design has several strengths. First, we will perform the study in a methodologically rigorous fashion by using a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design to answer our research question. Second, we will use advanced CV imaging methods, FDG-PET imaging, to investigate the underlying mechanism of action of colchicine. Trial results looking at the pharmacological impact on arterial inflammation as proxied by imaging with FDG PET/CT have mirrored the results of clinical CV outcome trials.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Therefore, FDG PET/CT inflammation imaging represents a practical method to define the mechanistic targets of a medication’s effect in smaller patient cohorts over a short time period.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> It may also be a useful tool to assist in identifying higher risk patients to improve patient selection for novel therapies. Third, as an exploratory outcome, we will look at the effect of colchicine therapy on quality-of-life outcomes. Finally, this is one of the first studies to use advanced imaging techniques to evaluate the underlying mechanism of action of colchicine for CV indications.</p>
              <p>It is noteworthy that pharmaceutical agents which have shown outcome benefits have demonstrated reductions in inflammation measured by FDG PET including statins, pioglitazone and canakinumab, whereas as drugs which have not shown to reduce CV events have not shown such local anti-inflammatory effects. We anticipate in this high-risk group of patients in CADENCE, inflammation reduction will also be demonstrated. An added benefit of CADENCE and other studies is that they will support the utilisation of inflammation vascular imaging such as FDG PET to enable better selection of patients who benefit from inflammation targeted therapies. Further studies would be needed to support this concept.</p>
              <p>Our study also has important limitations. First, as this is a mechanistic study, it is underpowered to evaluate for meaningful differences in clinical endpoints, and will be underpowered to correlate imaging and clinical endpoints. This may limit the clinical validity of our results. However, evaluation of pharmacological impact on arterial inflammation as proxied by imaging with FDG PET/CT have mirrored the results of clinical CV outcome trials in the past.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21 37</xref> Thus, FDG indices of vascular inflammation serve as a good surrogate marker for important clinical endpoints, without necessitating the large size and scale of a trial looking at clinical endpoints. Second, our study recruits patients with both cardiac and neurologic vascular events; thus, there is the potential that any overall effect seen is confounded or mediated by the vascular bed treated (neurologic vs cardiac). To address this, as mentioned, we will perform interaction t-tests to compare the overall results of our regression analysis in the subgroup of patients with recent coronary (ACS/MI) vs cerebral vascular events (TIA, stroke). Additionally, interaction t-tests will be conducted to evaluate differences in the responses of each of the vascular beds separately (carotid vs aorta).</p>
              <p>With a large portion of the population suffering from CV disease, discovering novel methods of treatment is of high clinical value. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as colchicine may fill this role, however for widespread adoption a thorough understanding of their underlying mechanism of action is needed. Furthermore, with an increasing recognition that many of these therapies, including colchicine, carry some increased non-CV risk, targeting higher-risk populations may tip the risk-benefit scale in favour of treatment with these agents. The results obtained from this study will provide essential information with respect to the underlying mechanism of action as well as clinical benefit of colchicine therapy in patients with high CV risk. We believe our findings will bridge an important knowledge gap in this area and will spark new research in cardiac imaging and anti-inflammatory therapies for CV disease.</p>

The results of this randomised control study will contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of action of colchicine by measuring the impact on plaque size, biomarkers and MACE outcomes.
