                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), a problem common in newborns exposed to substances in-utero, is an emerging health concern. In traditional models of care, infants with NAS are routinely separated from their mothers and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with long, expensive length of stay (LOS). Research shows a <italic>rooming-in approach</italic> (keeping mothers and infants together in hospital) with referral support is a safe and effective model of care in managing NAS. The model’s key components are facilitating 24-h care by mothers on post-partum or pediatric units with support for breastfeeding, transition home, and access to Opioid Dependency Programs (ODP). This study will implement the rooming-in approach at eight hospitals across one Canadian Province; support practice and culture shift; identify and test the essential elements for effective implementation; and assess the implementation’s impact/outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial will be used to evaluate the implementation of an evidence-based rooming-in approach in the postpartum period for infants born to mothers who report opioid use during pregnancy. Baseline data will be collected and compared to post-implementation data. Six-month assessment of maternal and child health and an economic evaluation of cost savings will be conducted. Additionally, barriers and facilitators of the rooming-in model of care within the unique context of each site and across sites will be explored pre-, during, and post-implementation using theory-informed surveys, interviews, and focus groups with care teams and parents. A formative evaluation will examine the complex contextual factors and conditions that influence readiness and sustainability and inform the design of tailored interventions to facilitate capacity building for effective implementation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary expected outcome is reduced NICU LOS. Secondary expected outcomes include decreased rates of pharmacological management of NAS and child apprehension, increased maternal ODP participation, and improved 6-month outcomes for mothers and infants. Moreover, the NASCENT program will generate the detailed, multi-site evidence needed to accelerate the uptake, scale, and spread of this evidence-based intervention throughout Alberta, leading to more appropriate and effective care and use of healthcare resources.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)</title>
                <p id="Par33">Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), a group of symptoms that occur in newborns exposed to substances (<italic>i.e.</italic>, opioids) in utero, is an emerging health problem rising with the opioid crisis in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More recently, the term Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) has been coined to specifically describe opioid withdrawal in newborns. Given the challenges with polysubstance use or exposure in this study population the term NAS is used in this protocol.</p>
                <p id="Par34">The challenge of managing NAS is well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It primarily affects the central and autonomic nervous systems and gastrointestinal tract of the newborn and is commonly seen in the first 24–48 h after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Babies with NAS may be very difficult to care for. In traditional models of care, infants diagnosed with NAS are routinely separated from their mothers and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and often receive pharmacological therapy. The sequelae of NAS include costly and prolonged NICU admission, need for pharmacological management of NAS symptoms, negative impact on mother-infant bonding, decreased rates of breastfeeding, increased rates of child apprehension by child protective services, negative impact on maternal mental health, and psychological distress for families and care-providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, there are missed opportunities to engage mothers in Opioid Dependency Programs (ODP) or Virtual Opioid Dependency Programs (VODP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">The problem is a priority because of increasing prenatal opioid use and NAS in North America and in Alberta, Canada where this study is located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The human, societal, and economic impacts will continue to worsen if care practices remain unchanged. Pregnant women are a unique population. Societal norms task mothers with risk avoidance as a moral requirement, including the assumption that mothers will abstain from substance use during pregnancy; however, this cannot be enforced legally and also raises complex ethical questions about power and control of women’s bodies. These social norms contribute to social stigma, legal, and health responsibilities, which may lead pregnant women who use substances to hide their status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Substance use in pregnancy and resultant NAS is seen in all socio-economic strata and all racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, the consequences of that use, including legal, medical, and social, may be different due to discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are also significant challenges and inequities related to which mothers are screened for opioid use during pregnancy, and hence when there may be involvement by Children’s Services, and potentially child apprehension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">Furthermore, the economic impact of NAS is substantial. In the US in 2017 there were approximately 7.3 infants with NAS per 1,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Infants receiving NAS pharmacological management had mean hospital charges of $93,400 (USD) and a mean length of stay (LOS) of 23 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, out of hospital and non-healthcare related costs of NAS are substantial. In particular, rates of child apprehension are high and there is often ongoing involvement with Children’s Services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While data are not available for Alberta there are published data available for Manitoba (Canada) related to the cost of a child being in care. In the year 2016/2017 the Manitoba annual child welfare budget was $514 million or $46,800 per child in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">There are tangible and intangible societal and economic benefits in maintaining and promoting intact mother-infant dyads. Child development and long-term mental and physical health outcomes are critically dependent on early establishment of a nurturing relationship between mothers and their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This in turn contributes to healthier families, less dependence on social services, and improved future economic contributions to society.</p>
                <p id="Par38">The problem of NAS in Alberta affects infants, parents, families, and health care team members, as well as the overall health system and society in general. Directly or indirectly, this problem has an impact on all Albertans. In the face of the ongoing opioid crisis, the lack of widespread adoption of evidence-based NAS care is a gap in health services that can be filled by a rooming-in model of care.</p>

                <title>The rooming-in model of care</title>
                <p id="Par39"><italic>Rooming-in</italic> is an evidence-informed model of care in managing NAS that is safe and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] The focus is on keeping mothers and infants together throughout their hospital stay. With the rooming-in model of care, infants are cared for by their mothers in a supportive post-partum environment, avoiding the need for a long and expensive NICU admission. Mothers are provided with breastfeeding support; a standardized assessment of infant NAS symptoms by health care team members <italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC)</italic>(a tool designed to evaluate infants ability to manage withdrawal symptoms); with non-pharmacologic interventions, such as skin-to-skin care, and low stimulation environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; ongoing social work support; an opportunity for maternal participation in an ODP; and supported transition home upon discharge in collaboration with community agencies. In addition, those involved in the provision of care to mothers and their infants with NAS receive education and support to address the stigma of drug use and its impact when caring for mothers with substance use disorder focusing on patient-centered and trauma-informed care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par40">Another instrumental aspect of the rooming-in model’s long-term success is the continuum of care provided pre- and post-delivery, sometimes referred to as ‘<italic>wraparound programs</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Cross-sectoral collaborations that form connections between those involved with rooming-in in hospital settings and community support organizations/services is crucial to the continuum of care for mothers pre- and post-delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">Data from existing programs in Canada and the US confirm that mothers can successfully provide care in hospital with support from staff prior to transitioning home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Programs introduced to address NAS management challenges, like the Managing Abstinence in Newborns (MAiN) program, include family-centred care, methadone treatment, and rooming-in with mothers, found mean costs of $10,946.96 versus $44,544.17 (2014 USD) for infants who received routine NICU care. The MAiN rooming-in program was safe, effective, and reduced costs by more than 50% when using non-critical care beds compared with NICU beds as the main cost driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Multiple studies corroborate these findings, identifying that nonpharmacological strategies such as rooming-in for NAS management compared to NICU care were associated with a shorter hospital LOS and a decreased need for pharmacological treatment, thereby lowering hospitalization costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par42">Supportive approaches for NAS management are practiced successfully in a few Canadian centres with the longest running example being the Families in Recovery (FIR) Program at BC Women’s Hospital in British Columbia (Canada) since 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The program reported a significant decrease in need for pharmacological intervention for the baby (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.20–0.78), shorter newborn LOS (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.25- 0.65), and higher rates of being discharged home in the care of their mothers (RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.43–3.98) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A study performed in Ontario, Canada estimated costs for a group of mothers and babies with NAS with no intervention to be three-fold higher than for those that received non-pharmacological intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">Specifically, the application of the ESC model of care decreased LOS and morphine doses for babies and increased breastfeeding rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A meta-analysis identified that breastfeeding is associated with reduced initiation and duration of pharmacological interventions and LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In another small subset of studies, rooming-in also demonstrated increased breastfeeding rates and higher rates of discharge home into familial custody and was not associated with in-hospital adverse events or readmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par44">Despite the successes seen with rooming-in programs there are still significant social barriers to providing care for families impacted by NAS. Nurses’ descriptions of their interactions when caring for women with perinatal substance use disorders and their infants have been described as problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There is trepidation, discomfort, and judgement related to providing care to infants and families who require support for NAS. Care-providers experienced moral distress related to uncertainty and discomfort with addictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nurses also described biases, stigma, negative attitudes, and vulnerabilities of both mothers and staff as challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Others identified negative feelings towards patients with opioid use disorder and preferential concern for the baby over the mother’s wellbeing, recognizing a need for education and training to reduce stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. At the same time, opioid dependent women in the prenatal and postpartum period describe feeling internal stigma, shame, and guilt while also experiencing external stigma and ‘punitive like’ actions by staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par45">Contextual barriers of providing non-pharmacologic care for NAS as identified by nurses included lack of education and resources available to staff and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, inter-, and intra-disciplinary coordination, flexibility in nurse staffing models, and unit architecture and layout were identified as possible facilitators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Providing training and education on patient centered- and trauma-informed care may influence attitudes and decrease stigma and judgment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Evaluation of a comprehensive training program pilot identified an increase in knowledge and self-efficacy to provide care for substance using pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>

                <title>NASCENT</title>
                <p id="Par46">The Alberta Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Mother-Baby Care ImprovEmeNT (NASCENT) stepped wedge cluster randomized study was funded to test a solution for NAS care by implementing the rooming-in model of care across the province of Alberta, Canada. In Canada in 2016/17 approximately 0.51% of all infants were diagnosed with NAS with an average LOS in the NICU of 15 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Increasing NAS rates in Alberta are consistent with Canada; preliminary data for 2011–2019 shows that the number of Alberta infants diagnosed with NAS increased from 1.52 cases per 1,000 live births in 2011/12 to 4.35 cases per 1,000 live births in 2018/2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par47">NASCENT is based upon the Maternal Medication Use and Neonatal Abstinence (MMUNA) model of care provided at the Grey Nuns Community Hospital in Edmonton (GNCH), Alberta since 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The MMUNA rooming-in program showed striking results in comparison to traditional models of NAS care including decreased NICU LOS (10.33 days to 0.82 days, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); decreased need for morphine treatment (67% to 12%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005); increased breastfeeding rates at discharge (22% to 77%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01); and increased discharge of babies in the care of their mothers (66% to 100%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). The successful pilot has led to the continuation of prenatal and postnatal wraparound support, including rooming-in, as a sustainable expected standard of care for pregnant women with opioid-related substance use delivering at the GNCH. To date, 140 mother-infant dyads have participated in this rooming-in approach with continued success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">NASCENT is also informed by the Comprehensive Accessible care for Infants with Neonatal abstinence (CAIN) study. Through focus groups and individual interviews with care-providers in hospital and community settings, CAIN explored their experiences caring for infants with NAS. The overarching theme identified was ‘<italic>Hope</italic>’. Fostering ‘<italic>Hope’</italic> was key for families and care-providers working with mother-infant dyads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">Despite the evidence and experience gained, the practice of the rooming-in approach is limited in Alberta. It has been recognized that introducing guidelines and models of care without a detailed and adaptive implementation strategy does not lead to changes in care or improved outcomes; intervention and purposeful implementation are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Implementation of a rooming-in model requires readiness development of several components, including care teams, education and training, partnerships, and referral and communication pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. NASCENT is specifically designed to address the gap in adoption of evidence-based NAS care. The rooming-in model of care will be introduced at 8 acute care hospital sites. The intent is to support teams in developing their NAS rooming-in model of care. Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) Framework, and the Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], targeted interventions will include identifying site barriers, facilitators, and opportunities for growth, as well as capacity building and facilitation of tailored site operationalization. NASCENT will provide funds to facilitate staff education and training; support the development of provincial standardized care components; and help connect sites for mutual support and as a community of practice. A Provincial Clinical Practice Lead, funded by NASCENT, will develop and coordinate educational programming, onsite and virtual training prior to initiation, roll out of site-specific clinical protocols, virtual mentorship for site champions, care teams and individuals following implementation, and feedback to all sites.</p>
                <p id="Par50">NASCENT will support the hiring of site champions at each of the participating sites who will be instrumental to the implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Trained by the study team, they will be the point of contact between the NASCENT research team and the site implementation team. The site champions will collect data; facilitate the work of the site implementation team by introducing the rooming-in model of care through staff education, provide training, and mentorship; and coordinate feedback/evaluation sessions and surveys. Additionally, they will work closely with community organizations to identify and recruit participants as well as help facilitate transitions after discharge from the hospital. They will also liaise with other site champions to share challenges and successes.</p>
                <p id="Par51">In partnership with each unit, the NASCENT research team will identify site-specific facilitators and barriers, as well as contextual influences within and across sites. The team will establish relationships and work with site implementation teams within their unique context to identify opportunities for growth, develop tailored implementation strategies targeting barriers to implementing the intervention, and leveraging existing facilitators to support practice change.</p>
                <p id="Par52">NASCENT is the first study of its kind to implement the evidence-based rooming-in model of care for mothers and babies with NAS in a large scale, single-payer health system. The ultimate goal is that the rooming-in approach for babies with NAS will become the new normal in the province. The intervention will bring about provider-, unit-, and community-level behaviour practice, and culture change across a whole jurisdiction. Formative evaluation of the implementation process will identify essential elements that are required to support effective collaboration and implementation and will guide uptake and scale of the rooming-in intervention. Implementation of the NASCENT rooming-in model of care will decrease NICU LOS and related costs, improve the quality of care, as well as the social and health outcomes for mothers and babies.</p>

                <title>The setting</title>
                <p id="Par61">Addictions and NAS have been identified as a priority health system challenge by the leadership of maternity and post-partum care units across the province of Alberta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Based on approximately 56,000 live births in 2018 there are an estimated 244 affected newborns per year in Alberta. Approximately 75% of infants with NAS were admitted to the NICU with a mean NICU LOS of 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The mean number of infants affected and the mean NICU LOS has risen over the last 10 years in Alberta. Given this rate of increase of NAS cases it is likely that approximately 300 infants will be diagnosed with NAS yearly by 2023. In some Alberta Zones, 90–100% of infants with NAS are admitted to the NICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Maternal opioid use and subsequent NAS is not specific to large urban areas, nor is it specific to women who have been structurally marginalized, and rates of NAS per live birth are consistent across all zones and regions in Alberta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. NAS is common, can occur throughout all social strata, and with current care models frequently results in NICU admission, with a costly 2- to 3-week length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This equates to 2,500 to 3,800 NICU days per year in Alberta. Even though Alberta has a single-payer health system, the sites participating in NASCENT each operate in a unique context [<italic>i.e.</italic>, health services model, population served (<italic>e.g.</italic>, some sites serve a larger number of Indigenous women) and availability of community services for opioid dependent women pre- and post-delivery]. Additionally, a new NAS care guideline was developed for Alberta in 2019 and revised in 2022 that includes guidance on rooming-in to support the shift in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par62">A Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (SW-cRCT) will be conducted with 8 participating sites in Alberta over the course of the study. The SW-cRCT is ideally suited to interventions that require implementation by multiple sites with impact on workflow and the structure of care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This design includes randomized sequential roll out of the intervention to all sites over time. Baseline data acts as the pre-intervention control comparisons and secular trends can be accounted for due to concurrent control groups for most periods. The analysis can also assess whether the impact of the intervention changes over time.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">We intend to introduce NASCENT at a new hospital every 3 months following a minimum of 6 months of initial baseline data collection as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Hospitals will implement the intervention following a computer-generated stratified random allocation sequence created by the independent study statistician. Stratification based on ‘readiness’ will be used to allow the two sites with existing rooming-in programs and experience to implement early in the study to inform care at sites implementing subsequently.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The NASCENT stepped wedge cluster design.

                  <p id="Par80">The mean NICU LOS over the last 10 years has consistently been 15 days (reported above) so it was selected as a conservative counterfactual and standard deviation (SD) was set at 3 days based on local and national data to provide adequate power to detect small differences in LOS. Intra-cluster correlation (ICC) was conservatively estimated at 0.1. With 8 sites, 8 initiation steps, and 1 site initiated per step (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) over the course of 3 years, a mean LOS of 15 days (SD 3 days), and an ICC of 0.1, the study will have at least 80% power with a two-sided 5% significance level to detect a 19% difference (2.75 days) in NICU LOS.</p>
                  <p id="Par81">There were 4.35 cases per 1,000 live births in 2018/2019 and approximately 56,000 livebirths in Alberta in 2018, thus an estimated 244 affected newborns are born per year. Given the rate of rise of NAS cases over the last decade it is likely that approximately 300 infants will be diagnosed with NAS yearly by 2023. Given that 75% of infants with NAS are currently admitted to NICU in Alberta, this corresponds to 225 patients being admitted to NICU by 2023.</p>

Based on the 70% maternal participation rate of the MMUNA program it is estimated that approximately 20–30 mother-infant dyads would participate in a rooming-in model of care in Year 1, 90 in Year 2, and an increase to 120 dyads/year by the end of year 3, for a total of 240 expected participating dyads during the NASCENT study. 75% of participating dyads in the rooming-in model of care are expected to take part in the research (<italic>i.e</italic>., secondary health outcomes and 6 months follow up) considering the population involved.</p>

                  <p id="Par84">Data extracted for the economic analysis will be used to calculate the cost avoidance related to shifting newborn care from the NICU to post-partum/pediatric units. We will compare both costs and outcomes of the NASCENT intervention with the baseline standard of care, calculating the decrease in overall NICU bed use and LOS. A significant proportion of the expected cost savings arising from this intervention do not relate to direct health system resources but include broader societal costs related to involvement with Children’s Services and decreased rates of child apprehension. These societal cost-savings will be determined using data collected from the Canadian Institute for Health Information and administrative databases. The 6 months post-discharge mother-infant dyad follow up will help ascertain short-term mother and infant health and infant developmental outcomes and will inform our economic analysis. It is also recognized that children and adolescents in care have poorer educational outcomes, higher hospitalization rates, and greater risk of attempting or committing suicide than those not in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. These longer-term outcomes are outside the scope of NASCENT, but it is anticipated that maintaining and supporting the mother-infant dyad will have long-reaching positive impacts.

                <title>Implementation strategies</title>
                <p id="Par94">The NASCENT investigative team will establish and work with site implementation teams to jointly develop tailored implementation strategies. This joint effort will include the identification of appropriate evidence- and local experience-based adaptations to the core NAS-interventions. Existing facilitators which are known to be effective in changing practice will also be leveraged, such as recent national and provincial guidelines. We will apply targeted implementation strategies informed by COM-B behaviour change interventions and policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study compilation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The strategies used will focus on building individual and team capacity through behaviour change (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) to provide the rooming-in model of care effectively. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies and refine them as needed. Data collection, strategies, and activities for each implementation phase are described in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The NASCENT study is designed to establish the ‘new normal’ standard of care for infants with NAS and their mothers. Its objective is to make the education elements become part of routine training and orientation for care providers.</p>

                <title>Integrated knowledge translation</title>
                <p id="Par95">NASCENT is a collaboration between researchers, clinicians, the health system, and community partners. The team includes a research and leadership core group, operational leadership, and other relevant collaborators, including women with lived experience. Several committees will be established including Leadership, Implementation Science Advisory, Site Implementation Teams, Parent Advisory Board, and a committee composed of stakeholders involved in the care for women and babies outside of the hospital setting. All partners will be engaged throughout the implementation study as part of an Integrated Knowledge Translation (IKT) approach which promotes partnerships between knowledge-users and researchers in health-oriented research to help close the “know-do” gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par96">A crucial component to the success of this implementation study is the connections/ relationships built between the hospital sites and community organizations to ensure continuum of care for mother-infant dyads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, support for building these relationships and continuous engagement throughout the implementation process will be instrumental.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Partnerships are crucial for the continuum of care</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2023_9440_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par97">To facilitate user and stakeholder engagement, NASCENT will support identifying and connecting with relevant stakeholders for each site; assist in forming relationships with province-wide services, programs and leaders, and practitioners; conduct preliminary meetings with relevant stakeholders to inform the upcoming program; and form spaces for collaboration and continuum of care (<italic>i.e.</italic>, facilitating referral pathways to hospitals that provide rooming-in care and safe transitions to the community after discharge). Moreover, stakeholders will be involved in the development of educational material to promote culturally safe, trauma-informed patient-centered care and the design of evaluation questions, analysis, and interventions.</p>
                <p id="Par98">With each step (3-month period) in the trial, data will be collected as outlined above. These data will be shared with stakeholders in feedback sessions. Specifically, information related to baseline and current rates of admission for NAS, number of participants, participation rates, LOS, and consistency of care implemented during the intervention will be fed back to sites and shared with funders. Process data related to expected implementation timeline and completion of staff training will also be collected and shared. Prospective data collection and frequent analysis (every 3 months) for each site and for the study’s overall including changes to the original plans will allow the NASCENT team to closely monitor if outcome measures are aligning with the improvement forecast. This will allow the team to regularly report actual performance metrics back to partners and funders. The study leadership team, clinicaltrials.gov, REBs, and funders will be notified of any protocol modifications. Adverse events and other unintended events potentially related to the rooming in care will be reviewed by the site implementation team and the study leadership team and reported to relevant REBs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par99">The NASCENT study will use an evidence-based approach to implement rooming-in care for babies with NAS in all five health zones in the province of Alberta, directly addressing a priority health system challenge identified by maternal-newborn leadership across the province. The model for the NASCENT study and its associated interventions has already been tested in two sites in Alberta. NASCENT will promote the shift from traditional NAS care to a rooming-in model providing a continuum of care that supports mothers and their babies, creating a critical contact point between health services and social systems to provide mothers, who in many cases have experienced structural marginalization, with an opportunity to make life changes that will support a long-term mother and infant relationship. Moreover, NASCENT will generate the detailed, multi-site evidence needed to accelerate the scale and spread of this evidence-based intervention throughout Alberta, leading to more appropriate and effective use of healthcare resources. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of safe supportive care for mothers caring for their infants using healthcare resources more effectively and leading to more appropriate and equitable care. The NASCENT logic model portrays the input, activities and the expected outputs and outcomes that pertain to the intervention and implementation objectives (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par101">The scholarly benefits of this study will be significant. Canadian studies have identified the significant benefits of rooming-in of NAS babies with their mothers: reduced LOS, reduced pharmacological management, increased breastfeeding rates, increased acceptance and use of support services, and decreased rate of child apprehension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The NASCENT study will evaluate all these outcomes and more on a larger scale and provide the evidence required to scale the rooming-in model of care. The NASCENT study will also empirically identify and develop implementation guidelines for NAS rooming-in including overarching facilitators and barriers on individual team and system levels, guides to identify site specific readiness indicators, needs assessment for implementation, and expected challenges and associated strategies to overcome. This study is an opportunity to collect and present a significant amount of scholarly data to the implementation, clinical science, social science, and medical communities.</p>
