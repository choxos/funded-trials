              <abstract>
                <p>The neural plasticity of spinal reflexes after two contrasting forms of walking training was determined in individuals with chronic, motor-incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Endurance Training involved treadmill walking for as long as possible, and Precision Training involved walking precisely over obstacles and onto targets overground. Twenty participants started either Endurance or Precision Training for 2 months and then crossed over after a 2-month rest period to the other form of training for 2 months. Measures were taken before and after each phase of training and rest. The cutaneomuscular reflex (CMR) during walking was evoked in the soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior muscles by stimulating the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle. Clonus was estimated from the EMG power in the SOL during unperturbed walking. The inhibitory component of the SOL CMR was enhanced after Endurance but not Precision Training. Clonus did not change after either form of training. Participants with lower reflex excitability tended to be better walkers (i.e., faster walking speeds) prior to training, and the reduction in clonus was significantly correlated with the improvement in walking speed and distance. Thus, reflex excitability responded in a training-specific way, with the reduction in reflex excitability related to improvements in walking function.

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Intensive motor training induces task-specific changes in the excitability of spinal reflexes in people without injuries to the central nervous system [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, resistance training of the plantarflexor muscles over many weeks increases the excitability of the soleus (SOL) Hoffmann (H) reflex [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas balance training on unstable surfaces for a few weeks does the opposite [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, professional athletes who spend years training intensively in their sport show sport-specific reflex excitability. For example, ballet dancers and athletes training in explosive leg sports (e.g., sprinting) show small H-reflexes and tendon reflexes in the SOL [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas athletes training in endurance sports, such as middle and long distance running, show large H-reflexes [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, motor training alters reflexes in a task-specific way.</p>
              <p>Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) can exhibit abnormally exaggerated reflex excitability, for example, in the tendon or H-reflex of the soleus (SOL) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and in the cutaneous or cutaneomuscular reflex elicited by stimulation of peripheral nerves at the ankle [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Whether this increased reflex excitability is useful for, or detrimental to, functional movements remains uncertain [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some suggest that exaggerated reflex excitability might be useful because it can augment hand grip, aid movements such as transfers, and help maintain muscle mass and strength [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although this is largely based on expert opinion [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>As with uninjured individuals, intensive motor training after SCI, such as walking on a treadmill, is associated with changes in spinal reflexes such as reduced clonus [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], stretch reflex amplitude [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and flexor reflex excitability [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It remains to be determined if these individuals also show training-specific spinal plasticity in response to different forms of exercises.</p>
              <p>We studied two forms of walking training in people with incomplete SCI, one emphasizing walking for as long and as fast as possible on a treadmill, Endurance Training, and the other emphasizing stepping over obstacles and precisely onto targets overground, Precision Training. We previously reported functional improvements in both walking endurance and skill [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and strengthening of the corticospinal pathways to the tibialis anterior (TA) motoneurons [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] after both forms of training.</p>
              <p>Here, we report the neural plasticity induced in spinal circuits from cutaneomuscular afferents in the foot to the SOL motoneurons and their antagonist, the TA, in the same individuals but during the functional task of walking. We examined two reflexes during treadmill walking: the cutaneomuscular reflex (CMR), induced by stimulating the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and clonus, induced by the natural recurrent activation of monosynaptic Ia inputs by the walking [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Portions of this data have been presented in abstract form [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Participants trained to step over obstacles without touching them and onto circular targets by obscuring the whole target with the foot, along a 15âm straight hallway with ~15 obstacles and targets spaced ~1âm apart. The difficulty of the initial training course was determined by trial and error, and it varied daily based on errors made on the previous day, aiming for an error rate of 20%. An error was defined as contact with an obstacle or failing to obscure a target completely. With improvement, the difficulty was increased by reducing support provided by walking aids, increasing obstacle height and width, increasing the size of the circular targets (making it more difficult to completely cover the target), and disallowing extra steps between obstacles and targets. Not all participants reached this last level of difficulty.</p>

The CMR was measured from the SOL and TA muscles in the more spastic leg on the basis of the participant's self-report and opinion of the clinical staff. The CMR was recorded in response to triple pulse stimulation (200âHz, 0.3âms pulse width; Digitimer, DS7A, Hertfordshire, England) of the posterior tibial nerve at the level of the medial malleolus, delivered pseudorandomly at intervals between 2 and 5âsec to reduce predictability. The posterior tibial nerve was chosen because (i) it is a mixed nerve that allows recording of an M-wave during movement to ensure that responses are compared at similar effective stimulus intensities (i.e., matched M-wave size) and (ii) stimulus intensity can be compared between days for participants that have impaired sensation. The nerve was first located with a hand-held probe, as we have done in the past [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and once an optimal location was identified, the probe was replaced with a disposable 1âcm diameter Ag/AgCl adhesive electrode. The anode was a 5âcm Ã 10âcm disposable adhesive electrode (Axelgaard Manufacturing Co., Fallbrook, CA), placed on the lateral aspect of the ankle joint. Both electrodes were held in place with additional skin tape. Stimuli were applied at a few intensities around 1.5x motor threshold (MT) of the AHB muscle (typically at 1.5x MT and then one intensity above and one below 1.5x MT) to ensure similar stimulus intensities (i.e., matched M-waves) throughout walking and across different experiment days (see<italic> Data Analyses</italic>), as done in the past [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The intensity of 1.5x MT was chosen to be consistent with previous reports of this reflex [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Motor threshold, estimated in standing, was defined as the stimulus intensity eliciting an M-wave with 50% probability. A minimum of 3 to 4 trials (~3âmin each) were required in order to provide a sufficient number of sweeps to match the M-wave size during the walking cycle.</p>
                  <p>A single trial of ~3âmin walking without stimulation (i.e., unperturbed walking) was also recorded. EMG from this control trial was subtracted from the EMG trace obtained during the stimulation trials to reveal the reflex response. The SOL EMG during the entire length of the unperturbed walking trial was also used to estimate clonus ([<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; see<italic> Data Analyses</italic>).</p>

                  <p>Self-selected walking speed was estimated using the 10MWT [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (time to walk the middle 10âm of a 14âm straight track). The 6-Minute Walk test (6MWT) measured the maximum distance covered while walking back and forth along a straight 30âm track for 6âmin [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Spinal Cord Injury-Functional Ambulation Profile (SCI-FAP), which contains 7 timed tasks during walking (carpet, up-and-go, walking over and around obstacles, up and down stairs, up and down a curb, walking while carrying a bag, and walking while opening door), measured walking skill [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

                  <title>2.5.1. Cutaneomuscular Reflex</title>
                  <p>Reflexes were analyzed using custom-written MatLab programs (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The EMG responses were sorted according to the time of occurrence of the stimulus within the walking stride. The beginning of a walking cycle was set to be near mid-swing on the stimulated side, based on a threshold crossing of the knee goniometer signal. Because the duration of each stride can vary, the strides were first normalized in time from the beginning of one cycle to the beginning of the next cycle and then divided into 8 bins of equal duration, using the MatLab software. Reflexes elicited with AHB M-wave amplitudes (peak-to-peak) within a target range were analyzed to control for stimulus intensity during movement, as pioneered by Capaday and Stein (1986) [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The target range was selected after examining the distribution of M-wave amplitudes for each participant before and after training, with the range being restricted to differences in the upper and lower limits of &lt;20% of the maximum M-wave (M<sub>max</sub>), consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Reflex responses in each bin were full-wave rectified, low-pass filtered at 200âHz (dual-pass, zero phase, 2nd-order, digital Butterworth filter), time-locked to the stimuli, and averaged.</p>
                  <p>EMG traces during unperturbed walking were similarly divided into 8 equal bins and subtracted from EMG responses with stimulation to reveal the reflex response [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All acceptable reflexes were analyzed, unless the subtraction was deemed unsatisfactory by visual inspection, revealed by a nonzero baseline prior to the stimulus. This ensured that the levels of EMG were matched across the control and stimulated conditions. The start and end times (i.e., window) of reflex responses were determined by visually examining the response across all 8 bins separately for each participant (e.g., Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>, vertical dashed lines) and kept consistent before and after training. The reflex response was the averaged EMG amplitude over the duration of the window for each bin (e.g., Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> (SOL) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref> (TA)) within a participant. These bin averages were then averaged bin-by-bin across participants (e.g., Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>(i) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref>(i)) to reveal the pattern of reflex modulation of the CMR over the step cycle. Reflex inhibition and excitation in the step cycle were also quantified using the maximum inhibition (for SOL only, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>) and excitation (for TA and SOL, e.g., Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>) of the CMR, wherever it happened in the step cycle and used to correlate with the walking outcomes. Since there were both excitation and inhibition in the SOL through the cycle but only excitation in the TA, only these were quantified. As the walking outcomes have been reported previously [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], those analyses are not repeated here.</p>

                  <p>The raw SOL EMG signal was corrected for the DC offset, rectified, and analyzed in the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform within the clonus frequency range set to 4â10âHz in agreement with other studies [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To normalize the amplitude of the clonic EMG bursts to that of the regular EMG during walking, the 4â10âHz signal power was expressed as a fraction of the total power within 0â40âHz, according to clonus power (power between 4â10âHz)/(power between 0â40âHz). Frequencies &gt; 40âHz were excluded to avoid power-line noise. Clonus power from the more spastic side, that is, the side with the higher average clonus power across the baseline measures, was used in the analyses.</p>

                  <p>The two baseline measures of reflexes taken approximately 1 week apart (i.e., BL1 and BL2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were compared for all participants, regardless of which training they did first, to determine repeatability using the Paired Samples <italic>t</italic>-test (or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for data that was not normally distributed). Baseline comparisons were made for the maximum inhibition, maximum excitation, and clonus, and a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for the reflex modulation of the CMR (factor 1: time across the step cycle (i.e., bins 1â8); factor 2: time of measurement of the baseline measures (i.e., Baseline 1 and Baseline 2)). In cases where the two baseline measures were not statistically different (all CMR data), the two baseline measures were averaged to provide the best estimate for pretraining conditions. Participant characteristics (age, time since injury, 10MWT, 6MWT, and SCI-FAP) at baseline were also compared between the 2 groups (Precision or Endurance first) using an Independent Sample <italic>t</italic>-test (or MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic> test).</p>

                  <title>2.6.2. Did the Two Types of Training Affect Reflex Excitability in Different Ways?</title>
                  <p><italic>(1) CMR Modulation in Walking</italic>. The CMR was quantified for before and after each type of training separately, regardless of when the training occurred (i.e., Phase 1 or 2). For example, for those who had Endurance Training in Phase 1, before and after training measures were those taken at baseline and at the end of Phase 1 (i.e., at end of Month 2; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), respectively. For those who had Endurance Training in Phase 2, before and after training measures were those taken at the end of Rest 1 (i.e., end of Month 4) and at end of Phase 2 (i.e., end of Month 6), respectively. The CMR for each of the two groups before and after Endurance Training was then pooled across phase (i.e., Phase 1 and Phase 2) to counterbalance the possible effect of the order of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see also [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). The same was done for Precision Training.</p>
                  <p>The distribution of the data was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. To determine the effects of training on reflex excitability, the modulation of the CMR across the step cycle was compared using a 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA, with treatment effect (i.e., before and after) and time bin of the step cycle (i.e., bins 1â8) as the two factors. Missing data in the ANOVA, such as when data was excluded at certain bins due to unsatisfactory subtraction of the background EMG (see<italic> Data Analyses</italic>), was managed by replacing the missing value with the average reflex value for the respective bins. A Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied if the assumption of sphericity was not satisfied (i.e., <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 on Mauchly's test of sphericity) or if the test was not performed due to insufficient degrees of freedom as a result of a small sample size. Post hoc analysis of significant findings was performed using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test.</p>
                  <p>To ensure that the results were not distorted by the crossover design, two further analyses were performed. First, the changes as a result of Precision or Endurance Training were compared for Phase 1 only, using the same statistical procedures (as above). Second, to determine if the rest period between Phases 1 and 2 resulted in changes to the reflexes, a similar 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare the measures at the beginning and at end of Rest 1 (i.e., at the end of Month 2 versus Month 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To be complete, the comparisons were also made for Rest 2 (i.e., at the end of Month 6 versus Month 8).</p>
                  <p><italic>(2) Clonus Power</italic>. Clonus was higher at Baseline 1 compared to Baseline 2 (Baseline 1: 0.13 Â± 0.08, and Baseline 2: 0.10 Â± 0.07; paired <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>p</italic> = 0.031), which could be related to familiarity with the testing environment, since nervousness during Baseline 1 could have caused greater reflex excitability [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Hence, we used clonus power at Baseline 2 as the more conservative estimate for clonus before Phase 1. Otherwise, comparisons were made for clonus measured before and after each form of training and collapsed across phase as described for the CMR (above). Unlike the CMR modulation, there was only one measure taken before and after each type of training, so a Paired Samples <italic>t</italic>-test (or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test) was used to determine if there was a significant change as a result of the training.</p>

                  <p>The relationship between reflex excitability and walking ability was quantified with linear regression. The maximum inhibition of the CMR during the walking cycle and the clonus power were each examined as a function of the 3 walking measures (10MWT, 6MWT, and SCI-FAP) prior to the start of any training. Since there were strong trends, including significant relationships between clonus and walking ability, we further determined if the overall change in clonus (i.e., from Baseline 2 to the end of Month 6) was related to the overall change in walking ability. The relationship between maximum inhibition of the SOL CMR and walking ability was similarly examined for before Endurance Training, since only Endurance Training induced a significant change in the CMR inhibition (see below). The relationship between change in the maximum inhibition of the SOL CMR and change in walking ability was also examined. Significance for all tests was set to <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

                <p>Of the original 20 participants who contributed data to the previous paper [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], all completed Precision Training and 17 completed Endurance Training. One participant (P15) was excluded from the current paper because he had no muscle activity in the TA and SOL (lesion level L1). Participant characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>, with the order of training indicated; no differences in participant characteristics were observed at baseline between the two groups. To facilitate comparison with our previous publication [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], participants are described using the same codes.</p>
                <p>For measures of clonus, all 19 participants were included in our analysis of Precision Training, and 14 for Endurance Training. Two participants were excluded from analysis of Endurance Training because one had large single motor unit activity in the SOL during walking (P4), whose firing rates confounded the clonus estimate [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the other had a technical problem with the EMG recording (P18).</p>
                <p>For the CMR, 14 data sets were included for Precision Training and 12 for Endurance Training. Three participants were excluded from the analysis of both forms of training because the stimuli either stopped their walking (P6, P18) or induced extensive clonus (P8), making it impossible to collect this data. P4 was additionally excluded from analysis of Endurance Training due to inadequate number of responses with acceptable M-wave matches. Two additional participants were excluded from the analysis of Precision Training due to extensive clonus generated by the stimuli (P3), or poor subtraction of unperturbed EMG, resulting in uncertainty of the CMR response (P12).</p>
                <p>The walking speeds during reflex testing ranged from 0.13 to 0.89âm/s (mean Â± SD = 0.35 Â± 0.18âm/s). Body-weight support was used by 6 participants, which ranged from 9 to 27âkg (mean Â± SD = 20 Â± 7âkg).</p>

                <p>The repeated-measures ANOVA comparing group data of the reflex amplitude in the SOL before and after Endurance Training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>(i)) indicated a significant interaction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047) between treatment effect and time bin of the step cycle and a significant training effect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.011). Post hoc analysis revealed significant increase in inhibition at bins 5 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014), 6 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0048), and 7 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.044), resulting in a deeper reflex modulation after training.

Precision Training had no effect on the CMR and background EMG activity in either muscle (ANOVA, data not shown).

                <p>The relationship between the SOL CMR and walking measures was examined for Endurance Training, since only Endurance Training induced a significant enhancement of the inhibition in the SOL CMR. Prior to the start of Endurance Training, there was a relationship between the maximum inhibition in the SOL CMR during walking and walking speed (10MWT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>(i); <italic>r</italic> = 0.65; <italic>p</italic> = 0.022) and walking distance (6MWT, not shown; <italic>r</italic> = 0.69; <italic>p</italic> = 0.013) and a weaker relationship with walking skill (SCI-FAP, not shown; <italic>r</italic> = 0.53; <italic>p</italic> = 0.078). Improved walking speed as a result of Endurance Training (i.e., Î10MWT) was weakly associated with enhanced inhibition in the SOL CMR (i.e., Îmax inhibition), but the correlation was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>(ii); <italic>r</italic> = 0.36; <italic>p</italic> = 0.26). No relationships were observed between the change in the max inhibition of the CMR and walking distance (Î6MWT, not shown; <italic>r</italic> = 0.2; <italic>p</italic> = 0.53) and skill (ÎSCI-FAP, not shown; <italic>r</italic> = 0.0095; <italic>p</italic> = 0.98).</p>
                <p>There were trends for a relationship between clonus and walking measures prior to any training (10MWT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>(i), <italic>r</italic> = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.073; 6MWT, not shown, <italic>r</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.088).

The reduction in clonus after all training was significantly related to improvements in walking speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>(ii), <italic>r</italic> = 0.698, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) and walking distance (not shown, <italic>r</italic> = 0.59, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026) but not walking skill (not shown, <italic>r</italic> = 0.065, <italic>p</italic> = 0.82). Due to the possibility of a single outlier in the bottom right corner of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>(ii) dominating the results, regression analyses were also performed without the outlier. There remained a trend in the relationship between change in clonus and change in walking speed (<italic>r</italic> = 0.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.083), but the relationship between change in clonus and change in walking distance was no longer significant (<italic>r</italic> = 0.29, <italic>p</italic> = 0.34).</p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>The primary new finding is that contrasting forms of walking training have differential effects on the excitability of the CMR. Endurance Training enhanced the reflex inhibition in the SOL during walking, while Precision Training did not. Neither form of training changed clonus in a systematic way. Yet there is a significant relationship between the degree of clonus and walking ability, as well as a relationship between improvement in walking and reduction in clonus. Increase in the CMR inhibition induced by Endurance Training was weakly related to improvement in walking. These results suggest that certain forms of walking training can reduce reflex excitability, and some aspects of the reduced reflex excitability are associated with improved walking function.</p>

                <title>4.1. Methodological Limitations</title>
                <p>As with all exercise interventions, the participants cannot be blinded to the intervention. While we told participants that we did not know which method would be better, the participants could have had their own biases. This may have affected the results but likely would not favor one type of training.</p>
                <p>The crossover design could have led to confoundedness in Phase 2 of training, as there was no washout from the training in Phase 1. However, since the trends in the results remained the same when we analyzed Phase 1 alone, we do not think this would have changed our overall findings.</p>

                <title>4.2. How You Train Makes a Difference</title>
                <p>Different forms of training in uninjured individuals have differential effects on the functional outcome of walking and spinal reflex excitability (see<italic> Introduction</italic>). Here, Endurance Training resulted in a small, yet significant, increase in inhibition of the SOL CMR during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>) and improvements in walking speed and distance [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas Precision Training only modestly improved walking [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and did not change the reflex excitability. Interestingly, both forms of training strengthened the corticospinal tracts (CST), as measured using maximum motor evoked potentials from single-pulse TMS [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, neural plasticity was differentially affected at the spinal and cortical levels by the two different forms of training. Interestingly, in these injured individuals, the total duration of training to elicit a change was considerably less than the athletes mentioned in<italic> Introduction</italic>, although similar changes to reflex modulation have been induced in uninjured individuals training to execute unfamiliar tasks such as backward walking over a 10-day period [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
                <p>It might be argued that the change in CMR inhibition in the SOL was relatively minor, that is, about â10â<italic>Î¼</italic>V on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). However, the typical inhibition seen in uninjured individuals during the stance phase of walking is in the order of â30â<italic>Î¼</italic>V [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the pretraining inhibition in our participants was about â5â<italic>Î¼</italic>V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>), so an additional â10â<italic>Î¼</italic>V is a considerable change in the direction towards the pattern of the uninjured.</p>
                <p>The reason that Endurance Training was more effective in reducing spinal reflex excitability overall could have been because of the much greater number of steps executed during training compared to Precision Training (steps/session: Endurance ~1200; Precision ~400), or it could be that the two forms of training induced neural plasticity at different neural pathways. The two forms of training emphasized very different aspects of walking: speed and distance for Endurance Training versus skill and accuracy for Precision Training. Thus, it was not feasible to equate the number of steps executed in these two forms of training, because it would have required over 4 hours a day of Precision Training to obtain the same number of steps. Thus, while we do not know the âingredientâ that caused the reduction in reflex excitability with Endurance Training, we suggest that the more likely explanation is that the volume (i.e., number of steps) of training is especially important to induce plasticity in the reflex pathways, because walking skill improved equally with both forms of training as measured by SCI-FAP [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A definitive answer will require studies targeting this question specifically, with perhaps more sensitive measures of walking skill than those contained in SCI-FAP.</p>
                <p>Two other studies have compared changes in spinal reflex excitability with different forms of walking training after SCI in humans [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The changes in H<sub>max</sub>/M<sub>max</sub> ratio and clonus in the SOL muscle were compared after 4 types of training: (a) BWS treadmill training (BWSTT) with manual assistance, (b) BWSTT with functional electrical stimulation to the common peroneal nerve, (c) training in the Lokomat, and (d) overground training with functional electrical stimulation to the common peroneal nerve [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While the excitability and duration of clonus were reduced after all forms of training, H<sub>max</sub>/M<sub>max</sub> ratio did not change. Thus, consistent with our study, different spinal reflexes could be differentially responsive to the training. The lack of difference between the different types of training could have been because the 4 training methods were more similar compared to the two in the current study, as all 4 training methods involved continuous stepping, with no differences in walking outcomes between the methods. In a different study, changes in clonus and H<sub>max</sub>/M<sub>max</sub> ratio were compared after 1 month of BWSTT and tilt table standing [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Clonus and flexor spasms were reduced only after the treadmill walking, while extensor spasms were reduced after tilt table standing; no change was observed in H<sub>max</sub>/M<sub>max</sub> after either form of training [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>

                <title>4.3. Are Training-Induced Changes in Reflex Behavior Related to Improvements in Walking?</title>
                <p>Many reports confirm that walking training changes reflex excitability in people with SCI, but few studies have considered its relationship with improvements in walking. BWS step training induced a reduction in SOL clonus duration and an increase in threshold angle for triggering clonus when measured in sitting [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and lying supine [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], while Lokomat training induced a deeper modulation of the H-reflex throughout the walking cycle [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and greater rate-dependent depression [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lokomat training, however, did not change the overground walking function as measured by the 6MWT and the timed-up-and-go test [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], so presumably there was no appreciable relationship between walking function and change in reflex excitability (relationship not reported in [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). Only one study reported a significant relationship between reduced clonus and improved walking speed with training [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>Cutaneous and cutaneomuscular reflexes also change with walking training. The CMR in the TA muscle in response to posterior tibial nerve stimulation showed enhanced early excitation and reduced late excitation with 4 weeks of Lokomat training [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Improvements were seen in the 10MWT, but the relationship between the electrophysiological and functional changes was not reported. Flexor reflex in the TA in response to sural nerve stimulation was also reduced with Lokomat training, but changes in overground walking ability were not reported [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
                <p>We show here that the amount of clonus in the SOL during walking is weakly related to how well the person walks (i.e., 10MWT and 6MWT) before training. Furthermore, reduction in clonus is correlated with improvement in walking outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>(ii)). Similarly, the depth of inhibition in the CMR is related to walking speed and distance before Endurance Training, and the increase in CMR inhibition as a result of Endurance Training is weakly related to the improvement in walking speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>(ii)). The ability to walk is multifactorial and dependent on factors such as the strength of descending input from the brain, strength and endurance of muscles, ability to balance, and excitability of spinal reflexes. Thus, the correlation between any factor and walking ability may be low. Nevertheless, we believe it is essential to understand which aspects of neural plasticity might underlie functional improvements. Indeed, it is possible that some neural plasticity is unrelated to walking function. Determining the correspondence between change in walking function and change in training-induced neural plasticity is the first step towards improving this understanding.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our data, along with other converging evidence, suggests that intensive training of walking reduces the abnormal reflex excitability seen after SCI, for example, reduced excitability of the H-reflex [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], stretch reflex [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and clonus [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] at the ankle, and the flexor reflex [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and long-latency cutaneomuscular reflex [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in the lower leg. This enhanced inhibition is concurrent with training-induced strengthening of corticospinal input to the motoneurons/interneurons [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and better volitional control of leg muscles [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Descending control of spinal circuits, especially from the CST, is well described for humans [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>â<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] including during voluntary movements [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is likely that walking training strengthens the descending control, including inhibitory control of spinal circuits, which have been weakened by the injury [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <p>The cutaneomuscular reflex (CMR) during walking in a single participant. Average EMG traces from the soleus (a) and tibialis anterior (b) muscles, time-locked to the beginning of the stimulus (time = 0), are shown for the 8 bins of the walking cycle from participant P12 after subtraction of the background EMG during unperturbed walking. The number of acceptable reflexes within each time bin (bin number) across the step cycle is indicated on the far right. Data were obtained after the first rest period (i.e., at Month 4) prior to Endurance Training. Triple pulses (200âHz; 0.3âms pulse width; at ~1.5x motor threshold for the abductor hallucis brevis (AHB) muscle) were applied to the posterior tibial nerve behind the medial malleolus during walking on a treadmill. Responses displayed are matched for M-wave amplitudes, measured from the AHB (see<italic> Data Analyses</italic> for details). Responses for each of the 8 bins of the walking cycle were quantified by averaging the EMG between vertical dashed lines in (a) and (b) and plotted as a function of time in the walking cycle in (c) and (d). Correspondences of the bin numbers with stance (ST) and swing (SW) phases are shown by the solid and open bars, respectively, at the bottom of the graphs. Horizontal arrows in (c) and (d) indicate maximum inhibition and excitation.</p>
