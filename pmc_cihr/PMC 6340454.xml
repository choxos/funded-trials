                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Delirium is a common complication of critical illness, associated with negative patient outcomes. Preventive or therapeutic interventions are mostly ineffective. Although relaxation-inducing approaches may benefit critically ill patients, no well-designed studies target delirium prevention as a primary outcome. The objective of this study is to assess feasibility and treatment effect estimates of a multimodal integrative intervention incorporating relaxation, guided imagery and moderate pressure touch massage for prevention of critical illness delirium and for related outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Randomised, controlled, single-blinded trial with two parallel groups (1:1 allocation: intervention and standard care) and stratified randomisation (age (18–64 years and ≥65 years) and presence of trauma) with blocking, involving 104 patients with Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC): 0–3 recruited from two academic intensive care units (ICUs). Intervention group participants receive the intervention in addition to standard care for up to five consecutive days (or until transfer/discharge); control group participants receive standard care and a sham intervention. We will assess predefined feasibility outcomes, that is, recruitment rates and protocol adherence. The primary clinical outcome is incidence of delirium (ICDSC ≥4). Secondary outcomes include pain scores, inflammatory biomarkers, heart rate variability, stress and quality of life (6 weeks and 4 months) post-ICU discharge. Feasibility measures will be analysed descriptively, and outcomes will be analysed longitudinally. Estimates of effects will be calculated.</p>

              <p>Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium affects 35%–55% of critically ill patients and is independently associated with a 13-fold (adjusted OR: 4.88–13.0) increased risk of death<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and long-term cognitive impairment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> ICU delirium carries important financial and societal burdens ((39% higher adjusted ICU (95% CI 12% to 72%) and 31% higher hospital costs (95% CI 1% to 70%)).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Moreover, patients identify frightening delirium experiences and pain as the most severe stressors<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> in critical care. Pharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium have limited benefit and are associated with high costs and risks for side effects.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Although clinical guidelines recommend the development of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> effective prevention strategies have yet to be established.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
              <p>A prolonged and eventually aberrant stress response and depressed parasympathetic (parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)) activity have been postulated as the pathophysiological basis for the development of both ICU delirium and systemic inflammation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref> Frightening hallucinations and ideations during delirium may further exaggerate the stress response and prolong critical illness with detrimental consequences. Pain may worsen matters by reciprocal incremental feedback on inflammation and stress.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 14</xref> Thus, in critical illness, stress, delirium, pain and systemic inflammation may comprise a self-perpetuating syndrome. Attenuating the cascade of negative health impacts from pain and delirium has become a high clinical priority (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Moreover, the growing recognition that delirium and other critical illness sequelae may have long-term consequences in critical illness survivors<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> further highlights the need for prevention strategies.</p>

                  <p>Evidence-based framework for the physiological mechanism implicated in relaxation-induced effects in critical illness. Relaxation acts early at the pathophysiological cascade through which an exaggerated stress response results in proinflammatory effects, suppressed PNS outflow and subsequently in systemic inflammation, multiple organ dysfunction and death. The relaxation response counterbalances the exaggerated stress response and activates PNS and cholinergic anti-inflammatory signalling, which downregulates proinflammatory (eg, HMGB-1) and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokines, therefore attenuating systemic inflammation and its detrimental organ effects. α7-nAChR, alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; HMGB-1, high mobility group box 1; ICU, intensive care unit; PNS, parasympathetic nervous system.</p>

              <p>Evidence-based theoretical work postulates that the multitude of psychological stressors in critically ill individuals may contribute to the development of pathophysiological sequelae.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Moreover, animal models illustrate that PNS stimulation and acetylcholine (ACh) release suppress inflammation and decrease fatality, via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Devising ways to draw on the autonomic nervous systems’ (ANS) inflammation and stress regulatory properties by non-pharmacological interventions has, in theory, the potential to improve outcomes with low side effect risk. However, stimulation of the PNS in critical care is challenging. Relaxation-inducing interventions can induce PNS activity. Such approaches have successfully been used in diverse patient populations to counter stress but remain under-tested in critical illness.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A recent systematic review shows favourable effects of relaxation and guided imagery (RGI) intervention in reducing pain, anxiety and length of stay in critically ill patients,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> whereas the relaxation-inducing effects of music in critical care have been well supported by evidence.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In a pilot randomised controlled trial of the effects of a similar multimodal intervention on the incidence of pain and on a number of secondary outcomes, we observed significant decreases in pain incidence (RR=0.56, p=0.003) and severity (p&lt;0.0001), systolic arterial pressure, anxiety, along with improved sleep quality.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

                <p>Consecutive patients admitted to two academic ICUs, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) score of 0–3 will be screened for study eligibility and will be recruited by research staff at each site. In cases where an ICDSC score cannot be obtained on admission, we will screen patients for up to 4 days after admission. Since delirium occurs most often within the first 5 days of admission, screening and enrolment will take place as soon as possible and within 96 hours after ICU admission. This pilot is not powered to determine a difference in a primary outcome, since we aim to assess estimates of effect. For a definitive trial, we would require 290 (145/arm) patients to detect a 10% difference in incidence proportion between intervention (20%) and control (30%) arm (two-sided alpha=0.05, power=80%, dropout rate=10%). The Pan method,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which is based on generalised estimating equations, was used to perform the sample size calculation under the assumption of AR<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> correlation structure among 5 days repeated measurements with correlation between any two adjacent observations from the same subject of 0.5. Since this is a pilot, aiming to explore feasibility and estimates of effects, and the incidence rates used for the calculation might not be appropriate, we used 36% of the sample size of the full study to estimate the parameters accurately and get an experience for a full trial.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

              <title>Intervention</title>
              <p>The choice of a multimodal intervention (duration: 55 min) was based on an evidence-based literature review, its superiority to unidimensional approaches,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the recommendations of the American Holistic Nurses Association<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and a successful pilot.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> According to the UK Medical Research Council guidance for complex intervention trials,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> development of the protocol included extensive theoretical work,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> two systematic reviews,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 26</xref> modelling of outcomes, extensive consultations with groups of experts, one small feasibility and acceptability pilot (n=10 participants) and one larger pilot (n=60)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and consultation with pilot participants and patients’ representatives. The intervention has been developed by the research team and a group of experts based at the University of Alberta and Cyprus University of Technology. It includes: (A) a brief moderate-pressure massage session (massage: 15 min) and (b) RGI (30 min, through headphones). The 30 min recorded RGI intervention involves: (A) guided relaxation, (B) a structured guided imagery script supported by instrumental music and (C) recorded instrumental music for 15 min (Haydn concerto no 1 in C major and Bach violin concerto in D minor, 60 beats per min approximately). The same recorded RGI script will be used at all sessions. It includes positive suggestions and instructions for gradual relaxation, followed by guidance to visualise one’s body being healed. Moderate-pressure (4 N, approximately or patient pressure rating 3/10) low velocity (1–5 cm/s) massage consists of broad and repetitive circular movements with wide area of contact, applied sequentially for 2–3 min at each site: hands, forearms, lateral arms and then over trapezius muscles, the temple, scalp, face and forehead area. Areas are to be contacted as appropriate to each participant, and the protocol may be adapted taking into account safety issues (ie, to avoid area around intravascular catheter or injury). Moderate pressure massage is involved in PNS activation, in contrast to light pressure.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The intervention will be administered once daily (09:00–15:00) for up to five consecutive days by trained research staff not involved in patient care, who will be randomly audited by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) to ensure protocol adherence. The decision to deliver the intervention for the first 5 days after enrolment only was based on epidemiological data regarding the onset of delirium,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> data on median length of stay of the target populations in the study institutions and cost considerations. However, it will be important to study the effect of the intervention on longer stay patients in future trials. The decision to deliver only one intervention daily was based on a small acceptability/feasibility pilot and pragmatic considerations for knowledge translation and future implementation of this approach, as well as cost considerations and burden to participants and units. The durations of guided imagery, music listening and touch intervention were based on the acceptability pilot, expert opinions on the minimum duration to achieve a relaxation effect and on published evidence.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Despite evidence on the importance of providing choice to patients regarding music listening,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we will use standardised music for intervention stability purposes. It will be important to look at the effect of patient-directed music in future trials of this intervention.</p>
              <p>Interruptions and deviations from the intervention protocol will be recorded in detail. The intervention will be terminated on a patient’s transfer or discharge from the ICU. The intervention may be discontinued in case of adverse events related to the intervention or withdrawal of consent. If we observe ICDSC scores above 3 once the intervention has been commenced, the intervention will be continued, unless otherwise indicated by a participant’s condition. Although contamination of the control group by spontaneously mimicking aspects of the intervention by healthcare personnel cannot be excluded, healthcare providers in the units are very familiar with clinical trials and have been instructed on the need to abstain from mimicking the intervention. Additionally, the touch component of the intervention requires specific training and it is unlikely to be successfully replicated.</p>

                <p>Investigators, physicians and nurses (when possible), data collectors, research assistants and laboratory technicians will be blinded to group allocation during the trial and analysis. Due to the nature of the intervention, participants cannot be blinded to allocation. Also, participants’ primary nurses cannot be blinded to study procedures (ie, delivery of massage); however, they will remain blinded to study hypotheses and study design (ie, study outcomes and numbers and types of participants’ groups), to minimise performance bias. We believe that these procedures along with the sham intervention will maintain an adequate level of concealment even among participants’ primary nurses to minimise bias. The same intervention personnel will be involved in the delivery of the intervention and sham intervention. Intervention personnel are not involved in assessment of patient outcomes and have been trained on the importance of preserving blinding, therefore minimising the risk for potential bias.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>Demographic/clinical characteristics of patients and all outcomes will be presented by treatment group using descriptive statistics: mean (SD), median (IQR) or proportion. Outcomes will be analysed longitudinally over 5 days by logistic regression model based on generalised estimating equations (GEE) with first-order autoregressive correlation structure (AR<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) correlation structure. Analysis of covariance, t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate, will be conducted for the continuous outcomes that are not longitudinal. Models will be adjusted for covariates including predeliric score, administration of medication (sedatives, analgesics, vasoactives and antipsychotics) and severity score (SOFA and APACHE). χ<sup>2</sup> or exact test, as appropriate, will be used for categorical outcomes. We will treat pain outcomes as both categorical (presence or absence of pain) and continuous variables (pain score). CIs will be presented with estimated effects. Primary analysis will be based on all available data using data from all assessments. Since GEE assumes missing completely at random (MCAR) mechanism, we plan to conduct a sensitivity analysis based on inverse probability-weighted GEE,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> which employs a less restrictive missing at random (MAR) mechanism. A ‘last observation carried forward’ (LOCF) approach was not considered because analysing all available data performs better than LOCF in GEE setting with respect to bias, type I error rate and coverage probability under both MCAR and MAR mechanisms. Although we are not able to formally assess potential effects of the sham intervention with the current two-group design, GEE models will provide indications of such potential effects that will be taken into account at a future trial. Analysis will be conducted by EPICORE.</p>
                <p>To account for non-compliance, protocol deviations and missing outcomes, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be employed. ITT analysis includes every randomised subject according to treatment assignment. Additionally, per-protocol (PP) analysis will also be employed. PP population is defined as a subset of the ITT population who completed the study without any major protocol violations. If ITT and PP analyses lead to similar conclusions, the reliability of results will be supported. Although this is a pilot trial, ITT will help reduce potential effects of selection bias. PP analysis will assess whether the ITT result is too conservative. This will provide important data regarding the effect size for the subsequent trial. Both analyses will assist us in revising the protocol for the larger trial.</p>

Periodical audits of the intervention and trial processes at both sites by personnel independent from investigators will be initiated by the TSC. Randomisation, recruitment, intervention adherence, blinding, stability and data collection processes will be monitored. Trial Monitoring Committee will also review relevant information from similar studies and will consider the recommendations of the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee. Study personnel have been trained to standardise processes. We have developed two training videos including detailed demonstration of the intervention. Moreover, research personnel involved with the intervention has received 18–21 hours of hands-on training, including detailed auditing, and several hours of self-paced training to standardise the process, communication and timing of intervention. Study personnel will meticulously record any deviations from the intervention protocol to assess feasibility and effect on outcomes. Clinical data will be retrieved from the quality-controlled clinical information system of the units. Detailed electronic data collection forms with embedded quality controls will be used and reviewed in detail. Data quality will be monitored through EPICORE before, during and after entry. All data will be entered electronically using study forms generated through RedCap with embedded quality control processes.

TMG meetings will take place on a regular basis throughout the duration of the study.
