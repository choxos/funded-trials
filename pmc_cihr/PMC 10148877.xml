                <p id="Par1">Resuscitation induced ischemia/reperfusion predisposes trauma patients to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. We investigated the effect of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), a treatment shown to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury in experimental models of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation, on the systemic immune-inflammatory profile in trauma patients in a randomized trial. We conducted a prospective, single-centre, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving trauma patients sustaining blunt or penetrating trauma in hemorrhagic shock admitted to a Level 1 trauma centre. Patients were randomized to receive RIC (four cycles of 5-min pressure cuff inflation at 250 mmHg and deflation on the thigh) or a Sham intervention. The primary outcomes were neutrophil oxidative burst activity, cellular adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of myeloperoxidase, cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood samples, drawn at admission (pre-intervention), 1 h, 3 h, and 24 h post﻿-admission. Secondary outcomes included ventilator, ICU and hospital free days, incidence of nosocomial infections, 24 h and 28 day mortality. 50 eligible patients were randomized; of which 21 in the Sham group and 18 in the RIC group were included in the full analysis. No treatment effect was observed between Sham and RIC groups for neutrophil oxidative burst activity, adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of myeloperoxidase and cytokines. RIC prevented significant increases in Th2 chemokines﻿ TARC/CCL17 (P &lt; 0.01) and MDC/CCL22 (P &lt; 0.05) at 24 h post-intervention in comparison to the Sham group. Secondary clinical outcomes were not different between groups. No adverse events in relation to the RIC intervention were observed. Administration of RIC was safe and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes. While trauma itself modified several immunoregulatory markers, RIC failed to alter expression of the majority of markers. However, RIC may influence Th2 chemokine expression in the post resuscitation period. Further investigation into the immunomodulatory effects of RIC in traumatic injuries and their impact on clinical outcomes is warranted.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Traumatic injuries continue to be a leading cause of mortality worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> despite significant advances in the comprehensive treatment of the trauma patient. Organ dysfunction observed in severely injured resuscitated patients, is, in part, attributed to the development of systemic immune dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The pathophysiological process of ischemia/reperfusion occurring in patients resuscitated from hemorrhagic shock initiates a cascade of cellular events leading to an altered immune status, and includes generation of oxidative stress, release of inflammatory cytokines, and the priming of immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The attendant phenotypic switch from Th1 to Th2 adaptive immunity post resuscitation is associated with immunosuppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Together these events predispose trauma patients to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, infections, and multiple organ dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">An intervention that has been shown to lessen the magnitude of ischemia/reperfusion injury is called Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. RIC is a non-invasive therapeutic procedure consisting of repetitive applications of brief ischemia/reperfusion to a distal limb by inflating and deflating a pressure cuff. In experimental studies, antecedent administration of RIC ameliorates distant organ ischemia/reperfusion injury. RIC has also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects when applied in healthy volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These findings have been translated to clinical trials to show a beneficial effect of RIC in renal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and cardiac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> protection. There has been considerable study of the mechanisms underlying the salutary effects of RIC on distant organ injury. Both humoral and neuronal pathways have been invoked, often with both being involved and frequently interacting, in mediating the transfer of the upstream signal i.e. RIC to downstream organ protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Further, both may be involved in the downstream effect leading to organ protection. It has also been reported that the elaboration of reactive oxygen species by the preconditioning intervention might exert protection through activation of redox-sensitive events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In the trauma setting, Joseph et al. demonstrated that RIC applied in patients following traumatic brain injury exerted neuroprotective effects, as determined by a reduction of neuronal biomarkers of acute brain injury in the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In animal models of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation, we and others have shown the protective effect of RIC in preventing organ injury in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, its ability to more broadly modulate immune function in trauma populations sustaining hemorrhagic shock, has not been evaluated. Whether RIC applied post-injury in trauma patients can initiate its upstream signaling and downstream protective effect, in which hemorrhage has led to hemodynamic instability, inflammatory responses, immune cell alterations, platelet dysfunction, and coagulopathy, remains to be determined.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We hypothesized that RIC may suppress the inflammatory response associated with traumatic resuscitated hemorrhagic shock. The major objective of this clinical trial is to investigate the potential immunomodulatory effects of posttraumatic application of RIC in trauma patients sustaining hemorrhagic shock by evaluating markers of neutrophil activation and systemic inflammation during the acute phase of injury.</p>

                <p id="Par7">A prospective, single-centre, randomized, controlled double-blind clinical trial was conducted at St. Michael’s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, a Level 1 provincial trauma centre, to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of Remote Ischemic Conditioning in trauma patients (age &gt; 16) sustaining blunt or penetrating injuries and in hemorrhagic shock. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02071290) on 25/02/2014. Hemorrhagic shock was defined as one or more recorded episode of systolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg at any time prior to enrolment with an identified source of blood-loss. The RIC procedure was to be completed within 4 h of injury to be eligible. Major exclusions included patients who were on anticoagulant medication, pregnancy, recorded systolic blood pressure of above 200 mmHg, burns, absence of vitals, or ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patients were enrolled by research coordinator through deferred consent as permitted by The Tri-Council Policy Statement on the Ethical Conduct of Research with Humans (TCPS2) and informed consent was obtained from all participants by the substitute decision maker within 24 h of enrolment. After randomization, blood samples were collected into citrate, EDTA, and heparin vacutainers at Admission (prior to initiation of Sham or RIC intervention), and at 1, 3, and 24 h after admission. These timepoints were chosen to reflect the biphasic cytoprotection afforded by RIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>; i.e. the early cytoprotection that lasts up to ~ 3 h after RIC (first window of protection) and the late cytoprotection that emerges ~ 24 h after RIC (second window of protection). Fresh heparinized whole blood samples for flow cytometric analysis were stained within 1 h of collection.

                <p id="Par20">Of the 25 enrolled patients in the Sham arm, the intervention was completed in 23 patients: 2 of the patients did not have the intervention initiate due to death of one patient after enrolment and another patient was not able to initiate the intervention within the inclusion period time frame. Of the 25 enrolled patients in the RIC arm, 20 patients completed the RIC intervention. The intervention was not initiated in 3 patients due to the inability to draw admission blood from one patient, one patient opted out of the study, and one patient was not able to initiate RIC within the inclusion period time frame. Two of RIC patients had the intervention started but prematurely terminated before all the cycles were completed due to the necessity to perform vascular surgery on the leg which RIC was performed and one patient had the intervention stopped during the first ischemic cycle due to discomfort. In addition, 4 patients from the Sham arm and 5 patients from the RIC arm had the RIC cycles interrupted due to transfer of the patients out to other departments including the Intensive Care Unit, CT Scan, or Operating Room where the interventions were resumed following transfer. The mean time for the completion of the intervention for patients who had the intervention interrupted was not significantly different between the Sham intervention (68 ± 22 min) and the RIC intervention (68 ± 21 min, P = 0.99).</p>
                <p id="Par21">The mean duration from injury to application of the Sham intervention (114 ± 53 min) was not different in comparison to the RIC intervention (130 ± 50 min, P = 0.31). The mean duration from the time of injury to completion of the intervention was also not significantly different between Sham (154 ± 56 min) and RIC (181 ± 46 min, P = 0.09) patients. Both arms had two patients in which completion of the intervention exceeded the 4 h inclusion period time frame. Significant positive correlations were observed between APACHE II score (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>A) and the Injury Severity Score (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>B) to the duration of time from injury to initiation of the intervention, suggesting the complexity of injuries and the patients’ pathological conditions contribute to the variability and delay in the application of RIC.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The median duration for transport time from the arrival to scene of injury to admission was 25 min (IQR: 15, 34) by ambulance and 70 min (IQR: 51, 85) by helicopter. Those patients who had prolonged transport time were due to transfers from other hospitals. These data suggest there is potentially sufficient time for pre-hospital application of RIC during EMS transport.</p>

              <p id="Par33">Dysregulated immuno-inflammatory responses may contribute to adverse outcomes following traumatic hemorrhagic shock despite successful resuscitation protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The present clinical trial is the first study to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of remote ischemic conditioning in trauma patients sustaining hemorrhagic shock. Based on the salutary effects of RIC in experimental models of ischemia/reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation, we hypothesized that RIC exerts anti-inflammatory effects in hemorrhagic shock patients during the acute phase of injury. We demonstrated that application of RIC in hemorrhagic shock patients upon arrival in the Emergency Room at our institution was feasible, safe, tolerable, and not associated with adverse outcomes. The RIC protocol employed in this study, namely four cycles of inflation/deflation on the thigh, inhibited baseline and stimulated ROS production in neutrophils when applied to healthy controls. However, in our cohort of trauma patients, we did not observe significant changes in neutrophil activation, plasma pro-inflammatory markers, and clinical outcomes in patients treated with RIC in comparison to the Sham treatment. Still, we observed that RIC prevented a significant increase in Th2 cytokines in Sham-treated trauma patients—an effect that may potentially prevent Th2 induced immunosuppression.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Ischemia/reperfusion injury is a pathological process caused by tissue ischemia followed by restoration of perfusion, which together initiate a cascade of cellular events culminating in the tissue injury due to the generation of oxidative stress, initiation of the cell death pathways and generation of pro-inflammatory molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the context of trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock, post-trauma resuscitation induces ischemia/reperfusion in tissues and contributes to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. The extravasation and activation of neutrophils play a key role in the pathogenesis of organ injury through degranulation and the release of injurious enzymes and ROS. Consistent with prior reports, we observed priming of neutrophils, increased surface adhesion molecule expression, and degranulation of MPO during the early injury period concomitant with an early rise in the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokine IL-8 in our cohort of trauma patients. We asked the question whether RIC application in trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock patients might alter this pro-inflammatory profile, along with neutrophil ROS production and CD11b expression, both unstimulated and in response to PMA and fMLP. In the current study, the application of RIC following traumatic injury did not exert effects on these parameters and specifically, at no time point did neutrophil ROS production and CD11b expression differ, whether unstimulated or in response to PMA, between RIC and sham groups. We also observed that there was lower unstimulated and fMLP stimulated ROS production in both Sham and RIC treated patients compared to healthy controls, and a gradual decline in PMA stimulated ROS production, which normalized by 24 h post intervention for both groups. This may have been due to the elaboration of IL-10. This anti-inflammatory cytokine, known to exert inhibitory effects on neutrophil ROS production and phagocytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, was elevated in both sham and RIC trauma patients throughout the study compared to healthy controls.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In addition to degranulation, activated neutrophils have also been shown to secrete VEGF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Patients in the Sham group exhibited significant increases in plasma VEGF levels at 24 h post intervention, but this increase was not observed in the RIC group. The role of VEGF post injury remains controversial due to its dual role in inducing endothelial permeability and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, VEGF is associated with increased vascular permeability in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
              <p id="Par36">In our investigation of a panel of cytokines/chemokines, we observed that RIC prevented the significant increases in the cytokines MDC/CCL22 and TARC/CCL17 at 24 h post intervention. Both MDC and TARC are specific ligands for C–C chemokine receptor type 4, a receptor expressed on myeloid cells and lymphocytes but predominately on Th2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to activating the Th2 response, TARC inhibits generation of classically activated macrophages resulting in impaired innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest a potentially novel role for RIC in the modulation of T cell mediated innate immunity, as post traumatic shift from Th1 towards an anti-inflammatory Th2 phenotype contributes to susceptibility to nosocomial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and development of sepsis and poorer outcomes. This suggestion is further supported by recent animal models, where RIC elicited increased T cell anti-inflammatory cytokine production with an attendant shift from Th17 cells towards Treg cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Importantly, Richter et al. revealed a role for MDC in mediating lung inflammation in a murine model of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation as administration of neutralizing antibodies against MDC significantly reduces pulmonary levels of the chemotactic cytokines KC, MIP-2, and MIP-1α and extravasation of inflammatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Another potential beneficial effect of inhibiting MDC and TARC during the late resuscitation period is that MDC and TARC stimulate platelet aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which may induce thrombosis post trauma. The upregulation of antioxidants may play a role in the down regulation of MDC and TARC. Jeong and colleagues demonstrated that induction of HO-1 prevents IFN-γ and TNF-α-induced production of TARC and MDC through suppression of NF-κB in human keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Notably, induction of the antioxidant heme oxygenase-1 by RIC mediates lung protection in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We have also recently shown in a murine model that Nrf2, the upstream transcription factor for antioxidant response, mediated hepatoprotection by RIC after hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In this trial, we did not observe any differences in the incidence of nosocomial infections or clinical outcomes between the Sham and RIC group, although our trial is not powered to detect such differences. Further studies are warranted to characterize T-cell phenotype and the innate immunity after RIC treatment post trauma.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Several studies in humans have sought to determine the potential mediators of RIC and have measured a number of humoral and immunomodulatory molecules, including plasma levels of cytokines, hormones, and factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These findings are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Notably, Gedik et al. identified increased plasma IL-1α as a potential cardioprotective factor of RIC that protects the myocardium during ischemic cardioplegic arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Although IL-1α was measured in our study, analysis was excluded as &lt; 80% of samples had detectable levels. The study by Dewitte et al. found RIC increased plasma levels of antioxidant superoxide dismutase in a model of vascular injury in healthy volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our present study did not measure superoxide dismutase, but this finding supports our prior animal study that determined the role of antioxidants in RIC-mediated protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par38">Despite a wealth of preclinical evidence pointing to the therapeutic effect of RIC in ischemia/reperfusion injury, translation to the clinical setting has been difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Large prospective multicentre clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of RIC in improving outcomes in the settings of cardiovascular surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and acute myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Several factors have been postulated that may negate the effects of RIC. These include surgical anesthesia, co-morbidities, age, as well as timing, route, and dose of RIC administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Many of these factors were pertinent in our trial and may have contributed to the neutral results of our study.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The nature of traumatic injuries and patient triage/transfer to our trauma centre affected our ability to precisely control the timing of initial RIC application across all patients as it relates to time after injury. Patients from our study had a median time of application at 2 h after injury, likely representing the post-resuscitative phase of injury. While there is no definitive clinical evidence to suggest the delayed application of RIC influences its protective effect, animal studies from our lab have shown that delaying RIC after shock/resuscitation in the early reperfusion period can diminish its protective effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, future trials on RIC might focus on pre-hospital application of RIC or try to standardize the intervention by applying RIC as soon as patients arrive to the trauma bay. One interesting patient population might be soldiers at risk of traumatic injuries who may have RIC applied prophylactically (preconditioning) during pre-deployment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Any of these strategies might serve to maximize RIC’s protective effect.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The heterogeneity in trauma patients results in a number of clinical characteristics that significantly differ between each patient. These include the number of blood products transfused, surgical procedures, and anesthesia regimens. Each of these variables can contribute to a different immunological response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Anesthesia is a major factor that may confound with the effects of RIC. For example, propofol has been shown to inhibit the cardioprotective effect of RIC in cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, whereas volatile anesthesia and opioids mimic the protective effects of RIC. The use of anesthesia was largely variable across our patient population and presents as a limitation in our study.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Previous studies in healthy volunteers that demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of RIC on leukocyte gene expression utilized the arm to conduct RIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Our current study utilized the thigh to induce RIC to permit the clinical resuscitation protocols performed on trauma patients. Controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of arm RIC versus leg RIC although a recent study by Dezfulian et al. demonstrated no significant differences in the liberation of nitrite—an effector circulating molecule of RIC, and the downstream cytoprotection induced by either method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. We showed in our healthy controls that thigh RIC induced down regulation of neutrophil oxidative burst and adhesion molecule expression, indicating the RIC stimulus applied on the leg reproduced the anti-inflammatory effect as forearm RIC. One potential explanation for reduced effect of RIC in trauma patients is that endothelial dysfunction, which develops in the early injury period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, has been shown to inhibit the generation of nitrite following reactive hyperemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and may therefore contribute to reduced generation of cytoprotective molecules by RIC. The significant reduction in peripheral blood flow to the limbs during hemorrhagic shock may also impair the initiation of signaling in the periphery by RIC. It is also unknown which dose (cycles) of RIC evokes optimal protective effects in humans as no dose response trial has been conducted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Activation of the vago-splenic axis has been shown by Lieder et al. to be causally involved in cardioprotection by RIC, implicating the spleen as a critical relay organ for its protective signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In addition to severely impaired perfusion of the spleen during hemorrhage, splenic immune response and cellular immunity are further suppressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, which together may potentially impair RIC’s protective signaling in trauma patients. To determine if arterial blood pressure during onset of RIC influences its effect, we performed post hoc analysis on subgroups of patients using surrogate markers of severe hemorrhagic shock (transfusion of blood products or no transfusion; injury severity score below or over 15; and admission systolic blood pressure below or over 90 mmHg) and found that these subgroups did not impact RIC on the biomarkers measured in this study. Traumatic injuries also impair platelet function, as platelets become inert to ex vivo stimulation, in a condition known as platelet exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Lieder et al. recently demonstrated that platelets play a causal role in RIC signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Thus, platelet dysfunction as a consequence of trauma may contribute to undermine RIC’s signaling.</p>
                <p id="Par43">In summary, our study was the first trial to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of RIC in humans sustaining traumatic hemorrhagic shock. We demonstrate that post-trauma application of RIC in hemorrhagic shock patients is safe, feasible and not associated with adverse outcomes. Although RIC induced anti-inflammatory effects in neutrophils taken from healthy volunteers, this effect was not recapitulated in trauma patients, which may in part be due to confounding factors, including the timing of the intervention. However, RIC prevented the increase in Th2 cytokines that are associated with immunosuppression. Results from our preliminary study in trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock suggest further investigation into the possible immunomodulatory mechanisms of RIC on the post-trauma immuno-inflammatory response and its impact on clinical parameters.</p>
