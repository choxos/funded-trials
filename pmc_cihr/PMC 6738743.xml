                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Research supports the use of specific strategies to discontinue mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill patients. Little is known about how clinicians actually wean and discontinue MV in practice or the association between different discontinuation strategies and outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to describe international practices in the use of (1) daily screening for readiness to discontinue MV, (2) modes of MV used before initial discontinuation attempts, (3) weaning and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) protocols, (4) SBT techniques and (5) sedation and mobilisation practices to facilitate weaning and discontinuation. The secondary objectives are to identify patient characteristics and time-dependent factors associated with use of selected strategies, investigate associations between SBT outcome (failure vs success) and outcomes, explore differences between patients who undergo an SBT early versus later in their intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and investigate the associations between different SBT techniques and humidification strategies on outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will conduct an international, prospective, observational study of MV discontinuation practices among critically ill adults who receive invasive MV for at least 24 hours at approximately 150 ICUs in six geographic regions (Canada, USA, UK, Europe, India and Australia/New Zealand). Research personnel at participating ICUs will collect demographic data, data to characterise the initial strategy or event that facilitated discontinuation of MV (direct extubation, direct tracheostomy, initial successful SBT, initial failed SBT or death before any attempt could be made), clinical outcomes and site information. We aim to collect data on at least 10 non-death discontinuation events in each ICU (at least 1500 non-death discontinuation events).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Mechanical ventilation (MV) is the prototypical life support technology used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most adult patients who are admitted to ICUs require either invasive or noninvasive MV for a proportion of their stay. A key component of MV support is the process of weaning or discontinuing MV. During MV discontinuation, the work of breathing is transferred from the ventilator back to the patient and ventilator support is either abruptly or gradually withdrawn. Approximately 40% of the total duration of invasive MV is spent in the weaning phase.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Prolonged invasive MV is responsible for a large portion of ICU costs and is associated with the development of complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> sinusitis<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and respiratory muscle weakness.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thus, minimising the duration of MV has been identified as a priority for improvement in the field of critical care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>Randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines support the use of specific strategies during weaning including the early identification of weaning candidates using weaning protocols,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref> tests to determine the patient’s ability to breathe spontaneously (or spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref> and selected modes of ventilation or strategies (pressure support (PS) and SBTs (using PS or T-piece).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> However, little is known about how clinicians actually discontinue MV (direct extubation (no prior SBT), initial SBT, direct tracheostomy) in practice or about the impact of different discontinuation practices on clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
              <p>Weaning is a collaborative effort involving the skills of diverse healthcare providers including respiratory therapists (RTs), critical care nurses, physiotherapists, kinesiotherapists, dietitians, pharmacists and physicians. Availability of personnel and organisational factors (teaching affiliation, funding status (public vs private), organisational models (open vs closed) and ICU processes of care) may influence how evidence is adopted into clinical practice and affect outcomes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 18 19</xref> Despite strong recommendations for the use of weaning protocols, several factors may limit their use in practice including the need for multidisciplinary education, scale of implementation and strategies to ensure ongoing compliance.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>In this International, Prospective, Observational Study of Mechanical Ventilation Discontinuation Practices (hereafter referred to as the IOS study), we aim to describe variation in practice variation in discontinuing MV at national and international levels, describe the impact of different practices in discontinuing MV on clinical outcomes and identify important predictors of initial SBT outcome (see the Objectives section).</p>

We will exclude patients who (1) are transferred to participating ICUs without a documented intubation time, (2) have a tracheotomy/tracheostomy at ICU admission and (3) are already on ventilator settings compatible with an SBT (eg, T-piece, CPAP≤5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or PS≤7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) at ICU admission. We will exclude patients who reside in participating ICUs for ≥24 hours on the first day of data collection and those readmitted to the index ICU during the study period.

We will describe the association between MV discontinuation practices and clinical outcomes including total duration of MV, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, proportion of patients off the ventilator and out of the ICU at day 28 after MV initiation, ICU and hospital LOS, ICU readmission (during the index hospitalisation) and reintubation within 48 hours of extubation.</p>

              <p>The IOS study seeks to quantify the magnitude of practice variation in liberating critically ill adults from invasive MV and associations between use of selected discontinuation strategies and clinical outcomes. Building on previous work including national and international weaning surveys, summarising intensivists’ stated practices in weaning critically ill adults from invasive ventilation, the IOS study will examine how clinicians actually discontinue MV in ICUs from six geographic regions of the world.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 26</xref> A study of this scope and rigour focused on MV discontinuation in both academic and community ICUs, involving individual site-training, prospective and consecutive (where possible) patient inclusion, event identification and data collection, and patient-level data validation (through a process involving individual data review, and detailed query generation and resolution over electronic mail and within Medidata RAVE) has not been conducted previously. We will also identify important predictors (patient, clinician, SBT, institutional and regional) of initial SBT outcome (success vs failure).</p>
              <p>We hypothesise that significant practice variation will exist among ICUs in different geographic regions in the use of daily screening, preferred methods of support before discontinuation, use of written directives for weaning and SBT conduct, in the conduct SBTs and in sedation and mobilisation practices. We predict that patients who undergo a tracheostomy or fail an initial SBT will experience higher overall mortality, reintubation, and readmission rates, and longer ICU and hospital LOS. Furthermore, these patients will be more likely to remain in the ICU and on invasive MV at day 28 after MV initiation. We anticipate that patient characteristics (eg, age, patient type (medical vs surgical), illness severity and prior history of heart failure) and time-dependent factors (development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, neutropaenia, a bleeding diathesis or the requirement for dialysis) will be associated with the use of selected discontinuation strategies. In addition, we postulate that patients who fail an initial SBT and those who undergo an SBT later in their stay will experience significantly higher mortality, reintubation and readmission rates, longer ICU and hospital LOS, and will be more likely to remain in the ICU and on MV at day 28 compared with patients who pass an initial SBT and those who undergo an SBT earlier in their ICU stay. We do not anticipate finding differences in clinical outcomes based on the SBT technique used; however, we predict that use of HME will result in more initial SBT failures, especially among patients who undergo an SBT later in their ICU stay. Finally, we expect to identify important patient-related (age, patient type, illness severity), clinician-related (presence of RTs, time spent in clinical practice), SBT-related (use of daily screening, SBT technique) and institutional-related predictors (public vs private funding, university affiliation, presence of written directives for weaning and SBT conduct) of SBT outcome.</p>
              <p>We encountered several challenges in designing and coordinating the IOS study. First, in designing the study we recognised that participation of a larger number of ICUs in any one geographic region could result in greater observed practice variation and conversely inclusion of only a few ICUs in any one region may underestimate true weaning practice variation. As such, we aimed to recruit a similar number of participating ICUs in each region. Second, we secured peer-reviewed funding through a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Operating/Industry partnered grant opportunity (80:20) to provide site investigators with a payment ($C750) for organising local approvals and prospective data collection. Despite the IOS study being investigator-initiated and peer-review funded, partial industry funding resulted in unanticipated requests for payment from several ethics committees for ethics review. Third, to address variation in ventilator terminology, we used standard terminology,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> where feasible and engaged our international collaborators in developing and pilot testing data collection forms. Fourth, to minimise the potential for selection bias introduced by the need to obtain prospective consent,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> we intended to implement this purely observational study with a waiver of consent. To ensure that family members were aware that the IOS study was in progress, we planned to display posters in the family waiting rooms of participating ICUs, where required. However, a few ethics committees mandated that research personnel obtain consent from patients or their substitute decision makers for participation. Fifth, although we initially planned to implement the IOS study during two data collection periods of approximately 2 weeks duration each, we recognised early in study implementation that this would not be feasible due to wide variation in the availability and efficiency of ethics and contract approval processes. Moreover, although most ICUs required only one ethics approval to participate, several ICUs especially in the UK and Australia required multiple approvals (eg, central plus other approval). Consequently, we adopted a staggered approach to study implementation. With this approach, we trained local research personnel on the study protocol and data collection procedures after local approvals were obtained and before study activation. Lastly, we underestimated the number of ICUs that we would need to approach to achieve 150 participating ICUs. Personnel from several sites who initially agreed to participate, subsequently withdrew study participation for various reasons. Consequently, ICU recruitment and initiation of approval processes became an iterative process. To achieve our target number of events, we ultimately reduced the minimum number of beds required in participating ICUs from 15 to 9 beds.</p>
              <p>Successful study coordination and implementation will require broad collaboration. This study builds on previous work conducted by members of the investigative team within in a <italic>P</italic>
<italic>rogram</italic>
<italic>of Research on</italic>

<italic>Discontinuation Practices</italic> and is being conducted under the auspices of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group (CCCTG).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Support for a research programme by the CCCTG signals a commitment to participate actively in the programme’s development, refinement, conduct and, ultimately, reporting in the medical literature<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Regional site leads (Dr Jones (UK), Dr Villar (Europe), Dr Kapadia (India), Dr Gattas (Australia/New Zealand), Dr Epstein (USA)) will assist with implementing the IOS Study in ICUs in their respective regions, function as local resources, and aid in drafting and revising the manuscript. The members of the organising team in Canada (Dr Burns, Dr Meade, Dr Cook, Dr Dodek, Dr Slutsky and Dr Cook) have strong working relationships with the regional site leads through previous collaborations. We will coordinate study implementation at participating sites using webinars, telephone, facsimile and electronic mail correspondence. To facilitate communication between the study investigators and personnel at participating ICUs, we will launch and up-date a microsite containing the study protocol, data collection forms and study newsletters. The investigative team will own and manage the study database, conduct the planned analyses and draft manuscripts independently from industry partners. Industry partners will be invited to review the study protocol, data collection forms and the study manuscript prior to submission. Industry partners may request and pay for additional analyses.</p>
              <p>The IOS study will characterise practices in discontinuing MV and the impact of using various discontinuation strategies on important outcomes. The IOS study is novel in evaluating actual weaning and discontinuation practices outside the structure of randomised trials on an international level and in heterogeneous settings. The IOS study will provide valuable information to the international critical care community, identify practices that warrant further study, inform the design of future trials, and foster collaborations between investigators and regions.</p>
