                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The number of adults across the globe with significant depressive symptoms has grown substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extant literature supports exercise as a potent behaviour that can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Using a suite of mobile applications, at-home exercise, including high intensity interval training (HIIT) and/or yoga, was completed to reduce depressive symptoms in the general population in the early months of the pandemic.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A 6-week, parallel, multiarm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was completed with four groups: (1) HIIT, (2) Yoga, (3) HIIT+yoga, and (4) waitlist control (WLC). Low active, English-speaking, non-retired Canadians aged 18–64 years were included. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and weekly following randomisation.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 334 participants were randomised to one of four groups. No differences in depressive symptoms were evident at baseline. The results of latent growth modelling showed significant treatment effects in depressive symptoms for each active group compared with the WLC, with small effect sizes (ESs) in the community-based sample of participants. Treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Effect sizes were very large (eg, week 6 ES range=−2.34 to −2.52) when restricting the analysis only to participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>At-home exercise is a potent behaviour to improve mental health in adults during the pandemic, especially in those with increased levels of depressive symptoms. Promotion of at-home exercise may be a global public health target with important personal, social and economic implications as the world emerges scathed by the pandemic.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, fears of infection, economic hardship and global stay-at-home mandates were widely predicted to worsen mental health (ie, the disruption of psychological well-being), including depression, anxiety and general distress.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> The prediction has been borne out, with global rates of depression and anxiety reaching 28% and 26% during the pandemic, respectively.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Few studies have investigated whether global rates of mental health concerns actually changed from pre-COVID-19 to the pandemic period. In a national poll completed 1 month into the pandemic, 10% and 23% of Canadians reported that they had high or some levels of depression, respectively, an increase from 4% and 15% reported prior to the pandemic.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Twofold to threefold increases were also reported in the USA<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the UK<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in the early months of the pandemic compared with before the pandemic.</p>
              <p>Researchers and healthcare professionals promoted a wide range of approaches to maintain the mental health of all individuals during this pandemic, from actions individuals can take within their homes and outdoors, such as exercise, to assessment and treatment considerations that healthcare providers and institutions can implement.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> The WHO<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and global government agencies (eg, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and Public Health England)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> similarly recommended that the public engage in physical activity and exercise to attain and maintain mental health during the pandemic. These recommendations are supported by an extant literature providing compelling evidence for impactful prevention of<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and reductions in<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations following the adoption of physical activity programming. Many trials have also revealed the many neurobiological effects of long-term exercise in improving depressive symptoms.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Yet, with the mandated closure of fitness centres and outdoor recreation sites (eg, local and state/provincial parks) at the start of the pandemic, opportunities for engaging in healthy behaviours remained limited to one’s home for the most part.</p>
              <p>Our study tested whether completing exercise at home that required little physical space or equipment would lead to reductions in depressive symptoms among Canadian adults in the spring and summer of 2020. Depressive symptoms were chosen as the trial’s primary mental health outcome since loneliness/social isolation are strongly associated with depression<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> and since loneliness/social isolation were particularly anticipated due to prevailing public health physical distancing mandates implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Activities were completed with the use of a commercially available mobile application (app), with memberships provided free. Given that 88% of Canadians own smartphones<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and 94% of Canadians have home internet access, the use of a commercially available app that is both android and iOS compatible allowed us to test the effects of at-home exercise using app-based programs that are easily scalable to the public and widely implementable in the future, if effects are significant. The provision of free memberships and the minimal room or equipment required to complete the activities attended to some of the socioeconomic inequities that can result from at-home exercise during the pandemic, as highlighted by Sallis and colleagues.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
              <p>We partnered with a mobile application company, Down Dog (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.downdogapp.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.downdogapp.com</ext-link>), that has a suite of apps for a variety of activities that require little space or equipment. Two of the apps that were available for download at the start of the pandemic from Down Dog included whole body weight based high intensity interval training (HIIT) and yoga. Both HIIT<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and yoga<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> have been shown to be effective in improving depressive symptoms. Participants in the active groups received access to either the HIIT or yoga application or access to both applications for 6 weeks.</p>
              <p>The primary hypothesis of our pragmatic randomised clinical trial was that completing at-home HIIT and/or yoga with the use of a free mobile application will lead to significant declines in depressive symptoms in adults over a 6-week period compared with a waitlist control (WLC). We further explored whether the benefits were unique to or stronger for HIIT, yoga or their combination by comparing each group’s effects over time to one another. Finally, we tested whether the effects were more or less apparent in those with high depressive symptoms prerandomisation.</p>

                <p>The COvid-19 Pandemic and Exercise (COPE) trial was a parallel, multiarm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, with participants allocated randomly to one of four treatment groups: (1) HIIT, (2) yoga, (3) HIIT+yoga or (4) WLC.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Low active, English-speaking, Canadians aged 18–64 years, who were not retired at study entry and had access to the internet via a mobile device or computer were eligible to participate. Activity was assessed with the validated Stanford Leisure-Time Categorical Activity Item (L-CAT).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Those who scored between 1 and 3 on the L-CAT were eligible to participate since these scores represent low activity as prescribed by the American College of Sports Medicine.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Only individuals deemed capable of performing moderate intensity physical activity were eligible to participate, as assessed with the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) and, if necessary, further assessed with the Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination (ePARmed-X+).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Those hospitalised within the previous 3 months were not eligible, unless a note from their physician was provided stating their ability to participate.</p>
                <p>Participants from across Canada were recruited through social media advertisements, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, reaching 21 406 unique viewers and 2731 engaged in the advertisements through shares, clicks or likes. The advertisements directed participants to the study website that provided a summary of the purpose of the study and inclusion/exclusion criteria. If interested, they were invited to email the study team to schedule an eligibility screening phone call. A study team member completed the screening using a scripted interview with Qualtrics, where eligibility screening data were stored. On agreement, eligible and interested participants received two links by email: (1) to the Qualtrics-based consent form for electronic signature and (2) to the PAR-Q+. Interested participants who were not cleared for exercise based on the PAR-Q+ or the ePARmed-X+ were required to receive clearance from their family physician or our team’s study physician. Following clearance, all participants completed our Qualtrics-based survey to assess the primary outcome: depressive symptoms.</p>

                <p>Participants randomised to one of the three treatment groups received a free 3-month membership to the mobile application version from Down Dog to access the applicable programs according to group assignment (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental materials</xref> – Methods section for details about the app). Participants in the treatment groups were asked to complete a minimum 4 weekly 20 min sessions for 6 weeks. This accumulation was based on global recommendations to complete 75 min of high/vigorous intensity activity per week (equating to 150 min of moderate intensity activity).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Seventy-five minutes of high intensity activity (for the HIIT condition) was averaged up to 80 min to translate the guidelines to 4 weekly sessions of equal length for study purposes. To ensure equivalence of weekly accumulated activity across intervention conditions, we asked participants in the yoga and HIIT+yoga conditions to also engage in four 20 min sessions per week. WLC participants were asked to remain at the same activity level as during recruitment during the 6-week study and received the free 3-month membership to the yoga and HIIT apps after the 6 weeks. To ensure anonymity on the Down Dog platform, each participant received a participant ID that was preregistered by a study team member on the Down Dog platform. This also allowed us to track their weekly progress.</p>

                <title>Outcome</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, measured weekly from baseline to the end of the sixth week of the trial with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale (CESD).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Examples of items include, ‘I was bothered by things that usually don’t bother me’ and ‘I could not get going.’ Scores ranged between 0 (‘Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)’) and 3 (‘Most or all of the time (5–7 days)’). Sum scores were produced (potential range from 0 to 30 (sample range: 0 to 30)). A cut-off score of 10 or above is considered significant depressive symptoms in community samples.</p>

                <p>Using Optimal Design Software,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> 367 participants were required to detect a small effect size (ES) δ=0.30 based on a two-level curvilinear growth model with power (1 - b) set at 0.80 and alpha set at 0.05 for a seven time points repeated measures design with four groups. A 25% attrition was expected over 6 weeks, thus a sample size of 490 was considered to be sufficient for the trial.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and allocation</title>
                <p>Sequence generation for randomisation was completed using Excel. Each member of the recruiting team received an Excel book with multiple blocks of randomised groupings. All blocks contained one of each potential grouping and a randomly assigned number generated by the data manager (second author). The treatment groups within each block were then sorted by their randomised number, allowing for unique configurations within each block and the grouping hidden on the Excel sheet. A member of the study team would unhide the result of the randomisation and allocated the participants to their group once they had completed the baseline surveys. The data manager and principal investigator (PI) (first author) remained blind to the participants’ allocations throughout the trial. The PI was blind to all randomisation until all data were prepared for analysis and initial primary analysis was completed.</p>

                <title>Changes to the trial</title>
                <p>On 7 August 2020, study recruitment was terminated for several reasons. First, interest in the study dropped substantially in late June, potentially due to the fact that fitness centres across Canada started to open, as did parks. Second, we wanted to keep the time frame of recruitment narrow to maintain similarity across participants in terms of impact of the pandemic. Finally, while we were very conservative with our original expected ES, a small-to-medium ES of δ=0.40 or a medium ES of 0.50 could have as easily been expected based on previous meta-analyses,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 27</xref> requiring 209 and 134 participants, respectively, or 278 and 179, accounting for 25% attrition.

                <p>Means and SD, or number and percentages, were calculated for all continuous or categorical sociodemographic variables, respectively. Analyses of variance or χ<sup>2</sup> analyses were completed for the continuous and categorical factors, respectively, to compare group differences. Imputation, using random forest methods,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> was conducted for depression symptom score when the participant did not complete all items in the survey at any week (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental statistical approach</xref> for information on imputation procedures and survey items completion rates on <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>). All descriptive statistics, multiple imputation and visualisations were run using R Statistical software (V.4.0.2).</p>
                <p>All randomised participants were included in the intent-to-treat analysis using Mplus (V.7.2).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We adopted quadratic latent growth models<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> based on the framework of structural equation models to account for non-linear trends in CESD scores over the 6 weeks. See <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental materials</xref> – statistical approach section for more details of our analytic approach and the equations of the conditional quadratic latent growth models.</p>
                <p>To examine the treatment effects in depressive symptoms on the subpopulation with high depressive symptoms initially, we restricted the sample to participants with CESD scores of ≥10<sup>25</sup> and, due to poor model fit when including the quadratic term, we used free time scores of the slope growth factor for non-linear trends (Muthén and Muthén, p. 124).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The equations are similar to those used for the quadratic latent growth model, but only I and S were estimated, and S is freely estimated with specifying the first two time points to 0 and 1.</p>
                <p>For all analyses, we computed effect sizes at each week using Feingold’s approach,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> equivalent to Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental materials</xref> for additional details including <italic toggle="yes">Mplus code</italic>).

                <p>Sixty-two per cent, 64% and 75% of HIIT, yoga and HIIT+yoga participants, respectively, completed four or more sessions in the first week of the trial, with an additional 18%–29% completing between one and three workouts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Adherence decreased during the study. While the majority of yoga and HIIT+yoga group participants were still meeting the requested four sessions per week by the end of the trial, only 40% in the HIIT group met these activity levels.

Participants in the combination group consistently engaged in more mean exercise on a weekly basis (between 71 min and 86 min throughout the 6 weeks) than those in the yoga arm (between 69 min and 78 min) or HIIT (between 46 min and 64 min).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Significant treatment effects in depressive symptoms were observed for participants randomised to complete HIIT or yoga, or a combination of the two, at-home using a suite of mobile applications over a 6-week period compared with WLC participants. While WLC participants’ depressive symptoms remained steady throughout the 6-week period, those in the three active arms had significant declines, as hypothesised. ES at each week were small for all three active groups, with the greatest effects in the combination group. Effects were very large when the sample was restricted to those with high depressive symptoms prior to randomisation, again with the apparent largest effects in the combined HIIT+yoga group. These differences could be attributed to the higher number of HIIT+yoga participants who completed at least four weekly workouts throughout the study, and the fact that those in the combined group completed the most minutes of activity every week. Our results highlight that providing variety to participants in pragmatic clinical trials can lead to the greatest adherence with the largest effects. This is supported by experimental research that demonstrates that those who engage in greater varieties of exercises are most likely to report more sustained physical activity.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Our study reveals an impactful health behaviour in which adults, especially those with significant depressive symptoms, can engage that can potentially offer relief from the burden of the pandemic.</p>
              <p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, percentages of adults across the globe who were already insufficiently active were troublesome.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Prior to COVID-19 in Canada, only 18% of adults were physically active at recommended levels when measured with accelerometers.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Evidence suggests that these trends worsened during the early months of the pandemic, globally<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and within Canada.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This is not surprising given the mandated stay-at-home orders that were implemented across all of Canada and most of the globe in the early months of the pandemic (see ref <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> for a review of the timeline of restrictions in Canada during the first wave). A global call for action<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> prioritised at-risk groups (eg, frontline, low-paid, healthcare system workers, laid off adults and older adults) as intervention targets for physical activity programming to reduce risk and severity of infection with COVID-19. Not included in the call for action were those at wider risk for mental health issues, and recent studies are directing attention to individuals in different countries who are at risk for pandemic-related depression. In the UK, for example, adults aged 18–34 years, women and adults with children had the greatest increases in depression during the early months of COVID-19.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similar elevated risk to women and young adults was identified in the USA, as was to those who self-identified as Hispanic, had lower education levels, were not married or had more life stressors resulting from the pandemic (eg, financial/employment loss and COVID-19 related death of a family member).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In our study, the majority of participants were women (87%), nearly half were 18–39 years of age (47%) and had children at home (42%). Yet, a large majority would not be considered to have met significant economic or employment challenges, as many were employed. The extent to which exercise programming can specifically benefit adults with economic challenges remains unclear.</p>
              <p>There are several limitations to the current study. First, while our study sought to recruit equal numbers of women and men, men did not participate at the same rate as women, likely a result of yoga appealing mostly to women.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Second, we partnered with a company with commercially available mobile apps, which allowed us to evaluate the efficacy of app-delivered programs that can be delivered at scale. While potential scalability makes our findings important, the study was not designed to control the types, difficulty or lengths of activities. Thus, it is impossible to quantify the frequency, intensity, type or time spent in specific exercises for prescriptive and clinical purposes. A final limitation is all participants were asked to complete a minimum of four sessions/week at 20 min/session, so that the total weekly HIIT would meet global recommendations for vigorous exercise.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Yet, 80 weekly minutes of moderate activity, such as yoga, do not reach the recommended 150 min of moderate intensity activity. While global recommendations are set at 75 vigorous or 150 moderate intensity minutes of physical activity per week,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> there is considerable evidence suggesting that weekly physical activity even below recommended threshold levels is effective for many health issues,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> including depression.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
</p>
              <p>By 2030, the World Economic Forum projected that mental illness will account for US$6 trillion of the annual global economic burden, accounting for more than half the burden from all non-communicable diseases.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> With the increasing prevalence of global citizens with COVID-19 related depressive symptoms, the personal, social and economic burden can be expected to be even more far-reaching and devastating. The results from the current trial suggest that health officials should continue to promote exercise to the public,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> directing such promotion especially to those experiencing significant depressive symptoms, with the provision of low-cost or free exercise-based mobile applications to use at home as part of healthcare systems’ initiatives. Free eHealth mobile applications are effective in improving medication adherence and clinic attendance for non-communicable physical diseases, leading to substantial cost-effectiveness.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Perhaps, then, the free provision of exercise-based mobile applications, supported by healthcare systems, could be one method to help reduce the emerging global mental health crisis and its eventual economic burden.</p>
