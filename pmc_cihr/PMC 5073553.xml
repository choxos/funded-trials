                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will use a mixed-methods implementation science study design, including a prospective longitudinal interrupted time series study, to evaluate a CBE intervention with PLWH in Toronto, Canada. We will recruit PLWH who consider themselves medically stable and safe to participate in exercise. In the baseline phase (0–8 months), participants will be monitored bimonthly. In the intervention phase (8–14 months), participants will take part in a 24-week CBE intervention that includes aerobic, resistance, balance and flexibility exercise at the YMCA 3 times per week, with weekly supervision by a fitness instructor, and monthly educational sessions. In the follow-up phase (14–22 months), participants will be encouraged to continue to engage in unsupervised exercise 3 times per week. <italic>Quantitative assessment</italic>: We will assess cardiopulmonary fitness, strength, weight, body composition and flexibility outcomes followed by the administration of self-reported questionnaires to assess disability and contextual factor outcomes (coping, mastery, stigma, social support) bimonthly. We will use time series regression analysis to determine the level and trend of outcomes across each phase in relation to the intervention. <italic>Qualitative assessment</italic>: We will conduct a series of face-to-face interviews with a subsample of participants and recreation providers at initiation, midpoint and completion of the 24-week CBE intervention. We will explore experiences and anticipated benefits with exercise, perceived impact of CBE for PLWH and the strengths and challenges of implementing a CBE intervention. Interviews will be audio recorded and analysed thematically.</p>

              <p>As people living with HIV (PLWH) in resource-rich countries age, they are experiencing the health-related consequences of HIV.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–7</xref> In addition to morbidity resulting from HIV and associated treatments, many PLWH experience multimorbidity from cardiovascular disease, diabetes,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> bone and joint disorders,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> neurocognitive disorders<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and non-AIDS-defining cancers.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> These health-related consequences may be characterised as disability, including the physical, cognitive, mental and emotional symptoms and impairments, difficulties carrying out daily activities, uncertainty or worrying about future health and challenges to social inclusion for PLWH.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>As the burden of disability increases, so does the role for rehabilitation in the context of HIV.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Rehabilitation is broadly defined as any service or health intervention that may address or prevent disability.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Rehabilitation, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy, can mitigate disability associated with HIV and multimorbidity, such as fatigue, pain, cognitive impairments, body composition changes and employment challenges. Rehabilitation thus has the potential to improve health and quality of life for PLWH. However, access to rehabilitation services can be limited for those without private insurance or the ability to pay out of pocket for services.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> With few rehabilitation professionals adequately serving PLWH,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> individuals may use self-management strategies to deal with their daily health challenges.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>Exercise is a rehabilitation intervention and self-management strategy that can address disability and improve or sustain the health of PLWH.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Exercise is defined as any physical activity involving bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure including (but not limited to) aerobic, resistance, flexibility and neuromotor activity that go beyond activities of daily living to improve and maintain physical fitness and health.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although systematic reviews indicate that exercise is safe and can lead to benefits in cardiopulmonary fitness, strength, weight and body composition, and psychological status for PLWH,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–27</xref> the included studies focused on highly supervised interventions by physical therapists and exercise physiologists that can be costly and unsustainable for PLWH. Few PLWH engage in regular exercise or achieve recommended levels of physical activity.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–31</xref> Hence, it is essential to consider exercise interventions that are accessible and practical for PLWH to sustain over the long term.</p>
              <p>Community-based exercise (CBE) is one approach for enhancing the health of PLWH. CBE involves a group of individuals exercising under the supervision of a health or fitness instructor with the goal of promoting regular exercise in the community.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref> CBE can foster social interaction, support and encouragement to exercise,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref> and promote emotional, cognitive and behavioural self-management strategies to help PLWH independently manage health challenges associated with chronic conditions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, the impact of CBE when translated into the HIV community setting and its sustainability over the long term is unknown.</p>
              <p>Authors of a qualitative study identified factors to consider in the development and implementation of a CBE programme for people who experience the complexity of HIV and multimorbidity.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Building on this work, we developed and piloted a 4-month CBE intervention with 28 PLWH at the Toronto YMCA. Exercise prescription included a combination of aerobic, resistive, flexibility and balance exercise three times a week, supervision of exercise once weekly and monthly group education sessions.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Fifteen (54%) participants attended ≥40% of the weekly supervised sessions. Reasons for not attending the exercise sessions included challenges with scheduling, health status and lack of motivation. The CBE intervention was positively received by participants who completed the study.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> These results directly informed the refinement of the CBE intervention, recruitment strategy and data collection methods for this study protocol.</p>
              <p>Our aim is to evaluate a CBE intervention for PLWH within the community with the goal of reducing disability and enhancing health (cardiopulmonary, strength, weight and body composition, flexibility) and intrinsic and extrinsic factor outcomes (social support, stigma, mastery, coping) for PLWH.</p>
              <p>We will use the RE-AIM Framework to evaluate the CBE intervention. Derived from the field of Implementation Science, the RE-AIM Framework emphasises the importance of considering multiple aspects of an intervention beyond clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The Framework includes criteria to evaluate the impact and translation of an intervention at individual and organisational levels in order to promote uptake, transferability and ultimately enhance the public health impact of health promotion interventions.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Specific study objectives are: (1) to determine the extent to which adults with HIV participate in a CBE intervention (proportion of eligible individuals who consent, initiate and complete the intervention); (2) to assess the effect of a CBE intervention on (i) disability and health outcomes (physical (cardiopulmonary fitness, strength, weight, body composition and anthropometrics, flexibility), mental–emotional, cognitive health, daily function, social inclusion) and (ii) intrinsic and extrinsic factor outcomes (social support, stigma, mastery, coping) for PLWH; (3) to assess engagement in CBE for adults with HIV over time (adherence, level of physical activity); and (4) to evaluate the process (strengths and challenges; feasibility; accessibility, long-term sustainability) of implementing a CBE intervention within the community from the perspective of recreation providers (fitness instructors; managers) and PLWH.</p>

                <p>We will use an interrupted time series (ITS) design in combination with qualitative interviews to assess outcomes at baseline (pretesting phase), during the CBE intervention (intervention phase) and after the CBE intervention (post-testing phase) to evaluate the short-term and long-term effect of CBE. In an ITS study design, ‘data are collected at multiple instances over time before and after an intervention (interruption) to detect whether the intervention has an effect significantly greater than the underlying secular trend’.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> We did not choose a randomised control trial given that the benefits of exercise are well known; rather what remains unclear is the long-term durability effect of exercise over time, and the optimal implementation of a CBE intervention for PLWH. Thus, a single-group ITS study design will allow us to evaluate how community-based interventions are translated into, and influenced by, a real-world setting.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> As per the RE-AIM Framework, we are particularly interested in assessing the long-term impact of exercise, the ability to integrate CBE into the community and the ability of PLWH to integrate exercise into their daily lives over time.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Using qualitative methods in combination with ITS to evaluate effectiveness will enable us to determine the impact of the intervention as perceived by PLWH and provide insight into the personal and environmental factors that may influence the benefits of exercise and its implementation into the HIV community.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> See online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file 1</xref> for the WHO Trial Registration Data Set.</p>

                  <p>The HIV CBE intervention is a 24-week exercise programme at the Central Toronto YMCA. The intervention is derived from high-quality research evidence on the effectiveness of exercise with PLWH, recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> qualitative consultation with community (PLWH and fitness instructors),<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> pilot work<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and existing HIV rehabilitation services in the UK,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> collectively adapted for the Canadian context. We chose a 6-month CBE duration because it aligns with transtheoretical model evidence on the stages of behaviour change whereby the ‘action’ of practicing a new behaviour (exercise) lasts up to 24 weeks followed by the ‘maintenance’ stage during which commitment to sustaining the new behaviour (self-monitored exercise) is solidified.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> This intervention is based on a chronic illness and self-management approach to engaging PLWH in exercise.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The intervention will include: framing exercise in the broader context of health through educational sessions; providing participants with the opportunity to choose activities of interest to enhance engagement and adherence to exercise; problem-solving support where participants will have access to staff to assist with goal setting and overcoming barriers to exercise; and communication among participants, fitness instructors and study staff to ensure participants receive feedback on their progress and goal attainment.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p>
                  <p>Prior to the intervention, fitness instructors will take part in <italic>realize's</italic> (formally CWGHR's) online interprofessional learning course Rehabilitation in the Context of HIV, and an education session on HIV, rehabilitation and exercise for PLWH.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Participants will meet one-on-one with a fitness instructor to assess their goals and establish an individualised exercise programme that will include a combination of aerobic, resistive, neuromotor and flexibility training.</p>
                  <p>Aerobic exercise will include physical activity 3 days/week (frequency) at 60–70% heart rate maximum (intensity) for at least 30 min (time) with a variety of types of activity based on participant choice (type). Resistance exercise will include strength training for each major muscle group ∼8–10 exercises (type) 3 days/week (frequency) at 60–70% 1 repetition maximum (intensity) with 10–12 repetitions each (time). Flexibility exercise will include stretching major muscle–tendon groups in a static stretch for 10–30 s each with two repetitions. Neuromotor exercise will include a range of activities focused on motor skills (eg, balance, agility, coordination and gait) for ∼20–30 min.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To achieve these exercise elements, participants will engage in a combination of individual exercise (eg, weight circuit training, endurance treadmill walking/jogging, stationary bike, swimming) and group-based exercise in the form of a class (eg, circuit training, spinning, yoga, aerobics, dancing). The combination of group and individual exercise will ensure that the intervention will be tailored to the individual, while promoting efficacy and social support that come from group activity.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Note that, in this study, we adopt a ‘guided adaptation’ approach whereby the intervention may be adapted based on the ongoing assessment of the needs and ability of participants by the fitness instructor.</p>
                  <p>Participants will attend exercise sessions for ∼1.5 hours, three times per week for 24 weeks. Sessions will be supervised weekly by a fitness instructor who will monitor participant progress, adjust exercise intensity, and complete a coaching log after each weekly session.

                <p><italic>Objective 2 (Effectiveness)—To assess the effectiveness of the CBE intervention</italic>: We will use a combination of an ITS analysis and qualitative interviews. ITS analyses assess the effectiveness of an intervention by comparing the level (intercept) and the pattern of pretest responses (baseline), with a pattern of post-test responses (postintervention). An effect is demonstrated when there is a change in the level or slope (trend) of the interruption or post-treatment responses when compared with the pretest responses. We will assess disability and health outcomes bimonthly at baseline (0–8 months), during intervention (8–14 months) and postintervention (14–22 months) for a total of 12 time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013618F1">figure 1</xref>). We will use a questionnaire to ask participants whether they experienced any life events or illnesses since the last assessment that may have had an impact on their ability to engage in exercise. We will also conduct a series of face-to-face interviews with a subsample of 15 PLWH participants at initiation (8 months), midpoint (11 months) and completion (14 months) of the 24-week CBE intervention.</p>
                <p>We will use the Episodic Disability Framework to inform the dimensions of health and disability against which to assess the impact of CBE, including dimensions of disability (physical, cognitive, mental and emotional symptoms and impairments, difficulties carrying out day-to-day activities, challenges to social inclusion and uncertainty about future health) and extrinsic and intrinsic contextual factors (social support, stigma, living strategies and personal attributes) that may exacerbate or alleviate dimensions of disability.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Using this Framework to inform our quantitative and qualitative assessment of CBE will promote consideration of not only health and disability outcomes but also the influence that contextual factors may have on the effect of, and engagement in, exercise.</p>

We will explore anticipated concerns regarding engagement in exercise prior to the intervention (initiation, 8 months), insights on the strengths and challenges of the CBE implementation and uptake (midpoint, 11 months) and reflections (post, 14 months) on the overall process of implementing the intervention with fidelity in a community setting immediately postintervention. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we will specifically explore the (1) strengths and challenges of implementing the CBE intervention, (2) accessibility and feasibility of the intervention and (3) potential for long-term sustainability of the programme. The interview guide will be revised over the course of the three qualitative time points of the study. All interviews will be audio recorded and later transcribed verbatim.

              <p>We will describe participant characteristics using descriptive statistics.</p>
              <p><italic>Objective 1 (Reach):</italic> We will report descriptive statistics for individuals who express interest to participate in the CBE intervention. For proportion, we will obtain an estimate based on the total number of eligible PLWH from the recruitment sites. For representativeness, we will assess the characteristics of participants who engage in the programme in relation to the broader HIV community comparing the sample to epidemiological data available in Toronto, Canada.<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref> We will report the descriptive statistics for individuals who are eligible and agree to participate, participants who withdraw from the programme and the reasons for withdrawal over time. We will also document the duration of time between participants' consent to participate to initiation of the study to document any delays that may occur due to capacity at the YMCA. We will assess differences in characteristics of those who complete versus withdraw from the intervention using independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests.</p>
              <p><italic>Objective 2 (Effectiveness): Disability and health status</italic>: We will calculate descriptive statistics as frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and means and SDs (normally distributed data) and medians and IQRs (non-normally distributed data) for continuous variables across all time points. We will assess the distribution of domain and total scores pre-CBE and post-CBE intervention as well as change scores. We will calculate the proportion of items at the floor or ceiling of the scales in order to determine floor or ceiling effects, respectively.</p>
              <p><italic>Quantitative analysis (ITS)</italic>: We will compare patterns of responses to the health and disability outcomes for the sample population at baseline (0–8 months), intervention (8–14 months) and postintervention (14–22 months) phases using time series regression analysis.<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> (1) We will graph the mean and SD scores for all health and disability outcomes taken bimonthly to determine the structure or trend of the data. (2) We will test for the presence of autocorrelation (extent to which the data are dependent on each other) using the Durbin-Watson statistic.<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref> (3) If present, then we will adjust for autocorrelation. We will use the Prais-Winston estimator, which uses the generalised least-squares method<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref> to determine regression estimates that express the level (value of outcome at the beginning of a segment; intercept) and trend (rate of change of outcome; slope) of the outcomes across each phase in the series in relation to the intervention. We will adjust for seasonality of exercise using dummy variables to define seasons. We will specifically determine the slope and 95% CI for each phase and significance in the change in slope. We will evaluate each comparison separately (baseline to intervention; intervention to postintervention) to determine the effect of CBE.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref> Regression coefficients corresponding to two standardised effect sizes will be obtained for each comparison: a change in level (also called ‘step change’) and a change in trend before and after the intervention. A change in level is defined as the difference between the observed level at the first intervention time point and that predicted by the preintervention time trend, and a change in trend is defined as the difference between postintervention and preintervention slopes.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS statistical software (SAS Computer Software 9.3 [program], 2011).</p>
              <p><italic>Objective 3 (Maintenance): Physical activity</italic>: We will calculate median (IQR) change scores of the RAPA questionnaire across all time points. We will also calculate median and IQR steps, distance and calories burned as measured by the Fitbit at each time point. We will define maintenance as the ability to sustain similar RAPA scores (highly correlated ≥0.7) postintervention. <italic>Adherence</italic>: Using the weekly exercise log, we will measure adherence to exercise over the intervention and self-monitoring phases. We will calculate the proportion of exercise sessions attended. Adherence will be defined as engaging in 75% or more of the three weekly exercise sessions throughout.<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref> In order to align with definitions of adherence derived specifically with PLWH, we will additionally determine how many participants engage in ≥40% of the exercise sessions.<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref> We will also calculate the proportion of participants who achieved the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (CPAG) of moderate to vigorous activity of at least 150 min a week for each of the study weeks, and the proportion of weeks in which the majority of participants achieved the CPAG guidelines.<xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref> We will calculate the median number of days per week participants achieved 20–30 min of physical activity, and the proportion of participants who achieved a minimum of 3 days per week of at least 20 min of physical activity. We will additionally test for associations between adherence and health and disability outcomes.</p>
              <p><italic>Objective 2 (Effectiveness) and Objective 4 (Implementation and adoption): Qualitative data analysis</italic>: We will use content analysis methods to explore perceptions of PLWH participants on the impact of the CBE intervention (objective 2) and perceptions of PLWH participants and recreation providers on the process of implementing the CBE intervention and its long-term sustainability (objective 4).<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref> We will analyse the transcripts cross-sectionally (at each time point) as well as longitudinally to identify changes in participant perceptions over time.<xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref> All transcripts will be analysed using line-by-line coding and codes clustered into broader categories.<xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref> When all interview data are analysed, we will formulate a summary of perceived impact and the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic contextual factors on exercise behaviour (objective 2) and strengths and challenges associated with the CBE intervention and recommendations for long-term implementation in the community (objective 4). We will use NVivo software to facilitate analysis (NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Version 7 [program]: QSR International Pty. Ltd, 2006). We will review and refine findings with the Community Advisory Committee. The quantitative and qualitative data pertaining to effectiveness (objective 2) will be analysed separately but concurrently and will be combined at the point of interpretation with the Advisory Committee.</p>
              <p><italic>Objective 4 (Assessing the CBE implementation)</italic>: The research team and Community Advisory Committee will meet throughout all phases of the project (start-up, recruitment, intervention and data collection, analysis and knowledge translation) to assess the process (strengths, challenges and recommendations for revision) related to the recruitment strategy, eligibility screening process, CBE implementation, retention in the study and outcome assessment. During teleconference and face-to-face team meetings, these discussions will be formally documented.</p>

For a model of 12 time points, to detect level and trend change, assuming an effect size of 1, equal preintervention and postintervention time periods, statistical significance p&lt;0.05 and an autoregression error time series model with lag 1, and autocorrelation estimate of 0.3, we would expect a power of 0.80.<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref><xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref> We will aim to recruit ∼120 PLWH with the goal for 75 participants to complete the study, the number of recommended observations in ITS to achieve acceptable variability of the estimates at each time point.<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref> This is due to the observed ∼60% retention rate observed in the pilot study (4 months)<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and was determined as feasible for the YMCA to accommodate administering the fitness assessments and providing weekly coaching during the intervention phase. The retention rate in the pilot study is higher than observed in other HIV-related exercise programmes;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> nevertheless, our sample size is limited to the capacity of participants the YMCA is able to accommodate for the fitness assessments and coaching. This is a feasible sample to recruit representing &lt;10% of the total number of clients served at Toronto PWA (n∼1000), Casey House (n∼180) and community organisations such as <italic>realize</italic>. Given the increased length of the study compared to the pilot, we may recruit an additional wave of participants if required.</p>
                <p><italic>Qualitative interviews</italic>: We will recruit a subsample of 15 PLWH who engaged in the CBE intervention and 5 fitness instructors and managers involved in the intervention to participate in 3 interviews.

The membership will be provided in two waves. The first membership will be for 6 months (intervention phase) and the second membership will be for 8 months (postintervention phase). Participants will be able to keep the Fitbit wireless activity monitor provided at the initiation of the intervention. Participants and recreation providers who complete the interview sessions will receive a $25 e-gift card at the end of each interview.</p>
              <p><italic>Potential risks and benefits</italic>: It is possible that participants will experience injury with exercise and the physical assessments. If this does occur, fitness staff from the YMCA will follow appropriate emergency procedures (in accordance with the YMCA general safety procedures and guidelines). It is also possible that participants may find some of the questions on the questionnaires to be personal or sensitive in nature. If participants experience any form of physical injury or emotional distress, investigators will refer participants to their physician, qualified counsellor or local community support group, if available. Finally, given the individual and group nature of the CBE intervention, and the monthly self-management information sessions, it is possible that participants may feel a loss of privacy related to participating in the YMCA programmes on site. During the consent process, we will indicate to participants that all individuals involved in this study, including other participants, researchers, knowledge users, and the fitness instructors and assessment staff at the YMCA, will know that participants in this study are HIV positive.</p>

              <p>Results will lead to the first known HIV-specific CBE intervention in Canada evaluated for effectiveness and successful translation with the HIV community. This research involves a partnership between the YMCA and HIV community that will facilitate the successful translation of CBE into the community while building capacity about HIV in the broader fitness sector.</p>
              <p>Strengths of our approach include an intervention based on a self-management and health promotion approaches to engaging PLWH in exercise that is less costly in contrast to earlier interventions, where participants followed highly structured, prescriptive protocols with less input into the type of exercise activity.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The 6-month CBE intervention and 8-month follow-up will surpass 3-month interventions commonly assessed in existing evidence, allowing us to evaluate the long-term impact of CBE and retention of benefits. Potential challenges will include recruitment and retention of participants across the 22-month study and potential burden of quantitative and qualitative assessments. Ongoing collaboration with community partners, including the YMCA, will be critical throughout. Overall, if deemed successful, this intervention may be transferable to other geographic regions where partnerships between community-based HIV organisations and fitness centres could enhance exercise and health promotion for PLWH.</p>
