                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>People experiencing homelessness suffer from poor outcomes after hospitalisation due to systemic barriers to care, suboptimal transitions of care, and intersecting health and social burdens. Case management programmes have been shown to improve housing stability, but their effects on broad posthospital outcomes in this population have not been rigorously evaluated. The Navigator Programme is a Critical Time Intervention case management programme that was developed to help homeless patients with their postdischarge needs and to link them with community-based health and social services. This randomised controlled trial examines the impact of the Navigator Programme on posthospital outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness.</p>

                  <p>This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of the Navigator Programme at an urban academic teaching hospital and an urban community teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada. Six hundred and forty adults experiencing homelessness who are admitted to the hospital will be randomised to receive support from a Homeless Outreach Counsellor for 90 days after hospital discharge or to usual care. The primary outcome is follow-up with a primary care provider (physician or nurse practitioner) within 14 days of hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes include postdischarge mortality or readmission, number of days in hospital, number of emergency department visits, self-reported care transition quality, and difficulties meeting subsistence needs. Quantitative outcomes are being collected over a 180-day period through linked patient-reported and administrative health data. A parallel mixed-methods process evaluation will be conducted to explore intervention context, implementation and mechanisms of impact.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>More than 235 000 Canadians experience homelessness annually, of which 27% are women, 19% are youth, and a growing number are identifying as racial, ethnic, sexual and gender minorities.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> This population experiences disproportionate intersecting physical, mental and social burdens that greatly increase morbidity and mortality relative to the general population.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> For example, rates of acute and chronic physical health problems, trauma, mental illness and substance use are much higher among homeless adults.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref></p>
                <p>Homeless individuals often experience substantial barriers to obtaining healthcare and frequently suffer from unmet health needs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> Many have other immediate competing priorities such as securing food and shelter that preclude consistent engagement with healthcare services.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Homeless individuals are also much less likely to have a primary care provider (PCP) or usual source of care compared with the general population.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Lack of primary care likely contributes to poor outcomes among the homeless population, given that access to primary care is associated with lower mortality and reductions in unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Indeed, there is abundant evidence suggesting that homeless adults rely heavily on acute care services, and rates of ED visits and hospitalisations are much higher among homeless versus non-homeless adults.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> A related problem is the high rate of hospital readmissions among homeless adults.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19 22 23</xref> Many of these readmissions are thought to be potentially preventable with more complete treatment and better coordination of health and social services following hospital discharge.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> In the general population, timely access to primary care follow-up after hospitalisation has been consistently associated with lower rates of readmissions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> Qualitative studies have also revealed that homeless individuals face unique challenges following discharge from hospital, such as difficulties storing medication, inability to find shelter and not being provided appropriate discharge instructions.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref> Altogether, systemic barriers to primary care, competing priorities and poor care transitions all contribute towards poor posthospital outcomes and reliance on acute care settings among homeless individuals.</p>
                <p>Case management is a core component of care for homeless individuals, serving to help navigate and coordinate health and social services.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Such programmes have been adapted and implemented for several subgroups of homeless individuals, including frequent users of acute healthcare services and those with complex needs and mental illness.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33–35</xref> Systematic reviews have found that case management is effective in improving housing stability, reducing substance use and removing barriers to securing employment in this population.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 36</xref> However, few studies have rigorously evaluated the effect of case management on broad posthospital outcomes among homeless patients overall.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> One randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a combined transitional housing, long-term housing and case management intervention reported reductions in hospitalisations, number of hospital days and ED visits among homeless adults with chronic illnesses.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Another more recent RCT of a combined permanent supportive housing and case management intervention found significant reductions in psychiatric ED visits and increases in use of outpatient mental health services.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, these studies could not evaluate the independent effects of multiple intervention components and did not assess other posthospital or patient-reported outcomes. One RCT of a physician-led model of multidisciplinary care coordination, advocacy and hospital discharge planning found a significant increase in quality of life and reduction in street homelessness, but the intervention had no effect on length of hospital stay or postdischarge acute care utilisation.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> However, the study was underpowered with low recruitment and follow-up rates. A smaller RCT of a Critical Time Intervention (CTI) case management programme focused specifically on homeless patients with severe mental illness was found to improve continuity of care, prevent homelessness and reduce psychiatric readmissions following hospital discharge.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40–42</xref></p>
                <p>Accordingly, this current RCT seeks to investigate the effectiveness of an adapted CTI case management programme—the Navigator Programme—in improving posthospital outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness at an urban academic teaching hospital and an urban community teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada. CTI is a time-limited case management programme which delivers focused case management at critical times or situations in the lives of clients, such as transitioning from hospital care to community care.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The Navigator Programme features Homeless Outreach Counsellors (HOCs)—whose roles are to create strong links between community services and patients through regular contact, supporting patients in following their postdischarge care plans, and helping patients in meeting their health-related and social-related competing priorities. This intervention was informed by a recent prospective cohort study conducted at the urban academic teaching hospital, which found that having an active case manager, sending discharge summaries to PCPs, and informal support were associated with reduced readmissions among homeless adults.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The first HOC position was created in February 2019 and has since been expanded to two positions and adapted through conversations with community partners and hospital staff. Ultimately, the goal of the Navigator Programme is to help homeless patients who are discharged from the hospital overcome systemic barriers and discontinuities in care that often result in poor health and high acute care utilisation.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>This RCT seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Navigator Programme in improving posthospital outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness. It will specifically evaluate outcomes related to PCP follow-up, acute care utilisation, difficulties meeting subsistence needs, care transition and overall health following hospital discharge.</p>
                <p>A detailed mixed-methods process evaluation will be conducted alongside the RCT. This evaluation primarily aims to provide a deeper understanding of intervention implementation, mechanisms of change within the intervention and the way in which the Navigator Programme interacts with the internal and external contexts to influence both implementation and RCT outcomes in expected or unexpected ways.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> This evaluation will also aim to understand the in-hospital and postdischarge experiences of participants in the intervention and control arms, exploring differences and similarities qualitatively. It is important to investigate how RCT outcomes are shaped by intervention implementation or by the intervention itself, and to identify which parts of the Navigator Programme did or did not work to achieve the intended goals and why.</p>

                <title>Design and setting</title>
                <p>This study is a pragmatic RCT that is being conducted at an urban academic teaching hospital (St. Michael’s Hospital) and an urban community teaching hospital (St. Joseph’s Health Centre) in Toronto, Canada.

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>To be eligible for the study, patients must meet the following criteria: (1) be 18 years of age or older, (2) be admitted to any medical or surgical service (excluding psychiatry and obstetrics) and (3) be identified as experiencing homelessness (as per the Canadian definition of homelessness) at the time of admission or anytime during the hospital admission.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) are unable to provide informed consent or (2) were connected with a HOC prior to the initiation of the RCT and have received services from the HOC within 90 days preceding their current admission. Each individual patient can be randomised only once during the study period. Patients admitted to psychiatric and obstetric services are excluded from this study because optimal immediate postdischarge follow-up for these patients should be with specialists rather than with PCPs.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> Furthermore, recommended follow-up time frames for these patients are often longer than 14 days, thus rendering the primary outcome inapplicable.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and data collection</title>
                <p>Clinical or research staff will identify potential participants on weekdays. Once identified, the patient will be asked by a member of their circle of care for permission to be introduced to the research team. The research team will then confirm patient eligibility and explain the purpose, process, risks and benefits of the study to potential participants. Participants may choose to enrol in the study by providing written informed consent (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>A baseline interview will be conducted with participants prior to randomisation and as a soon as possible after admission to the hospital on confirmation of eligibility. Sociodemographic information will be collected, including age, gender, race, indigenous identity, education level, housing status and social service utilisation. Participants who complete the baseline interview will receive a $C20 gift card to compensate them for their time. Another 30-day interview will take place at least 30 days (but no longer than 50 days) after the discharge date to assess patient-reported posthospital outcomes. At this time, the research team will contact PCPs to ascertain any follow-up visits. Baseline and 30-day interviews will be conducted in person or remotely. Data from interviews will be collected with tablets using electronic surveys hosted by Snap Professional Software.</p>
                <p>The research team will also undertake a chart review of hospital records after discharge to ascertain characteristics of the admission, information about discharge, participant health information and history of alcohol and substance use.</p>

                <title>Plans to promote continued participation</title>
                <p>Several strategies will be implemented to minimise attrition. At the baseline interview, study participants will be asked to provide detailed contact information, as well as the names and contact information of family, friends and other service providers who may be contacted if the research team cannot reach the participant directly. In addition to active outreach from the research team, participants will be asked to contact the research team after discharge to schedule a 30-day interview. Participants who contact the research team 2–3 weeks following their discharge to confirm their contact information and schedule the 30-day interview will receive an additional $C10 honorarium on completion of the interview. Participants who complete the 30-day interview will also receive a $C40 honorarium and reimbursement for any travel-related expenses, when applicable, for the interview.</p>

The programme will assign participants to either the intervention or the usual care arm using permuted-block randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation ratio and random permuted block sizes of 6 or 8. This process will maintain balanced group sizes between the intervention and usual care arms at intermediate points in the recruitment process and minimise the possibility of the research team predicting study allocation.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Participants randomised to the intervention arm will be assigned to work with an HOC. The HOC will connect with participants as early as possible during the admission and will provide support for 90 days after hospital discharge. The period of support may occasionally be extended beyond 90 days for certain patients, if the HOC deems this to be necessary and appropriate. The main role of the HOC is to support continuity and comprehensiveness of care by helping participants follow their postdischarge plans and facilitating strong links with community-based health and social services. Day-to-day HOC activities fall into five main categories: (1) making connections and referrals to community-based providers, (2) supporting and advocating for patients during the hospital stay and discharge process, (3) supporting patients with health-related matters during the postdischarge period, (4) supporting patients with social-related matters during the postdischarge period and (5) transferring patient-related information to other healthcare and community-based providers (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The intensity and types of support from HOCs will be tailored to the specific needs of the individual.</p>

                <title>Usual care</title>
                <p>Participants in the usual care arm will be discharged without support from the HOCs. However, all participants will still receive support as usual from Care Transition Facilitators (CTFs) and/or social workers. CTFs and social workers help patients during their hospital stay to arrange discharge plans and make follow-up arrangements. However, unlike HOCs, CTFs and social workers do not typically work with patients after hospital discharge.</p>
                <p>The typical discharge process involves counselling from the discharging physician and healthcare team, who make recommendations or appointments for follow-up care as needed. Patients will also be provided with a written discharge summary and prescription(s) as needed. If the patient has an identified PCP, a copy of the discharge summary is emailed to the PCP.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome is follow-up with a PCP (physician or nurse practitioner) within 14 days of hospital discharge. This outcome was chosen given the unique and substantial barriers to primary care access faced by the homeless population and the fact that timely access to primary care after hospitalisation is linked to better outcomes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 50</xref> In-person visits, virtual encounters and phone calls will all be considered as follow-up with a PCP. The primary outcome will be ascertained through participant self-report at the 30-day interview, phone calls to PCP offices, and verification in the OHIP and Community Health Center Databases at ICES. In the event of discrepancies between these sources of information, we will use prespecified rules to adjudicate the primary outcome (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Several other outcomes will be assessed given the multiple potential effects that are expected from this complex intervention.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Secondary outcomes include a composite measure of all-cause mortality or readmission, total number of days spent in hospital postdischarge, and number of ED visits within 30 days, 90 days and 180 days postdischarge. Acute care utilisation (readmissions and days in hospital) outcomes will not include labour and delivery visits and planned readmissions. If a patient is transferred between services within the hospital, the entire hospital stay will be treated as a single admission. Other secondary outcomes include self-reported quality of care transition (three-item Care Transitions Measure) after hospital discharge and self-reported change in difficulties meeting subsistence needs (RAND Course of Homelessness Scale) at the time of the 30-day interview relative to baseline.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 51</xref> Exploratory outcomes include change in health status (EQ-5D-3L; European Quality of Life - Five Dimension - Three Levels) at the time of the 30-day interview relative to baseline, change in quality of life (EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale) at the time of the 30-day interview relative to baseline, leaving against medical advice at discharge, medication adherence (eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale) at the time of the 30-day interview, connection to a case manager in the community at the time of the 30-day interview, attendance of any non-PCP healthcare appointment within 180 days postdischarge, and time to all-cause mortality or readmission after discharge.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52 53</xref> Only non-PCP appointments made by the time of discharge and documented in the discharge summary will be assessed for attendance.

                <p>No previous data are available to ascertain 14-day PCP follow-up rates after hospitalisation among people experiencing homelessness under usual care. However, a previous study reported that 14-day PCP follow-up rates after hospitalisation among low socioeconomic status (SES) patients was ~48%.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> An assumption was made that 14-day PCP follow-up rates after hospitalisation among people experiencing homelessness under usual care is around 2/3 that of low-SES patients (32%). This study is powered to detect an effect size of 12%, equivalent to a 37.5% increase in relative rate of follow-up with a PCP within 14 days of discharge. With an α of 0.05, 256 participants per study arm will result in an 80% power to test the study hypothesis. Given an estimated 20% attrition rate based on past studies in this population,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> a total of 640 participants will be recruited for this study.</p>

                <p>It will not be possible to blind participants, HOCs, or healthcare teams given the active and collaborative nature of the intervention. However, data collectors and data analysts will be blinded to the allocation of participants.

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Sample characteristics will be summarised by descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, IQR and proportion). We will also construct graphs to explore relationships and estimate correlations between participant characteristics and outcomes. Descriptive comparisons between group baseline characteristics and outcomes will be performed with χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and with t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous or count variables.</p>
                <p>The primary analysis will be performed using the χ<sup>2</sup> test to compare two independent proportions of 14-day PCP follow-up. The difference in proportions (risk difference, RD) and 95% CI will be estimated using the Wald method.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Two secondary analyses will be conducted. The first is a log-binomial regression model including the intervention arm indicator as the covariate. The risk ratio and 95% CI will be estimated from the model. The second is a logistic regression model including the intervention arm indicator as the covariate. The OR and 95% CI will be estimated from the model. To explore potential subgroup effects, multivariable logistic regression models for the primary outcome will be constructed including each of the following prespecified covariates, one-at-a-time and with corresponding interaction terms with the intervention arm: age, sex, current illicit drug use, current risky alcohol use, Charlson Comorbidity Index score and prior acute care utilisation for a mental health reason.</p>
                <p>For secondary and exploratory binary outcomes, logistic regression models will be used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs. For count outcomes, Poisson or negative binomial regression models (if overdispersion is suggested by the data) will be used to estimate rate ratios and 95% CIs. For cross-sectional continuous outcomes, linear regression models will be constructed. For longitudinal continuous outcomes, we will consider linear mixed models or generalised estimating equations, depending on the outcome distribution. Models will include the intervention arm indicator, time (baseline vs 30-day interview), and the interaction of intervention arm by time. A significant interaction will indicate that the change from baseline is different between the study groups. This difference and 95% CI will be estimated. For time to all-cause mortality or readmission after discharge, a survival analysis will be performed. Cumulative event rates will be calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, with event or censoring times calculated from the date of discharge. Differences in Kaplan-Meier survival curves between the study arms will be assessed using the log-rank test.</p>
                <p>Any missing data will be considered, and multiple imputation will be performed if indicated either for the main analyses or as sensitivity analyses.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> All analyses will be conducted using R version 4.1.2, STATA version 16 and SAS version 9.4. All statistical tests will be two-sided and a p value of 0.05 or less will indicate statistical significance. Adjustments will not be conducted for multiple comparisons.

                <title>Process evaluation methods and analysis</title>
                <p>In keeping with recommendations from the Medical Research Council on Process Evaluations of Complex Interventions,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> we have designed a pragmatic mixed-methods process evaluation that will gather quantitative measures on programme activities and qualitative data on how participants experience the intervention and how staff experience its implementation and operationalisation. Three domains will be explored in this evaluation: implementation, mechanisms of impact and context. Multiple data collection methods will be employed to better understand intervention implementation, mechanisms of change and important contextual influences on the Navigator Programme. These methods and their corresponding process evaluation domains, research questions and data sources are outlined in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>, and include chart review, non-participant observation (NPO), semistructured interviews and field notes. Chart review will include data on the number and nature of interactions between HOCs and participants, community service providers and healthcare team, collected from a database developed specifically for the Navigator Programme. NPO is a process of observing participants and the programme setting without actively participating, and can be helpful for assessing the finer details and spirit of implementation, mechanisms of change and programme activities and contexts.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> In this study, NPO will entail accompanying the HOCs as they do their day-to-day work at the hospital and in the community. Semistructured interviews will be conducted with the HOCs (n=2), the implementation team (n=4), hospital physicians and staff (n=25–50), community service providers (n=10–20) that interact with the Navigator Programme, and individuals experiencing homelessness enrolled in the study in both the intervention (n=15–25) and control arms (n=15–25).</p>
