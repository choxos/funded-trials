                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">This article outlines the protocol for a trial to test the effectiveness of a nature-based intervention called <italic>Open Sky School</italic> to reduce mental health problems among elementary school children. Experimental studies show that contact with nature (e.g. walks in parks) improve mental health. A growing number of teachers have been applying outdoor education within the regular school curriculum and evidence suggests that such teaching methods could improve students’ mental health but a randomized controlled trial has never been conducted.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A two-arm clustered randomized controlled trial will be conducted in elementary schools across Québec, Canada. Following informed consent by teachers, parents and students, schools will be randomly assigned 1:1 to the intervention or the control group with a total of 2500 5-6<sup>th</sup> grade students and 100 teachers expected to participate. The intervention will take place outdoors in a green-space (2 h per week for 12 weeks) and include a toolkit of 30 activities to foster well-being (e.g. mindfulness) and academic competencies (e.g. mathematics). Questionnaires will be administered to teachers and students before, immediately after and 3 months after the intervention. The primary outcome will be reductions of mental health problems in children from pre-to-post test (Social Behavior Questionnaire: self and teacher reports). Secondary outcomes include depression, positive and negative affect, nature connectedness, and pro-environmental behaviors among children. We will explore, immediate benefits on teacher’s well-being and positive and negative affect and sustained benefits among students at 3 months follow-up. For the primary outcome, we will explore moderators including child’s sex, child’s disability status, the green-space of neighbourhoods, the school’s socio-economic position and teacher’s experience.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Mounting evidence indicates that spending time in nature can be beneficial for mental health for individuals of all ages (e.g., to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Indeed, large epidemiological studies have reported an association between residing in an area with a high density of green vegetation and mental health. For instance, a recent Danish study including over 900,000 children suggested that proximity to green space in childhood was associated with a lower onset of psychiatric disorders later in life, independently from other known risk factors such as the family socioeconomic status and parents’ psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A double-blind, controlled, within-subject study carried out among children aged 7 to 12 years diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder also suggested that walks lasting 20 min in urban parks reduced sustained attention difficulties more than walking in town or in the streets around their residence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Large effect sizes were observed (0.52 and 0.77 respectively), which were comparable to the effect of psychostimulant medication. In addition to health benefits, spending time in nature during childhood is known to increase nature connectedness and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. This would be because when children spend time enjoying nature, they tend to feel more connected to the environment and become more likely to engage in behaviors to protect it as a result e.g. recycling, volunteering for pro-environmental causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As such, increasing time spent in nature at school could be a highly accessible way cultivate children’s pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors while also reducing mental health problems. Accessible interventions capable of reducing mental health problems in children are also particularly timely given numerous reports suggesting worsening levels of mental health among youth since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and increasing preoccupations for climate change among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While the practice of outdoor education (e.g. teaching the standard curriculum off campus) has been increasingly encouraged in education, including in Canada, where a rising number of teachers practice outdoor education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the effectiveness of such practices in reducing mental health problems has never been tested with a robust randomized-control trial design.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We are nevertheless aware of two quasi-experimental studies that tested the effectiveness of education outside the classroom applied directly within the school curriculum in reducing mental health problems among students. The first study was carried out in Sweden with children aged 6 to 12 years (<italic>n</italic> = 230) and used a non-equivalent quasi-experimental design to assess whether daily teaching outside (e.g., in the schoolyard) for 6 months reduced symptoms of mental disorders, in comparison with usual indoor education. The intervention entailed one hour per day of outdoor education where children were taught academic competencies while being outside and manipulating elements of nature (e.g., branches and stones used to represent mathematical concepts rather than textbooks). Findings suggested a significant reduction in internalized and externalized symptoms pre-to-post intervention, but only among boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A second quasi-experimental study was conducted over the course of a school year with students aged 9 to 11 years (<italic>n</italic> = 631) and aimed in part to assess the benefits of outdoor teaching on mental health, in comparison to education as usual. The authors found that pro-social behaviors improved among all children and that hyperactivity and problems with peers were reduced among disadvantaged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, quasi-experimental designs do not use randomization and conclusions about causal associations between the intervention and outcomes are limited. Further, the two quasi-experimental studies described above did not require that the outdoor education take place in a green space. Therefore, the effectiveness of education outside of the classroom that necessarily includes the component of exposure to nature in reducing mental health problems needs further investigation. In light of the available empirical evidence and the aforementioned limitations, we propose to test the effectiveness of a nature-based intervention implemented within the school context in reducing mental health problems in children, increasing their pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors as well as improving teachers’ well-being. Our intervention program will essentially entail 5-6<sup>th</sup> grade teachers taking their students outside to a nearby green space (e.g. park, wooded area) during school hours for 2 h a week for 12 weeks. The teachers will be provided with a toolkit of outdoor lesson plans that were professionally designed to improve mental health and develop classic academic competencies.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Our main objective is to test the effectiveness of the <italic>Open Sky School</italic>, a nature-based school intervention, designed to decrease mental health problems in children, immediately after the intervention. We hypothesize that the <italic>Open Sky School</italic> will lead to greater reductions in overall mental health problems in children in comparison to a control group (primary outcome), in addition to greater improvements in children’s symptoms of depression, affect, connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes immediately after the intervention (secondary outcomes). We will explore whether the intervention improves teachers well-being and affect, and if benefits in primary and secondary outcomes are maintained at 3 months follow-up among children. We will also explore potential moderators in the association between exposure to the program and outcomes including the children’s sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and disability status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the quality of green-space surrounding school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the deprivation indicator of the school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the amount of experience of teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par8">Participating schools will be recruited from a list of 280 French language elementary schools in the Canadian province of Quebec, enrolled in a larger study conducted by the Observatory for Children’s Education and Health, which aims to document the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on 4<sup>th</sup> grade children’s academic achievement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.observatoireenfants.ca/en/">www.observatoireenfants.ca/en</ext-link>). Additional inclusion criteria for schools are: (a) approval by their school board, (b) access to a natural environment (e.g., park, wooden area) on school grounds or within 1 km of the school and (c) having 5-6<sup>th</sup> grade teachers provide informed and written consent to participate in this study (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Inclusion criteria for children to participate in assessments are (a) enrollment in 5-6<sup>th</sup> grade, (b) providing their assent (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and (c) having their parents or legal guardians provide informed written consent (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

                <title>Intervention group</title>
                <p id="Par9">The intervention aims to provide approximately 2 h of exposure to nature per week and access to a toolkit of pedagogical and mental health activities grounded in positive psychology. The rationale for <italic>Open Sky School</italic> was informed by the growing literature on the benefits of spending time in nature for mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The exposure to nature consists of teachers bringing their students to the highest quality green space within 1 km of a school which could be located on or off campus. For instance, this could be a forest on campus or a park nearby. The class will spend a total of 2 h (i.e. 2 one hour visits or one 2 h visits) per week for 12 weeks (transportation included), which is in line with recent guidelines recommending a minimum of 2 h per week in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the main component of the <italic>Open Sky School</italic> consists of exposing children to nature, which is embedded in various activities (academic and mental health components), while providing teacher training and support. To this end, we designed an online toolkit of pedagogical and mental health activities. The mental health activities are rooted in positive psychology (mindfulness, philosophy for children and art therapy) and are designed to improve children’s mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The pedagogical activities (French language, mathematics and sciences) are aligned on the core academic learning competences required by the Ministry of Education of Québec. Teachers will be allowed to use their own pedagogical activities (if they do, they will be asked to describe their activities), but are encouraged to use those provided in the toolkit, because they were professionally designed and positively appraised in the quality assessment phase. Nevertheless, as our trial primarily aims to reduce mental health problems among children, teachers will be required to carry out at least 10 mental health activities provided in the toolkit. The toolkit also includes brief video-based modules on best practices for implementing mental health activities outdoors (i.e., how to deal with negative emotions; how children can remain mindful in a noisy environment). Our experts and graduate students in education and clinical psychology will provide teachers with up to 1 h per week of virtual optional consultation during the intervention to discuss any arising issues related to the intervention and its implementation. Licensed psychologists from the research team will offer psychological support to any participant who reports high levels of psychological distress and orientate them to appropriate services if needed.

                <p id="Par10">From May to June 2022, 34 elementary school teachers (5th and 6th grade) were invited to evaluate the quality of the 30 activities from our toolkit by answering 7 items about our activities (e.g. overall my students were engaged in the activity; I would use this activity with another class in the future) using a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agreed). Teachers were also invited to provide suggestions to improve the activity using an open response format. We received 85 questionnaires from 24 teachers reporting on 27 activities (14 mental health and 13 pedagogical). Teachers’ feedback was very positive with average ratings ranging from 4.2/5 to 4.5/5. More specifically, teachers responded that they agreed that the instructions clear and that the activities were simple to prepare and to implement. They reported that the students were engaged and liked the activity. Teachers agreed that they would use the activity in the future and recommend it to a colleague. Our research team further refined activities to incorporate teacher’s feedback.</p>

                <p id="Par11">Six months after the inception of the trial, elementary schools (and their teachers) in the control condition will receive an unguided version of the intervention, supplemented by an online peer support group. As the children of the control group will by then be in high school with different teachers, we will provide them with a toolkit of 10 mental health activities that they can practice alone, in addition of support via video-conference, phone or email if they require help practicing the activities from a member of the research team. As in the intervention group, we will provide support by licensed psychologists to any children who report high levels of psychological distress and orient children to appropriate services if needed.</p>

The widely used NDVI is based on the land surface reflectance of colors which is drawn from satellite images of the earth’s surface. The index varies between + 1 and -1 with higher values indicating higher green vegetation density.

The ranking is based on a composite score incorporating the proportion of students within each school whose mother completed high-school and whose both parents are employed full time. Schools are classified on a scale ranging from 1 (lowest deprivation) to 10 (highest deprivation) and scores of 8 to 10 are considered as disadvantaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

They will provide information on the activities they chose to carry out (from our toolkit or others of their choice), the duration of these activities, where the activity was carried out and the total time spent outdoors. They will record if they watched our training videos, if they encountered any problems and the amount of time they spent with our supervisors. This information will be used to evaluate the adequacy of the implementation of our intervention. To fully comply with implementation, there must be of a total of 24 h of intervention (2 h per week for 12 weeks) and a minimum of 10 mental health activities from the toolkit must be carried out. Classes that do not achieve a minimum of 80% completion and comply with content 90% of the time will be excluded from sensitivity analyses. Information contained in the logbooks will be evaluated independently by two researchers and we will analyze inter-rater agreement to ensure the consistency of the codification of the information provided.</p>

On the basis of the limited literature on outdoor education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we expect to obtain a small effect size for our primary outcome, i.e. overall mental health problems in children. With 100 classes (n≈2500) which include typically 25 students (range between 18 to 26) per class, a refusal and attrition rate of 20% (n≈2,000) pre to post-test, an inter-class correlation of 0.02, an expected effect size of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.20 and alpha set at 0.05, we expect that sufficient power will be achieved (&gt; 0.80) for our primary and secondary outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par28">Randomization will occur after baseline assessments. Once randomization has occurred, it is not possible to blind researchers and participants within our design. A simple computer algorithm will be used to randomly allocate schools to two parallel and balanced conditions (intervention or control; 1:1) by an independent researcher not involved in the study. This will ensure that all schools have an equal opportunity to be allocated into one of the two groups. In the event that multiple teachers from the same school consent to participate, they therefore be allocated to the same experimental condition to avoid contamination effects. All research assistants or classroom teachers administering questionnaires will complete training sessions prior to assessment to maintain consistency and when possible, the same investigator or classroom teacher will be used at baseline and at the immediate post-intervention assessments. The evaluation at 3 months follow-up will be completed by children online at home.</p>

A longitudinal ANCOVA, as described in Liu et al. (2009), will be used to estimate the main effects and the moderating effects previously mentioned. Participant characteristics from the intervention and control groups will be compared at the school level, where means (e.g., school deprivation indicator) could be added to the model as covariates in the unlikely event that randomization has not unable to balance the two groups. Multiple imputation and intent to treat analyses will be used to handle missing data.</p>

In the invitation letter, 5-6<sup>th</sup> grade teachers will be invited to attend an online information session describing their expected involvement in the <italic>Open Sky School</italic> project. All interested teachers will be sent an information and consent form. Once teachers will have consented to take part in the study, they will then distribute information and consent forms to students and their parents. Parents will be invited to an online information session describing the intervention. Baseline assessment will take place from March 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> 2023 and post-test assessments will be conducted from June 5<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> 2023. The weekly 2 h nature visits will take place from March 13<sup>th</sup> 2023 to June 2<sup>th</sup> 2023. The follow-up assessments will be administered from September 18<sup>th</sup> to 23<sup>rd</sup> 2023. To encourage participation throughout the study, teachers will be compensated 100$CA for evaluating mental health symptoms of their students before and after the intervention (up to 200$CA total). Children can choose to be entered into a lottery to win gift cards to a local bookstore. More specifically, we will draw two 50$CA gift cards per class for children who complete questionnaires at pre and post-test, and ten 100$CA gift cards for children who the complete follow assessment.
