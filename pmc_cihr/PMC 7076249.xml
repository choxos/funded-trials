                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Pain negatively affects the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of adolescents with cancer. The Pain Squad+ smartphone-based application (app), has been developed to provide adolescents with real-time pain self-management support. The app uses a validated pain assessment and personalised pain treatment advice with centralised decision support via a registered nurse to enable real-time pain treatment in all settings. The algorithm informing pain treatment advice is evidence-based and expert-vetted. This trial will longitudinally evaluate the impact of Pain Squad+, with or without the addition of nurse support, on adolescent health and cost outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This will be a pragmatic, multicentre, waitlist controlled, 3-arm parallel-group superiority randomised trial with 1:1:1 allocation enrolling 74 adolescents with cancer per arm from nine cancer centres. Participants will be 12 to 18 years, English-speaking and with ≥3/10 pain. Exclusion criteria are significant comorbidities, end-of-life status or enrolment in a concurrent pain study. The primary aim is to determine the effect of Pain Squad+, with and without nurse support, on pain intensity in adolescents with cancer, when compared with a waitlist control group. The secondary aims are to determine the immediate and sustained effect over time of using Pain Squad+, with and without nurse support, as per prospective outcome measurements of pain interference, HRQL, pain self-efficacy and cost. Linear mixed models with baseline scores as a covariate will be used. Qualitative interviews with adolescents from all trial arms will be conducted and analysed.</p>

                  <p>This trial is approved by the Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Board. Results will provide data to guide adolescents with cancer and healthcare teams in treating pain. Dissemination will occur through partnerships with stakeholder groups, scientific meetings, publications, mass media releases and consumer detailing.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adolescents with cancer report pain as the most commonly occurring and distressing cancer-related symptom experienced.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Pain negatively impacts health-related quality of life (HRQL),<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> represents a significant cost burden to patients, families and the health system<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and is a major reason for cancer-related emergency health service use in adult patients.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref> However, the successful identification of pain, including in and outside of the hospital setting, does not equate to its adequate treatment and pain is often undertreated in adolescents.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref></p>
              <p>Due to improvements in therapeutic regimes, supportive care and changes in the health system, adolescents with cancer now spend less time in hospital and more time at home.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> Thus, adolescents and their families are increasingly responsible for managing cancer-associated pain in environments with less supervision from healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 19</xref> Adolescents are more vulnerable in these environments as they often lack the knowledge, skills and self-efficacy needed to adequately react to symptoms and may ignore or inappropriately accept changes in pain.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 16 20 21</xref> Digital health technologies are widely used by adolescents<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and can empower adolescents with cancer to engage in remote and real-time pain treatment in all of their natural environments (eg, hospital, home, school). Studies have indicated that digital real-time symptom monitoring and treatment improves HRQL and decreases emergency service use and hospitalisation rates in adults with cancer,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> but no such research has been conducted with adolescents.</p>

                <title>The Pain Squad+ smartphone-based real-time pain treatment application</title>
                <p>Using a phased-centred and user-centred approach, our team has developed a smartphone application (app), called Pain Squad+, capable of providing adolescents with real-time pain treatment support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–31</xref> Pain Squad+ uses a truncated 8-item version of a valid and reliable automated questionnaire to assess adolescent pain (severity, interference, location and capacity to self-manage pain).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> When pain is reported using Pain Squad+, self-management advice is presented to users in real-time according to a vetted and standardised clinical care algorithm.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 28</xref> Advice is based on a library of pharmacological (eg, medication adherence reminders), psychological (eg, distraction techniques) and physical (eg, yoga instruction) advice that aligns with typical recommendations provided to adolescents by their healthcare teams.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Three consecutive moderate-to-severe reports of pain intensity (ie, ≥3/10)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> trigger an email to be sent to a paediatric oncology-trained registered nurse. The nurse then contacts the adolescent and/or their healthcare team to discuss the case and initiate healthcare professional-driven intervention, which may be outside of the scope of the self-management algorithm (eg, adjusting a prescribed medication regime). To encourage engagement with Pain Squad+, the app is ‘gamified’ with users playing the role of superheroes who receive rewards for adherence to pain assessment and treatment recommendation completion.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>

                <p>The most recently completed phase of Pain Squad+ testing was a 1-group, baseline-poststudy pilot that demonstrated the feasibility (ie, intervention fidelity, outcome measure completion, adherence, acceptability) of evaluating the app in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), as well as small-to-moderate effect sizes (Cohen’s d: 0.23 to 0.67).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This protocol details the methods to be used in the next phase of Pain Squad+ testing: a RCT aimed at longitudinally evaluating the impact of Pain Squad+, with or without the addition of nurse support, on adolescent health and cost outcomes.</p>

                  <p>The deployment of the Pain Squad+ app to adolescent’s personal phones will be done through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The research team will loan an iPhone or Android phone to those without a smartphone. All adolescents will be trained to use Pain Squad+ using a standardised procedure. Three repeated audible smartphone alerts over a 30 min window will signal each adolescent to complete the 8-item pain assessment using Pain Squad+ every morning and evening for 8 weeks. The timing of morning and evening pain assessments will be individualised according to participant’s daily and weekly schedules. An automated 30 min window within which each assessment must be completed will be set, or the assessment will be registered as ‘missed’. Adolescents will also have the option of completing ad hoc pain assessments anytime between the automated alert times. Algorithm-driven pain self-management advice will be issued in response to pain, providing real-time decision support (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary appendix A</xref>). One hour after a recommendation is made, the app will alert adolescents to complete a pain reassessment and additional advice will be offered as appropriate. All pain assessment and treatment advice data logged will be encrypted and wirelessly transferred to a secure server at SickKids for storage. Email alerts related to three consecutive reports of pain &gt;3/10 will be sent to the study nurse who will log into the Analytics Platform to Evaluate Effective Engagement (APEEE) platform<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> to review the adolescent’s pain report history. The nurse may liaise with the adolescent’s healthcare team regarding the case and will contact the adolescent within 12 hours of receiving the alert, including on weekends. The time of nurse contact and the details of the pain treatment conversation will be recorded. A research coordinator will provide telephone-based technical assistance (weekdays 09:00 to 17:00 EST) to participants if required.</p>

Cost effectiveness and cost utility will be expressed as incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs), calculated by dividing the incremental costs between treatment arms by the incremental difference in average pain intensity or the incremental change in utility scores, measured by the HUI2/3. Multiple ICERs will be calculated comparing each of the three study groups in a pairwise fashion for both the cost effectiveness and cost utility analyses. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. A 95% CI for incremental costs, incremental effects and the ICER will be calculated from study data.</p>

                  <title>Qualitative interview analyses</title>
                  <p>Audio-recorded interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Transcribed data will be managed using NVivo 12.0 software (QRS International). Data analysis will occur shortly after each interview is conducted so that identified issues can be used to inform subsequent interview content. Data will be read several times by the study team for overall understanding and to identify data codes. Data will then be coded using a line-by-line approach according to study objective. Codes will be grouped into categories based on between-code relationships. Category development will occur until all data can be classified under the existing categories. Categories will then be grouped into themes. Field notes and relevant sociodemographic and disease characteristics will be integrated into the analysis process to illustrate or clarify emerging categories and themes.</p>

                <p>Adolescents with cancer have been directly and actively involved in all stages of the development and evaluation of the Pain Squad+ app, including determining the feasibility of this study, evaluating any potential burden on adolescent participants and in the development of this research protocol. An adolescent with cancer advisory committee has been established to guide trial conduct and results interpretation and dissemination from a patient perspective and will report to the principal investigators. This advisory committee will meet regularly with the lead investigators to ensure the trial is guided by the priorities and experiences of adolescents with cancer.</p>

                <p>The trial steering committee consists of the lead study team. Virtual progress meetings with all steering committee members will be routinely collected to ensure the smooth running of the study. A data
safety and monitoring committee (DSMC) guided by a prepared charter of roles and responsibilities (available from corresponding author) and consisting of a statistical expert, a paediatric oncology nurse scientist and a paediatric anaesthesiologist who are independent of the research team has been established. The DSMC will meet biannually to review recruitment, accumulating study data and adverse events and will provide guidance to the study team regarding any needed action.</p>

                <p>Based on our pilot and similar studies conducted by our group,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> there are no known risks to adolescents enrolled in the experimental or control groups. Any adverse events reported by adolescents, their healthcare teams or the study nurse will be tracked on a critical incident form and reported to treating oncologists as soon as possible. Site ethics boards and the DSMC will also be contacted as soon as possible after the occurrence of any adverse event. Any major amendments to the protocol that may impact the conduct of the study or participant benefits or harms will be agreed on by the trial steering committee, as well as the adolescent with cancer advisory committee and approved by all site ethics boards before they are instituted. These amendments will also be communicated with study participants as soon as possible by site RAs.</p>

We will present research findings at international oncology and paediatric conferences and publish in leading journals. Our knowledge translation strategy will also include: a one-page brochure for distribution to oncology healthcare professionals, a~3 min video for adolescents with cancer, which will be posted on websites such as YouTube, media releases (ie, for newspaper, magazines), posting on partner organisation, hospital and university websites and supporting adolescents and caregivers in translating results into fact sheets to support these key stakeholders in educating their healthcare professionals about results (ie, consumer detailing).</p>
