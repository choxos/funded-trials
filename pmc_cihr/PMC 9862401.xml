                  <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
                  <p>High cereal fiber and low-glycemic index (GI) diets are associated with reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in cohort studies. Clinical trial evidence on event incidence is lacking. Therefore, to make trial outcomes more directly relevant to CVD, we compared the effect on carotid plaque development in diabetes of a low-GI diet versus a whole-grain wheat-fiber diet.</p>

                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>The study randomized 169 men and women with well-controlled type 2 diabetes to counseling on a low GI-diet or whole-grain wheat-fiber diet for 3 years. Change in carotid vessel wall volume (VWV) (prespecified primary end point) was assessed by MRI as an indication of arterial damage.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Of 169 randomized participants, 134 completed the study. No treatment differences were seen in VWV. However, on the whole-grain wheat-fiber diet, VWV increased significantly from baseline, 23 mm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI 4, 41; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.016), but not on the low-GI diet, 8 mm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI −10, 26; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.381). The low-GI diet resulted in preservation of renal function, as estimated glomerular filtration rate, compared with the reduction following the wheat-fiber diet. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was modestly reduced over the first 9 months in the intention-to-treat analysis and extended with greater compliance to 15 months in the per-protocol analysis.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>Since the low-GI diet was similar to the whole-grain wheat-fiber diet recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction, the low-GI diet may also be effective for CVD risk reduction.</p>

              <p>Refined carbohydrate foods are recommended against, internationally, as part of the strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Diets high in whole grains and cereal fiber are promoted widely, as are low glycemic index (GI) diets, in many jurisdictions (e.g., Australia and Canada). This advice is driven by evidence of prospective cohort studies that have noted reductions in both diabetes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and CVD (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, in no instance have clinical trials been undertaken to support current carbohydrate advice, although meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have been undertaken that demonstrate, for example, the effect of low-GI diets in reducing CVD risk factors, including lipids, blood glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In the absence of trials with clinical CVD outcomes, we believed it important to determine whether low-GI diets affected outcomes that are closer to a CVD event. Arterial damage has been associated with CVD morbidity and mortality, and we have the ability to measure arterial damage and plaque formation as vessel wall volume (VWV) by MRI of the carotid arteries. We therefore studied otherwise healthy men and women with type 2 diabetes and with evidence of possible future CVD risk, assessed as carotid intima media thickness of ≥1.2 mm. We assumed that those with diabetes would be more likely to show the effects of dietary change over the 3-year study.</p>

                <p>A detailed account of the design and methods of this trial has been published (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Subjects were recruited by advertisements and from previous studies, and 169 participants were eligible and randomized (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). Recruitment took place from December 2010 to June 2013, with the last follow-up visit in July 2016. Eligible participants were men or postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes who took antihyperglycemic agents and had a minimum intima media thickness by ultrasound of ≥1.2 mm (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Text 1</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>Protocol</title>
                <p>The study was a 3-year randomized parallel study with two treatments consisting of advice to select low-GI foods versus to increase consumption of wheat-fiber, where possible using whole-grain products. After stratification by sex, HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&gt;7.1%), smoking, and statin use, randomization was performed using participant ID by a statistician in a separate geographic location (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Text 2</ext-link>). The analytical technicians, MRI technologists, and experts who assessed and measured the MRIs were also blinded. However, the dietitians and the participants could not be blinded. Participants were seen at a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto for screening, week −1, baseline, and at 3-month intervals throughout the 3-year intervention. At each center visit, participants were weighed, a fasting blood sample was taken, and blood pressure was measured. In addition, participants brought their 7-day food record covering the week prior to the visit to discuss with the dietitian and document self-reported adherence. At baseline and years 1 and 3, participants underwent MRI of their carotid arteries.</p>

                <p>Details of the low-GI and wheat-fiber diets have been published (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These diets also conformed to the advice given in our previous 6-month trial of a low-GI diet (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The low-GI dietary advice emphasized low-GI oat bran and psyllium breads, peas, beans, and lentils, pasta, and temperate climate fruit, while the wheat-fiber diet emphasized 100% whole-meal and whole-grain wheat breads, and 100% whole wheat cereal products and breakfast cereals (further details are given in <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Tables 1</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">2</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Maximum compliance goals were calculated from the 1-day dietary records used for participant instruction to illustrate the ideal composition of the low-GI and cereal-fiber diets (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). In these illustrative diets, all cereal foods were truly whole grain and the lowest GI options were selected for carbohydrate foods. Under these ideal conditions the low-GI diet could achieve a GI of 57 (bread scale with white bread GI = 100) and the cereal fiber diet would provide 15 g/2,000 kcal diet. The St. Michael’s Hospital Research Ethics Board and the University of Toronto approved the study. Written consent was obtained from all participants (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.Gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.Gov</ext-link> identifier: <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01063374" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01063374</ext-link>).</p>

The cardiovascular imaging software VesselMASS (Medis, Leiden, Netherlands) was used for image analysis. Image grading (1–5) was performed, and images of poor quality (grade &lt;3) or missing images were excluded from analyses. Three trained independent readers identified lumen and outer wall contours for all the participants. The software automatically generated VWV. Intraclass correlation values for measurements were &gt;0.9 (good to excellent). This process, together with reader training, took ∼9 months after study completion.</p>

No differences were seen between the completion rates on the low-GI (69 of 86) and wheat-fiber diets (65 of 83).</p>
              <p>Adherence to the ideal low-GI and wheat-fiber diets was very low, with only 6 participants (8.3%) on the low-GI diet at 3 years achieving a dietary GI of ≤57, and on the wheat-fiber diet, 11 participants (15.9%) at 1 year, and 7 participants (10.6%) at 3 years achieving an intake ≥15 g of wheat fiber per 2,000 kcal. The mean GI at years 1 and 3 was 66.6 and 67.3, and the corresponding cereal fiber figures were 6.5 g/2,000 kcal and 5.6 g/2,000 kcal (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 7</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>The treatment difference at 3 years in GI, assessed as the change from baseline, was significant ([ln] −0.19; 95% CI −0.22, −0.16; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.001) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 8</ext-link>).

There were no treatment differences in changes in medication use over the 3-year trial; however, participants on the low-GI diet were somewhat more likely to decrease use of lipid-lowering medications (16% of participants) than those on the wheat-fiber diet (11%), although similar proportions of participants increased their use of these medications (19% on the low-GI diet, and 20% on the wheat-fiber diet) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 9</ext-link>).</p>

Adjustment for the two significant baseline differences, VWV and triglyceride, made little difference to the results in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, although the significance of the relative reduction in HDL-C was lost (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 16</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Baseline values were also similar between treatments (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 5</ext-link>).

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>No treatment differences were seen in the change in VWV between wheat-fiber and low-GI diets at 3 years. Despite the lack of a significant treatment difference between the diets, there was an increase in VWV on the wheat-fiber diet that was not seen on the low-GI diet. Furthermore, a very small reduction in renal function (eGFR) was also seen with the wheat-fiber died that was not seen on the low-GI diet. The resulting significant treatment difference in eGFR may be an indication of potential microvascular disease benefits associated with the low-GI diet (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Small changes were seen in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, blood lipids, or blood pressure; however, these changes in risk factors did not relate to changes in VWV, possibly resulting from the already low baseline levels of risk factors that limited further reductions (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21222365" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 14</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>The current trial results do not explain the strong association of GI with CVD as seen in a recent prospective cohort study (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Factors such as adherence and duration of exposure may have reduced the effectiveness of the low-GI diet in our study. Other factors not assessed here may also have been involved, such as the effect of postprandial glycemia on markers of oxidative damage that are associated with increased CVD risk (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Further, postprandial hypotension and tachycardia have been associated with all-cause mortality (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In turn, postprandial hypotension may be prevented by acarbose treatment (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) that reduces the rate of carbohydrate absorption, so effectively creating a low-GI diet. These potential actions of low GI diets require further exploration. Previous studies on low-GI diets have reported reductions in serum triglyceride and CRP and increases in HDL-C (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), with no data on pulse rate. While the relevance of the small decrease in pulse rate seen in our study is uncertain, it is of interest that a slower heart rate has been associated with reduced CVD risk (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <sec id="s27">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The study has several weaknesses. Our original estimation of an effect size of 34 mm<sup>3</sup> for the increase in VWV over 3 years was optimistic, even though other publications have provided annual data that translate to an increase in VWV of 40 to 72 mm<sup>3</sup>/3 year (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These increases are all greater than the 8 mm<sup>3</sup> and 23 mm<sup>3</sup> 3-year changes in VWV that we observed for the low-GI and wheat-fiber diets, respectively. It is also possible that our two current approaches to treatment were both effective in limiting our ability to see a difference or that they are most effective as preventive measures rather than for reversing established disease.</p>
                <p>Few participants achieved the ideal goals for the low-GI and wheat-fiber diets. Nevertheless, the reduction of 12 GI units achieved at 1 and 3 years was very similar to the reduction in GI reported in previous studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and similar to the extreme quintile range of 15 units seen in a recent study in which the high GI diet was significantly associated with increased CVD risk (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, the absolute reliability of the diet records may be called into question since the significant treatment differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> were lost over the duration of this 3-year trial, while significant treatment differences in GI of 12 units were seen consistently throughout the trial, based on the 7-day self-reported food records of the participants.</p>
                <p>Provision of foods would likely have encouraged increased adherence. However, interventions that provide significant food items over a number of years are difficult to undertake and do not necessarily reflect real-world conditions. The concern that long-term adherence is a major problem for dietary trials was supported by the observation that an objective measure of adherence, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, showed a longer-term reduction in the per-protocol group as the most adherent group compared with all study participants combined.</p>
                <p>This problem of maintaining adequate dietary adherence in long-term trials supports the use of large cohort studies where major changes to adherence to a specific diet is not the objective, but rather continued adherence to the participant’s self-selected diet is all that is required.</p>
                <p>Finally, the strong association in cohort studies of cereal fiber consumption, predominately wheat-fiber, with reduced cardiometabolic events (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), makes the selection of wheat fiber a very positive control and will increase the difficulty in seeing a more favorable effect for the low-GI diet. Therefore, a third treatment, as a true control, would have provided the possibility of a more relevant comparison. However, our participants from previous studies had requested a positive control only, especially for long-term interventions.</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p>The study also has several strengths. At 3 years, our trial was longer than most dietary trials, at 3 months to 2 years, with notable exceptions such as Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) and Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) at 4 to 9.6 years (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Further, the use of MRI allowed assessment of VWV as an indication of atheroma burden making the outcome closer to a CVD event.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>We conclude that no significant treatment difference was seen between the low-GI and wheat-fiber diets on VWV. However, cereal fiber has consistently been associated, in cohort studies, with a reduced risk of CVD. The lack of increase in vessel volume over the 3 years on the low-GI diet and its noninferiority in VWV compared with the wheat-fiber diet provide support for considering low-GI diets along with cereal fiber and whole grains as part of the dietary strategy for CVD risk reduction (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
