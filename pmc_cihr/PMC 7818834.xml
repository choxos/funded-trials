                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Exercise therapy is the most recommended treatment for chronic low back pain (LBP). Effect sizes for exercises are usually small to moderate and could be due to the heterogeneity of people presenting with LBP. Thus, if patients could be better matched to exercise based on individual factors, then the effects of treatment could be greater. A recently published study provided evidence of better outcomes when patients are matched to the appropriate exercise type. The study demonstrated that a 15-item questionnaire, the Lumbar Spine Instability Questionnaire (LSIQ), could identify patients who responded best to one of the two exercise approaches for LBP (motor control and graded activity). The primary aim of the current study isill be to evaluate whether preidentified baseline characteristics, including the LSIQ, can modify the response to two of the most common exercise therapies for non-specific LBP. Secondary aims include an economic evaluations with a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Participants (n=414) will be recruited by primary care professionals and randomised (1:1) to receive motor control exercises or graded activity. Participants will undergo 12 sessions of exercise therapy over an 8-week period. The primary outcome will be physical function at 2 months using the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes will be pain intensity, function and quality of life measured at 2, 6 and 12 months. Potential effect modifiers will be the LSIQ, self-efficacy, coping strategies, kinesiophobia and measures of nociceptive pain and central sensitisation. We will construct linear mixed models with terms for participants (fixed), treatment group, predictor (potential effect modifier), treatment group×predictor (potential effect modifier), physiotherapists, treatment group×physiotherapists and baseline score for the dependent variable.</p>

              <p>Exercise therapy is the most commonly endorsed treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP) in clinical guidelines<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> and systematic reviews.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although exercise is more effective than no intervention, the effect sizes of exercise, like other back pain treatments, are small to moderate,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> and no exercise approach (eg, Pilates or general exercises) has been shown to be superior to another exercise.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 6</xref> The most commonly cited reason for the relatively small average effect size for exercise is the heterogeneity of people presenting with LBP. Improved precision in matching patients to specific types of exercise (ie, a personalised medicine approach to exercise) could increase treatment effects.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref></p>
              <p>Recent progress has been made in the triage of individuals attending primary care for LBP.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The STarT Back Tool uses risk stratification to aid selection of those who would benefit from physiotherapy, primarily exercise for a medium-risk group, or exercise plus more complex psychosocial interventions for a high-risk group. Although this tool is more effective and cost-effective than usual care,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> this stratification care model does not provide guidance regarding the type of exercise to provide to individuals with LBP. Those who have undergone risk stratification according to the STarT Back tool and require exercise therapy (~75%)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> are still faced with the decision of ‘Which exercise will produce the best outcomes?’ Identification of subgroups of responders to treatment, including different exercise types, has been the leading research priority in the last two international consensus statements on priorities for LBP research.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref></p>
              <p>There has been some effort towards derivation of clinical decision support tools for LBP.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–17</xref> Most tools were not developed using strict methodological criteria, such as the evaluation of plausible effect modifiers within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) or were derived from studies that were underpowered to evaluate interaction effects.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Further, these tools were not subsequently validated or tested for effectiveness within an RCT design. Validation of clinical decision support tools is critical as derivation studies are highly prone to spurious findings. Multiple systematic reviews of clinical support tools conclude that we do not need more development studies but rather validation studies.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17 19</xref> This is an important challenge within the LBP literature where many promising studies are neither replicated nor translated into clinical practice. Validation studies are essential before recommending a change in policy and clinical practice.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>A recently published preplanned secondary analysis of an RCT investigated whether clinical characteristics could identify patients who benefit more from either motor control exercises or a graded activity programme using principles of cognitive behavioural therapy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> Both exercise approaches have evidence of effectiveness from high-quality systematic reviews<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref> but no evidence for superiority when tested in heterogeneous populations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 25</xref> The study results suggest that a simple 15-item self-report questionnaire, the Lumbar Spinal Instability Questionnaire (LSIQ), that asks questions primarily related to tasks that provoke and relieve symptoms,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> could identify patients who responded best to either motor control exercise or graded activity. As hypothesised, individuals with LBP and a low LSIQ score (&lt;9 points) had a statistically and clinically significant better outcome when receiving graded activity than motor control exercise 1 year postintervention. Conversely, individuals with a high LSIQ score (≥9 points) achieved better outcomes with motor control exercise than those prescribed graded activity. These results provided preliminary evidence that simple and easy to collect measures might enable better matching of exercise and significantly improve outcomes for patients with LBP. It is only after validation that these results may be implementable in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>Guidelines for the investigation of subgroups of respondents to treatment recommend the use of a small number of plausible potential effect modifiers.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the aforementioned derivation study,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> theoretical models behind potential mechanisms of action of the interventions were used to derive potential effect modifiers.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Motor control exercises use a motor learning approach to address features of trunk posture, movement and muscle activation that are related to symptoms. This intervention should work best on those who lack neuromuscular coordination or have mechanically related problems. Graded activity uses principles of cognitive behavioural therapy to address LBP-related beliefs and fears. This intervention should work best for individuals who are deconditioned and have fear avoidance and other unhelpful beliefs and attitudes towards their pain.</p>
              <p>This study will also include an economic evaluation, including cost-effectiveness and cost–utility analyses, and take into consideration the LSIQ scores. The interventions delivered as part of this study have the same direct delivery cost in that they require the same resources. However, there is some evidence that patients receiving graded activity intervention may seek less additional care for their LBP than those receiving motor control.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Theoretically, traditional graded activity interventions include a large self-management component that reduces the need for seeking additional care.</p>
              <p>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the score on the LSIQ modifies the response of patients with chronic non-specific LBP to motor control exercises or graded activity. The secondary aim s to compare the cost-effectiveness between patients who did and did not receive the ‘matched’ intervention at 12 months of follow-up. An exploratory aim is to evaluate whether other effect modifiers contribute to the identification of subgroups of patients that may best respond to motor control exercises or graded activity.</p>

                <p>This study is a comparison of two common interventions, motor control exercises and graded activity, delivered by physiotherapists for the management of LBP. These two interventions have received substantial attention over the past decades as they have been developed based on evidence-based theoretical models. Both groups will include the delivery of education on pain neurophysiology, education, ergonomics and advice to stay active.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 26 33</xref></p>
                <p>Participants in each group will receive 12 individually supervised sessions of approximately half an hour (as per usual clinical practice) over an 8-week period (two sessions per week in the first 4 weeks and one session per week in the second 4 weeks).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The treatment sessions are designed to become less frequent and to promote transition to independent exercise and may become shorter in time as they progress. Participants included in both exercise programmes will be advised to complete home exercise daily during the programme and after discharge. Participants will be asked to refrain from receiving other interventions such as chiropractic treatment, massage therapy and medication, although this will not preclude from patient participation. We will collect information on cointerventions on both groups.</p>
                <p>Treatment will be provided by 22 physiotherapists at 15 different locations in Ontario, Canada. All physiotherapists have been trained to deliver both interventions through a 2-day workshop with Professor Paul Hodges (motor control exercise) and a 2-day workshop with Dr Geoff Bostick (graded activity), as well as the use of a treatment manual and refresher webinars. Refresher sessions (webinar) are planned each 6 months to guarantee continued compliance with the protocol. To help clearly differentiate the two interventions and decrease potential overlap, a table with key treatment components was developed (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Motor control exercise</title>
                  <p>Motor control exercise was developed within a mechanical model of LBP. It is based on a large body of evidence suggesting that individuals with LBP have impaired control and coordination of the trunk muscles, including the deep trunk muscles (eg, transversus abdominis and multifidus).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–42</xref> The underlying premise is that for many with chronic LBP, ongoing nociceptive input from the periphery secondary to suboptimal tissue loading contributes to the ongoing pain.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The primary goal of motor control exercises is to retrain optimal control and coordination of the spine and limbs.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>
                  <p>The motor control exercise will be based on the programme reported by Hodges <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and similar to the protocol previously used in the initial study that this trial replicates and extends<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> and a Canadian feasibility study (unpublished). The intervention is called motor control as it uses principles of motor learning, such as segmentation, simplification and task-specific practice to retrain control of trunk muscles activation, body alignment and movement.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The intervention is based on assessment of the individual patient’s motor control features, their relationship to symptoms and the patient’s individual treatment goals (set collaboratively with the physiotherapist).</p>
                  <p>The first stage of the treatment involves assessment of the postures, movement patterns and muscle activation associated with symptoms and implementation of a retraining programme. The programme is designed to improve activity of muscles assessed to have poor control (commonly the deeper muscles such as transversus abdominis, multifidus, pelvic floor and diaphragm) and to reduce the activity of any muscle identified to be overactive, commonly the large, more superficial trunk muscles such as obliquus externus abdominis that the individual may use to brace and guard the trunk.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>
                  <p>Participants are taught how to contract/control these muscles independently from the superficial trunk muscles<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 46</xref> and progress until the patient is able to maintain independent contractions of the target muscles while maintaining normal respiration.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Exercises for breathing control, control of posture and movement of spine and limbs are individualised based on the presentation of the patient.</p>
                  <p>The second stage of the treatment involves progression of the exercises towards functional activities<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> using a combination of static and dynamic tasks. Throughout this process, the recruitment of the trunk muscles, posture, movement pattern and breathing are assessed and modified as necessary.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>

                  <p>Graded activity is based on the biopsychosocial model.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In this model, disability is determined not only by the underlying pathology, but also mostly by contextual factors such as social, cognitive, emotional and behavioural factors.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48–54</xref> The primary goal of graded activity is to address individual modifiable contextual factors associated with the activity-related pain experience such as self-efficacy, pain-related fear, fear of movement and unhelpful beliefs/behaviours about back pain<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> while at the same time addressing physical impairments such as endurance, muscle strength and balance.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></p>
                  <p>The graded activity exercise programme is based on the treatment programme reported by Lindström <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and similar to the protocol previously used in the initial study that this trial replicates and extends<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> and a Canadian feasibility study (unpublished). A primary goal of the programme is to increase activity tolerance by performing individualised and submaximal exercises<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> in addition to addressing illness behaviours and reinforcing well behaviours. The programme is based on meaningful activities that each patient identifies as problematic as a result of their LBP. The activities in the programme are progressed in a time-contingent manner (rather than a traditional pain-contingent manner) from the baseline assessed ability to a target goal set jointly by patient and physiotherapist.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57 59 60</xref> Participants receive daily quotas and are instructed to only perform the agreed amount, not less or more, even when they feel they are capable of doing more.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Cognitive–behavioural therapy principles, such as reinforcement and reassurance, are used to help participants overcome the natural reluctance to engage in activities and exercise while experiencing pain.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59 62</xref></p>

                <p>Outcomes (described further) will be assessed at similar times for both exercise groups at the follow-ups of 2, 6 and 12 months. All core outcomes in LBP are self-reported<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> and therefore will be collected using a REDCap URL link sent to participants via email. If the participant does not complete the questionnaire within 2 days, they will be sent a reminder, and if they still do not respond, they will be contacted via phone. Alternatively, if the participant does not own an email account or does not have access to the internet, the questionnaires will be completed over the phone by an investigator unaware of treatment allocation.</p>
                <p>Pain pressure threshold is the only outcome measure that will be collected in person as part of this study. Baseline assessment will be performed by the treating physiotherapist after consent and prior to randomisation. At the end of the treatment prior to discharge, pain pressure threshold will be assessed again, but at this time, physiotherapists will no longer be blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

Thumbnail measures will be performed with the participants sitting with the thumb resting over a hard surface. PPT will be recorded as the point which the sensation of pressure changes to a sensation of pain. Pressure will be increased from 0 N at 40 N/s until the participants indicate that they have reached their PPT. Two consecutive measurements will be performed at each site, with 10 s recovery between repeated applications. The threshold pressure will be transformed to kilogram per square centimetre.</p>

In addition, participants will enter indirect costs (such as income loss) for themselves and for their family members as it relates to their LBP. These will be used to estimate costs from the societal perspective and from the patient perspective. The CoPaQ will enable the inclusion of indirect costs into the economic evaluations, as well as the evaluation of costs from the patient perspective. Thus, societal perspective analysis will include healthcare system costs, as well as indirect costs from loss of productivity.</p>

                <p>It has been demonstrated through simulation studies that the sample size of a 2×2 interaction (eg, treatment×effect modifier) in a mixed effects model is fourfold of the sample to detect a main effect of the same magnitude.<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100 101</xref> It is argued that interaction effects are usually smaller in validation studies than pilot studies, and therefore, the study was powered for a clinically significant interaction of 15 points. Assuming from previous systematic reviews<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23 24</xref> the main effect of these exercise approaches compared with no treatment is approximately 15 points on a 100-point scale for the ODI at 2 months, an interaction of 15 would mean that the effect would be approximately 22.5 when participants receive the correct targeted intervention and 7.5 when participants do not receive the targeted intervention. This would generate a significant improvement in outcomes that are clearly considered clinically relevant (&gt;10 points).<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Sample size was calculated for the primary outcome of function (ODI) using PASS V.16 software for mixed models tests for two means based on the methods of Vierron and Giraudeau.<xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">102 103</xref> A sample size of 90 achieves 85% power to detect a difference of 15 between the two means (main effect) when the SD of the response variable is 25 and the ICC (ρ) is 0.10 using a test with a significance level of 0.05. A sample size of 360 (90×4) is required to appropriately power the study for the interaction effect. A total of 424 participants (212 per treatment group) will be included to account for a 15% loss to follow-up.</p>

              <p>Identification of subgroups of patients that best respond to different interventions has long been a research priority in LBP<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> and is an agenda driven by clinicians and researchers. Despite this, few high-quality research studies have been conducted,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17 19</xref> which are likely because of the limited understanding of important methodological criteria that are specific for these types of studies. This includes a priori designation of plausible effect modifiers, large sample sizes and a robust statistical analysis. In addition, validation and replication of studies are often not performed, which significantly limits translation into clinical practice. This study will fill this important gap in the literature and potentially validate our promising preliminary study.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
                <p>A strength of this study is its design as a replication study as a critical step to test the robustness of findings of a previous preplanned analysis of effect modification in a high-quality RCT.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The design of this study uses a strong RCT design with a preplanned effect modification analysis based on a specific plausible rationale founded on the results of the high-quality prior study.</p>
                <p>Limitations of this study include the lack of blinding of patients and physiotherapists, although this is common practice in studies of exercise interventions. Further, collection of out-of-pocket costs using the Cost for Patients Questionnaire may suffer from recall bias, which is mitigated by a relatively frequent data collection. Although data on service use from administrative databases are of high quality, it will not be possible to distinguish use related to LBP. In addition, we will add a significantly large list of effect modifiers which may be prone to type I error, although we have identified the LSIQ as the primary effect modifier of interest. Finally, the results of two different Rasch analysis studies demonstrated conflicting evidence for the adequacy for calculating a summary score of the questionnaire and also demonstrated potential problems with person reliability.<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78 106</xref> However, given the conflicting evidence of the two RASCH studies and strong evidence for predictive validity available, the use of this questionnaire is still appropriate. Further, there has been questions about the construct being measured by the questionnaire and whether it represented instability or another construct (eg, nociception). The additional measures of pain characteristics added into this study will allow for a better understanding of the LSIQ construct.</p>
                <p>The results of the previously published study identified a simple and easy method to subgroup individuals into more homogenous groups of patients with LBP that led to improved efficacy of exercise.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Implementation of this new approach to personalisation of exercise could be easily adopted as both treatments evaluated are currently widely used, and the method to identify subgroups of responders to each approach is straightforward, quick and at no cost. There has been an appetite from clinicians and researchers for the development of evidence-based patient subgroups,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 107</xref> and the results of this study could result in a major advance in the field.</p>
