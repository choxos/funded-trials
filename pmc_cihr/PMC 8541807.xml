                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Smoking cessation interventions implemented in emergency department (ED) settings have resulted in limited success, owing to factors such as lack of time, motivation, and incentives. A dynamic yet simple and effective approach that addresses the fast-paced nature of acute-care ED settings is needed. This study proposes a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effectiveness of an easy to deliver proactive, multi-component tobacco treatment intervention to usual care in the ED setting.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This will be a prospective four-site, single-blind, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) RCT. Participants will be recruited directly in the ED and will be approached strictly in order of arrival time. Those randomized to the Quit Card Intervention (QCI) group will receive a “quit kit” which will include: a “Quit Card” worth $300 that can be used at any Canadian pharmacy to purchase any form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); a self-help booklet; and proactive enrolment in 6 months of telephone follow-up counseling. The usual care (UC) group will receive a “quit kit” which will include a brochure for a local smoking cessation program. Quit kits for both groups will be delivered in opaque, sealed envelopes, and identical in size and weight so to conceal group allocation from the blinded research coordinator. Randomization will be stratified by site and by the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS), a value assigned to each ED patient based on the severity of the condition. An equal number of quit kits will be prepared for each CTAS level. The primary outcome will be bio-chemically verified smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes include smoking behavior at weeks 4, 52, and 104 as well as mortality and health care utilization outcomes. Investigators, outcome assessors, and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation until after primary analyses are completed. It is hypothesized that the QCI group will have higher a abstinence rate, improved health outcomes, and decreased healthcare utilization.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">There are few examples of hospital EDs in Canada that systematically initiate tobacco cessation interventions for patients who smoke. Given the high smoking prevalence among ED patients and the relation of tobacco smoking to the majority of ambulatory care sensitive conditions, EDs are a missed opportunity in the initiation of tobacco treatment interventions. We have designed and will test an evidence-based tobacco treatment intervention that is simple and highly scalable.</p>

                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par40">In Canada, smoking results in nearly 40,000 premature deaths per year and it has been estimated that smoking-attributable healthcare use will cost approximately $80 billion over the next 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Heart disease and stroke are 2–4 times more common among smokers compared to non-smokers, and smoking accounts for 80–90% of all chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cases and 30% of all cancer deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Individuals who smoke have a 30–40% greater chance of developing type II diabetes, and those with diabetes have a greater risk of morbidity and premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Smokers use twice as many hospital days annually and are being hospitalized, on average, 12 years earlier than their non-smoking counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par41">Smoking cessation results in improvements in vascular, respiratory, and cancer-related health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and reduces the prevalence and incidence of vascular events (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, stroke) substantially within the first few years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If a person quits before the age of 40, they will eliminate 90% of their risk of premature morbidity and mortality associated with smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hospital-initiated cessation interventions have been found to decrease 30-day, 1-year, and 2-year re-hospitalization rates, thus indicating the potential for improving “avoidable” hospital readmissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite progress in reducing the current smoking prevalence in Canada to 13%, there is a need for increased cessation efforts in order to reach Canada’s goal of 5% prevalence by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Wider-scale implementation of proactive interventions initiated in clinical environments that treat large volumes of smokers is needed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="Sec5">
                  <title>Rationale</title>
                  <p id="Par42">Given the high smoking prevalence among patients treated in emergency departments (ED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], ED settings are an opportune and critical target area to initiate tobacco treatment and aftercare. Smoking rates among ED patients have been found to be &gt;5% higher than levels in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a pilot study completed by our research team, an assessment of smoking prevalence completed at four hospital sites to be included in this study revealed that 509 of 2713 (19%) of patients reported current smoking. Therefore, the ED is an ideal environment to reach smokers and initiate tobacco treatment. However, few EDs in Canada offer tobacco treatment interventions to patients due to the environment’s fast-paced and acute care nature. Interventions in the ED must be simple and fast to deliver to facilitate implementation among ED staff.</p>
                  <p id="Par43">Previous cessation intervention trials in ED settings have mostly found non-significant differences in abstinence rates (from −3.6 to 20%) between intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Limitations of previous studies have included (1) low intensity of interventions (e.g., brief advice initiated in the ED and passive referral to a telephone “quit line”); (2) single-site studies, limiting generalizability; (3) weak-to-moderate methodological quality of most (88%); and (4) lack of health services outcomes (e.g., mortality, healthcare use, cost). Motivational interviewing (MI)-based counseling for smokers in the ED has shown to be effective; however, it has been acknowledged that, due to time constraints present in the ED, briefer interventions may be better suited for this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A Canadian RCT compared advice from an ED physician and referral to a quit line to usual care (no support) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In total, 660 patients were randomized to the intervention group, of whom 412 agreed to a quit line referral. Of those, only 13% enrolled in the quit line intervention, and only ~5% completed the program. Not surprisingly, given the low uptake, no significant differences in cessation were found between groups.</p>
                  <p id="Par44">Clinical tobacco treatment interventions that include medication and behavioral counseling are most effective at helping people quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. NRT is the most frequently used cessation medication in acute care settings given its rapid effect on nicotine withdrawal. A systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of NRT reported an odds ratio (OR) of 1.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71–1.99)) for long-term cessation when comparing NRT to placebo. Combination NRT (e.g., pairing a nicotine patch with a shorter-acting form like gum, inhaler, or mouth spray) is more effective than nicotine monotherapy (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.00–1.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Behavioral counseling is crucial in supporting cessation efforts and preventing relapse. Proactive enrolment in behavioral support programs, as opposed to passive referral, is necessary. A recent study of a smoking cessation intervention in an out-patient surgery clinic found that 85% of patients enrolled in smoking cessation counseling when an “opt-out” referral approach was implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is compared to a 23% enrolment rate observed when hospitalized patients were referred to the same program using “opt-in” approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of telephone counseling trials found positive effects for interventions involving multiple sessions of proactive counseling compared with self-help or single-session brief counseling (relative risk [RR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.20–1.66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par45">Cost is a significant barrier to smoking cessation from the patient perspective. A study of 1400 hospitalized smokers in Ontario, Canada, by our research team found that 50% of participants belonged to the bottom two income quintiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Systematic review and meta-analysis data have shown full coverage of the cost of NRT, compared to no coverage, to increase quit attempts (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.17; 4 trials) and abstinence (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37–2.28; 6 trials) in non-ED patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Even partial coverage has led to greater quitting compared to no coverage (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02–1.59; 5 trials). A systematic review examining the use of incentives (e.g., cash payments, gift cards) aimed at prompting or reinforcing smoking cessation among non-ED populations found that, compared to controls, smokers who received incentives were more likely to be abstinent for at least six months (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.19–1.69; 17 trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Unpublished pilot data from our group found that 43% of patients who initially reported they were not planning to quit smoking changed their status to ready after being offered coverage for their NRT in the form of a gift card, suggesting that incentives may be an important motivator among clinical populations (Mullen KA, Langevin E, Walker K, Noble S, Martin N, Reid RD: Nicotine replacement therapy “gift cards” as incentives to help smokers quit: a pilot study, unpublished). To date, the coverage of NRT or the use of incentives (e.g., gift cards) for smoking cessation has not been tested in the ED setting.</p>
                  <p id="Par46">The evidence-based, proactive tobacco treatment intervention described in this protocol will be evaluated to inform future cessation interventions for smokers presenting to Canadian EDs. We propose a trial of high quality and generalizability that addresses many of the limitations and barriers faced by patients and staff of EDs. Our intervention (an NRT gift card called a “Quit Card” and proactive enrolment in behavioral support) has been designed to optimize uptake and smoking abstinence by including the most effective evidence-based behavioral and pharmacological approaches, removing specific challenges that smokers face when trying to quit (e.g., affordability, low confidence, and motivation), while packaging the intervention in a quick-to-initiate manner, making it ideal for fast-paced, complex ED environments.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par69">The quit card intervention (QCI) has been designed to optimize cessation outcomes. It has been shown that passive approaches (e.g., handing brochures) to tobacco treatment interventions for clinical populations result in lower rates of quitting (from 2.6 to 11.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. When medication and behavioral support are combined, long-term (≥6 months) abstinence rates approach 25–30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A “Quit Card” (STI Technologies, Halifax, Canada) to pay for NRT products was selected as (1) it reduces the barrier of cost for the participant; (2) it is a simple way to deliver intervention for the fast-paced ED; (3) hospitals do not have to worry about the storage and distribution of NRT product; (4) the program is only charged for the actual amount of product purchased by the patient; therefore, any unused value on the card is not wasted and can be applied to help more patients; (5) the card is programmed to pay for only NRT-specific Natural Health Product Numbers; (6) pharmacies process the card the same way they would any other health benefits insurance card; and (7) card-use, including date, location, NRT type, dose, and cost are tracked in real time.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">A recent evaluation of a Quit Card pilot program for hospitalized smokers in Ontario, Canada, reported that out of 5722 individuals who received a $450 Quit Card, 70.2% used it and when used, &gt;90% of its value was spent (Mullen KA, Langevin E, Walker K, Noble S, Martin N, Reid RD: Nicotine replacement therapy “gift cards” as incentives to help smokers quit: a pilot study, unpublished). The self-reported abstinence rate at 1 month was significantly higher among the subsample of participants that received the Quit Card (<italic>n</italic>=143) compared to a pre-incentive control (<italic>n</italic>=128) that did not (48% vs. 29%; OR 5.6 [2.5–12.5]; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>= 30.6). Even among participants who indicated that they were “not ready” to quit, &gt;50% redeemed their card for NRT and close to 30% reported abstinence at 1 month. Of those who received a Quit Card, 76% engaged in behavioral support, compared to 31% of controls (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>=53.6; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001).</p>

QCI participants will have up to 2 months from study entry to use the full value of their Quit Card to encourage quit attempts. If a participant’s Quit Card expires before they use the full value and they would like to continue NRT, it will be possible for the study counselor to extend the expiration date. The study counselor will call QCI participants within the first week of study entry to initiate the behavioral support. Participants will receive at least four additional proactive (live) counseling calls, plus three automated calls or emails (based on participant preference) over 6 months (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). During the counseling calls, the counselor will use standard follow-up protocols based on established baseline treatment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

                  <p id="Par74">The proposed intervention of the use of NRT for participants allocated to the QCI group is considered low risk. A systematic review and meta-analysis (92 RCTs, 28 observational trials) reported NRT patch-use was associated with increased skin irritation (OR 2.80, 95% CI, 2.28–3.24) and oral NRTs associated with mouth and throat soreness (OR 1.87, 95% CI, 1.36–2.57), mouth ulcers (OR 1.49, 95% CI, 1.05–2.20), hiccups (OR 7.68, 95% CI, 4.59–12.85), and coughing (OR 2.89, 95% CI, 1.92–4.33) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A network meta-analysis (21 RCTs) found no evidence of increased risk of serious cardiovascular events with NRT (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.26–4.30); however, it did report an elevated risk, mostly due to less serious events such as heart palpitations (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.39–3.82) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These reported risks are irrefutably much lower than those associated with continued smoking.

Using logistic regression, with 905 participants assigned in a 1:1 allocation to the two groups, we will have 80% power to detect a clinically important 5% difference in smoking abstinence rates between the QCI and UC groups and &gt;90% power to detect a 10% difference (two-sided test; alpha = 0.05). While we have included features to minimize attrition, we have increased our sample to account for a 25% loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; therefore, we intend to recruit 1208 participants to allow for per-protocol analyses.</p>

We will have &gt;90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.45 for death.

                  <p id="Par93">On average, 70,000 patients visit each participating ED annually, of which approximately 13,000 are current smokers. Each participating hospital will see 20–25 potential participants during “daytime” shifts (7am–7pm) or two per hour. Based on unpublished pilot data gathered from the TOH Civic campus ED in April 2017, 58% of smoking participants who were approached with a “Quit Card” in the waiting area accepted the intervention. Therefore, we estimate that our RC will spend 5 h per day, 5 days per week recruiting participants into both treatment arms of the trial. With approximately 9 smokers every 5 h, we expect that on average 5 smokers per day will be eligible and will consent to participate. Recruitment is expected to take 14 months.</p>

For each new participant, the RC will select the next available kit in the corresponding CTAS level box. Participants will be asked to wait until after the RC has left to open their kits in order to maintain blinding. For those in the QCI group, their Quit Card will need to be registered upon study entry. To maintain RC blinding, each kit (both UC and QCI) will have a sticker on the outside envelope printed with a unique and random card registration number. The RC will enter this number into the Quit Card online portal. Numbers corresponding to true Quit Cards will register the cards, allowing the patient to purchase their NRT. Numbers corresponding to UC kits will be “dummy” codes that when entered into the portal will lead to no further action. Since the RC will not be able to explain the contents of the kits to study participants, both QCI and UC kits will contain simple instructions and contact information for the unblinded research manager if additional questions arise.</p>

Blinded research assistants will assess outcomes at week 4 by telephone and weeks 26, 52, and 104 in person. Smoking status will be assessed initially by a self-report of point prevalence abstinence (“Have you used any form of tobacco, even a puff, in the past 7 days?”) and confirmed via expired CO concentration testing using a CO meter. CO levels below 4 ppm will be considered confirmatory of non-smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par100">Secondary outcomes related to smoking behavior will be collected by survey and will be gathered in accordance with data-standard guidelines developed by the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]: “How many cigarettes do you smoke per day on the days that you smoke?”; “In the past number of weeks, how many times did you stop smoking for over 24 hours because you were trying to quit?”. To evaluate health services outcomes, participant data will be individually linked to healthcare administrative databases at IC/ES using a unique Ontario Health Insurance Plan number. Mortality data will be acquired through the Registered Persons Database, ED-use data through the Canadian Institutes of Health Information (CIHI)’s National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, and hospital admissions through CIHI’s Discharge Abstract Database. To assess cost-effectiveness, costs associated with the delivery of both the QCI and UC conditions will be gathered. Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained will be calculated using HR-QoL, collected with the EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level survey (EQ-5D-5L).</p>
                  <p id="Par101">Satisfaction and perceived program barriers and facilitators will be assessed for both patients (at 26 weeks) and providers (at the end of each ED’s recruitment period) by open-ended survey questions asked to participants during the 26-week survey.</p>

The baseline questionnaire will be completed over the telephone, and the intervention will be randomly allocated in the same manner as previously planned, with the RC selecting the next available kit in the corresponding CTAS box. The RC will mail each participant their kit along with a copy of their informed consent form and will register the unique card number online into the Quit Card portal. For QCI group participants only, registration of the card number will activate their Quit Card and will lead to an electronic Quit Card being emailed to the study counselor. The counselor will then email the e-card to the participant and initiate the behavioral support.</p>
                <p id="Par125">Follow-up surveys will also be completed by telephone, and only those participants who self-report smoking abstinence at 26 weeks will be asked to complete a CO test to limit potential exposures.</p>

                  <title>CO monitoring</title>
                  <p id="Par126">Extra precautions will be taken when performing exhaled CO tests with study participants. Medical-grade face masks, gloves, and a face shield shall always be worn by study staff to protect both themselves and participants. The CO monitor will only be handled by study staff wearing gloves, and the study team member performing the CO test will hold the device for the participant when they are blowing into the device (the device will never be handled by participants). The study team member performing the CO test will thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water immediately before and after performing the CO test, and the device will be wiped down with non-alcoholic antibacterial or viral wipes after each breath test. The device being used for this study is the Covita Micro+ Smokerlyzer. This device uses single-use mouthpieces containing a one-way valve and infection control filter that has been proven to remove and trap 99% of airborne bacteria and 96.5% of airborne viruses. The device’s single-use mouthpieces have been tested to filter viruses as small as 23 nanometres in diameter; therefore, theoretically, the mouthpiece should be effective at filtering out the COVID-19 virus particle which has been measured to have an approximate diameter of 125 nm, although testing of the single-use mouthpieces against COVID-19 has yet to be done.
