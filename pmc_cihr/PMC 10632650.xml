                  <p>A large proportion of youth with chronic conditions have mental health comorbidities. However, the effect of these comorbidities on paediatric‚Äìadult transition readiness, and the relevance of widely used tools for measuring transition readiness, are unknown.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The objectives of this study were to describe and explore the transition readiness of youth with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions using a combination of quantitative data obtained from participants completing the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and qualitative data.</p>

                  <title>Design and Participants</title>
                  <p>A three‚Äêphase sequential explanatory mixed methods design was employed, with the qualitative strand taking priority. First, the TRAQ scores (range 1‚Äì5) of youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ61) enroled in a multisite randomized controlled trial were measured, followed by qualitative interviews with a sample of youth (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ9) to explain the quantitative results. Results from both strands were then integrated, yielding comprehensive insights.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Median TRAQ scores ranged from 2.86 on the appointment keeping subscale to 5.00 on the talking with providers subscale. The qualitative results uncovered the complexities faced by this group concerning the impact of a mental health comorbidity on transition readiness and self‚Äêmanagement skills across TRAQ domains. The integrated findings identified a diverse and highly individualized set of strengths and challenges amongst this group that did not align with overarching patterns as measured by the TRAQ.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This mixed methods study generated novel understandings about how youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions develop competencies related to self‚Äêcare, self‚Äêadvocacy and self‚Äêmanagement in preparation for paediatric‚Äìadult service transitions. Results demonstrated the assessment of transition readiness using a generic scale does not address the nuanced and complex needs of youth with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions. Our findings suggest tailoring transition readiness practices for this group based on youths' own goals, symptoms, coping mechanisms and resources.</p>

YARP members were aged 18‚Äì30 years, resided in Canada and had lived experience transitioning from pediatric to adult health/mental health services. Further details about the formation, onboarding and processes of YARP engagement have been previously described.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Several opportunities and possible tasks for YARP members according to the study phase were agreed upon by the YARP in a team discussion.

                <p>Phase 1 involved a secondary analysis of data collected for the TNT, a trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a patient navigator for youth with chronic conditions transitioning to adult health care in Alberta.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Though the methods and results of our phase 1 analysis have been published elsewhere,<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> an overview of information relevant to the mixed methods design follows. Eligible participants for this secondary analysis: (i) were between 16 and 18 years old; (ii) were followed in a chronic disease clinic at one of the three study sites; (iii) identified as having a mental health comorbidity; (iv) resided in Alberta; (v) were expected to transfer to an adult specialist and (vi) had to have completed the TRAQ and baseline demographic forms at study enrolment. Individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD), or chronic health/mental health conditions only (but not both), were excluded from the phase 1 cohort given our study's objective of examining transition readiness in youth with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions and the fact that many youth with IDD in our sample did not complete the TRAQ for themselves. While a total of 334 patients were enroled in the TNT, 61 individuals met inclusion criteria for this secondary analysis.</p>
                <p>All phase 1 participants completed the TRAQ<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> at study enrolment.

In phase 2, qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of youth with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions aged 16‚Äì20 were conducted to explore the impact of their mental health on transition readiness and self‚Äêmanagement skills (e.g., communicating with providers, managing medications). Participants were selected based on their age, gender and diagnoses, allowing for a range of experiences to be captured. We aimed to recruit between 10 and 15 participants for phase 2 based on prior literature.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> However, data collection and analysis co‚Äêoccurred, and we ceased recruitment efforts once our research question had been addressed,<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> resulting in nine participants.</p>
                <p>Telephone or videoconference interviews lasting between 45 and 60‚Äâmin were held with participants using a semistructured guide co‚Äêdeveloped with the YARP.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Given this study adopted a sequential explanatory design, the quantitative results informed the qualitative interview questions, allowing us to build on the phase 1 findings. The narratives of youth were elicited to help provide explanations for the phase 1 median TRAQ subscale scores. Phase 2 participants reviewed the TRAQ in advance of the interviews to consider their own readiness for adult care and how their mental health influenced preparedness to engage in tasks associated with each subscale domain.

The YARP offered feedback on the codes, themes and visuals using various methods, including verbal input in meetings, written comments on a shared document, brainstorming activities using a Google Jamboard, reflexive journal entries/memos and/or by email. Each team member brought their own experiences and perspectives into the analytic process and the senior author was available to resolve conflicts (though this was not required). Through collaborative and reflexive group discussions and using the aforementioned methods, the team developed the resulting themes and subthemes.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>

                <title>Phase 3: Integration</title>
                <p>There were two points of integration during this study: during data collection and data analysis. The results from the descriptive analysis of the TRAQ scores in phase 1 guided the types of questions asked during the qualitative interviews in phase 2. Specifically, youth were invited to reflect on which areas of the TRAQ (e.g., managing medications, talking with providers) they felt most/least confident in, allowing for comparison with the median TRAQ subscale scores from phase 1. The second point of integration took place during data analysis at the reporting level.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> We integrated the findings through narrative using a weaving approach whereby the quantitative and qualitative findings were described together according to the theme.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The narrative was developed by reflecting on how both data sources could be used in a complementary fashion to contribute to newfound understandings about the ways in which youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions prepare for the transition. The resulting integrated themes were guided by the concepts assessed in each of the five TRAQ subscale domains. Finally, we developed side‚Äêby‚Äêside presentations and joint displays in partnership with the YARP to illustrate the similarities and differences between the two data sources according to the TRAQ domain.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>

                <p>There was some discordance<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> between the phase 1 and phase 2 results regarding the impact of a mental health comorbidity on transition readiness. Several youth described developing transition readiness as a result of overcoming mental health challenges, engaging with a series of care providers (including mental health providers) and practicing self‚Äêmanagement skills in therapy which aligns with our phase 1 findings. However, the qualitative interviews also revealed many youth with mental health comorbidities found their mental health symptoms impeded their ability to communicate with care providers, take ownership of their care and independently navigate a new system. The two data sources used in this study, which reveal at times conflicting results, underscore the complexity of developing transition readiness while living with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions. The integrated results according to the TRAQ subscale are presented below and juxtaposed findings from phases 1 and 2, including demonstrative quotes, are illustrated in Table¬†<xref rid="hex13821-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>

                  <title>Managing medications</title>
                  <p>Many phase 2 participants indicated feeling confident in managing their medications, whether for their chronic health condition, mental health condition or both, which aligns with the high phase 1 median TRAQ subscale score of 4.00 (see Figure¬†<xref rid="hex13821-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). During the qualitative interviews, youth described using adaptive strategies including apps and symptom trackers to assist them in managing their medications. Participants described high levels of confidence in refilling and taking their prescriptions independently because most had been on their medications since childhood. Administering their own medications appeared to be one of the first tasks youth took responsibility for in preparation for transition due to the complexity of their regimens (e.g., steroids and anti‚Äêdepressants). While the diversity of experience reflected by the TRAQ subscale score for medication management is identified in the IQR associated with the median score (IQR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.75), the phase 2 interviews illuminate some specific and unique challenges faced by individuals with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions in this area.</p>

                  <p>First, participants described how certain mental health symptoms (e.g., low mood, lack of motivation, inability to focus) affected their capacity to fill prescriptions and independently adhere to medication regimens. Next, two youths described the negative effects of their medications on their mental health, and the specific side effects they observed, including nightmares, withdrawal and depression resulting in the exacerbation of existing mental health symptoms. In addition, several of the youth were prescribed medications (e.g., antidepressants, antianxiety medications) for the management of their mental health, indicating a daily treatment regimen consisting of multiple medications. Taken together, these points reveal the active steps taken by this group to take ownership of medication management in preparation for adult care, while illuminating the complexities they experience regarding treatment regimens and side effects.</p>

                  <title>Appointment keeping</title>
                  <p>The median TRAQ appointment keeping subscale score of 2.86 represented the lowest score of all five subscales in the phase 1 sample. The phase 2 results are in alignment with this finding and help to explain why individuals with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions may exhibit lower readiness in this domain. The majority of phase 2 participants expressed the impact of their mental health symptoms, namely anxiety, disorientation and ‚Äòfeeling stuck‚Äô, on their appointment attendance and appointment keeping capacities (see Figure¬†<xref rid="hex13821-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The examples and experiences of the youth interviewed bring voice to the ways that tracking, remembering and physically getting to and from appointments can be complicated by the presence of a mental health comorbidity.</p>

                  <p>One youth, for instance, described a lack of motivation to write down appointments and develop a routine for tracking clinic visits as a result of her depression. Taking on this responsibility for the first time in the adult healthcare system without the support of her parents, while simultaneously coping with mental health challenges, complicated the process of tracking and scheduling appointments independently. Another phase 2 participant described the commonly held sentiment of being ‚Äòa little bit scared‚Äô on her way to her first adult neurology clinic appointment. She then elaborated on how her anxiety exacerbated these symptoms and created feelings of pressure regarding the transition to a new provider. This resulted in the youth getting disoriented and overwhelmed as she navigated public transit, adding to the pre‚Äêexisting fears associated with attending an appointment independently.</p>
                  <p>The only TRAQ question which addresses the concept of getting to and from appointments as youth prepare to take ownership over this domain is ‚ÄòDo you arrange for your ride to medical appointments?‚Äô.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The interview results illuminate the series of challenges experienced by youth with co‚Äêoccurring diagnoses regarding appointment attendance, including social anxiety while on public transit, that would not have been apparent based on a score of 1‚Äì5 on this subscale.</p>

                  <p>Keeping track of symptoms, completing medical history forms and maintaining a calendar for medical appointments were all skills endorsed by the phase 2 participants in this study. In fact, many phase 2 participants described confidence in their capacities related to the TRAQ ‚Äòtracking health issues‚Äô domain. Furthermore, none of the phase 2 participants outlined this as an area of weakness related to their transition readiness (see Figure¬†<xref rid="hex13821-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The phase 1 median tracking health issues subscale score of 3.75 indicates some discrepancies between the results from phase 2, wherein youth expressed confidence in this domain. The experiences and strategies highlighted by the sample of phase 2 youth could help clarify and account for this finding.</p>

                  <p>To keep track of the variety of symptoms youth were experiencing related to their chronic health and/or mental health conditions, many Phase 2 participants described using organizational tools, including ‚Äòpersonal health journals‚Äô, ‚Äòthe MyHealth app‚Äô, ‚Äòonline tools for medication and symptom tracking‚Äô and ‚Äòcalendars for appointment keeping‚Äô. These strategies may be particularly useful for individuals with multiple diagnoses; indeed, all nine interview participants endorsed having at least two (and up to eight) diagnoses. The presence of many chronic conditions necessitates the value of organizational tools to manage symptoms, medications and appointments, especially as youth begin taking ownership of their care in preparation for transition to adult services. It is worth noting that all but one interview participant endorsed being diagnosed with anxiety. The slightly higher proportion of individuals with anxiety in phase 2 compared to those in phase 1 could help explain why there is greater confidence in tracking health issues than would be expected based on the phase 1 results. It is also possible that youth in phase 2 had more manageable levels of anxiety and/or developed more adaptive coping strategies for tracking their health issues, specifically, than those in phase 1.</p>
                  <p>The combination of results from phases 1 and 2 regarding tracking health issues indicates that factors including the number of comorbidities, complexity and rarity of one's diagnosis(es), and the severity of mental health symptoms influence the ways in which youth track their symptoms and their comfort level in describing their medical history to providers. Appreciating these multifactorial implications on transition readiness would not have been possible looking at the TRAQ tracking health issues subscale scores in isolation.</p>

                  <title>Talking with providers</title>
                  <p>The phase 1 results indicated that youth were more confident in talking to providers than any other subscale, with a median score of 5.00 (the maximum possible score for a subscale). As such, there were some unexpected findings arising from the qualitative interviews which counter this level of confidence in communicating with providers.</p>
                  <p>Some youth in phase 2 expressed feeling very comfortable talking with clinicians, asking questions and describing their symptoms (see Figure¬†<xref rid="hex13821-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These results align closely with the phase 1 findings regarding a high level of confidence for youth with co‚Äêoccurring diagnoses in this domain. There were a number of examples provided by interview participants to elucidate reasons for this. For instance, ‚Äòhaving multiple chronic illnesses‚Äô and ‚Äòbeing exposed to a variety of providers‚Äô helped the youth ‚Äòbuild up courage‚Äô to ‚Äòvocalize [their] pain and health history‚Äô. As aptly shared by one participant, ‚Äòpractice [communicating with health care providers] makes perfect‚Äô. Some youth explained how they learned to advocate for their mental health needs which enhanced their comfort in talking with providers. Others felt their ability to be ‚Äòintrospective‚Äô regarding their mental health allowed them to articulate their feelings with confidence in clinical encounters.</p>

                  <p>An unexpected finding arising during the integration of data sources specific to this domain related to the ways in which mental health comorbidities made communicating with providers more challenging. In fact, several youths interviewed expressed a lack of confidence in communicating with their care teams, primarily in relation to their mental health. For some youth, a hesitancy to express their true feelings, particularly related to depression, for fear of disappointing providers contributed to this lack of confidence.</p>
                  <p>For others, the symptoms of generalized and/or social anxiety made talking with clinicians without caregivers present for the first time stressful. Some youth described the incapacitating effects of anxiety on communicating with care providers. Fears about not having the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô answers, not sharing enough information or not asking the right questions during appointments with new adult care providers were exacerbated by pre‚Äêexisting anxiety for many youths. They explained the pressure they felt to perform in adult care and how, at times, this pressure led to them shutting down and ‚Äògoing completely silent‚Äô so as not to say the wrong thing.</p>
                  <p>Given the incongruence between the phase 1 and 2 results in this domain, it is possible the two TRAQ questions focused on communication are not sufficiently capturing this phenomenon for youth with co‚Äêoccurring diagnoses. While phase 1 participants expressed confidence via their TRAQ subscale scores, youths' experiences indicate the importance of exploring whether youth feel their opinions are valued by providers and their comfort in advocating for their needs and asking questions above and beyond the TRAQ subscale questions.</p>

The relatively high TRAQ subscale score indicates youth with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions in phase 1 were confident managers of their daily activities, including preparing meals, doing household chores, and using neighbourhood services.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This patient‚Äêoriented, mixed methods study aimed to understand the transition readiness of youth with co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions utilizing a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. The phase 1 results, which indicate relatively high TRAQ subscale scores, underscore the role of resilience within this population, whereas phase 2 highlights the criticality of understanding each youth's individual experiences, symptoms, coping strategies and available supports as they relate to transition preparedness. The integrated phase 3 findings necessitate individualized approaches to transition planning which use a combination of readiness assessments, in‚Äêdepth conversations and tailored resources given the complexity of this group's needs.</p>
              <p>In combining the findings from phases 1 and 2, it became apparent that a transition readiness score using a well‚Äêvalidated tool is insufficient to capture the breadth of factors contributing to self‚Äêmanagement and preparedness for adult care for youth with co‚Äêoccurring health and mental health conditions. It is evident that transition readiness encompasses a variety of skills, capacities, experiences and system‚Äêlevel factors that may be difficult to address in a single readiness assessment for this group. As has been described by Straus,<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> assessing transition readiness using a tool like the TRAQ may not adequately capture the evolving and multidimensional nature of this concept and the daily realities of youth preparing for adult care. Thus, there is congruence between this study's findings and Straus' ideas surrounding the challenges associated with measuring transition readiness.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Indeed, our results suggest that the TRAQ may not be sensitive to individual characteristics related to transition readiness for youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions, including the impact of fluctuating mental health symptoms on chronic condition management. In order for clinical decisions and transition plans to be person‚Äêcentered, the administration of this tool should be complemented with discussions between youth, families and care providers about self‚Äêmanagement, self‚Äêadvocacy and youths' own priorities for transition.</p>
              <p>Though the influence of a mental health comorbidity on transition readiness in youth with chronic conditions exiting pediatric care has not been specifically investigated in the literature, research has examined aspects of self‚Äêmanagement amongst individuals with multimorbidity (i.e., the presence of ‚â•2 chronic conditions).<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> The presence of emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) often impairs physical functioning and frequently affects activities of daily living including tasks associated with self‚Äêmanagement in adults with multimorbidity.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Furthermore, this group is known to experience the compounding nature of physical and emotional symptoms which results in larger negative impacts on their lives and daily routines, echoing the present study's findings.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Our study adds to this body of knowledge by exploring how these concomitant symptoms influence youths' capacities for self‚Äêcare during a developmental period in which they are expected to assume greater responsibility for activities of daily living, appointment scheduling and transportation.</p>
              <p>Mental health problems fluctuate, thus the need for support with managing daily activities from healthcare providers, family members and/or peers may wax and wane depending on the acuity of mental health symptoms for youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions. The TRAQ, as it is currently worded, does not capture possible temporal variations in readiness based on vacillating symptoms given the questions are prefaced by the following statement: ‚ÄòPlease check the box that describes your skill level in the following areas that are important for transition to adult health care‚Äô.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Without probing qualitatively into the specific interactions between health, mental health, and daily activities, the TRAQ subscale score alone may present an incomplete picture of transition readiness as it relates to this domain for youth with co‚Äêoccurring diagnoses. For instance, our qualitative interviews revealed the criticality of clinicians exploring how hobbies, schoolwork or chores are impacted by the manifestation of co‚Äêoccurring chronic health and mental health conditions.</p>
              <p>While first‚Äêtime interactions with adult healthcare providers are anxiety‚Äêprovoking for the majority of youth with chronic health conditions,<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> this study's qualitative data provided greater depth to the TRAQ scores and illustrated the additional barriers experienced by youth with pre‚Äêexisting mental health conditions, such as social anxiety in anticipation of appointments. Our integrated insights indicate possible considerations for clinicians supporting youth to develop their confidence across TRAQ domains. These include: practicing communication skills in a scaffolded fashion in pediatric care (i.e., first with caregivers present and then independently once youth develop confidence) for youth with particular mental health comorbidities, providing additional support with managing appointments and targeted strategies to assist with remembering appointments, planning for and physically getting to appointments and practicing scheduling before transfer to reduce some of the pressure of the first adult visit.</p>
              <p>Barriers and facilitators to medication adherence have been well studied amongst individuals with multiple chronic conditions across the lifespan;<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> however, this study expands our understanding of multimorbidity and medication adherence during pediatric‚Äìadult service transitions. Prior research demonstrates that adherence to prescribed medications in older adults with multimorbidity is suboptimal, possibly due to the complexity of their treatment regimens, the number of medications and the costs of filling prescriptions.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Youth in the current study did not cite financial barriers or the number of medications as impacting their adherence to treatment. They did, however, describe challenges with managing their medications while experiencing mental health symptoms, including forgetfulness and disruptions to daily routines. Our results demonstrate the utility of care providers inviting youth to expand on their medication management strategies in clinical encounters and encouraging them to reflect on how their mental health affects these practices, especially when taking on these roles for the first time in preparation for the adult healthcare system.</p>
              <p>The ability to self‚Äêadvocate through communicating one's needs to healthcare providers is a core component of successful chronic condition self‚Äêmanagement.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> In fact, evidence suggests that individuals with health or mental health conditions who openly communicate with healthcare providers and express their treatment preferences obtain more information to support decision making and experience fewer symptoms.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> While our phase 1 results demonstrated youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions were confident in talking with providers, there was dissonance between the phase 1 and phase 2 findings surrounding this domain. Some youth felt greater courage and insight into articulating their emotional needs as a result of engaging with mental health providers; however, the qualitative findings also revealed that the presence of a mental health comorbidity made communicating one's needs independently in adult care difficult in certain instances. For instance, phase 2 participants described feeling immobilized, fearful of responding incorrectly to questions and lacking the organizational skills to take in large amounts of information independently when severe anxiety or ADHD symptoms were present. This speaks to the challenges of applying median TRAQ scores to individual youth with unique experiences, coping strategies and mental health symptoms. It also underscores the inherent limitations of self‚Äêreported surveys like the TRAQ, including social desirability bias.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>The phase 2 results are largely consistent with prior research in the adult population which identified that feelings of hopelessness, high levels of emotional distress and fears of wasting healthcare providers' time were barriers to effective communication and self‚Äêadvocacy in patient‚Äìprovider interactions.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> The present study expands on the literature in this field by focusing specifically on the impact of co‚Äêoccurring physical and mental health symptoms on one's ability to ask questions, respond to provider questions and articulate one's needs while adapting to newfound responsibility in the adult healthcare system. Phase 2 findings demonstrated that while extensive experience interacting with different service providers may enhance feelings of preparedness to communicate with care teams, mental health symptoms also contributed to feelings of pressure, worry about wasting providers' time or not having the appropriate responses to provider questions.</p>
              <p>The progression of self‚Äêmanagement, communication and advocacy skills in youth transitioning to adult care is dependent upon a series of interwoven factors ranging from one's mental health symptoms, familial support, the complexity of their chronic condition(s) and their relationships with care providers, all of which are endorsed in the social‚Äêecological model of adolescent and young adult readiness for transition.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This study's integrated insights underscore the limitations associated with self‚Äêreported surveys administered at singular time points to measure complex concepts, like transition readiness. Fluctuating symptoms, for instance, cannot be captured within a cross‚Äêsectional survey. Indeed, inherent difficulties exist with using an average transition readiness assessment score to condense the totality of a youth's experience, including sociodemographic background, relationships, beliefs, culture and community connectedness.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Our findings demonstrate that tools like the TRAQ should be used cautiously to guide clinical care, given transition plans should be personalized according to need. This study highlights the benefits of using qualitative and mixed methods approaches to elicit nuanced understandings of how preparedness for adult care is shaped by the presence of mental health comorbidities. Further research using multiple data sources is needed to develop transition readiness tools and person‚Äêcentered interventions for youth with co‚Äêoccurring health and mental health conditions.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>These findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, selection bias<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> may have occurred in both phases 1 and 2 of this research. In phase 1, the data were obtained through a randomized controlled trial and did not represent a random sample of the general population. It is possible that the presence of severe mental health symptoms at the time of study recruitment (e.g., active psychosis or suicidality), for instance, precluded some youth from enroling in the trial. In Phase 2, those who agreed to participate in a qualitative interview may have been more organized and/or motivated than those in the phase 1 sample, contributing to possible differences in readiness across the two cohorts. Regarding the qualitative sample, it is possible that the experiences of youth with differing diagnoses, cultural and/or socioeconomic backgrounds could have strengthened this research by contributing new perspectives on this topic. It should be noted, however, that a demographically and clinically diverse sample of youth was obtained, and that the richness of the qualitative data<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> guided the decision to cease recruitment efforts.</p>
                <p>There was slight variation in the age ranges of participants in phases 1 and 2 of this research and the qualitative participants were not recruited from the quantitative sample which could contribute to inconsistencies between the quantitative and qualitative results. Phase 1 participants were between ages 16‚Äì18 (pretransfer) given the eligibility criteria for the TNT and the fact that baseline TRAQ scores (which were administered at the time of enrolment) were used in the descriptive analysis. This group's TRAQ scores, therefore, measured perceived and not actual levels of readiness given they had not yet transferred to adult care. Phase 2 participants ranged from 16 to 20 years old. It is possible the older participants who had more time to adapt to the adult system contributed to this sample appearing more prepared than those in phase 1; however, older age has been associated with greater readiness as measured by the TRAQ in the literature.<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13821-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> Though youth did reflect back on their levels of preparedness (as opposed to current readiness), which partly addressed this limitation, this may have been challenging for those with memory issues within our sample.</p>
                <p>While youth in phases 1 and 2 self‚Äêreported their mental health diagnoses, they were not asked to define the prominence, degree or severity of their symptoms, nor their coping strategies for managing these symptoms. Given the potentially important roles of symptom severity and coping in transition readiness,<xref rid="hex13821-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> future research should continue to investigate these concepts using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. Finally, the version of the TRAQ used in this study was developed in the United States before the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic. As such, certain questions (e.g., regarding insurance) were less relevant to youth in Canada where this study took place. The impact of COVID‚Äê19 on transition readiness and the refinement of existing tools to capture the nuances of virtual service delivery, for instance, should be considered in future research.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>This patient‚Äêoriented, mixed methods study yielded novel insights about how youth with co‚Äêoccurring conditions develop competencies related to self‚Äêcare, self‚Äêadvocacy and self‚Äêmanagement in preparation for service transitions. It illuminated the impact of mental health comorbidities on transition readiness in youth with chronic conditions using TRAQ subscale scores and qualitative interviews. Our results suggest that while instruments like the TRAQ may be useful for examining a group's average transition readiness (e.g., in assessing an intervention designed to improve transition readiness), they should not be used to guide individual decisions in the absence of in‚Äêdepth conversations with youth. Individualized transition plans should be developed in partnership with youth to address their goals, mental health symptoms, coping strategies and available support.</p>
