                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>High maternal mortality from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia results from lack of early identification and management of pregnant women at high-risk for pre-eclampsia. A potential tool to support pregnant women at high-risk for pre-eclampsia is telemonitoring. There is limited evidence on the use and effectiveness of telemonitoring for pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) which limits the understanding of the process and mechanisms through which the intervention works in LMICs. This study will explore the feasibility of implementing a mobile phone-based telemonitoring programme for pregnant women at high-risk for pre-eclampsia in Karachi, Pakistan.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A convergent mixed-methods study will be conducted at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC) in Karachi, Pakistan. This study will recruit 50 pregnant women at high-risk for pre-eclampsia to assess clinical feasibility across the five foci of Bowen’s framework including acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality and limited-efficacy testing. Data sources will include semi-structured interviews with the enrolled women, caregivers and clinicians, as well as quantitative data from paper medical records, research logs and server data. The quantitative and qualitative data will be analysed separately and then integrated at the interpretation and reporting levels to advance our understanding of the telemonitoring programme’s feasibility across the five areas of Bowen’s framework.</p>

                  <p>Ethics approvals have been obtained from JPMC, the National Bioethics Committee of Pakistan, University Health Network, Aga Khan University and the University of Toronto. The study results will be disseminated to the scientific community through publications and conference presentations. Findings of the study will provide evidence on the feasibility of using a telemonitoring programme where pregnant women at high-risk for pre-eclampsia in Pakistan will take their own blood pressure readings at home. Lessons learnt in this feasibility trial will be used to determine the appropriateness of a future effectiveness trial.</p>

              <p>Hypertension is the most common medical condition encountered during pregnancy, occurring in approximately 6–8% of the pregnancies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The spectrum of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy includes chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In particular, pre-eclampsia affects between 3–5% of the pregnancies and is one of the main causes of maternal and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy that is characterised by high blood pressure and protein in the urine after 20 weeks of gestation. It is associated with high maternal mortality, preterm birth, pregnancy loss and stillbirth.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia are at increased risk for stroke and damage to vital organs such as kidneys, liver and brain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In severe cases, pre-eclampsia can lead to eclampsia which is the presence of seizures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This condition could also lead to the separation of the placenta from the uterus (referred to as placental abruption).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In addition, the risk for anxiety and depression is increased in pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Infants born preterm due to pre-eclampsia are at higher risk of mortality and long-term health issues including learning disorders, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, deafness and blindness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref></p>
              <p>Pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are seven times more likely to develop pre-eclampsia compared with those living in high-income countries, and their mortality rates are much higher, with 10–25% of these cases resulting in maternal death.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Pakistan has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios worldwide at 178 per 100 000 live births<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and neonatal mortality ratios at 42 per 1000 live births.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Eclampsia accounts for more than 12% of the direct maternal deaths in Pakistan.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Deaths from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia represent one-third of the maternal deaths reported at tertiary care hospitals.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> High maternal mortality from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia results from: (1) lack of early identification and treatment of high-risk pregnant women, (2) difficulties in reaching treatment centres and (3) poor health-seeking behaviours linked with low patient health education.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>A potential tool to support pregnant women at high-risk for pre-eclampsia (HRPE) is telemonitoring, which refers to the use of information technology to monitor patients at a distance.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Women at HRPE would take home blood pressure readings and record self-reported symptoms related to pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, and the data would be sent to clinicians in real-time.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 13–22</xref> Telemonitoring is a promising tool to improve pregnant women’s health outcomes from pre-eclampsia, as well as quality and coordination of care in a cost-effective and scalable manner.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12 16 17 20 23</xref> Through telemonitoring, clinical alerts can be generated based on the patient’s blood pressure values and symptoms as appropriate, and patients can be sent tailored self-care messages. This could lead to the earliest possible detection of alarming increases in blood pressure, resulting in an early intervention such as through medications, hospitalisation or delivery of the baby.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> In addition, telemonitoring may provide pregnant women at HRPE with the reassurance of clinical oversight and self-care support that may reduce anxiety and stress related to pregnancy and hospitalisation.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>Most telemonitoring interventions have been implemented in high-income countries such as the UK, the USA and Belgium,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 13–19 23</xref> as part of clinical trials and feasibility studies. These studies have reported potential benefits of telemonitoring during pregnancy including fewer hospital visits, better blood pressure control and cost savings.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15 21 22</xref> However, there is scarce evidence on the use and effectiveness of telemonitoring of pregnant women in LMICs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Previous studies in LMICs have implemented telemonitoring by community health workers as part of the Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) trial<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation—Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (COBRA-BPS) studies.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These telemonitoring interventions relied on community health workers to record vital signs on a mobile application during in-person visits, which can miss signs of health issues between physical visits by the community health workers and can also introduce white coat hypertension or masked hypertension.</p>
              <p>This will be the first study to explore the feasibility of using a mobile phone-based telemonitoring programme in an LMIC, where pregnant women at HRPE take their own blood pressure readings at home between antenatal visits. This study aims to explore the following research question: <italic toggle="yes">What is the feasibility of implementing a mobile-based telemonitoring programme in Pakistan to support pregnant women at HRPE?</italic> The objective of this study is to enable early risk detection, diagnosis and treatment of pregnant women at HRPE between antenatal visits and to provide more frequent data than what can be achieved with home visits by community health workers, such as in CLIP and COBRA trials. If this study finds that the telemonitoring programme is feasible, the intent is to conduct a future effectiveness trial. Therefore, this proposed feasibility trial will also include an evaluation of the feasibility of potential metrics and evaluation methods of a future effectiveness trial.</p>

                <p>A convergent mixed-methods design<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> will be used to comprehensively understand the feasibility of the telemonitoring programme. It is anticipated that the feasibility study will be conducted between December 2022 and February 2024, at the obstetrics and gynaecology (OB-GYN) outpatient department of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC), which is a 1650-bed tertiary-level public sector hospital in Karachi (the largest city in Pakistan). A vast majority of high-risk pregnant women of low-socioeconomic status within the region, seek care at JPMC, where annual admissions exceed 26 000, and 19 000 deliveries take place per year.</p>
                <p>The study will recruit approximately 50 pregnant women at HRPE in the telemonitoring programme to assess clinical feasibility across the five foci of Bowen’s framework. A range of qualitative and quantitative measures will be used to determine telemonitoring programme feasibility including telemonitoring adherence rate, recruitment rate, drop-out rate and interviews with enrolled women, caregivers and clinicians to explain quantitative results such as positive and negative exemplars (high and low telemonitoring adherence), outliers and significant findings (telemonitoring efficacy). The results of the quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated at the interpretation and reporting levels.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>

                <title>Study intervention: mobile phone-based telemonitoring programme named ‘Raabta’</title>
                <p>The study intervention will be the telemonitoring programme for high-risk pregnant women, which will be delivered using the telemonitoring platform. The telemonitoring programme is named ‘Raabta’ which means ‘a connection' in Urdu. The Raabta technology has been developed at the Centre for Digital Therapeutics, University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. Hosting of the telemonitoring platform and storage of the study data will be at the Centre for Digital Therapeutics.</p>
                <p>The patient-facing technology includes the Raabta smartphone application (app) and Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure device that is validated for use in pregnancy. The app will enable pregnant women to take daily blood pressure readings at home with a provided Bluetooth-enabled home blood pressure monitor and to receive automated alerts (ie, self-care messages) via the app. The app will use a rules-based algorithm (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>) which was developed using National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and consultations from expert clinicians. The algorithm includes settings to trigger alerts and self-care messages for high-risk pregnant women with or without antihypertensives and symptoms of pre-eclampsia such as taking additional blood pressure readings, calling the medical officer (ie, a medical doctor with postgraduate training completed in OB-GYN field) or visiting the OB-GYN emergency department. Other features of the Raabta app include the use of the local language (Urdu), illustrations for daily symptom monitoring questions (for pregnant women who cannot read), an easy-to-understand green–yellow–red alert system that uses the well-known traffic lights analogy and voice message alerts in conjunction with the text. The features of the technology have been informed by our previous needs assessment study with pregnant women at HRPE and their caregivers.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>

                <p>The clinician-facing technology includes the web-based Raabta dashboard. To support clinical decision-making, the medical officer and research nurse situated at the JPMC OB-GYN outpatient department will receive alerts from the telemonitoring system if the patient’s blood pressure trends are out of the target and/or if the patient is reporting symptoms. The medical officer will act as a central point person to communicate with the patients (via phone calls or using the asynchronous telemonitoring system chat feature) and with the rest of the participant’s care team as needed.</p>
                <p>Preparations for the programme launch will include the development of training materials (user manual and training checklist) for patients as well as for clinicians. The medical officer and research nurse will be trained on the use of the web-based Raabta dashboard prior to recruitment of patients. A full-day training session will be organised for the clinicians to train them on using the Raabta web-based dashboard and the study procedures. Context-specific training plans will be designed to train pregnant women and caregivers on how to use the technology.</p>
                <p>The medical officer and research nurse will train recruited pregnant women at HRPE and their caregivers, if appropriate, on the use of the telemonitoring system at the same antenatal visit at which they have consented to participate in the study. The training session for pregnant women and caregivers will last approximately 1 hour. If the participant owns a compatible smartphone (ie, an Android phone operating a minimum of Android V.5.1.1.), the app will be downloaded onto their phone. Otherwise, a mobile phone will be provided for the duration of the study. Technical support will be available to all participants by the research nurse and the medical officer via a provided phone number. Once at home, participants will be asked to take their blood pressure every morning, and answer symptom questions using the app to receive auto-alerts and self-care messages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). If the participant develops hypertension (systolic between 140 and 154 mm Hg inclusive and diastolic between 90 and 104 mm Hg inclusive), they will be prompted by the app to immediately call a medical officer (ie, the trained physician in Pakistan) and take a second blood pressure measurement in 4–6 hours. If the participant develops severe hypertension (systolic &gt;155 mm Hg and diastolic &gt;105 mm Hg), they will be prompted by the app to immediately visit the emergency department.</p>

Women enrolled in the study will be interviewed in Urdu during a normally scheduled JPMC clinic visit post-delivery. Enrolled women will be purposively sampled for interviews in order to explore perspectives of the following groups: pregnant women with different home supports, age groups, number of pregnancies, positive and negative exemplars (ie, high, and low telemonitoring programme adherence) and significant results (high or low telemonitoring programme efficacy indicated by different health outcomes).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Separate or combined post-study interviews will also be conducted with their partners (almost always male husbands in the Pakistani culture) and/or other caregivers (eg, mother and mother-in-law) in the Urdu language, at the preference of the woman and the caregiver. The interviews with partners and the caregivers will provide insight into the sociocultural barriers and facilitators influencing pregnancy care, which can further current research reporting that the inclusion of male partners in Pakistan resulted in a substantial increase in antenatal care uptake.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Post-study clinicians’ interviews will be conducted in English to explore the experience of the implementation of Raabta.</p>

All interviews are expected to last between 45 and 60 mins<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and will be audio-recorded. The interviews will use semi-structured interview guides (<xref rid="SP2 SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 2, 3 and 4</xref>) and will be guided by Bowen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>’s framework.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Separate interview guides have been designed for pregnant women, caregivers and clinicians. Interviews with enrolled women will explore the overall experience of using a telemonitoring programme, while caregiver interviews will explore the influence of the telemonitoring intervention on caregiver roles and responsibilities. Clinicians’ interviews will focus on identifying facilitators and barriers to implementing the telemonitoring programme. Each of these interview guides will include open-ended questions and probes to facilitate discussion.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Descriptive analysis will be conducted for demographic information, maternal characteristics and obstetric history including the quantitative data related to the limited efficacy focus and telemonitoring programme adherence (eg, adherence to taking the home blood pressure measurements). In addition, monthly telemonitoring adherence rates will be examined to identify any patterns in the increase or decrease of pregnant women’s adherence to the telemonitoring programme over time. The metrics relevant to the Limited Efficacy focus will be compared with values the year before the launch of the Raabta programme to provide an indication if the programme is worsening, improving or having no effect on the outcome metrics. In addition, general linear mixed model procedures will be performed to determine if pregnant women’s characteristics predict dependent variables (telemonitoring adherence, and measures associated with limited efficacy). General linear mixed model procedures will also be performed to determine if there are any trends toward the programme adherence predicting the efficacy of the telemonitoring programme. The statistical analyses will be performed using a statistical software application such as R (V.4.2.2). Statistical significance will be considered at p&lt;0.05 unless otherwise specified.</p>
                <p>For the qualitative data, audio recordings of the interviews will be translated into English and transcribed for two-stage data analysis. In the first stage, the interviews will be analysed inductively using an open coding approach to capture themes and codes that provide insights into the feasibility of the programme and a future randomised controlled trial. The transcripts will be uploaded to NVivo software and analysed by two researchers independently who will later discuss the themes and subthemes until consensus is achieved. To gain a more complete understanding of the telemonitoring programme feasibility, the themes from all the interviews will be compared by the primary investigator with the help of the research team to seek convergence and corroboration through data triangulation between the enrolled women, partners, caregivers and provider interviews. In the second stage, the identified themes and subthemes will be mapped to the focus areas of Bowen’s feasibility framework. The study will also highlight themes and sub-themes that were identified through inductive analysis and do not fit under the focus areas of the framework.</p>
                <p>Finally, the qualitative and quantitative data will be merged.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> At this stage, the integration will occur at the interpretation and reporting level, whereby we will use a joint display technique for analysing the data and presenting the integrated data.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 37 38</xref> The integrated data will help advance our understanding of the programme’s feasibility across the five areas of Bowen’s framework.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 37</xref> The analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data within the five foci of Bowen’s feasibility framework will also help inform a future effectiveness trial of the Raabta programme.</p>

                <title>Study timeline</title>
                <p>The intent is to launch the mobile phone-based telemonitoring programme in April 2023. We anticipate that the recruitment of 50 pregnant women at HRPE from JPMC will take approximately 3–5 months. Pregnant women will be followed until the 42 days postpartum. Post-study interviews with enrolled women, caregivers and clinicians will be conducted in the December 2023. The primary analysis is expected to be conducted by early 2024.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first study investigating the feasibility of using a mobile phone-based telemonitoring programme in an LMIC, where pregnant women at HRPE will take their own blood pressure readings at home between antenatal visits for real-time monitoring by their clinicians. The insights gained through this study will help determine the feasibility of implementing a mobile phone-based telemonitoring programme and may help justify and guide an intended future, large effectiveness trial, as well as provide knowledge on how to implement such a programme in other LMICs and even underserved populations in high-income countries. This study could be a foundational step toward a new model of care, with the aim to lower maternal and neonatal mortality rates.</p>
