                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and central venous catheters (CVC) are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Minimal data exist regarding the use of anticoagulation as thromboprophylaxis of VTE in this demographic, and as a result, clinical equipoise exists. Prophylactic dose rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, is efficacious and safe as thromboprophylaxis in other demographics, and may be an optimal agent in SCD with CVC. Prior to conducting a full clinical trial to assess rivaroxaban as thromboprophylaxis in SCD with CVC, a pilot study is needed to gauge its feasibility.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>THromboprophylaxis In Sickle Cell Disease pilot trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing if it is feasible and safe to conduct an adequately powered RCT comparing rivaroxaban to matching placebo as thromboprophylaxis in those with SCD and CVC. Fifty adult patients with SCD and CVC will be randomised to receive either rivaroxaban 10 mg daily or matching placebo for the duration of the CVC in situ for up to 1 year. After randomisation, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months. The primary outcomes pertain to the feasibility of a full trial and include numbers of eligible and recruited participants. Exploratory outcomes include overall incidence of VTE and bleeding complications, as well as quality of life. If the full trial is feasible, blinding will be maintained and patients in the pilot study will be included in the full trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is considered to be a prothrombotic state. The sickling and haemolysis of red blood cells cause ischaemia-reperfusion injuries, oxidative stress and inflammation which in turn lead to activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets, damage to the vascular endothelium and chronic vasoconstriction with decreased blood flow.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In addition to these intrinsic processes, individuals with SCD can be exposed to external risk factors that further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> such as central venous catheters (CVC), which are often required for exchange transfusion, difficult intravenous access or long-term antibiotics. The risk of VTE with CVC in patients with SCD is estimated to be as high as 1 event per 1000 catheter days.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The consequences of VTE put these patients at risk for: (1) major and fatal bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation treatment; (2) permanent loss of vascular access at a venous access site where a VTE occurred, eliminating means by which these patients can be treated; (3) long-term morbidity, including post-thrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and (4) mortality, with a hazard of death 2.5-fold that of an individual with SCD without VTE.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>It is possible that prophylactic anticoagulation can reduce the incidence of VTE in those with SCD and CVC. Rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), is administered at fixed doses without need for routine monitoring. In large randomised controlled trials (RCTs), low-dose rivaroxaban has proven to be efficacious and safe in decreasing the incidence of VTE as primary prevention in posthip arthroplasty and high-risk cancer populations and secondary prevention in those with prior VTE.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> While those with SCD and CVC are well acknowledged to have a high VTE risk, due to limited data, guidelines regarding thromboprophylaxis in this group are ambivalent or absent and clinical equipoise is present.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> In ambulatory cancer patients, who are similarly at high risk for VTE, those with a VTE risk of 10% or greater at 6 months are considered for thromboprophylaxis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There remains strong potential for clinical benefit with thromboprophylaxis in SCD with CVC, as a recent retrospective multicentre observational study found lack of thromboprophylaxis compared with thromboprophylaxis with any antithrombotic agent, was associated with a rate ratio for VTE of 4.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 12.6).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, there is also potential for harm, as SCD also has a predisposition to bleeding, including haemorrhagic stroke, vitreous haemorrhage and haematuria. In a population-based study, individuals with SCD had a cumulative incidence of bleeding requiring emergency department or hospitalisations of 21% (95% CI 19.8% to 22.3%) by age 40.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>To assess the efficacy of rivaroxaban as thromboprophylaxis in patients with SCD with CVC, if the untreated rate of VTE is 0.21 per year, a trial with 3 years of accrual and 2 years of additional follow-up would need 181 participants to have 80% power to detect an HR of 0.5 with treatment, using alpha of 0.05 and assuming 3.5% annual loss to follow-up. However, SCD is an orphan disease and as such, a trial of this size would represent a large commitment of resources. Given previous concerns about slow enrolment and high loss to follow-up in trials in SCD, we propose a pilot trial to determine the feasibility of this full-scale RCT.</p>

                <p>THromboprophylaxis In Sickle Cell Disease with CVC (THIS) is an investigator-initiated pilot, double-blinded, multicentre RCT to assess if it is feasible and safe to conduct an adequately powered RCT comparing rivaroxaban to matching placebo as thromboprophylaxis in adult SCD participants with CVC. The study is funded by the Paul B. Helliwell Foundation Hematology Research Innovation Fund and is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05033314).</p>
                <p>The trial will be conducted at three adult centres in Canada: the University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto, Ontario, the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, and the London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario. Drs. Jameel Abdulrehman and Kevin H.M. Kuo are coprincipal investigators. The trial study will be conducted as an internal pilot study, in that if the full trial is feasible, patients in the pilot study will continue to be followed, their treatment assignment will remain concealed, and they will be included in analyses of the full study.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>The trial will include adult participants with documented SCD, with new or pre-existing CVC planned for long-term (at least 6 months) use, who are able to provide consent. Participants will be excluded for previous VTE within the past 3 months, current use of anticoagulation for an indication other than CVC thromboprophylaxis, and concerns pertaining to potential safety risks of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban such as concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy, creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault equation), or cirrhosis with Child-Pugh score B or C. Given the limited data for bleeding risk associated with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily in participants with SCD, the exclusion of participants with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as moyamoya, severe vasculopathy or routine non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use will be at the discretion of the treating physician based on their holistic bleeding risk assessment. Please see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> for full list of exclusion criteria. Females of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy during use of study drug and for 30 days after, either through non-oestrogen-based contraception or abstinence.</p>

                <p>Recruited participants will be block-randomised with 1:1 allocation ratio, stratified by type of CVC (peripherally inserted central catheter or other) and whether the CVC is new or pre-existing, to either daily oral rivaroxaban 10 mg or matching placebo for the duration of the CVC in situ, for up to 1 year. A centralised blinded study coordinator will have a document with the randomisation sequences generated by the study’s statistician comprising a list of alphanumeric codes. The coordinator will receive emails from the respective sites requesting randomisation, and a return email will include the next available alphanumeric code to provide to the investigational pharmacy. The investigational or clinical trials’ pharmacist will have a list which connects each code to the treatment arm assignment and will dispense the patient’s investigational product accordingly. Investigational pharmacies at the respective participating centres will package and dispense study drug and placebo in identical containers. Study participants, treating physicians, study investigators, adjudicators and outcome assessors will be unaware of treatment arm assignment.</p>
                <p>Rivaroxaban was chosen as the active intervention for the following reasons: it is a once-a-day fixed dose oral medication without the need for routine monitoring, it has a rapid onset of effect and a short half-life and was found to be efficacious at the low dose of 10 mg daily as primary prevention in the setting of posthip arthroplasty and high-risk patients with cancer and secondary prevention in those with prior VTE.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6 13 14</xref> Rivaroxaban decreased the risk of VTE with absolute risk reduction of 1.7% (95% CI 1.0% to 2.5%) compared with enoxaparin in posthip arthroplasty participants, with HR of 0.40 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.80) compared with placebo in high-risk cancer participants, and with HR of 0.26 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.47) compared with aspirin 81 mg daily in participants with prior VTE.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Compared with traditional oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the DOACs have a lower risk of major, fatal, intracranial, clinically relevant non-major and total bleeding.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Compared with other DOACs, apixaban has twice daily dosing, which may decrease adherence, and less information is available regarding the use of dabigatran and edoxaban as thromboprophylaxis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Despite the effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin in decreasing the incidence of CVC-related VTE in patients with cancer, it was not selected as the intervention as it is expensive, burdensome and uncomfortable to administer as a subcutaneous injection.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                <p>Placebo was chosen as the control arm rather than active control since there is no approved drug for primary thromboprophylaxis in patients with SCD with CVC and there is clinical equipoise as to whether anticoagulation should be used at all for this indication.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref> Furthermore, there is no universal standard of care as no clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation as thromboprophylaxis in this demographic.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The study placebo is manufactured by the Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).</p>

                <p>The aim is to enrol 50 patients in the pilot trial. The expected number of patients that will need to be assessed to identify 50 patients ranges from 63 to 84 across participation percentages of 60%–80%. The resulting percentage of participants can be estimated with a 95% CI of approximately ±10%. The estimate from the pilot will be applied to patient counts at potential future study sites to (a) assess feasibility of randomisation of approximately 200 patients across all sites and (b) calculate the number of sites and duration of accrual needed for the full trial.</p>

Combining 50 patients from the pilot (with a maximum of 1 year of follow-up) with an additional 160 patients in the full trial (with 3 years of accrual and 2 years of follow-up) gives 80% power to detect a HR for treatment of 0.5, using an alpha of 0.05 and an assumed 3.5% loss to follow-up per year. The estimated baseline rate will be revised based on any new data available before the full trial commences, in particular the estimated baseline rate from the pilot, calculated from the blinded pilot data. The assumed drop-out rate will also be updated with pilot trial data.</p>

                  <p>The full trial is designed to show the superiority of study drug over placebo in decreasing the incidence of composite VTE events. However, for the pilot study, to maintain blinding of the full trial and because of low power for showing differences in clinical endpoints in the pilot, the clinical endpoints will only be presented using descriptive statistics, aggregating both study arms. Only if a full study is deemed not feasible will the outcomes of the study drug arm and the placebo arm will be presented separately for the pilot study. In that case, the VTE, bleeding and event-free outcomes will be compared between the study drug arm and the placebo arm using a stratified log-rank test. In addition, for both arms combined, Kaplan-Meier survival curves will assess the composite VTE events, the composite of major and CRNMB, and event-free time from time of randomisation to event. Study participants who do not have a VTE or bleeding outcome prior to discontinuation of CVC will be censored at time of removal of CVC. Participants who withdraw consent, are loss to follow-up or died from reasons other than composite VTE, who did not have a composite VTE event will be censored at the last day the participant was assessed for outcomes. Quality of life outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>As the population of individuals with SCD and CVC increases, data are urgently needed to guide management decisions regarding thromboprophylaxis. In developed countries, the prevalence of SCD is increasing due to an increase in immigration from endemic countries, and improving mortality associated with advancements in supportive care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Only 60 years ago, SCD was thought of as a ‘disease of childhood’ as few would survive to adulthood, but today in well-resourced countries, individuals with SCD can live well into their 50s and 60s.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> Furthermore, the use of CVCs in those with SCD is likely to increase as studies continue to demonstrate the benefit of chronic transfusion therapy for prevention of stroke and end-organ damage.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36–39</xref></p>
              <p>A considerable challenge in conducting a trial in patients with SCD is the risk of low enrolment and poor follow-up. A prior RCT, investigating the effect of VKA compared with placebo on pulmonary artery systolic pressure in patients with SCD with mild pulmonary hypertension, with planned follow-up of 12 months, was terminated early due to poor enrolment (NCT01036802). While the study targeted a total of 20 patients, from December 2009 to September 2012, only 3 patients were successfully enrolled. To maximise enrolment in our study and increase generalisability, we are enrolling at multiple sites, and we have broad inclusion criteria to include all types of CVCs, whether new or pre-existing, and for all indications. Furthermore, patients may be more likely to participate in an anticoagulation study with a DOAC rather than a VKA given its greater convenience and safety profile.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A more recent RCT in patients with SCD assessing the effect intravenous crizanlizumab compared with placebo on sickle cell-related pain crises, with 12-month treatment phase, was successfully completed, but had a high rate of early study discontinuation.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Of the 198 patients randomised to study drug, 69 (35%) failed to complete the study. Nonetheless, we expect that our rate of early study discontinuation will be much lower, as our study evaluates an oral medication rather than an intravenous one, and the majority of our study demographic is estimated to be dependent on chronic transfusion therapy which requires regular in-person visits, making study follow-up more likely. However, to accurately gauge if a full trial is feasible, the proposed pilot study is necessary.</p>
              <p>Compared with a full trial, pilot studies are reduced in scope and size, and although they can provide insight into the efficacy and safety of an intervention, their findings are rarely conclusive.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Rather, the goals of pilot studies are to evaluate trial processes, financial and time resources, data management and scientific inquiries on a smaller scale, prior to committing to an expensive and resource intensive full clinical trial.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> THIS pilot study will allow us to accurately estimate participant recruitment, participant adherence to study drug, compliance with study procedures and the proportion of participants loss to follow-up, and if modifications are required to the study protocol for the full trial to be successful. Moreover, the knowledge gained from the pilot study trial will help decide which centres would be able to recruit participants, and how many centres would be required to successfully complete the trial.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, THIS pilot study will evaluate the feasibility to conduct an adequately powered full RCT comparing rivaroxaban to placebo as thromboprophylaxis in patients with SCD with CVCs. Individuals with SCD and CVC are at high risk of VTE, but little data exist to guide if thromboprophylaxis should be considered. The full trial could provide strong evidence to support or refute the use of low dose rivaroxaban as thromboprophylaxis in this demographic and solve the clinical equipoise.</p>
