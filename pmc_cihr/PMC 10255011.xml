                  <p>552 hypertensive patients (65.6 years old, 57.4% female) already established on a single once-daily morning antihypertensive and randomised to switch that antihypertensive to bedtime. Of these, 203 used diuretics (27.1% thiazide alone, 70.0% thiazide/non-diuretic combinations) and 349 used non-diuretics.</p>

                  <p>Primary outcome: Adherence to bedtime allocation time at 6â€‰months (defined as the willingness to continue with bedtime use, not an assessment of missed doses). Secondary 6-month outcomes: (1) nocturia considered to be a major burden and (2) increase in overnight urinations/week. All outcomes were self-reported and additionally collected at 6â€‰weeks.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>At 6â€‰months: Adherence to bedtime allocation time was lower in diuretic users than non-diuretic users (77.3% vs 89.8%; difference 12.6%; 95%â€‰CI 5.8% to 19.8%; p&lt;0.0001; NNH 8.0), and more diuretic users considered nocturia a major burden (15.6% vs 1.3%; difference 14.2%; 95%â€‰CI 8.9% to 20.6%; p&lt;0.0001; NNH 7.0). Compared with baseline, diuretic users experienced 1.0 more overnight urinations/week (95%â€‰CI 0.0 to 1.75; p=0.01). Results did not differ between sexes.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Switching diuretics to bedtime did promote nocturia, but only 15.6% found nocturia a major burden. At 6â€‰months, 77.3% of diuretic users were adherent to bedtime dosing. Bedtime diuretic use is viable for many hypertensive patients, should it ever become clinically indicated.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Although consensus is lacking,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“3</xref> two randomised trials by the same principal investigator suggest large reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events occur if blood pressure (BP) medications are taken at bedtime, as compared with conventional morning use.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> This finding, however, may be difficult to implement for those using diureticsâ€”common first-line therapeutics, with a unique and important role in volume control and natriuresis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> This is because diuretics are widely believed to promote nocturia, and typically recommended for morning use only as a result.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p>
              <p>Nocturia occurs in roughly two-thirds of men and women over the age of 70 years<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and is believed to disrupt sleep, impair quality of life and increase the risk of night-time falls and fractures.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> However, there are no randomised trials examining diuretic timing and adverse effects. The concern that bedtime diuretics could produce troublesome nocturia, being based on opinion and observational data, could be incorrect. Morning diuretics (typically thiazides) are generally well tolerated, and cross-sectional analysis of diuretic-using populations, without accounting for administration time, does not support a strong association between diuretic use and nocturia.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Whether clinicians can recommend diuretics for bedtime use is, therefore, unclear.</p>
              <p>To determine how well diuretics are tolerated at bedtime we conducted a prespecified prospective cohort study embedded within the ongoing BedMed trial. BedMed randomises Canadian primary care patients with hypertension to take their existing antihypertensive medications either in the morning, or at bedtime, and examines mortality and morbidity outcomes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Recruitment started in March 2017 and the trial is ongoing, with follow-up continuing until late 2023. This paper examines those participants with a single morning antihypertensive at baseline who were randomised to switch that antihypertensive to bedtime. Our goal was to compare adherence with bedtime allocation, and self-reported nocturia burden, between those switching a diuretic to bedtime and those switching other types of BP lowering medication to bedtime. Note, our definition of adherence to allocation time differs from the conventional notion. When we refer to adherence to bedtime allocation, we are talking about the participantâ€™s intention to use their antihypertensive at bedtime. This study is not evaluating the extent to which individual doses are missed. As such, we did not compare bedtime diuretic use to morning diuretic use because morning medication use was already well established for all participants. As we have defined it, we would expect virtually everyone allocated to morning antihypertensives to be adherent to their administration time, as a morning allocation meant no change of any kind was needed.</p>

                <title>Study design and sample size</title>
                <p>BedMed is an ongoing prospective, randomised, open, blinded-endpoint<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> trial. Recruitment is registry-like, with participating family physicians using their usual-care electronic medical records to identify their eligible patients, and then mailing those patients information about the study. Interested patients call the study team and, if eligible and consenting, are randomised to take all their regular BP medication (as tolerated) either in the morning, or at bedtime. Participants received their allocation, using the REDCap<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> serverâ€™s central randomisation module, directly from a research assistant with no prior clinical interactions, achieving irreversible, independent and concealed allocation.</p>
                <p>The prospective cohort study reported in this manuscript is a prespecified interim analysis of BedMed data, carried out as part of an adaptive trial design. The analysis was triggered on the allocation to bedtime dosing of 203 participants whose only baseline antihypertensive included a morning diuretic (whether a diuretic only, or a diuretic/non-diuretic combination pill). If adherence with bedtime diuretic use had been poor, the BedMed trialâ€™s inclusion criteria would have been altered to exclude future such individuals from enrolling. This sample size gave a 90% chance of detecting a 20% relative reduction in adherence to bedtime allocation if (1) morning adherence was 75% and (2) there were an equal number of participants switching a non-diuretic antihypertensive to bedtime with whom to compare.</p>

                <title>Setting and participants</title>
                <p>In Canadaâ€™s publicly funded healthcare system, residents are not billed directly for physician services, but medication costs are either paid for privately, or partially or completely covered by either employer-sponsored health insurance, or government subsidised programmes (including coverage for seniors). The vast majority of Canadians have family physicians, who are normally the sole prescriber of their patientâ€™s hypertension medications.</p>
                <p>BedMed recruitment began in March 2017, with the final participant included in this analysis enrolling in September 2020. Over this period, participants were being recruited by 352 family physicians (typical practice panel ~1500 patients, with 20% hypertension prevalence among adults) in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Some BedMed participants (22% of those randomised) also learnt about the study through social media, or other sources, and were enrolled with their family physicianâ€™s consent, but without their family physician actively recruiting them. To be eligible for BedMed, participants needed to be community dwelling (including assisted living) and to have a physician diagnosis of hypertension for which they used one or more BP-lowering medications. BedMed excluded anyone with a personal history of glaucoma because of an association between nocturnal hypotension and ischaemic optic neuropathy in such individuals.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18â€“21</xref> For this substudy, we intentionally kept our eligibility criteria as broad as possible (including participants with potentially nocturia-modifying conditions such as diabetes, sleep apnoea and congestive heart failure (CHF)) so as to most closely resemble, and be generalisable to, a hypertensive primary care population.</p>
                <p>For this substudy, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria defined the study cohort.</p>

                      <p>*We made both these exclusions since, for the diuretic group, including patients who were not actually attempting to switch a diuretic to bedtime would have lessened any potential nocturia, and biased the groups towards looking more similar. When looking at adverse effects of an intervention, such a â€˜modified intention-to-treatâ€™ analysis is the more conservative analytic option, given a full intention-to-treat analysis, for the reason described above, is more likely to underestimate nocturia-related problems.</p>

                  <title>Assistance changing antihypertensive medication to bedtime</title>
                  <p>Participants had their choice of being assisted in making their timing change by their family physician, who applied their own judgement as to how to make the change or, if they described no heart disease, by the research assistant with whom they were dialoging. Exceptions included those whose BP-lowering medication was Tiazac XC or Diltiazem XC (which have delayed-release kinetics), and furosemide, isosorbide mononitrate/dinitrate, or alpha blockers (medications whose timing decision may be more complicated). Such participants had their family physician guide their timing change. Advice from research assistants was to delay the next morning dose until bedtime, and to continue all future doses at bedtime. If bedtime use proved problematic, and there were concern participants would switch back to morning, switching to dinnertime was suggested. As a memory aid, participants were advised to place pill bottles near objects they use when getting ready for bed (eg, toothbrush, denture case, alarm clock), or to use an AM/PM dosette. If medication type, dosage or timing needed to be changed, for any reason, those decisions were at the sole discretion of the prescribing physician.</p>

                  <title>Follow-up interviews</title>
                  <p>Baseline characteristics were collected directly from participants through telephone interview prior to randomisation. The first follow-up with a research assistant occurred by telephone 7â€‰days post-timing change to encourage adhering to the timing change, and to troubleshoot participant concerns. Another telephone follow-up took place at 6â€‰weeks to obtain self-reported adherence to bedtime antihypertensive use (â€˜Are you taking your blood pressure medication at bedtime?â€™; and if â€˜noâ€™â€”the reason for not doing so), and to assess nocturia. Participants could report nocturia as â€˜noâ€™, â€˜minorâ€™ or â€˜majorâ€™ burden (subjective overall assessment, no itemised criteria), and they were asked to quantify the number of overnight urinations per week by estimating the number of nights they rose to urinate, and the number of times per night they urinated on those evenings. The same follow-up questions were asked again at 6â€‰months, either by telephone or by email questionnaire (participantâ€™s choice), and again every 6â€‰months thereafter.</p>
                  <p>Note: this study was not designed to explore whether or not individual medication doses were missed, something which could be better assessed with electronic devices, or pill counting. We were instead assessing each participantâ€™s willingness to persist with bedtime antihypertensive use. As such, self-report more accurately reflects the patient feedback prescribers could expect, were they to recommend diuretics be administered at bedtime.</p>

                  <p>Comorbidities were also collected as baseline characteristics (coronary artery disease, diabetes, sleep apnoea, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CHF and stroke). For non-Alberta residents, these comorbidities were self-reported. For Alberta residents, the vast majority of participants (83%), these comorbidities were derived from physician diagnoses submitted to Alberta Health in the normal course of care, specifically, by extracting comorbidities from linked governmental databases recording community physician billings and hospital separations. Access and analysis of this administrative data was performed by Alberta Health Services, the governmental data steward. These data, and this linking process, have been widely used in other studies and have been identified as valid.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22â€“25</xref> Most comorbidities were considered present if there were two community visits with that diagnosis, or one hospital diagnosis, from any physician. However, only one such diagnosis was required for stroke (since the diagnosis might not repeat outside of the acute event), and for chronic kidney disease (which, in our experience, is infrequently recorded by primary care providers).</p>

                <p>Our inclusion and exclusion criteria created one prospective cohort with two exposures: (1) an established morning diuretic medication being switched to bedtime and (2) an established morning non-diuretic medication being switched to bedtime. Participants using a combination pill with two or more antihypertensive components were considered diuretic users if at least one of those components was a diuretic. The analysis was by modified intention to treat and consisted of descriptive statistics, comparing proportions using Fisherâ€™s exact test (primary outcome analysis), comparing the number of overnight urinations/week using Mann-Whitney, and using Hodges-Lehmann estimation for difference in medians. All analyses used GraphPad Prism V.9.1.2.</p>

If no subsequent data were available for imputation (ie, lost to follow-up or study drop-out) participants were excluded from analysis. We did not impute missing values for lost or dropped out participants because we were looking to demonstrate potential harm (harm constituting a difference in non-adherence or major nocturia burden) and imputing missing values, being reasonably balanced between groups, would have biased the groups towards looking more similar.

Data from these non-adherent individuals were not used for assessment of nocturia frequency. If medication or timing changes were made for reasons other than nocturia, participants were excluded from analysis. We made this exclusion because including such individuals would have biased the groups towards appearing more similar, and could have led us to underestimate the nocturia burden in diuretic users. If physicians changed the participantâ€™s medication to twice daily (with the second dose at bedtime or dinnertime) we considered them to still experience the effects of a bedtime dose, and included them in the analysis.</p>

                <title>Baseline</title>
                <p>Overall, most participants were from Alberta (83.0%), 94.7% identified as white and they were a mean 65.6 (SD 10.0) years of age. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) although slightly more diuretic users were female (65.5% vs 52.7%). They were largely non-smokers (92.4%), exercised a median 3 (IQR 0â€“5)â€‰days/week and had a median body mass index of 28.3 (IQR 25.5â€“32.3). The most common comorbidities were coronary artery disease (19.2%), sleep apnoea (18.3%) and diabetes (17.2%). The cohort-defining medications used are broken down in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>. Of the diuretic users, 142 (70.0%) used a thiazide containing combination pill, and 42 (20.7%) used hydrochlorothiazide alone. Although BedMed does not collect information on drug dosage, it would be unusual for Canadians to be prescribed hydrochlorothiazide outside a range of 12.5â€“25â€‰mg/day. Of the non-diuretic cohort, 150 (43.0%) used angiotensin receptor blockers, 148 (42.4%) used ACE inhibitors, 38 (10.9%) used calcium channel blockers, 4 (1.1%) used beta-blockers and 9 (2.6%) used combination pills that did not include diuretics. Baseline nocturia was similar between diuretic versus non-diuretic users, in terms of the number of overnight urinations per week (median 5.5 vs 6.0), and the percentage of participants perceiving nocturia to be a major burden (1.5% vs 2.3%). However, slightly more diuretic users felt nocturia was a minor burden (30.5% vs 23.5%). Overall, three-fourths of participants did experience nocturia at least once per week. Of these, 62.8% considered it â€˜not a problemâ€™, 34.5% considered it â€˜a minor burdenâ€™ and 2.6% considered it â€˜a major burdenâ€™.</p>

                  <p>At 6â€‰months, adherence to bedtime medication use (our primary outcome) had fallen somewhat in both groups (77.3% vs 89.8%), and the difference in adherence had widened (difference 12.6%; 95%â€‰CI Diff, 5.8% to 19.8%; p&lt;0.0001; NNH 8.0). However, most diuretic users were still adherent to bedtime medication use. Nocturia was given as the reason for non-adherence by 25/45 (55.6%) diuretic users, compared with 0/34 (0%) non-diuretic users, whose main reasons for non-adherence were forgetting to take their pill (10/34, 29.4%), worsening of BP control (8/34, 23.5%), and non-symptom driven medication changes (6/34, 17.6%). Of those still adherent to allocation (153 diuretic users and 301 non-diuretic users), the median difference in overnight urinations compared with baseline remained 1.0 urinations per week higher in diuretic users, compared with non-diuretic users (95%â€‰CI 0.0 to 1.75; p=0.012). Including those who had stopped adhering because of nocturia, 14.2% more diuretic users had perceived nocturia to be a major burden (15.6% vs 1.3%; 95%â€‰CI Diff, 8.9% to 20.6%; p&lt;0.0001; NNH 7.0).</p>

                <p>Given slightly more diuretic users were female, we conducted a post hoc analysis to determine whether nocturia burden or adherence differed between sexes. Using the Mann-Whitney test, there was no difference, male versus female, in the number of overnight urinations at 6â€‰weeks for the diuretic group (median difference 0.0; 95%â€‰CI Diff âˆ’1.0 to 1.0; p=0.96), nor for the non-diuretic group (median difference 0.0; 95%â€‰CI Diff, 0.0 to 0.0; p=0.98). Adherence with bedtime antihypertensive use, diuretic versus non-diuretic users, was also similar between males and females at 6â€‰months (male: 76.5% vs 90.5%; female: 77.7% vs 89.3%; p=0.86 for the difference in adherence between male and female diuretic users). The same was true for major nocturia burden at 6â€‰months, which was no different between sexes (male: 14.8% vs 0%; female: 16.0% vs 2.5%; p&gt;0.99 for the difference in major nocturia burden between male and female diuretic users).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this prospective cohort of hypertensive primary care patients, 1.5% of morning diuretic users experienced nocturia as a major burden at baseline. When these morning diuretic users switched their diuretic to bedtime, nocturia was more frequent, becoming a major burden for 15.6% of participants over a period of 6 months. Similar primary care patients simultaneously switching other types of antihypertensives from morning to bedtime experienced no increase in nocturia, but they still failed to adhere to bedtime use 10.2% of the time. Due to the extra burden of nocturia, non-adherence in diuretic users was higher, at 22.7%. Hence, one in eight diuretic users, compared with non-diuretic users, will fail the switch to bedtime, with one in four diuretic users failing the switch overall.</p>
              <p>Our findings are limited by the potential for selection bias, given some BedMed participants may have previously tried diuretics (morning or evening) and, if they experienced troublesome nocturia, may have stopped using diuretics altogether prior to enrolling. Morning diuretic users may also have avoided enrolling in BedMed if they were concerned about the possibility of needing to switch their diuretics to bedtime. The subjective nature of our outcomes might also be considered a limitation, in that nocturia burden could be interpreted differently by different people. However, self-reporting of nocturia burden integrates the patientâ€™s perceptions and values, and our use of it prioritises the individualâ€™s own assessment of their experience. Similarly, while our allowing patients struggling with bedtime use to switch their diuretic to dinnertime might lessen nocturia, this would likely reflect real-world practice. Our findings are simultaneously strengthened by the prospective nature of the design, and by the cohort selection process, which ensured diuretic and non-diuretic users were all recruited from the same practices, using the same approach, and meeting the same inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to prospectively evaluate the link between bedtime diuretic use and nocturia. Our finding the majority of diuretic users able to adhere to bedtime use is consistent with the generally weak and variable association of diuretics and nocturia in cross-sectional studies,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 13</xref> the inability of baseline diuretics to predict future nocturia (2-year incidence) in 1289 community dwelling respondents 60 years and older in the Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social Aspects of Aging (MESA) study,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and the number of participants changing the timing of a diuretic in the Treatment In Morning versus Evening (TIME) antihypertensive timing trial.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> While 22.5% of TIME subjects used a diuretic at baseline, postrandomisation diuretic timing changes were made by 5.2% of the evening group versus 0.7% of the morning group (p&lt;0.0001), suggesting 5.2%/22.5%=Â¼ of diuretic users chose not to continue bedtime use. Although bedtime antihypertensive use might offer an advantage so far as cardiovascular risk reduction,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> our clinical experience is that most BP-lowering medication is still administered in the morning. In a 2017 survey of hypertensive primary care patients (single centre in Ohio, 139 respondents), 75.5% used all of their antihypertensive medication in the morning.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Of the same population, 21 of 22 thiazide-diuretic users (95.5%) took that thiazide in the morning.</p>
              <p>Although roughly 14% of hypertensive primary care patients will newly experience nocturia as a major burden after switching a thiazide diuretic from morning to bedtime, the vast majority of morning diuretic users can successfully make the switch to bedtime should it become clinically indicated to do so. The key remaining question is whether or not an attempt to switch diuretics to bedtime is clinically indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction, as the MAPEC (Monitorizacion Ambulatoria para Prediccion de Eventos Cardiovasculares, i.e. Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events) and Hygia trials suggest.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Three confirmatory trials, of which BedMed is one, are looking to evaluate this,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 28 30</xref> with the first of these, the TIME trial,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> recently reporting neither benefit, nor harm, to bedtime prescribing. Final results of the remaining two trials, BedMed<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and BedMed-Frail,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> are expected in mid 2024.</p>
