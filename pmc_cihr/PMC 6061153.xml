                  <p id="Par1">In line with current advice, we assessed the effect of replacing carbohydrate consumption with mixed nut consumption, as a source of unsaturated fat, on cardiovascular risk factors and HbA<sub>1c</sub> in type 2 diabetes. The data presented here are from a paper that was retracted at the authors’ request (10.2337/dc16-rt02) owing to lack of adjustment for repeated measures in the same individual. Our aim, therefore, was to fix the error and add new complementary data of interest, including information on clotting factors and LDL particle size.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A total of 117 men and postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes who were taking oral glucose-lowering agents and with HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 47.5 and 63.9 mmol/mol (6.5–8.0%) were randomised after stratification by sex and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> in a parallel design to one of three diets for 3 months: (1) ‘full-dose nut diet’ (<italic>n</italic> = 40): a diet with 2.0 MJ (477 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as mixed nuts (75 g/day); (2) ‘full-dose muffin diet’ (<italic>n</italic> = 39): a diet with 1.97 MJ (471 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as three whole-wheat muffins (188 g/day), with a similar protein content to the nuts, and the same carbohydrate-derived energy content as the monounsaturated fatty acid-derived energy content in the nuts; or (3) ‘half-dose nut diet’ (<italic>n</italic> = 38): a diet with 1.98 MJ (474 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as half portions of both the nuts and muffins. The primary outcome was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The study was carried out in a hospital clinical research centre and concluded in 2008. Only the statistician, study physicians and analytical technicians could be blinded to the group assessment.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">A total of 108 participants had post-intervention data available for analysis (full-dose nut group, <italic>n</italic> = 40; full-dose muffin group, <italic>n</italic> = 35; half-dose nut group, <italic>n</italic> = 33). Compared with the full-dose muffin diet, the full-dose nut diet provided 9.2% (95% CI 7.1, 11.3) greater total energy intake from monounsaturated fat. The full-dose nut diet (median intake, 75 g/day) also reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared with the full-dose muffin diet by −2.0 mmol/mol (95% CI −3.8, −0.3 mmol/mol) (−0.19% [95% CI −0.35%, −0.02%]), (<italic>p</italic> = 0.026). Estimated cholesterol levels in LDL particles with a diameter &lt;255 ångström [LDL-c<sub>&lt;255Å</sub>]) and apolipoprotein B were also significantly decreased after the full-dose nut diet compared with the full-dose muffin diet. According to the dose response, the full-dose nut diet is predicted to reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub> (−2.0 mmol/mol [−0.18%]; <italic>p</italic> = 0.044), cholesterol (−0.25 mmol/l; <italic>p</italic> = 0.022), LDL-cholesterol (−0.23 mmol/l; <italic>p</italic> = 0.019), non-HDL-cholesterol (−0.26 mmol/l; <italic>p</italic> = 0.020), apolipoprotein B (−0.06 g/l, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013) and LDL-c&lt;<sub>255Å</sub> (−0.42 mmol/l; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). No serious study-related adverse events occurred, but one participant on the half-dose nut diet was hospitalised for atrial fibrillation after shovelling snow.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par21">For many years there has been a move towards replacing refined carbohydrates with unsaturated vegetable oils. Cohort studies have indicated benefits for lower carbohydrate diets of plant origin in terms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Specifically, these benefits have been attributed to the use of nuts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] as a source of vegetable oils. More recently, the benefit of reducing the glycaemic load of the Mediterranean diet by the addition of olive oil or mixed nuts was clearly shown in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) study, in which 50% of participants had type 2 diabetes. This RCT demonstrated a 30% reduction in CVD risk, especially stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and a reduction in diabetes incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In smaller studies of shorter duration, most types of nuts have also been shown to reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], improve endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and reduce postprandial blood glucose levels when consumed with a bread-based meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the PREDIMED study, a small blood pressure-lowering effect was also observed for both nuts and extra virgin olive oil as compared with a control low-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], while it has also been shown that nuts may also be used to treat the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As might be predicted, from their LDL-c lowering effects, nuts have been shown to reduce arterial plaque as measured by carotid intima media thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">As a result of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a health claim stating that nuts reduce cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, bodies concerned with diabetes and CVD (e.g. the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the European Atherosclerosis Society) are now advocating increased nut consumption as part of their dietary recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">We now report the effects of the consumption of mixed nuts in a study of participants with type 2 diabetes that was concluded in 2008 and published in 2011, but retracted in 2016 at the authors’ request because of failure to control for repeated measures in the same individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our aim, therefore, is to provide an expanded report that fixes the previous error and adds new data of interest, including data on non-HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), LDL particle size distribution, and clotting factors VII, VIII, fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).</p>

                <p id="Par24">Participants were recruited by newspaper advertisement and from lists of participants who had taken part in previous studies. Recruitment took place from April 2007 to September 2008, with the last follow-up visit on 18 December 2008. Eligible participants (<italic>n</italic> = 117; see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were men or postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes who were taking glucose-lowering agents other than acarbose, and not taking insulin, with medications stable for the previous 3 months. These individuals also had HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at screening between 47.5 and 63.9 mmol/mol (6.5% and 8.0%) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). No participants had clinically significant cardiovascular, renal or liver disease (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal), a history of cancer or were on warfarin. Participants were accepted after surgery or myocardial infarction providing they had an event-free 6 month period prior to the study. One participant changed medications within 3 months prior to the start of the study. Nevertheless, all participants were retained for the analyses.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of study participants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Full-dose nut diet (<italic>n</italic> = 40)</th><th>Half-dose nut diet (<italic>n</italic> = 38)</th><th>Full-dose muffin diet (<italic>n</italic> = 39)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age, years</td><td>63 (± 8.9)</td><td>61 (± 7.9)</td><td>61 (± 9.9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Sex</td></tr><tr><td> Male</td><td>26 (65.0)</td><td>26 (68.4)</td><td>26 (66.7)</td></tr><tr><td> Female</td><td>14 (35.0)</td><td>12 (31.6)</td><td>13 (33.3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Race/ethnicity</td></tr><tr><td> European</td><td>23 (58)</td><td>25 (66)</td><td>18 (46)</td></tr><tr><td> Indian</td><td>10 (25)</td><td>8 (21)</td><td>13 (33)</td></tr><tr><td> Far Eastern</td><td>4 (10)</td><td>3 (8)</td><td>3 (8)</td></tr><tr><td> African</td><td>3 (8)</td><td>2 (5)</td><td>3 (8)</td></tr><tr><td> Hispanic</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (3)</td></tr><tr><td> Native American</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (3)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight, kg</td><td>80.0 (± 14.7)</td><td>86.2 (± 15.6)</td><td>82.9 (± 14.7)</td></tr><tr><td>BMI, kg/m<sup>2a</sup></td><td>28.8 (± 4.5)</td><td>30.3 (± 5.0)</td><td>29.4 (± 4.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Current smokers</td><td>2 (5.0)</td><td>4 (10.5)</td><td>3 (7.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">HbA<sub>1c</sub><sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td> &lt;54.1 mmol/mol (&lt;7.0%)</td><td>21 (53)</td><td>20 (53)</td><td>17 (44)</td></tr><tr><td> ≥54.1 mmol/mol ≥7.0%)</td><td>19 (47)</td><td>18 (47)</td><td>22 (56)</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of diabetes, years</td><td>6.7 (± 5.5)</td><td>7.9 (± 6.2)</td><td>7.9 (± 5.8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Medication use</td></tr><tr><td> Glucose-lowering medications</td><td>40 (100)</td><td>38 (100)</td><td>39 (100)</td></tr><tr><td>  Thiazolidinedione</td><td>12 (30)</td><td>11 (29)</td><td>11 (28)</td></tr><tr><td>  Biguanide</td><td>35 (88)</td><td>36 (95)</td><td>35 (90)</td></tr><tr><td>  Sulfonylurea</td><td>14 (35)</td><td>13 (34)</td><td>17 (44)</td></tr><tr><td>  Meglitinides (± non-sulfonylurea)</td><td>2 (5)</td><td>3 (8)</td><td>2 (5)</td></tr><tr><td>  α-Glucosidase inhibitors</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0 (0)</td></tr><tr><td>  DPP-4 inhibitor</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>1 (3)</td></tr><tr><td> Cholesterol-lowering medications<sup>†</sup></td><td>23 (58)</td><td>31 (82)</td><td>30 (77)</td></tr><tr><td> Blood pressure medications</td><td>23 (58)</td><td>29 (76)</td><td>28 (72)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are presented as mean (± SD) or <italic>n</italic> (%)</p><p><sup>a</sup>Calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>b</sup>HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;53 mmol/mol (&lt;7%) was used as the therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p><p><sup>†</sup><italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.42, difference between treatments, Fisher’s exact test</p><p>DPP-4, dipeptidyl peptidase 4</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

                <title>Protocol</title>
                <p id="Par25">The study was a 3 month randomised parallel study with two supplements and three treatment groups: (1) ‘full-dose nut diet’: a diet with 2.0 MJ (477 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as mixed nuts (75 g/day); (2) ‘full-dose muffin diet’: a diet with 1.97 MJ (471 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as three whole-wheat muffins/day (188 g/day); (3) ‘half-dose nut diet’: a diet with 1.98 MJ (474 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as half portions of both nuts and muffins (see ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The thermonuclear conversion factor (1 MJ=239.006 kcal) has been used throughout. Further details of the supplements and their dose are given below.</p>
                <p id="Par26">After stratification by sex and HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≤ 54.1 mmol/mol (≤7.1%), randomisation was carried out anonymously by a geographically isolated statistician. Neither the dietitians nor the participants could be blinded. However, equal emphasis was placed on the potential health benefits of both supplements. The analytical technicians were blinded to treatment, as was the statistician up to and during the preliminary assessment of the primary outcome, HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p>
                <p id="Par27">Participants were seen at the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Centre in St Michael’s Hospital, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto (Toronto, ON, Canada), for screening and assessments at week −1, baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12 of the intervention. During the first visit, and reinforced at subsequent visits, participants received instruction on how to incorporate the supplement into their diets. At each visit, participants were weighed in indoor clothing without shoes and a fasting blood sample was taken. Only the baseline and final body weight data from the final month of the study were used in the final analysis. Also, at each visit, blood pressure was measured while participants were seated, on three occasions at 1 min intervals, using an OMRON HEM 907 XL automatic sphygmomanometer (OMRON Healthcare, Burlington, Ontario, ON, Canada), and the average of the three measurements was taken. In addition, participants brought 7 day food records to each visit, covering the week prior to the visit; this record was discussed with the dietitian.</p>
                <p id="Par28">During the study, participants were asked not to change their oral glucose-lowering medication use. If participants experienced symptoms of hypoglycaemia with blood glucose levels below 3.5 mmol/l (this occurred in one individual on the full-dose nut diet), and providing hypoglycaemia was not explained by specific circumstances, such as missed meals or increased physical activity, medications were reduced, according to a predetermined protocol, by the participants’ physician. If HbA<sub>1c</sub> rose above 69.4 mmol/mol (8.5%) on two successive occasions, participants were withdrawn from the study and referred to their own physician. Two participants were withdrawn, one from the full-dose muffin group and the other from the half-dose nut group. Both had HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels that rose above 69.4 mmol/mol (8.5%) on two successive occasions during recruitment (weeks −1 and 0 for the individual in the half-dose nut group, and weeks 0 and 2 for the individual in the full-dose muffin group (ESM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par29">The study was approved by the research ethics board of St Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto and written consent was obtained from all participants.</p>

                <title>Dietary interventions</title>
                <p id="Par30">General dietary advice conformed to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) and ADA guidelines. Forty-three per cent of the participants were obese (50/117, BMI&gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and wished to lose weight. They were informed that this was not a weight-loss study but were given advice on portion size and food intake to help them meet their body-weight objectives. All participants were advised to reduce total food intake since the supplements replaced approximately 24% of dietary energy, and to take the supplements with meals or as snacks, with a special emphasis on reducing dietary carbohydrate intake. Adherence to the diet supplements was assessed using the final 7 day diet record (obtained at week 12 for <italic>n</italic> = 99 participants or week 8 for <italic>n</italic> = 3 participants for whom week 12 and week 10 diet records were missing) and calculated as a percentage of the amount prescribed.</p>

                <title>Supplements</title>
                <p id="Par31">The nuts supplied consisted of a mixture of unsalted and mostly raw almonds, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, peanuts, cashews and macadamias provided in equal quantities by weight (donated by the International Tree Nut Nutrition Research and Education Foundation, Davis, CA, USA and the Peanut Institute, Albany, GA, USA). The muffin was whole wheat, sweetened with apple concentrate, with no sugar added (Del’s Pastry, Etobicoke, ON, Canada). The full-dose muffin supplement had a very similar protein content to the full-dose nut supplement, by the inclusion of egg white and skimmed milk powder. The energy from the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in the full-dose nut supplement was very similar, by design, to the carbohydrate-derived energy in the full-dose muffin supplement (ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par32">Energy requirements were calculated using the Harris–Benedict equation, with allowance for physical activity. Those participants with energy requirements &gt;10 MJ (2400 kcal) were prescribed supplements of 2.6 MJ (630 kcal) (100 g nuts [<italic>n</italic> = 0], 4 muffins [<italic>n</italic> = 1], or 50 g nuts and 2 muffins [<italic>n</italic> = 1]); those whose requirements were 6.7–10 MJ (1601–2390 kcal) were prescribed supplements of 2.0 MJ (477 kcal) (75 g nuts [<italic>n</italic> = 38], 3 muffins [<italic>n</italic> = 36]; or 37.5 g nuts plus 1.5 muffins [<italic>n</italic> = 36]); and those whose requirements were &lt;6.7 MJ (1600 kcal) were prescribed supplements of 1.31 MJ (314 kcal) (50 g nuts [<italic>n</italic> = 2]; 2 muffins [<italic>n</italic> = 2]; or 25 g nuts and 1 muffin [<italic>n</italic> = 1]) (ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Biochemical analyses</title>
                <p id="Par33">HbA<sub>1c</sub> from whole blood, collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes (VWR International, Mississauga, ON, Canada), was measured within 2 days of collection in the routine biochemistry laboratory of St Michael’s Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada) by a designated HPLC method (Tosoh G7 Automated HPLC Analyzer, Grove City, OH, USA; CV = 1.7%). Blood glucose was analysed on the day of collection, using a glucose oxidase method on a Beckman Coulter Synchron LX20 analyser (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA; CV = 1.9%).</p>
                <p id="Par34">Serum samples were obtained from blood which was allowed to clot at room temperature and spun at 2200 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min in a refrigerated centrifuge (Beckman GS-6KR; Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and were stored at −70°C and, subsequently, analysed for lipids, apolipoproteins and oxidative lipid and protein products at the end of the study. Total cholesterol (CV = 0.8%), triacylglycerol (CV = 1.2%) and HDL-c (HDLC3 homogeneous assay; CV = 0.9%;) were measured on a Roche Cobas 6000 c501 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada), with LDL-c calculated by the Friedewald equation. Serum lipid measurements were standardised with the CDC Lipid Standardization Program (Centres for Disease Control, Lipid Program, Division of Laboratory Sciences, Atlanta, GA, USA). Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1; CV = 1.4%) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB; CV = 2.1%) were measured by nephelometry with the Siemens BN ProSpec analyser (Siemens Canada, Oakville, ON, Canada). C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by endpoint nephelometry (Siemens BN ProSpec analyser). Oxidised products were only measured in samples from participants who completed the study and had sufficient serum available (<italic>n</italic> = 100). Oxidised LDL-c was measured chemically, as conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the LDL fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and oxidised serum proteins were measured as protein thiols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">The electrophoretic characteristics of LDL-c were assessed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, using serum obtained at baseline and at week 12, stored at −70°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The relative (%) proportion of each LDL subfraction (LDL size: &lt;255 ångström [Å], 255–260 Å and &gt;260 Å) was multiplied by the total LDL-c level to obtain the cholesterol concentration in each subfraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

                <p id="Par40">The primary outcome was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to study end using all available data for an intent-to-treat analysis, acknowledging that nine participants did not have post-intervention data. The primary comparison of interest was the difference in change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between the full-dose nut diet and the full-dose muffin diet. The significance of the between-treatment differences was assessed using a repeated measures ANCOVA model, with time treated as a continuous variable (see ESM <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Methods</xref>, SAS code for primary outcome), with a spatial power covariance (PROC MIXED, SAS 9.4; Cary, NC, USA), including all post-intervention time-points as the outcome. The spatial power covariance structure was chosen to account for the within-participant correlation and the unequal spacing of observation times of the repeated measures (at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12 post-baseline) (the SAS code for the primary outcome is provided in ESM <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Methods</xref>). This covariance structure also yielded the smallest corrected Akaike’s Information Criteria (AICC), indicating that it was the best-fitting model for the observed data.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The Tukey adjustment was applied to the significance levels for pairwise comparisons among the three treatments. No correction was made for the multiple different outcomes assessed (e.g. the 24 biochemical comparisons in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Application of the Bonferroni correction would require a <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.0021 (0.05/24) to denote significance. Hence, we regarded these outcomes as exploratory. Covariates included sex and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (≤54.1 mmol/mol [≤7.1%], &gt;54.1 mmol/mol [&gt;7.1%]), representing stratification factors. Further, lipid medication use at baseline was also a covariate, since it had been determined a priori that variables showing treatment differences at baseline, in this case only lipid medication use (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042), would be adjusted for. Measures that were not normally distributed were transformed using the natural logarithm (log<sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) for assessing treatment differences. This process was iterative after assessment of change and not solely based on an examination of baseline information. These adjustments were applied to all measures with the exception of the primary comparison, the difference in change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between the full-dose nut diet and the full-dose muffin diet, where the unadjusted significance value is reported in the text. The treatment effect estimates were assessed using the residual maximum likelihood method with the degrees of freedom calculated by the Kenward–Roger method. In the model, treatment, time, the treatment × time interaction, and baseline were treated as fixed effects, while participant was considered as a random effect (ESM <xref rid="MOESM1"

                <p id="Par42">Baseline was defined as the mean of available screening values plus weeks −1 and 0 for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure variables. Lipids, lipoproteins and CRP were measured in batches in frozen samples; and baseline was calculated as the mean of weeks −1, and 0. If week −1 was missing, the mean of the screening and week 0 sample was used. For other secondary outcomes where samples from both the start and end of the study were available (including LDL particle size and clotting factors), only week 0 and week 12 samples were used for analysis; where week 0 samples were missing, samples from week −1 was used as baseline; where week 12 samples were missing, week 10 samples were used for the end of study measurement or, if these were not available, week 8 samples were used to represent the final month.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Exploratory analyses of the effects of the treatments on dietary variables, LDL particle size, markers of oxidative stress and clotting factors (where only start and end values were available), together with body weight, were all assessed using an ANCOVA with change from baseline (PROC MIXED, SAS 9.4).</p>
                <p id="Par44">A dose–response regression analysis was also carried out using the half-dose nut group as a half dose of the full-dose nut group and assessing outcome as a function of treatment assignment. The model specification was: change in biochemical measure = <italic>α</italic> + <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> dose + ε<sub>ij</sub> (where: <italic>α</italic> = <italic>x</italic>-axis intercept; <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> = slope; dose = 0 for the full-dose muffin group, 0.5 for the half-dose nut group and 1 for the full-dose nut group; and ε<sub>ij</sub> = residual difference between the observed and predicted value). A single unit increase in the nut dose represented the full dose of nuts prescribed, i.e. 50 g/&lt;6.7 MJ (1600 kcal) per day diet, 75 g/6.7–10 MJ (1601–2390 kcal) per day diet or 100 g/&gt;10 MJ (2400 kcal) per day diet. The changes in biochemical measures (HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipids and lipoproteins) were calculated from values at the end of treatment (defined as the mean of week 8–12 values) minus the pooled baseline values. The dose–response data were unadjusted and untransformed. Where only a single baseline and a single end of treatment value were available (LDL particle size and clotting factors), these single values were used in the analysis.</p>

This change was associated with a reduction in carbohydrate intake. Nuts were eaten in excess of that prescribed by some individuals and so the percentage of recommended nut intake exceeded 100% in some cases. The per cent consumption of prescribed supplements was (mean ± SD): 100.5% ± 12.0% for the full-dose nuts; 105.3% ± 13.7% for the half-dose nuts; 90.7% ± 21.2% for the full-dose muffins.</p>

              <p id="Par54">In 1994, the ADA first suggested the possibility of exchanging dietary carbohydrate for MUFA in dietary recommendations for type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Since then, many [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] although not all, studies have shown beneficial effects of MUFA in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In 2011, our own study demonstrated that the use of nuts as a replacement for carbohydrates in the diet led to an improvement in glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, we have withdrawn that paper because of our failure to adequately account for repeated measures in the same participant. Our current manuscript still demonstrates the glycaemic advantage of nuts and also shows a potential CVD advantage in reduced LDL-c, ApoB and LDL-c&lt;<sub>255Å</sub> in the dose–response regression analysis of nuts. In the PREDIMED study, MUFA in the form of either extra virgin olive oil or nuts, reduced CVD in high-risk participants, especially atrial fibrillation and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the current study, participants were instructed to reduce their intake of carbohydrates, especially of starchy foods, to accommodate the muffin and nut supplements. No significant overall weight change was observed with any of the treatments. Consumption of nuts has not been associated with increased body weight despite their high lipid content. Assessing energy intake in those who were on the full-dose nut diet or full-dose muffin diet, a significant change in energy intake was only observed in those on the full-dose nut diet with a BMI over 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; in these individuals, there was a 0.87 MJ (208 kcal) increase (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042) in energy intake, but with no significant increase in body weight (0.37 kg, <italic>p</italic> = 0.452), possibly reflecting the reduced bioavailability of nut lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par55">Cohort studies have provided additional support for the association of higher vegetable fat and protein intake with reduced risk of developing diabetes and CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. More specifically, nut consumption has been shown to be associated with reduced CVD risk, total cancer and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">The relative reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in this study was small (2.0 mmol/mol [0.19%]). Nevertheless, this reduction was approximately half that recognised by the FDA as being therapeutically significant for new drugs (3.3–4.4 mmol/mol [0.3–0.4%], assuming a fasting level of 54.1 mmol/mol [7.1%] for the calculation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Moreover, this beneficial effect of nut consumption on HbA<sub>1c</sub> was seen in those already treated with one to two (average, 1.5) glucose-lowering medications and despite 44–53% of the participants in the three diet groups having baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels already at target (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The potential added benefit of nuts on HbA<sub>1c</sub> may result from a number of factors that may affect postprandial blood glucose. First, nuts added to a meal will reduce the glycaemic load of the meal if isoenergetic intake is maintained. Second, the presence of lipids together with antinutrients, such as phytates and antioxidant phenolics, may delay gastric emptying and the rate of small intestinal absorption, resulting in a flatter postprandial glycaemic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par57">Pharmacological interventions aimed at improving glycaemic control must have no negative impact on CHD risk. In our study, increased nut consumption not only improved glycaemic control but was also negatively associated with lipid risk factors for CHD. The significance of LDL particle size on CHD risk is still debated but evidence from the Quebec Cardiovascular Study suggests a strong positive association between LDL-c<sub>&lt;255Å</sub> and CHD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Small LDL particles may have pro-atherogenic properties compared with large LDL particles, owing to increased vulnerability to oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Most studies show that isoenergetic exchange of carbohydrate for fat tends to reduce serum levels of small LDL particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], although others have not observed this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In our study, the change in lipid and lipoprotein risk factors for CVD (LDL-c, LDL-c<sub>&lt;255Å</sub>, non-HDL-c, and ApoB) were negatively related to the changes in nut intake, supporting the recognised hypocholesterolaemic effects of nuts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and providing additional mechanistic evidence for the association of nut intake with reduced CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par58">Higher circulating clotting factor VII concentrations have also been associated with increased CHD risk. This has been demonstrated in the Northwick Park Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and, more recently, in the Prospective Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], in which the association between raised clotting factor VII and the incidence of CHD was assessed at the respective 5 and 8 years follow-up of these cohorts. In the PROCAM study, in 1780 healthy men, 130 events occurred during follow-up, with a significant increase (~3.4%) in factor VII levels when all CHD events were considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Perhaps for reasons of power, nut consumption did not have an effect on clotting factors in our study; although a significant change in factor VII was observed when using the unadjusted comparison of the full-dose nut diet vs the full-dose muffin diet (<italic>p</italic> = 0.043), significance was lost after adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p>
              <p id="Par59">The major weakness of the study is that it was underpowered to establish a dose response to nuts. Also, in the present study, nut consumption was substantial (75 g/8.4 MJ (477 kcal), equating to 24% of energy intake) for the full-dose nut diet. However, compliance levels were high: 100.5% and 105.3% for the full-dose nut and half-dose nut groups, respectively.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Further a study-wide adjustment was not made for the multiplicity of comparisons. The secondary outcomes must therefore be seen as exploratory. Since this is a post-retraction reanalysis of a previously published trial, all results could be considered post hoc. In terms of the original protocol, insulin, HOMA-IR, serum amyloid A, IL-6 and waist and hip circumference were not measured, but LDL particle size, non-HDL-c, factor VII, factor VIII, fibrinogen and PAI1 were measured as emerging risk factors for CVD. By comparison with the retracted study, we have now lost significance for total cholesterol, LDL-c, total cholesterol:HDL-c, LDL-c:HDL-c, and ApoB:ApoA1 in comparison of the full-dose nut diet with the full-dose muffin diet. Significance was also lost for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, total cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure when the full-dose nut group was compared with the half-dose nut group. Nonetheless, significance was retained for the primary outcome, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and also for ApoB, and it was gained for LDL-c<sub>&lt;255Å</sub>, when comparing the full-dose nut group with the full-dose muffin group.</p>
              <p id="Par61">The statistical approach used in the current study represents a departure from the pre-specified original analytical plan. The statistical analysis was originally intended to involve <italic>t</italic> tests and χ<sup>2</sup> tests, together with standard equation modelling. Use of a repeated measures mixed model (ANCOVA) was also originally considered as an option to account for possible confounders. We believe our current approach fulfils the original intention by appropriately accounting for the correlation between repeated measures in the same individual and the use of covariates to adjust treatment effects.</p>
              <p id="Par62">Finally, our failure to demonstrate a treatment difference in the antioxidant effects of nut consumption may relate to the relatively high content of antioxidants in wheat bran and apple concentrate used in the muffins.</p>
              <p id="Par63">The strengths of the study include its novelty as one of the few studies to assess the effects of the consumption of mixed nuts in type 2 diabetes. It is also one of very few studies to assess the effects of nut consumption on apolipoproteins and the only study to examine the effect of nuts on LDL particle size and clotting factors. Another strength of the study was that supplement compliance was good.</p>
              <p id="Par64">In conclusion, the exchange of carbohydrate intake in the form of a whole-wheat muffin for monounsaturated fats in nuts improved glycaemic control in diabetes and was negatively associated with lipid risk factors for CVD. These data support the benefit of including nuts in the diet of individuals with diabetes despite previous concerns over their high fat and energy density.</p>
