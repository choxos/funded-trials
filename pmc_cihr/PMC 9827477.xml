                  <p>Diagnostic reasoning requires clinicians to think through complex
uncertainties. We tested the possibility of a bias toward an available
single diagnosis in uncertain cases.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>We developed 5 different surveys providing a succinct description of a
hypothetical individual patient scenaric. Each scenario was formulated in 2
versions randomized to participants, with the versions differing only in
whether an alternative diagnosis was present or absent. The 5 scenarios were
designed as separate tests of robustness using diverse cases, including a
cautious scenario, a risky scenario, a sophisticated scenario, a validation
scenario, and a comparative scenario (each survey containing only 1 version
of 1 scenario). Participants included community members (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>
= 1104) and health care professionals (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 200) who judged
the chances of COVID infection in an individual patient.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The first scenario described a cautious patient and found a 47% reduction in
the estimated odds of COVID when a flu diagnosis was present compared with
absent (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.94,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.003). The second scenario described a less
cautious patient and found a 70% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in
the presence of a flu diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval
0.13 to 0.70, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The third was a more
sophisticated scenario presented to medical professionals and found a 73%
reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a mononucleosis
diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.75,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Two further scenarios—avoiding mention
of population norms—replicated the results.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The principle of diagnostic parsimony has endured for centuries and is popularized by
the term <italic toggle="yes">Occam’s razor</italic>. The general concept is that simple
explanations ought to be preferred over more convoluted theories.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Incorporating
Occam’s razor into modern medicine, however, has led to dissenting
perspectives.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Hickam’s dictum is a counterargument that asserts a patient,
especially in an era in which patients are older and increasingly frail, can have
multiple diagnoses occurring together.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Such conflicting perspectives
around diagnostic simplicity and complexity abound in daily medical practice and
will not end soon.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic starting 2019 (termed
COVID) provides a new opportunity to examine medical judgment under uncertainty
because symptoms are ambiguous, test results can take time, a definitive diagnosis
is eventually established, and outcomes can be serious. Moreover, the presence of
one virus does not exclude the possibility that a second infection is present
simultaneously.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Epidemiology suggests, furthermore, that co-infection from
different pathogens is frequent because of common risk factors such as crowded
living spaces, lapses in hand hygiene, social interactions, insufficient distancing,
and other health determinants.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Undue deference to Occam’s razor can thus lead to oversimplification, premature
diagnostic closure, and potentially faulty patient care.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Direct tests of Occam’s razor
in judgment under uncertainty, however, rarely appear in evidence-based medicine
(beyond editorial commentary and case reports).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Here, we tested whether
judgments about COVID infection show a bias toward diagnostic parsimony.
Specifically, we hypothesized that an available alternative explanation might lead
individuals to underestimate the likelihood of a COVID diagnosis. A randomized test
of this fallacy may help motivate greater awareness and more effective medical
care.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p>We developed survey materials using methods adapted from behavioral decision
science. This involved creating different scenarios that each provided a
succinct description of an individual patient who had symptoms suggestive of
COVID. When appropriate, each scenario also provided the population baseline
norm (average risk) of COVID relevant to the setting. The purpose of each
scenario was to elicit judgments about the relative likelihood of COVID in the
hypothetical individual patient. The question wording was, “What are the chances
that [the patient] has COVID?” The 5 response options were “definitely below the

                <p>Each scenario was formulated in 2 different versions, defined the
<italic toggle="yes">absent</italic> version and the <italic toggle="yes">present</italic> version.
The <italic toggle="yes">absent</italic> version described an alternative infection
(influenza, mononucleosis, strep throat) that had been considered, tested, and
excluded (the patient did not have the alternative infection). The
<italic toggle="yes">present</italic> version described the same alternative infection
that had been considered, tested, and confirmed (the patient did have the
alternative infection). Given the information about the absence or presence of
the alternative infection, participants then judged the relative likelihood of
COVID infection in the patient. In all other respects, the 2 versions were
identical, involved only a single question, and were randomly assigned to
participants.</p>
                <p>Five other survey features were designed to minimize bias. First, each scenario
was conceived based on direct clinical experience to make materials original,
succinct, clear, meaningful, and relevant. Second, each survey was conducted
during active waves of the COVID pandemic to check robustness, provide realistic
population norms, and respect community priorities. Third, the scenarios
described an individual who was young and had no comorbidities to reduce the
need for medical expertise and minimize complexity. Fourth, each respondent was
assigned only 1 version of 1 scenario to avoid carryover artifacts and survey
fatigue. Fifth, no identifying demographic information on respondents was
collected to maintain confidentiality and reduce respondent workload.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>We surveyed different participant groups primarily from North America. The
largest group was community participants recruited by the Qualtrics Survey
platform (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.qualtrics.com/lp/survey-platform/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.qualtrics.com/lp/survey-platform/</ext-link>). Another group
was health care workers surveyed in person during a mandatory 15-min observation
interval immediately after receiving a COVID vaccination. The overall intent was
to elicit judgments from potential patients as well as from health care workers
who were experienced, motivated, informed, and engaged. Surveys for community
participants were conducted in September 2020 (second wave of the pandemic) and
April 2021 (after the third wave had subsided); surveys for health care workers
occurred in February 2021 (initial vaccine rollout).</p>
                <p>All participants completed the survey at their own pace (with a planned time to
completion of less than 2 min) and returned responses anonymously (with no
formal debriefing). Each participant was blinded to the hypothesis, unaware of
alternative versions, and given only a single scenario. Community participants
were compensated at the standard internet platform rate ($15 per 1h, equal to $1
per 4 min), whereas health care workers received no incentives. The introductory
script for healthcare workers was, “I am hoping you might complete a short
survey. It is voluntary, intended for research, and needs no identifying data.
Your involvement, results, or lack of participation will not affect your status
here at Sunnybrook.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Princeton University and
by the Sunnybrook Research Institute (file No. 3798). The approval included a
waiver for signed consent, with consent expressed by checking the appropriate
box on the survey platform or by willingness to complete the short paper survey.
The community participants received the survey online, and the health care group
received the survey on paper in person. Patients and the public were not
involved in study design or reporting. At the time of the surveys, PCR testing
was the primary method for diagnosing COVID in the community, with a typical 1-
to 2 day delay for reporting. Community respondent demographics are summarized
in the <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0272989X221121343" ext-link-type="uri">Appendix</ext-link>.</p>

                <p>The primary analysis compared responses in the 2 versions of each scenario,
expressed as the proportion of respondents who judged the patient’s chance of
COVID infection as below the norm. Statistical analyses used the chi-square test
and the odds ratio as a consistent measure of effect size (analyses using the
Mann-Whitney test to account for the full nonparametric distribution yielded
similar results and are not reported). Sample size calculations were designed to
provide an 80% power (beta = 0.20) for detecting an effect size of at least 15%
(baseline 25% reduced to 10%). The analytic plan was specified in advance, and
each scenario was considered an independent test. All <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values
were 2 tailed, and the same statistical tests were used for all scenarios.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p>Through scenarios involving a spectrum of risk, we found that respondents judged
the probability of COVID infection to be lower in the presence of another
diagnosis compared with when an alternative diagnosis was absent. These
judgments are problematic because a simple diagnosis (e.g., influenza) provides
no protection against COVID infection. Co-occurrence of influenza and COVID is
less likely when behaviors are cautious (scenario 1) than risky (scenario 2),
but the chance of COVID does not decrease in the presence of another disease
unless the two are negatively correlated.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Instead, our respondents
consistently lowered their judged likelihood of COVID infection when an
alternate diagnosis was present (<xref rid="table1-0272989X221121343" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This bias might reduce a
patient’s willingness to seek care and a clinician’s propensity to investigate a

                <title>Selective Justifications</title>
                <p>Diagnostic parsimony is sometimes appropriate. Some anatomical disorders are
mutually exclusive; for example, a diagnosis of micrognathia tends to exclude a
diagnosis of macrognathia. Similarly, many metabolic disturbances cannot
coexist; for example, a diagnosis of Addison’s disease excludes a diagnosis of
Cushing’s syndrome. Other problems are confined to different populations; for
example, a diagnosis of uterine cancer is unlikely to occur with a diagnosis of
prostate cancer. And some issues are segregated across time; for example, a
diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is unlikely to occur with a diagnosis of
osteoporosis. In many other cases, Occam’s razor will appear correct simply due
to chance, because of the low base-rate frequency of most individual
diseases.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Reliance on Occam’s razor is sometimes expedient. Heuristic thinking early in an
epidemic may be justified by the lack of hard data for directly estimating
disease probabilities. Reliance on simplicity is also encouraged by binary
diagnostic algorithms and by billing systems that ask for a single diagnosis for
a clinical encounter. Furthermore, exhaustive diagnostic testing can potentially
yield adverse patient outcomes from iatrogenic harms, false positives, and
wasted time.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A plurality of diagnoses may also be hard to defend when a
patient has minimal symptoms, since double-trouble should otherwise lead to
worse severity. Medical care might also prove overwhelming if clinicians
considered all the complexity occurring each day.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Fundamental Misconception</title>
                <p>Many diseases, however, cluster together (e.g., hypertension and diabetes). A
diagnosis of one of these diseases is no time to appeal to parsimony and neglect
combined comorbidities. In the initial years of the pandemic (when COVID tests
were in short supply), guidelines mistakenly suggested the presence of the flu
reduced the likelihood of a COVID diagnosis and prioritized testing only when
influenza was absent.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Subsequent microbiology evidence contradicted this
assumption and found similar rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and
without other pathogens.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Of course, the converse is also relevant: the presence
of a COVID diagnosis does not guarantee the absence of another serious disease
(e.g., tuberculosis).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Our study highlights a misconception about the laws of probability. The logic of
Venn diagrams implies that an intersection set tends to be smaller than a single
set; however, the arithmetic of conditional probability is more complex (<xref rid="fig1-0272989X221121343" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). As an analogy,
consider that a patient’s probability of having a fever exceeds the probability
of fever and fatigue; however, a patient’s probability of fever with fatigue can
exceed the probability of fever without fatigue. Similarly, a patient’s risk of
co-infection is necessarily less than the risk of having 1 infection; however,
the risk of co-infection may easily exceed the risk of having 1 infection
exclusively. Fallible intuitions often reflect a failure to think of the inverse
conditional probability.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr18-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Our study has limitations that merit mention. We tested different groups at
different times, yet more replication is justified. Future research could also
test whether the effect varies in different individuals. We examined diagnostic
judgments in simple scenarios, whereas daily care is more complicated and
challenging. We examined brief scenarios that allowed time for uninterrupted
thought, whereas clinical decisions often involve distractions, uncertainties,
and conflicting priorities. We examined one viral infection, whereas a bias
toward simple diagnoses might extend more broadly. To be sure, our design
renders the results difficult to attribute to a lack of education, sloppy
responses, strategic ploys, fallible test results, atypical respondent samples,
incentives, or chance.</p>
                <p>Other pitfalls in diagnostic reasoning can reinforce an unduly parsimonious
explanation. People tend to discount alternative explanations once a compelling
account is available.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In addition, a focusing illusion can arise wherein a
particular explanation or a popular misconception appears overly compelling due

unique insights known to a few.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These and other factors

                <p>Our results suggest that an available simple diagnosis can lead to premature
closure and a failure to fully consider additional serious diseases. Like other
heuristics, this shortcut in reasoning is often effective but sometimes
mistaken. The appeal to Occam’s razor is justified mostly when the alternative
diagnosis is inversely correlated or relatively rare.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In the case of COVID

preventive health strategies.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0272989X221121343" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The tension between
diagnostic parsimony and precision is not easy to resolve, will continue beyond
