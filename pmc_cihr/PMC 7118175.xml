                <p id="Par1">It remains unclear why many patients with depression do not respond to antidepressant treatment. In three cohorts of individuals with depression and treated with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (<italic>N</italic> = 424) we show that responders, but not non-responders, display an increase of GPR56 mRNA in the blood. In a small group of subjects we also show that GPR56 is downregulated in the PFC of individuals with depression that died by suicide. In mice, we show that chronic stress-induced Gpr56 downregulation in the blood and prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is accompanied by depression-like behavior, and can be reversed by antidepressant treatment. Gpr56 knockdown in mouse PFC is associated with depressive-like behaviors, executive dysfunction and poor response to antidepressant treatment. GPR56 peptide agonists have antidepressant-like effects and upregulated AKT/GSK3/EIF4 pathways. Our findings uncover a potential role of GPR56 in antidepressant response.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Antidepressants are the first-line treatment for moderate to severe major depressive episodes (MDE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and although they are effective, not every patient responds to antidepressant treatment. Approximately 40% of patients respond to their first antidepressant trial, and following multiple trials, response rates increase up to 70%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Antidepressants are thought to act through modulation of mono-amines, but the precise mechanisms whereby they affect therapeutic response, as well as the underlying causes of treatment-response variability, remain poorly understood. Therefore, there is an important need to better understand molecular pathways and mechanisms involved in antidepressant response. In this study, we examined peripheral gene expression in three cohorts of individuals with MDD undergoing antidepressant treatment and identified one gene, G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) whose expression was consistently associated with antidepressant response. We further characterized the function and signaling properties of this gene in vivo and in vitro, and found it to be related to depressive-like behaviors and executive functioning, and to upregulate classical antidepressant signaling pathways upon activation.</p>

                <p id="Par4">Antidepressant response involves a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Using a double-blind, randomized clinical trial design (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), we first set out to investigate mRNA changes associated with antidepressant response in patients undergoing a MDE (<italic>N</italic> = 237) treated with either the antidepressant duloxetine (<italic>N</italic> = 112), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or with placebo (<italic>N</italic> = 125), over eight weeks. After treatment, 89 (79.5%) and 51 (40.8%) patients were responders in the duloxetine and placebo arms, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Using the Human HT-12 v4 Expression Bead Chip (Illumina), we found 42 probes, corresponding to 41 different annotated genes, that were overexpressed following duloxetine treatment in responder patients (FDR &lt; 1%). Two of these probes were also upregulated in the placebo group, but among non-responders, while the remaining 40 were specifically overexpressed in duloxetine responders (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). No downregulated probes were found by our initial analysis, while 1752 and 1670 probes were found to be downregulated and overexpressed, respectively, using a <italic>t</italic>-test without correction (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). G protein-coupled receptor 56 (<italic>GPR56</italic>), also known as <italic>ADGRG1</italic>, a G protein-coupled receptor of the adhesion class, was the most significantly upregulated mRNA based on fold change (FC) and q-value during duloxetine treatment (FC = 1.19, <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Using a general linear model (GLM) for repeated measures, we confirmed that <italic>GPR56</italic> was specifically increased only in patients who responded to duloxetine (<italic>F</italic>(1,199) = 8.47, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). These results were technically validated using qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and were not explained by potential clinical or biological confounders including sex, age, BMI, or sample cellular composition (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title><italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA is related to antidepressant response.</title><p><bold>a</bold> In the discovery cohort, 237 patients in a major depressive episode were randomized to double-blind treatment with either duloxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 112) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 125), for up to 8 weeks. Using two-class paired significant analysis of microarray (SAM) with correction for multiple testing (FDR &lt; 1%) in patients who responded to duloxetine, <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA is the most significantly upregulated mRNA in whole blood after duloxetine treatment, based on fold change and <italic>q</italic>-value (FC = 1.19, <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.01). General linear model (GLM) demonstrated a time x treatment interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,199)=8.468, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, that confirms the specificity of <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA increase in responders to duloxetine. <bold>b</bold> In the first replication cohort (Montréal), patients were treated with citalopram in an open-label trial. <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA in whole blood demonstrated an increase only in responders.

                <p id="Par5">We next investigated whether the results observed in our discovery cohort could be replicated in two independent cohorts with similar clinical characteristics, but treated with different antidepressants. The Montréal cohort consisted of patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram over 8 weeks (<italic>N</italic> = 63, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Similar to the discovery cohort, we found that peripheral levels of <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA significantly increased after treatment only in patients who responded to antidepressant treatment (<italic>F</italic>(1,61) = 4.273, <italic>p</italic> = 0.043; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Our third cohort (Marseille cohort) was designed as a naturalistic 30-week-follow-up study, which investigated patients with depression (<italic>N</italic> = 64) and healthy subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 87) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Patients received antidepressant treatment as prescribed by their physician/psychiatrist (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). As observed in the other two cohorts, we found that <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA levels significantly increased as a function of response after 8 weeks (<italic>N</italic> = 30, FC = 1.26; paired <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic> = −2.52, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018) while no change were observed in non-responders (<italic>N</italic> = 34, <italic>t</italic> = 0.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.73).

                <title>Effects of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) on Gpr56</title>
                <p id="Par6">Our results above suggest that GPR56 may be involved in mechanisms associated with antidepressant response that are common to different classes of antidepressants, but interestingly, not involved in mechanisms of placebo response. To further examine the potential function and regulation of Gpr56 in depression and antidepressant response, we conducted studies in animals, using the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm, a well validated murine model of depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, followed by treatment with fluoxetine, a standard SSRI, to model antidepressant effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In this model, stress-exposure leads to depressive-like behaviors (displayed as increased anhedonia and/or resignation) that can be alleviated by subsequent administration of an antidepressant. We have previously adapted this model to distinguish between responder and non-responder mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Here, chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors were effectively reversed in 60% (responders) of the fluoxetine-treated mice. Thus, we investigated peripheral <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA levels in mice subjected to UCMS and found a significant decrease in mice that manifested depressive-like symptoms as compared to non-stressed mice (FC = 0.81; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Interestingly, reversal of the depressive-like behaviors with antidepressant treatment was paralleled by normalization of blood <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA expression in responder mice, i.e., demonstrating improvement in depressive-like phenotype. In contrast, blood <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA levels remained low in non-responder mice, in close analogy to the <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression biosignature seen in the human studies detailed above (<italic>F</italic> = 6.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) and antidepressant response dysregulate <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA in blood and CNS in mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold><italic>Gpr56</italic> expression was analysed by qRT-PCR in blood and several brain regions, including the dorsal and ventral hippocampal areas (HD and HV, respectively), the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) in non-stressed or stressed mice (exposed to UCMS) and receiving vehicle or fluoxetine. Mice treated by fluoxetine were classified as “responders” or “non-responders” according to behavioral tests. <bold>b</bold> In whole blood, a one-way ANOVA showed between group differences for <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression (<italic>F</italic> = 6,150, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Blood <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA expression was decreased in mice subjected to UCMS, while reversal of depressive-like behaviors with fluoxetine was paralleled by normalization of blood <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA expression in responder mice (post hoc analysis <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). <bold>c</bold> In brain, a two-way ANOVA between group and brain regions showed a significant interaction between brain region and mice group (<italic>F</italic>(9,151) = 3.112; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0018).

                <p id="Par7">Using the same model, we then sought to investigate the effects of stress-induced depression and antidepressant treatment on <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression in the central nervous system (CNS). We focused on four regions of interest: the dorsal and ventral hippocampal areas (HD and HV, respectively), the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), all previously implicated in stress and depression, albeit in a different manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A repeated measures two-way ANOVA analysis between groups and brain regions showed a significant interaction between brain region and phenotypes (<italic>F</italic>(9,151) = 3.112; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0018) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Subsequent post hoc analyses showed that stress-induced a significant reduction in <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression in the PFC (FC = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006) and no effect in the NAcc (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08). In the hippocampus we observed a difference in the HD (FC = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), in accordance with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but not in the HV (<italic>p</italic> = 0.88). In the PFC, we observed a bimodal regulation of <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA by UCMS and antidepressant treatment. UCMS exposure led to reduced <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which was normalized by antidepressant administration in responder mice, but not in non-responder mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), a pattern remarkably similar to that seen in the mouse and human blood samples. In contrast, in the HD, while UCMS induced a downregulation of <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA, antidepressant treatment had no effect in responder mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.38). Although brain-blood correlation of gene expression remains a matter of debate, it is worth noting that <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA levels were significantly correlated between the PFC and peripheral blood in stressed mice (<italic>r</italic> = 0.51; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) while in control mice, we found no correlation between blood and PFC (<italic>p</italic> = 0.21). Taken together, our results suggest that an increase in <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression levels may be an integral part of effective antidepressant action. Our results also suggest a specific role for the PFC in relation to <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA variation in depressive-like behaviors and antidepressant action, as we found no significant effect of antidepressant-related regulation of <italic>Gpr56</italic> in several other brain regions, including the HD.</p>

                <title>Effects of Gpr56 over-expression and knockdown on mouse behavior</title>
                <p id="Par8">To investigate a possible causal relationship between <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA variation in the PFC and behavioral responses to stress, we used a viral vector strategy to locally manipulate <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression levels selectively in the PFC, and thus determine the influence of increased or decreased expression of <italic>Gpr56</italic> on depressive-like behaviors and/or antidepressant action in the mouse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In naive mice, bilateral PFC infusions of a lentivirus-<italic>Gpr56</italic> construct resulted in PFC <italic>Gpr56</italic> overexpression (FC = 2.02, <italic>t</italic> = 4.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5B</xref>), while bilateral PFC infusions of a lentivirus-sh-<italic>Gpr56</italic> construct resulted in PFC <italic>Gpr56</italic> downregulation (FC = 0.49, <italic>t</italic> = 3.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5C</xref>). Behavioral analysis showed that PFC <italic>Gpr56</italic> downregulation was sufficient to produce depressive-like behaviors in unstressed mice, as seen by increased immobility in the TST (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, <italic>t</italic> = 2.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048). This test is among the most commonly used procedures to detect clinically effective antidepressant agents because of its high degree of predictive validity, and has been previously used to identify mouse strains that are resistant or hyporesponsive to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the same test, PFC <italic>Gpr56</italic> overexpression in naive mice induced the opposite effect, namely decreased immobility, the hallmark effect of antidepressant action (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, <italic>t</italic> = 3.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). In both cases there was no effect on locomotor activity, indicating no change in general ambulatory behavior (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>A and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7A</xref>), but rather a targeted effect of <italic>Gpr56</italic> PFC manipulations on stress-triggered behaviors. This observation was further strengthened by similar results in the forced swim test (FST) for both up- and downregulation of Gpr56 (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6B</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7B</xref>). We also found behavioral effects for <italic>Gpr56</italic> downregulation in the sucrose preference and O-maze tests (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7C–D</xref>). Cognitive symptoms are often associated with MDE and may have prognostic and therapeutic implications, in particular related to executive functioning and PFC functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a consequence, we also conducted a set shifting test (SST), a well validated cognitive test in mice related to PFC functioning, in sh-<italic>Gpr56</italic>-PFC mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

Based on this mechanism, synthetic peptides (i.e., P7 “TYFAVLM-NH2” and P19 “TYFAVLMQLSPALVPAELL-NH2”), comprising the specific portion of the tethered-peptide-agonist, have been generated and demonstrate GPR56 agonist properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We bilaterally infused these peptides and their inactive controls in the mouse PFC to explore the behavioral effects of GPR56 activation. Parallel to our results with Gpr56 overexpression, behavioral analyses showed that GPR56 agonists produced antidepressant-like effects in unstressed mice, as seen by decreased immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) for P7 with a dose-response profile (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, ANOVA <italic>F</italic>(1,4) = 4.88 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) and for P19 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Interestingly, we confirmed the specificity of antidepressant-like effects of GPR56 in the PFC by using the same peptides infused in the NAcc, which produced no behavioral effects (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Finally, the antidepressant-like effect of the GPR56 agonists was not explained by basic locomotion differences, as we did not find any differences in ambulations across time between active peptides and their controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). These data provide evidence that activation of GPR56 through pharmacological manipulation by GPR56-specific ligands has antidepressant-like-effects, specifically in the PFC. These experiments further support a role of GPR56 in depressive-like behaviors and antidepressant response. Furthermore, they indicate that GPR56 may represent a molecular target for treatment of MDD.</p>

                <p id="Par14">In order to gain a more complete understanding of downstream signaling processes initiated by GPR56 activation, we investigated the transcriptional consequences of treatment with the two GPR56 agonists described above. These experiments were performed in vitro, using a human neuroblastoma cell line, which was treated with the agonist peptides for 24 h then examined using RNA sequencing. We used these cells because they are derived from neural cells, express GPR56 receptors, and express genes from several important pathways that have been associated with antidepressant response, including the serotonin signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par15">To functionally characterize the gene expression variation associated with agonist-induced activation of GPR56, we used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. 6,568 gene sets with sizes between 15 and 500 genes were included in the analysis after gene set size filtering.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par16">Taken together, our preclinical and clinical results identified GPR56 as a player in depressive symptomatology and a key mediator of antidepressant response in blood and in the brain. In blood, <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA increased in parallel to antidepressant response and could be used to monitor antidepressant response. In the brain, namely in the PFC, decreased <italic>GPR56</italic> expression associated with depression in humans or depressive-like behaviors in mice, whereas in mice increased PFC <italic>GPR56</italic> expression was necessary and sufficient for antidepressant action, an effect that might involve cognitive modulation. Using two agonist peptides, we confirmed in mice that activation of GPR56 in the PFC is associated with behavioral responses that are commonly associated with antidepressant treatment. Moreover, based on cell experiments and RNA sequencing, we found that GPR56 agonists upregulated AKT-GSK3-EIF4 pathways, downstream biological mechanisms previously associated with depression and antidepressants action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although we did not examine these pathways in vivo, it is possible that the upregulation of these pathways explains the antidepressant effects that were observed following agonist treatment. Overall, our results suggest that GPR56 is a potential target for development of antidepressant drugs.</p>
              <p id="Par17">GPR56 is involved in a number of biological functions relevant to the pathophysiology of depression, including neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte development and progenitor cell migration in brain, as well as myelin repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, in parallel to its important role in immune cell functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. GPR56 ligands comprise two general subtypes: (1) proteins from the surface of neighboring cells, and (2) extracellular matrix proteins. Known extracellular ligands of GPR56 include collagen III, transglumatinase 2, and heparin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Following activation of the GPR56 receptor by its ligands, the extracellular and transmembrane domains dissociate to reveal a tethered-peptide-agonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To date, it remains unclear which ligand could be related to depressive behavior and antidepressant effects of GPR56 in the PFC. GPCRs are particularly appealing drug targets. While further efforts are needed to develop compounds with optimised pharmacokinetic properties for in vivo administration, our findings identify a previously unsuspected GPCR as a possible target for antidepressants.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Our study does have several limitations. Firstly, the human cohorts have relatively modest sample sizes that may limit the generalisation of our results. However, we replicated our findings in three relatively different treatment cohorts. Secondly, as we only conducted these studies using SSRI and SNRI antidepressants, we cannot conclude if <italic>GPR56</italic> is involved in antidepressant response in general or limited to specific antidepressant classes. Thirdly, <italic>GPR56</italic> is expressed in numerous cell types and tissues, and is involved in different processes that may be related to antidepressant response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In the brain, single-cell sequencing data from the frontal cortex indicates that <italic>GPR56</italic> is expressed in all cell types, including glutamatergic neurons, and astrocytes, where relatively higher levels are observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These data are consistent, although not fully concordant, with results we observed in the mouse using fluorescence in situ hybridization (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). In the future, cell-type specific studies should be conducted in order to elucidate the mechanisms through which GPR56 is involved in depression and antidepressant response. It remains unclear how <italic>GPR56</italic> may be regulated by antidepressants in both the brain and blood. Moreover, it is unclear if variation in the blood only mirrors a process in the brain, or reflects an active biological process that influences antidepressant response. Fourthly, we conducted our animal experiments to test the causal relationship between Gpr56 under- and over-expression, as well as pharmacological testing, only in acute stress paradigms of depressive-like symptoms (i.e., TST, FST).</p>
              <p id="Par19">Despite these limitations, by integrating several clinical cohorts, animal studies and post-mortem brain analyses, our results provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of depression, and suggest a drug target for the treatment of MDD.</p>

The mice were kept under standard conditions at 22 ± 1 °C, and a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum except when food/water deprivation was part of the experimental protocol. Humidity levels were between 45 and 55%. Behavioral assessments were performed during the second half of the light phase. All animal protocols and welfare complied with French and European Ethical regulations. The experimental protocols were approved by the local Ethical Committee (Comité d'éthique en expérimentation animale Charles Darwin N°5).</p>
                <p id="Par32">Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS): After a two week acclimation period BALB/c male mice (8-week old) were individually housed and subjected to UCMS as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Stressors, typically wet bedding, tilted cages, lights on at night, crowding, difficult access to food, paired housing with intruder restraint and forced swim were applied twice a day for a two hour period and overnight in a randomized order. No food deprivation was used. Control (non-stressed) mice were standard housed in a room distinct to that of the stressed mice. Throughout the UCMS protocol the animal’s weight was measured every five days. At the end of the chronic stress protocol the emotional state of the animals was evaluated in the TST and the sucrose preference tests as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The stress procedure was maintained with items compatible with behavioral testing. Control (non-stressed) mice were left undisturbed throughout the protocol.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Pharmacological effects and response to antidepressants in UCMS-subjected mice were assessed with a reversal protocol (45 days of UCMS; treatment during the last 3 weeks) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Namely, mice were subjected to the UCMS-protocol for 45 days starting Day 0. During the first 3 weeks there was no treatment for any of the groups. From week 4 until the end of the protocol, mice were treated daily with saline or the reference antidepressant fluoxetine at 15 mg/kg, i.p., daily. In the literature it has been reported that fluoxetine administered in a reversal mode exerts a bimodal effect; it elicits a response in a sub-group of responder mice and has no effect on a distinct sub-group of non-responders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to distinguish between fluoxetine responders and non-responders for subsequent qPCR determinations of <italic>Gpr56</italic> mRNA expression.</p>
                <p id="Par34"><italic>Lentiviral particle-infusions in the PFC:</italic> Lentiviral particles: The following commercially available lentiviral particle solutions were used: for <italic>Gpr56</italic> overexpression, we used the Adgrg1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_018882">NM_018882</ext-link>) Mouse Tagged ORF Clone Lentiviral Particle, &gt;10<sup>7</sup> TU/mL (Origene CAT#: MR210044L2V), and for <italic>Gpr56</italic> downregulation, we used <italic>Gpr56</italic> shRNA (m) Lentiviral Particles (Santa Cruz: sc-60750-V).</p>
                <p id="Par35">Infusions: For stereotaxic delivery, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (100/10 mg/kg, i.p.) and then given bilateral microinjections of 0.8 μl/side of lentivirus solution at a rate of 0.1 μl/min. The following stereotaxic coordinates were used for viral delivery: +1.9 mm (anterior/posterior), +0.75 (lateral), −2.75 (dorsal/ventral) at an angle of 15° from the midline (relative to bregma). Animals were left to recover for 4–5 weeks before behavioral testing. The correct placement of the injection site was verified histologically at the end of the experiments (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5A</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par36"><italic>Gpr56 agonist:</italic> To test the antidepressant-like effect of Gpr56 agonists, we bilaterally infused synthetic peptides (P7 and P19) as well as control or an inactive modified peptide (P19 Y -&gt;N: “TNFAVLMQLSPALVPAELL-NH2”) previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, both in the PFC and in the NAcc of mice. Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (100/10 mg/kg, i.p.) and stereotaxically implanted with 12 mm long canulae in the left and right PrL Area (anterior (AP) + 1.9 from the bregma; lateral (ML) +/− 0.5; ventral (DV) −1.3) or in the left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (AP + 1,6; ML +/− 0.7; DV −3.3). Animals were left to recover for at least 7 days. On the test day, infusion needles (30 Gauge) were inserted into the canulae (needles were 13 mm long i.e. ending 1 mm deeper than the guide canulae) and mice were locally infused with a pump (UNIVENTOR), at a rate of 0.5 μl/min, with P7 (0.5 mM, 1 mM or 2 mM) or vehicle (vehicle: 80% saline + 10% DMSO + 10% Cremophor), or with P19 (1 mM) or its inactive control peptide P19YN (1 mM). The needles were left in place for another 2 min to ensure compound diffusion. Mice were subsequently placed in their cage until the TST session (30 min after infusion).</p>
                <p id="Par37"><italic>Behavioral studies:</italic> Behavioral testing was performed using 7–22 animals per group.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Tail suspension test (TST): Immobility was measured in the TST as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Mice were individually tail-suspended by using a paper adhesive tape that was placed 1 cm from the tip of the tail, in such manner as to down rate the probability of the mice reaching their tail. Immobility time (seconds) was measured during a 6 min test period. In case of the mouse catching its tale the measure was discarded. We tested 8–15 mice/group.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Forced swimming test (FST): The forced swimming test was conducted in clear plastic cylinders (diameter 20 cm; height 25 cm) filled with 6 cm of water (22–25 °C) for 6 min. The duration of immobility was measured manually during the last 4 min of the 6 min trial. A mouse was regarded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above the water. We tested 11–22 mice/group.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Locomotor activity: Horizontal activity (ambulations) was assessed in transparent activity cages (20 × 15 × 25 cm), with automatic monitoring of photocell beam breaks (Imetronic, France). Locomotor activity (ambulations defined as breaking two consecutive beams) was recorded for a 1-h period and we conducted analyses between groups, both for the first 6 min and the total duration of the test. We tested 7–21 mice/group.</p>
                <p id="Par41">O-maze: The O-maze consisted of a white circular path (runway width 5.5 cm, Ø = 46 cm) with two opposing compartments protected by walls (height = 10 cm) and two open sectors of equal size. The maze was elevated 40 cm above the ground and illuminated from the top with white light (50 Lux). At the start of the testing session, mice were placed at the end of one of the two closed compartments. The test was recorded with a camera for 5 min. We tested 10–18 mice/group.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Sucrose consumption: For the sucrose preference test mice were first habituated to drink from two graduated pipettes: one filled with water, and the other with sucrose solution for 3 days. The side of the sucrose pipette was alternated each day. On day 4 and after an overnight (15 h) deprivation of water, the two pipettes were presented again; however, one was filled with water and the other with 4% sucrose. The water and sucrose solution consumed over a 3-h period were measured. The sucrose preference index is defined as (sucrose consumed)/(sucrose consumed + water consumed). We tested 11–16 mice/group.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Cognitive testing: To test the impact of mouse PFC <italic>Gpr56</italic> inhibition on cognition, we used an attentional set shifting test (ASST) for mice as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The extra-dimensional shift task of the ASST has been associated with medial-frontal lesion and is considered as a measure of executive functioning associated with PFC in primate and rodent animal models.</p>
                <p id="Par44"><italic>Measurement of Gpr56 expression:</italic> RNA extractions: Brain punches were made with a Rodent Brain Matrice, ASI Instruments RBM-2000C, and a Harris Uni-Core, Hole 1.0 mm biopsy tool. Regions were punched according to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Total RNA from tissue punches was obtained using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen, France) and 1 µg was reverse transcribed with random primers from Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Reverse Transcriptase MLV-RT from Fisher scientific (France), according to manufacturers’ instructions.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR): qRT-PCR was performed to assess <italic>Gpr56</italic> expression using SYBR green (ABgene, France) on an ABI PRISM 7000. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and the mean of at least three independent experiments was calculated. All results were normalized to 26S or <italic>Gapdh</italic> and calculated using the relative (2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>) quantification method. The primer sequences used in real time PCR are: 26S (FW: AGGAGAAACAACGGTCGTGCCAAAA, REV: GCGCAAGCAGGTCTGAATCGTG), and GPR56 (FW: TCCAGGCATACTCGCTGTTGCT, REV: CTTCTCACCCAGGACTTGGCTA).</p>

                <p id="Par46"><italic>Cell Culture:</italic> Human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-AS, ATCC CRL-2137) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 25 µM of peptide (P7, P19, P19Y N) or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 h then collected in TRI reagent. RNA was extracted using the DirectZol kit with DNase treatment (Zymo). Three experiments were performed in triplicate. For sequencing, we pooled the triplicates from each experiment.</p>
                <p id="Par47"><italic>RNA sequencing:</italic> All libraries were prepared using the NEB mRNA stranded protocol following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were sequenced at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montreal, Canada) using the Illumina HiSeq4000 with 100nt paired-end reads. Based on the number of reads, their length and the estimated human exome size being around 3 Mb, the average sequencing depth across all samples is 115×.</p>
                <p id="Par48">FASTX Toolkit (v0.0.14) and Trimmomatic (v0.36) were respectively used for quality and adapter trimming. TopHat (v2.1.1), using Bowtie2 (v2.2.9) was used to align the cleaned reads to the reference genome (GRCh38, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.39">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.39</ext-link>). Reads that lost their mates through the cleaning process were aligned independently from the reads that still had pairs. Quantification on each gene’s expression was estimated using HTSeq-count and a reference transcript annotation from ENSEMBL (v77). Counts for the paired and orphaned reads for each sample were added to each other. Genes counts for each sequenced library were normalized using DESeq2’s median ratio normalization method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par49">To facilitate downstream analyses, we chose to correct our normalized counts for the effect of potential covariates using limma’s removeBatchEffect function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We specifically regressed out the effects of a possible batch effect associated with the cell culture as well the expected heterogeneity associated with the use of the two different peptides and their respective controls.

                <p id="Par52">For the discovery cohort, data were expressed as proportions and frequency for categorical variables or means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables. Differences between groups were compared using Chi-square tests for categorical data or two-sided <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables. Repeated measures were analyzed using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Moreover, group by time interactions were evaluated using GLM for repeated measures. If necessary, potential confounding factors according to univariate analyses and/or current knowledge were also added in GLM. Correlations between continuous variables were conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient calculation and partial correlation analysis to include potential confounding factors.</p>
                <p id="Par53">For microarray expression data analysis in the discovery cohort, we first used two-class paired significant analysis of microarray (SAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> to determine differential gene expression before and after treatment in the duloxetine responders group with MultiExperiment Viewer 4 (MeV4, TM4 software suite). False discovery rate (FDR) threshold was set at 1% and <italic>q</italic>-values were computed. To identify specific probes which were differentially expressed between the two time points in the duloxetine responders group, we also performed two-class paired <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons between both times in the duloxetine non-responders group, the placebo responders group, and the placebo non-responders group. To confirm specificity of gene expression variation across time in the duloxetine responders group, we built a GLM for repeated measures including all available samples to identify the effect of time, group (placebo or duloxetine) and response, as well as the interaction between them. To control for potential confounding factors, we also included age, gender and BMI.</p>
                <p id="Par54">For the replication cohorts (Montréal cohort and Marseille cohort), we performed a two-paired <italic>t</italic>-test to identify gene expression variation across time in responders, non-responders and healthy controls. To confirm specificity in the responders, we built a GLM for repeated measures as described above. For the Marseille cohort, we also conducted a Linear Mixed Model to compare <italic>GPR56</italic> mRNA between groups across the four visits.</p>
