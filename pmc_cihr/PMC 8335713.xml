                <p id="Par1">Early exposure to maternal depression is a key risk factor for child mental illness (MI), but there are limited programs that interrupt intergenerational transmission. The BRIDGE “Building Regulation in Dual Generations” Program treats maternal MI using Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills with a paired curriculum that promotes non-reactive and emotionally validating parenting designed to improve child mental health and ultimately prevent MI. The pilot feasibility trial (n = 28 dyads) included mothers and their preschool-aged children. The 20-week program was completed in a group-based format using mixed methods questionnaires and interviews. Results indicate high feasibility and acceptability (86% retention). Consistent improvements were seen across program targets and outcomes including maternal depression (<italic>d</italic> = 1.02) and child mental health (<italic>d</italic> = 1.08), with clinically significant symptom reductions for 85% of clients. Mothers with higher adversity exhibited greater reductions in parenting stress. Qualitative results highlighted efficacy in promoting positive parent–child relationships, rewarding parenting experiences, competence, and child development. Evidence suggests high feasibility and accessibility for BRIDGE in addressing intergenerational mental health needs. There was strong satisfaction with the program material and efficacy across key outcomes. BRIDGE holds promise for offering a transdiagnostic approach to preventing child MI in families of at-risk preschool aged children.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Childhood mental illness [MI] is a significant public health concern, diagnosed in 10–15% of children worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Children with MI, including disruptive behaviour, attention deficit hyperactivity, anxiety and mood disorders, experience low quality of life similar to children with chronic physical health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early exposure to maternal MI is a risk factor for the emergence of children’s own MI, given the primary role of caregivers to young children’s well-being as well as heritability components shared by mothers and their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Notably, the intergenerational transmission of MI risk is understood to be largely transdiagnostic, such that early life exposure to one type of maternal MI (e.g., depression) confers broad risk across child psychopathology symptoms, as opposed to specific risk for a given child MI disorder or category (e.g., internalizing or externalizing) of problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Effective interventions are needed to treat maternal MI and promote mental health in at-risk children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par3">Despite the identification of unmet needs for mothers with MI and their children, there are limited programs that effectively support both maternal and child mental health to ultimately prevent intergenerational transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A lack of programming that integrates maternal mental health and parenting support poses significant obstacles for mothers given the logistics of attending two separate programs and the challenges of learning two different sets of therapeutic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Programs that only target adult MI reduce maternal mental health symptoms but have limited effects on child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These approaches rarely transfer skills to parenting contexts or promote accessibility for parents through childcare, transportation or meals, which are well-documented barriers for mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Parenting programs designed to prevent child MI in families with maternal MI have had, on average, small effects, but there is emerging evidence that simultaneously addressing both maternal MI and child needs improves program efficacy by up to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Upon review of parenting programs designed to prevent child MI and promote healthy development, maternal MI, in particular depression, has been linked to lower program engagement and more limited program efficacy. Mothers who also struggle with interpersonal relationships (e.g., attachment anxiety) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] are particularly vulnerable to these program outcomes. We and others have previously advocated for the value of addressing both maternal mental health and parenting needs to maximize long-term impacts of interventions on child mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Adaptations of existing parenting programs (e.g., Triple-P, Family Check-Up) have largely included minor adaptations designed to target maternal depression, while some mental health programs have likewise included minor adaptations relevant to the parenting context [reviewed in: 14; 9]. However, minimal work to date has systematically paired both maternal MI and parenting skills therapy into a comprehensive and integrative intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Here, we present mixed-methods data from a pilot feasibility trial (Clinical Trial Registration #: NCT04347707) of a novel program: <italic>Building Regulation in Dual Generations</italic>, BRIDGE, designed to build intergenerational emotion regulation, by pairing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills therapy (DBT), with a theoretically aligned parenting skill program. DBT has emerged as promising transdiagnostic treatment for MIs that include emotion regulation difficulties (e.g., depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and eating disorders), which have been identified as underlying mechanisms of psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Many aspects of developmentally supportive parenting also require mothers to have effective emotion regulation skills to both limit over-reactive responses and teach children about their own emotions, which makes the integration of DBT with parent training a promising approach for addressing intergenerational needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>BRIDGE Program Development</title>
                <p id="Par5">BRIDGE parenting skills are designed to promote responsive parenting that scaffolds children’s ability to understand emotions, regulate their own physiological arousal using co-regulation techniques, and reduce aggressive or defiant behaviour. Many DBT skills were also taught using family context examples (e.g., <italic>Checking the Facts</italic> when a babysitter cancels). The parenting skills are drawn from behaviour management, emotion socialization, and mindfulness parenting strategies. Behaviour management training is a well-established treatment approach for reducing externalizing behaviours through clear instructions, positive reinforcement and purposeful ignoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. BRIDGE provides mothers with various behaviour management skills aimed to help them think ahead and plan for difficult situations. These include using clear directions or ‘When-Then’ statements, sticker charts and motivators, and pre-teaching desired behaviours in reinforcing ways, such as using goofy superhero skills (e.g., <italic>super sidekick</italic> = staying close together in grocery store; <italic>stealth mode</italic> = extra quiet at the library).</p>
                <p id="Par6">Emotion-focused parenting approaches help parents validate children’s big emotional reactions, increase emotional communication, and provide support to move through emotions without escalating the situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Three key processes through which parents teach emotions to their children include: parental reactions to child emotions, talking about emotions, and emotional expressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In BRIDGE, mothers are guided to observe emotion-linked behaviours and validate their children’s emotional experiences, while managing their own emotional reactions. Extant research has demonstrated the effectiveness of emotion socialization strategies in both increasing children’s emotional knowledge and reducing challenging child emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par7">Mindful parenting techniques promote non-reactivity and fully participating in play-based interactions with children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Mindfulness-oriented parenting programs can be helpful in reducing stress, increasing parental emotion awareness, and reducing behaviour problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. BRIDGE includes techniques such as paying attention (e.g., catching good behaviour and reinforcing it), engaging fully, and experiencing the positive emotions of parent–child play.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Taken together, BRIDGE aims to treat maternal MI, improve child mental health and ultimately prevent child MI by empowering mothers to (1) address their own mental illness, which can contribute to child emotional distress (e.g., reduce maternal modelling of negative coping strategies and interpersonal conflict) and (2) parent in ways that support children’s emotion regulation development (e.g., increase positive parent–child interactions, family routines and child emotional knowledge).

                <title>The Present Study</title>
                <p id="Par9">Here, we aimed to examine initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the BRIDGE program in an open pilot trial with depressed mothers of preschool-aged children (<italic>N</italic> = 28) using a multi-stage mixed-methods framework design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] Quantitative pre/post questionnaire data was collected as the priority method to assess outcome change, followed by qualitative interviews to explore the participant views in greater depth. High feasibility and acceptability metrics were expected, given team efforts to engage in client feedback during program design to identify topics of interest (e.g., managing tantrums, building a positive relationship) and encourage accessibility (e.g., community locations, childcare, meals). Mothers, as opposed to ‘parents,’ were selected for inclusion based on focus group preference for speaking with other mothers about gender-linked MI stigma stressors in parenting roles as well as the elevated rates of MI is mothers, as opposed to fathers, of young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Recruitment was based on depression, and co-occurring conditions, because (1) our community partner agencies communicated preference for this clarity in recruitment materials and (2) our clinical research team decided that there would be a benefit to having diagnostic similarity given the limited power in a pilot trial. As described in the methods section, this was a diagnostically complex sample in which many mothers experienced co-occurring mental health problems across anxiety, substance use, and trauma-related diagnoses.</p>
                <p id="Par10">It was hypothesized that participants would experience significant improvements in program targets (DBT skills use, readiness to change, ability to cope with children’s negative emotions, social support) and outcomes (parenting stress, emotion dysregulation, maternal depression, child symptoms of mental illness). Qualitative interviews using thematic analysis were conducted to understand the extent to which participants perceived benefits in specific program areas. We also explored associations between outcome improvement across domains and the effects of baseline maternal stress exposure on outcome change.</p>

                <p id="Par11">Mothers were recruited from sources such as community posters, online (e.g., Kijiji), and referrals from community agencies. Participants first participated in a phone screen to confirm that they were experiencing significant symptoms of depression (i.e., scoring higher than 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9) and parenting a 2.5 to 5-year-old child. Next, they were invited to participate in an intake interview with an MA or PhD clinical psychology graduate student where they were assessed for Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and co-occurring diagnoses, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Exclusion criteria included: child not in maternal custody, child or mother has known autism diagnosis, mother has psychosis or active suicidal plan.</p>

Education ranged from some high school to a Doctorate degree (median = College or Bachelor’s degree). Over half of the mothers were unemployed or on leave (57.1%) with others working full-time (21.4%) or part-time (21.4%). The median household income was $20,000–$30,000 (range &lt; $10,000 to $80,000 +). Mothers were predominantly married or common law (50<italic>%</italic>), with the remaining 50% single (never married, 39%; divorced or separated, 11%)<italic>.</italic> In addition to MDE, mothers met criteria for co-occurring diagnoses including Post-Traumatic Stress (<italic>n</italic> = 7), Alcohol and Substance Misuse (<italic>n</italic> = 5), Mood (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and Generalized Anxiety (<italic>n</italic> = 17) Disorders. Racial/ethnic composition was not collected due to a local history of inappropriate reporting of Indigenous identity in research and corresponding need to conduct a more extensive consultation with specialized ethics boards than was considered appropriate for this pilot research.</p>

                <p id="Par13">The BRIDGE program content was developed by the principal investigator, with support from a team of graduate and undergraduate student research assistants in psychology who co-drafted all materials. Four expert clinicians in DBT and/or parent training interventions (including the two senior authors) also reviewed materials and provided input on the content.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Weekly 2-h groups were structured with 60 min of DBT skills material (i.e., mindfulness, homework review, didactics), followed by a 10 min break and 50 min of parenting material. Some DBT skills were combined, based on clinical research team expertise in working with mothers with depression (See Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> modules, by week). BRIDGE was exclusively delivered to mothers. As part of a program incentive, some mothers brought their children who participated in unstructured childcare, elsewhere within the community agency while they attended the program. Additional incentives to participation included the provision of meals for attendees and their children in care as well as bus tickets for parents who did not drive to the program. Parenting content included role-plays and small group discussions to share skills use ideas and scaffold social support. Participants received binders of parenting material at the beginning of the program, which included the DBT skills manual and parenting materials (one handout and one worksheet) designed for each week. Parents also received a binder of short interactive activities that built on weekly concepts (e.g., mindful breathing with stuffed animals, emotion naming in books, routines to for tough times of day) to provide fun at-home practice on core parenting techniques.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Table of modules by week</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Module</th><th align="left">DBT skill</th><th align="left">Parenting skill</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Wise mind: States of mind</td><td align="left">Goals &amp; activity toolbox</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">“What” skills &amp; “How” skills</td><td align="left">Motivators &amp; “When-then”</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">Understanding &amp; labeling emotions</td><td align="left">Family emotions</td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Check the facts</td><td align="left">Chain analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">Opposite action</td><td align="left">Doing the unexpected</td></tr><tr><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">Problem solving &amp; mindfulness of current thoughts</td><td align="left">Helping with BIG emotions</td></tr><tr><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">A-accumulate positive emotions</td><td align="left">Making memories</td></tr><tr><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">B-build mastery &amp; C-Cope Ahead, PLEASE</td><td align="left">Pre-teaching</td></tr><tr><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">Review of mindfulness skills</td><td align="left">Successful routines</td></tr><tr><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">STOP</td><td align="left">STOP when parenting</td></tr><tr><td align="left">11</td><td align="left">Pros &amp; Cons, TIP skills</td><td align="left">Identifying a crisis &amp; TIP child needs</td></tr><tr><td align="left">12</td><td align="left">Distract, Self-soothe, improve the moment</td><td align="left">Parenting survival kit</td></tr><tr><td align="left">13</td><td align="left">Radical acceptance</td><td align="left">Loving your whole child</td></tr><tr><td align="left">14</td><td align="left">Turning the mind, willingness, half-smiling &amp; mindfulness of current thoughts</td><td align="left">What works &amp; coping thoughts</td></tr><tr><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">Review of mindfulness skills</td><td align="left">Family meetings &amp; shared goals</td></tr><tr><td align="left">16</td><td align="left">Clarifying priorities</td><td align="left">Expectations &amp; consequences</td></tr><tr><td align="left">17</td><td align="left">Objectives effectiveness: DEAR MAN</td><td align="left">Effective time outs</td></tr><tr><td align="left">18*</td><td align="left">Relationship effectiveness: GIVE</td><td align="left">Resets</td></tr><tr><td align="left">19*</td><td align="left">Self-Respect effectiveness: FAST</td><td align="left">FAST family skills</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20*</td><td align="left">Evaluating Options</td><td align="left">Trouble Shooting</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Modules 18 – 20 were delivered via pre-recorded 90-min Zoom didactic sessions along with 30-min individual follow-ups with facilitators due to Covid-19 in-person cancellations</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

Clients who missed sessions were invited to come early to the next session to catch up on relevant material. Consistent with DBT therapeutic agreement, a participant was considered to have dropped out if they missed four sessions in a row and declined make-up sessions. Multiple commitment and re-engagement strategies were made to promote retention, consistent with DBT therapeutic principles, including phone calls, texts, emails, and occasional individual sessions (no more than four over the course of the program), if needed, to catch up on materials or manage a particular challenge that could not be addressed in group, such as substance use or the emergence of suicidal behaviour.</p>

                <title>Program Efficacy</title>
                <p id="Par39">Paired-sample t-tests indicated significant pre to post intervention change in maternal mental health (e.g., depression and dysregulated emotions), parenting stress and child mental health outcome domains. More general therapeutic pre to post targets were also identified in the domains of readiness to change and social support. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> includes descriptive statistics across time points, t-test results and effect sizes, by measure. Effect-sizes were largest for changes in maternal depression (<italic>t</italic> (25<italic>)</italic> = 5.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.001, d</italic> = 1.02) and child mental health problems (<italic>t</italic> (25) =  − 5.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.001, d</italic> = 1.08). This included clinically significant symptom reductions defined as a 5 point or greater symptom reduction OR moving between established clinical severity benchmarks [e.g., from moderate to mild depression] for 85% of clients. Smaller changes were apparent in coping with children’s negative emotions. See Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for pre, post, and change scores, with statistics across domains.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Finally, we explored the extent to which domains of outcome change were associated with each other and program targets using bi-variate correlations (All statistics, Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We also examined the extent to which apriori program moderators of early life stress (maternal ACEs) and current stressors (RSE) were associated with individual differences in outcome change. Change in depression was highly correlated with parenting stress and change in emotion dysregulation (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.60, <italic>s</italic> &lt; 0.001). Lower parenting stress from pre to post was also positively correlated to dysregulated emotions change (<italic>r</italic> =  − 0.47<italic>, p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and child mental health problems (<italic>r</italic> = 0.41 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). AAQ-II, DBT Skills, and CCNES were associated with DERS, BDI, and PSI.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par51">We examined feasibility of the BRIDGE novel parenting program, matched with DBT Skills in a group format, as a promising treatment for maternal depression and promotion of child mental health. Results support high feasibility in recruitment and retention metrics with participants highlighting accessibility considerations (e.g., childcare, meals) and the group-based context as important for addressing their specific needs in qualitative analyses. There is also evidence across quantitative and qualitative methods for client satisfaction with the program material and increases in both DBT skills and parenting skills from pre to post program. Furthermore, efficacy results on key program outcomes suggest significant clinically significant reductions in maternal MI and child MI symptoms. Results provide preliminary support for the Theory of Change, in which theoretically linked targets (i.e., reductions in parenting stress) were associated with outcome change (i.e., child mental health improvement), with detail provided in outcome sections, below. All results should be considered in light of limitations of the feasibility trial design, including a lack of comparison group and mothers as the single responder, due to COVID-19 restrictions on planned mother–child observations.</p>

                <p id="Par52">Regarding recruitment, our community-based advertisements and outreach resulted in reaching our recruitment goal within 6 weeks. Feasibility was demonstrated by a high retention (86%), which is comparable to retention rates in other group-based interventions for individuals with depression. Prior research has demonstrated rates of 71% retention for DBT Skills groups for depression and an average retention rate of 85% in a meta-analysis of group-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Emerging themes from the qualitative analyses, such as <italic>Reason for Joining, Logistical Support,</italic> and <italic>Motivation</italic> offer reinforcing evidence for program feasibility and acceptability.

                <title>Target and Outcome Change</title>
                <p id="Par53">Regarding program targets (i.e., direct skills taught in group), clients demonstrated increases in DBT skills use (<italic>d</italic> = 0.87), readiness to change (<italic>d</italic> = 0.75), and increased social support (<italic>d</italic> = 0.55), as well as reductions in harsh and dismissive approaches to coping with children’s negative emotions. Increases in supportive reactions to children’s negative emotions only reached marginal significance, which may be due to the relatively high supportive parenting strategies used at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This is consistent with meta-analytic data that suggests there is a stronger association between depression and negative parenting behaviours, compared to depression and lack of positive parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Qualitative analyses emphasized the relevance of these changes in organizing themes of <italic>DBT skill</italic> and <italic>Parenting skill</italic> use in addition to the overall general positive feedback of the program. Many mothers discussed the stress reductions from better prevention and management of tantrums, a specific focus of the program.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Amongst the primary program outcome domains, we saw a meaningful difference in maternal depression (as measured by the BDI-II) with a mean difference of 12.5 points between the pre to post intervention scores, representing a large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 1.02). This is comparable to effect sizes demonstrated from prior meta-analytic reviews, which report post-treatment effects from<italic> d</italic> = 0.40 – 1.61 ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Of note, 85% of clients had a clinically significant reduction in symptomology, defined as at least a 5-point decline or decreasing categorical levels of severity on the BDI-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Changes in maternal emotion regulation skills were also observed, with moderate effect size. This is not surprising given the low (non-clinical) levels of DERS scores at baseline. DBT skill use was correlated with changes in both depression and emotion dysregulation, providing evidence supporting the application of DBT skill interventions for depression in this demographic, and consistent with theory about the transdiagnostic relevance of emotion regulation skills and our recent meta-analyses highlighting DBT as effective for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Participants were able to voice these changes in maternal mental health in the qualitative interviews, noting an increased ability to manage difficult emotions and a decrease in depressive symptoms.</p>
                <p id="Par55">There was also a large effect on reductions in child mental health problems as demonstrated by the changes on the CBCL Total Problem Score (<italic>d</italic> = 1.08). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on group-based parenting programs for childhood behaviour problems, found medium to large effect sizes for externalizing behaviour outcomes and small to moderate effect sizes on internalizing behaviour outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. These findings suggest promising potential of the current program for improving child MI outcomes. Notably, exploratory analyses showed that changes in child MI symptoms were significantly associated with changes in maternal BDI and parenting stress, but only marginally associated with parent approaches to coping with children’s negative emotions. Findings related to children were supported by the current study’s qualitative interviews where parents disclosed decreases in parental stress and increased bidirectional communication with their children and understanding of emotions. Future research should both (1) obtain alternate responder or observational assessments of children’s behavioral and emotional wellness and (2) examine the relevant contributions of improvements in child MI symptoms from reductions in maternal MI symptoms and improvements in parenting. Developing a parenting measure designed to examine BRIDGE-specific skills would be of particular help in this endeavor. Both quantitative and qualitative results highlighted the increased social support from BRIDGE and the value of being part of group with other mothers.</p>
                <p id="Par56">Although underpowered to examine moderation, we did explore individual differences in participant histories of ACEs and RCEs based on our theory of change. Both variables predicted greater reductions in parenting stress. This is promising preliminary data given the significant risk conferred by maternal ACEs and mental illness for children’s emerging mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This finding is consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of DBT regarding the dialectic of improving one’s own mental health while also acknowledging inherent unfairness and injustice regarding the interpersonal harms that may contribute to one’s mental health vulnerability. However, due to the small sample size, it was not feasible to examine more statistically rigorous multivariate predictors of changes in outcome variables and this will be an aim of future research in larger samples.</p>
                <p id="Par57">Limitations include self-report nature of the data; although study plans included an in-lab observational assessment, this was not feasible due to COVID19 in May 2020. Results should also be considered preliminary evidence of program efficacy given the small size, lack of a control group, and single time point of follow-up in this feasibility pilot study.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Multiple strengths are highlighted including evidence for BRIDGE’s efficacy for targeting both maternal and child MI symptoms in addition to doing so in a setting with logistical supports (e.g., providing meals and childcare). Both factors have been highlighted as limitations of prior efforts to improve maternal mental health and child development outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The program may be more effective in reducing parenting stress for mothers with chronic stress exposure, both regarding ACEs and past year adverse events (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Using mixed-methods data provided both quantitative support for BRIDGE, along with qualitative data to describe a rich array of program benefits, from the client’s voice.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Chronic stress exposure and reduction in parenting stress</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10578_2021_1219_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par59">Next steps will involve updating the BRIDGE program based on participant feedback and evaluating it in a randomized control design with longer-term follow-up. A more structured evaluation in a larger sample will aid in assessing the relative importance of specific targets on outcome change, which will strengthen knowledge the specific program strategies to emphasize in future iterations. We also plan to <italic>capture more precise information on therapeutic dosage and examine associated links to program efficacy.</italic> Ongoing research also aims to extend the BRIDGE program to primary caregivers of various parent identities (e.g., fathers, grandparents, mothers) in different agency contexts. Finally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a telehealth version of the program to be delivered through an online platform in a similar group-based format. Telehealth therapy for treating depression has growing evidence to support its efficacy, but there has been limited such work in maternal mental health research to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p id="Par60">Effective interventions that treat symptoms of maternal MI and promote healthy parenting styles are imperative to disrupt the intergenerational transmission of poor mental health. This pilot feasibility study examined the effects of the BRIDGE program, which pairs DBT skills for maternal MI with a parenting curriculum that promotes non-reactive and emotionally validating parenting behaviours. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the program in sample of mothers with depression and their preschool aged children using a mixed-methods approach. Results indicated high feasibility and acceptability (86% retention) in addition to qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting client satisfaction with the program. Among primary program outcomes, clients had clinically significant reductions in symptoms of depression and improvements in emotion regulation skills. Findings also demonstrated consistent improvements across program targets, such as DBT skill use, readiness to change, and increased social support along with reductions in harsh and dismissive parenting behaviours. There was also a large reduction in child MI symptoms, which were associated with changes in maternal depression and stress. Additionally, ACEs and recent stressful experiences predicted greater reductions in parenting stress suggesting that the program may be more effective for mothers with chronic stress exposure. These findings suggest the promising potential of the BRIDGE program for promoting intergenerational mental health, which also treated as preliminary evidence, due to the small sample size, lack of control group, self-report nature of the data, and single time point of follow-up assessment. Taken together, the BRIDGE program holds substantial promise for offering a single-program approach to preventing child MI and treating maternal MI in families of preschool aged children at risk for intergenerational transmission. Delivering BRIDGE in an accessible cost-effective group format has strong potential for scalability in transdiagnostic relevance in improving family well-being and support child health and development.</p>
