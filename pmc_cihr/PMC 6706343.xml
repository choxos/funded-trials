                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia that is associated with twice the risk of falls. It is unknown whether white matter integrity (WMI) is associated with increased risk of falls in MCI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if early changes in WMI were associated with gait impairment and falls.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Forty-three participants with MCI from the Gait and Brain Study underwent standardized assessment of cognition, gait performance under single and dual-task conditions (walking while talking), and WMI using 3 Tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Macro-structural imaging characteristics (white and grey matter morphology) as well as microstructural WMI parameters were examined for associations with falls and gait performance. Significantly associated WM tracts were then used to test the interplay between WMI and history of falls, after adjusting for other important covariates.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Multiple WM tracts (corpus callosum, forceps minor, and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were significantly associated with history of falls and lower dual-task gait performance. A multivariable regression model showed that fall history was associated with the radial diffusivity in the forceps minor, even after adjusting for education, sex, BMI, MMSE scores, comorbidities, gait velocity and WMH volume as covariates.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Multiple WM tracts that are known to be involved in executive and visuospatial functions were preferentially affected in MCI individuals with history of falls. Our preliminary findings support the notion that WMI in key brain regions may increase risk of falls in older adults with MCI.</p>

              <p id="p0020">Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia,(<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie, 2004</xref>) are not only at higher risk of progression to dementia but also at higher risk of falls.(<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Tinetti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Tinetti et al., 1988</xref>) Individuals with MCI have twice the fall risk when compared with age matched cognitively normal older adults.(<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Tinetti et al., 1988</xref>) Falls in this population have been associated with serious adverse events including injuries, disability, nursing home placement and even mortality(<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Tinetti et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, a better understanding of the neuro-mechanism contribution to the high risk of falls seen in MCI will eventually help to detect modifiable risk factors.</p>
              <p id="p0025">The interplay between falls, cognition, and gait is complex (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., n.d.</xref>) and not coincidentally related, but rather it may reflect damage in shared brain regions and networks that are affected by aging, neurodegeneration, and microvascular mechanisms.(<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., n.d.</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso and Hachinski, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2012a</xref>) Indeed, brain macro-structural changes, including grey matter volume loss(<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2007</xref>) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden, are common in individuals with MCI.(<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Annweiler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Annweiler et al., 2013</xref>) WMH burden has been shown to be associated with poor balance, slowing gait speed(<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 2003</xref>), and falls history in community-dwelling older adults.(<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2012</xref>) However, these associations have not been thoroughly explored in individuals with MCI Moreover, it remains unclear whether white matter integrity (WMI) in specific brain regions is related to a greater risk of falls or slow gait seen in older adults with MCI.</p>
              <p id="p0030">Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that can predict the formation of WMH <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2013</xref> and has been increasingly used to investigate WMI with cognitive changes and aging. DTI provides microstructural information about WM health by measuring several diffusion parameters of water(<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>) in nerve fibers such as fractional anisotropy (FA) which is sensitive to fiber structural integrity, myelination degree, fiber diameter, density, and tract coherence.(<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Le Bihan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Mori and Zhang, 2006</xref>) Mean diffusivity (MD) can also be derived from DTI, a measure of isotropic average diffusion (in all directions of the fiber), which indicates density.(<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Beaulieu, 2002</xref>) In addition, diffusion in the primary direction, axial diffusivity (AD) and average diffusion in the perpendicular direction, radial diffusivity (RD) can also be used for interpretation of myelin and axon pathologies. Generally, reduced FA implies reduced structural integrity by damage to axons, myelin or loss of coherence, increased MD implies loss of axons or myelination, low AD indicates damage to axons, and high RD denotes myelin damage.(<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2006</xref>)</p>
              <p id="p0035">An analytic processing tool to investigate DTI parameters called tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) involves aligning data into a template, keeping only white matter tract information to be collected and saved onto DTI parametric maps. The TBSS approach improves sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of multi-subject DTI analysis by using carefully tuned nonlinear registration of patient data followed by the projection of the WM DTI parameters onto an alignment-invariant “skeleton” tract.(<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) WM tracts provide the infrastructure for inter- and intra-brain network communications,(<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Fields, 2008</xref>) some of which may be involved synergistically in natural gait and cognitive function.(<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Scherder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Snijders et al., 2007</xref>) Therefore, specific WM fiber tract-based regions of interest (ROI) may be used to examine the skeletonized data of specific regions.</p>
              <p id="p0040">The goal of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional association between WM microstructure changes, history of falls, and gait characteristics in an MCI population. We hypothesize that examination of microstructural white matter abnormalities in older adults with MCI may reveal early changes in brain regions associated with falls and slow gait.</p>

                <p id="p0045">This analysis includes baseline data from 43 participants with MCI who completed a 3 T MRI exam including DTI in the Gait and Brain Study, a prospective cohort study designed to determine whether quantitative gait impairments can predict cognitive and mobility decline, and progression to dementia and falls among community-dwelling older adults. Study design and logistics have been described in detail elsewhere.(<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2014</xref>) and more details can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="ir0005">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT: 03020381).</p>
                <p id="p0050">MCI was diagnosed as follows: i) presence of subjective memory complaints from the patient and family, ii) objective memory impairment in cognitive tests (below 1.5 standard deviation under the expected performance in cognitive tests for age and education), iii) preserved activities of daily living(<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lawton and Brody, 1969</xref>), and iv) absence of clinical dementia (established using DSM-IV-TR criteria). Participants were required to be able to walk independently for 10 m without any aid, have no Parkinsonism or other residual motor deficits, have no major depression, to be free from the use of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, and have no musculoskeletal or joint disorder affecting gait performance detected by clinical and physical exam by a skilled clinician.</p>
                <p id="p0055">Participants underwent a comprehensive assessment that included medical questionnaires, cognitive tests, and quantitative gait assessments. Sociodemographic characteristics, chronic medications, history of falls, and comorbidities were collected using standardized questionnaires in face-to-face interviews. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Mori and Zhang, 2006</xref>) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Beaulieu, 2002</xref>).</p>
                <p id="p0060">In order to investigate whether WM changes were associated with a higher number of falls, participants were stratified to two groups based on history of falls; those with ≥1 fall in the past 12 months were categorized as “fallers” while those with no falls were categorized as “non-fallers”.</p>

Start and end points were marked on the floor 1 m from either walkway end to avoid recording acceleration and deceleration phases. Each participant performed one practice trial walking on the mat. The single-task trial consisted of walking the length of the mat at the participant's usual pace. For the dual-task trials, participants walked at their usual pace with no instruction to prioritize the gait or cognitive task; while doing the following cognitive tasks aloud – one at a time, (i) counting backwards from one hundred by ones (ii) subtracting serial sevens from one hundred, and (iii) naming animals out loud. The rationale for the selection of these dual-task conditions has been described elsewhere.(<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., n.d.</xref>) Allowing both gait and cognitive tasks to vary provides a better representation of daily living activities. To balance and minimize the effects of learning and fatigue, the order of the simple and dual-tasks was randomized. Reliability for this gait assessment protocol has been previously established in MCI populations.(<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2009b</xref>) Gait speed was expressed in meters per second (m/s).</p>
                <p id="p0070">A fall was defined as an event in which in a person comes to a rest unintentionally on a lower level (e.g. ground). The number of falls was reported as the total number of fall incidents within and no later than a year prior to the imaging schedule. This methodology to record falls has been previously validated (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

                <p id="p0080">All DTI processing was performed using FSL 5.0.8 (FMRIB Software Library, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl" id="ir0010">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>) including brain extraction (BET, part of FSL) from DTI (b = 0) and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images, correcting for susceptibility, eddy currents, subject head movement (via affine registration; FDT, part of FSL) and gradient directions (applied during diffusion weighted volumes acquisition) as well as fitting diffusion tensor models at each voxel. Then, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), a part of FSL was run as previously described (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). TBSS involves aligning data into 1 mm × 1 mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 Space and registering each patient's brain into the FMRIB58 template using the FMRIB's Nonlinear Image Registration Tool (FNIRT, part of FSL). Then a mean image of FA values (including pixels with values above 0.2 to eliminate voxels in the grey matter or cerebrospinal fluid from the analysis) was created and thinned to create a mean FA “skeleton” which represents the centers of all tracts within the subject group. Finally, each subject's aligned data was projected onto this skeleton; MD, AD and RD were processed in the same way. In addition, WM fiber tracts' DTI parameters averages were calculated for each tract ROI per patient to allow for further examination if necessary. For masking of WM fiber tract ROIs, we used the Johns-Hopkins University (JHU) DTI-based white-matter probability maps in FSL toolbox(<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Douaud et al., 2007</xref>) with a threshold of 10% (probability of voxels being white matter). These tracts are visualized in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (with either left or right hemispheric tracts shown only for ease of visualization purposes).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>WM fiber tract ROIs used for region specific analysis.

                <p id="p0085">Image analysis for WMH was performed for each subject with our in-house fully automated pipeline utilizing FSL tools (See Supplemental Figs. 1). In short, after correcting for bias-field, (1) each subject's T<sub>1</sub>weighted structural images were co-registered to their own T<sub>2</sub>-FLAIR images; (2) T<sub>2</sub>-FLAIR and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images were spatially normalized to the MNI standard space; (3) Both T<sub>1</sub>-weighted and T<sub>2</sub>-FLAIR images were segmented into grey matter (GM), WM and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF); (4) slice-by-slice thresholding and clustering tools were used to separate and delineate hyperintensities. It was necessary to investigate whether WMHs have a potential influence on the DTI measures of the WM tracts. A group probability map of WMHs was generated by summing the binarized WMHs image of each MCI subject in the MNI space and multiplied by the probability map of WM (giving lower weighing factors to any voxels found in regions that were not deemed WM).</p>

The resulting images were averaged and flipped along the x-axis to create a left-right symmetric, study-specific grey matter template. Second, all native grey matter images were non-linearly registered to this study-specific template and “modulated” to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation. The modulated grey matter images were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 4 mm. Finally, voxel-wise non-parametric permutation tests were used while correcting for multiple comparisons across space, as has been validated previously (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Good et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

                <p id="p0145">Negative binomial regression analyses were used to test the association between the RD in the Forceps minor and falls (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and the model remained significant after adjusting for age, number of years of education, gender, BMI and MMSE scores, as well as further adjusted for number of comorbidities, counting gait velocity and WMH volume (which were otherwise not accounted for by the TBSS analysis). The regression analysis using average DTI values from across the tract provide a level of independence from voxel-wise and cluster-specific extreme DTI values (possibly due to WMH lesions).

              <p id="p0155">Changes in tissue microstructure in WM were significantly associated with gait disturbances and falls in older adults with MCI, even after adjusting for WMH and other important covariates. Specifically, we found that several DTI parameters correlated with slow gait and previous falls in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, forceps minor and major, corticospinal tract, anterior thalamic radiation and uncinate fasciculus. DTI can be used to probe the integrity of WM tissue microstructure. In this study, the analysis of DTI parameters FA, MD, AD and RD provided specific quantitative measures that were associated with gait performance and history of falls.</p>
              <p id="p0160">Previous non-TBSS imaging studies focusing on MCI-related abnormalities found WM alterations in people with MCI in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes(<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Medina and Gaviria, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2006</xref>) as well as the posterior cingulum,(<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2009</xref>) splenium of corpus callosum,(<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2008</xref>) long association fascicles,(<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2009</xref>) and internal capsule.(<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2009</xref>) TBSS MCI studies found reduced WMI in the splenium of the corpus callosum, crus of fornix, (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2010</xref>) and para hippocampal WM, uncinate fasciculus, and WM tracts of the brain stem and cerebellum.(<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) Imaging studies focusing on gait related abnormalities found association between gait performance and WM hyperintensities(<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Rosano et al., 2006</xref>) and WMI in the genu of the corpus callosum and gait in the elderly (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bhadelia et al., 2009</xref>) as well as bilateral frontal and periventricular WM lesions-affected voxels corresponding to major anterior projection fibers (thalamic radiations, corticofugal motor tracts) and adjacent association fibers (corpus callosum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, short association fibers) (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a recent cross-sectional imaging study of normal adults at risk of falls found several clusters of abnormal WM regions that correlated with gait performance (medial frontal. Parietal subcortical pathways, genu and splenium of corpus callosum, posterior cingulum, prefrontal and orbitofrontal pathways, and longitudinal pathways that connect frontal-parietal-temporal lobes), with a smaller portion (medial frontal and parietal subcortical pathways) that also correlated with MMSE scores (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, one study that focused on finding the cross-sectional association between history of falls and the WMI of patients with Cirrhosis. <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Ansón et al. (2015)</xref> found significant deteriorations in local WMI within the superior longitudinal fasciculus and corticospinal tract associated with falls in agreement with our TBSS findings.</p>
              <p id="p0165">When our sample was stratified based on history of falls, fallers were found to have significantly reduced WMI in the corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, and forceps minor. Using voxel-wise non-parametric permutation test of all four DTI parameters, limited loci within WM tracts were found to be significantly correlated with some gait parameters and falls. Our primary findings indicated that WMI, as measured by AD, RD, MD or FA, was lower in MCI patients with a history of falls, within several WM tracts including but not limited to the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the forceps minor and the uncinate fasciculus. Successful regression models using the RD of the forceps minor showed that poor WMI is significantly associated with history of falls in MCI. The model remained significant after accounting for age, sex, BMI, years of education, MMSE, comorbidities, dual-task gait velocity, and WMH.</p>
              <p id="p0170">The executive network has been previously suggested to be involved with mobility function and falls (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso and Hachinski, 2014</xref>). Therefore, it was expected that lower WMI would be found in the forceps minor (a tract that connects the frontal and prefrontal lobes by passing though the genu of the corpus callosum) and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (a tract that connects the occipital, posterior temporal, and the orbito-frontal areas associated with visuospatial function) WM regions in patients with history of falls since the executive network relies on the integrity of these tracts (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Genova et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the implied disruption in fronto-occipital fasciculus as determined by the reduced WMI (low FA and AD) might indicate disruption in the connectivity between different functional networks (e.g. executive function – in the prefrontal cortex and visual and proprioception in the occipital/parietal lobes). Further implicating the executive network in falls stems from the observation that significant WMI differences between fallers and non-fallers appear to be lateralized predominantly to the left hemisphere, consistent with previous evidence suggesting left-lateralized WM damage is responsible for executive function impairment (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Barbey et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, executive dysfunction has been associated with reduced dual-task gait velocity in healthy older adults (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Coppin et al., 2006</xref>) and MCI (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2009b</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0175">Clinically, our results highlight the relationship between gait, cognitive dysfunction, and fall risk in older adults with MCI as symptomatic flags to the presence of underlying pathology affecting WM structural connectivity between common brain regions. This may unravel the role of modifiable factors including vascular damage, in addition to the neurodegenerative process (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Holtzer et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, it was previously shown that older adults with MCI that had high prevalence of vascular risk factors were more likely to present slowing gait, greater dual-task cost on gait, and executive dysfunction (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Hajjar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2012b</xref>). Our study provides further evidence that specific tracts are associated with gait characteristics and falls. These results are consistent with recent work evaluating normal older adults that also found a strong association between the forceps minor and gait performance (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Poole et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0180">Some limitations of our study should be considered. The cross-sectional design precludes a direct causal interpretation of the associations between differences in WMI and history of falls. Stratification of patients to the two groups assumed singular fall events were not incidental but related to underlying pathology, which may not be correct for all patients. Furthermore, history of falls was used in lieu of- and as a surrogate for- each patient's fall risk. An additional limitation was that WMH volume was not accounted for in the TBSS analysis, which could introduce variability due to the significantly different DTI parameters values within these lesions. However, the patient cohort studied presented with generally small WMHs, and WMH volume was used as a confounding variable in the regression to minimize potential bias. Several other confounding variables that may modify the association between WMI, falls and gait performance were controlled for; however, there may be other un-accounted confounders in this study. For example, it may be important in future studies to control for single-task gait characteristics or at least assess dual-task cost, when testing dual-task performances and associations with WMI, since it is possible baseline single-task performance introduce a bias into the dual-task analysis when not controlled for. A weakness of this study is the exploratory nature of the associations and consequently the relatively large number of statistical tests performed which increased the risk of a Type 1 error (false positives). No corrections were made for multiple comparisons to reduce the likelihood of missing important differences and reduce likelihood of Type 2 errors (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Perneger, 1998</xref>). Based on the results of the current study, prospective studies can be designed to focus on specific WM tracts, which would reduce these concerns. Finally, our study sample consisted exclusively of MCI older adults and thus results may not generalize well beyond this population. Future studies should explore if WMI can prospectively predict falls in older adults with MCI. Our study strengths include the comprehensive clinical, cognitive and mobility assessment in a very well identified cohort of individuals with MCI. In addition, we applied novel and emerging imaging tools and methodologies to study WMI and its role in mobility-cognitive dysfunction. DTI parameters were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), an automated exploratory approach to investigate the whole brain while circumventing the shortcomings of ROI and volume based morphometry techniques, and is therefore considered more sensitive and less prone to errors (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). For regression analysis our measurements of region-specific DTI parameters of the Forceps minor were made using standard brain atlas-derived regions of interest (ROIs) within the skeletonized DTI parametric maps. This further supported the interpretation that the Forceps minor WM tract is critically associated with falls. And finally, the group comparisons and regression models accounted for multiple confounders including age, sex, years of education, BMI, and MMSE scores.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0185">Quantitative measures of WMI using voxel-wise TBSS technique was found to be significantly associated with history of falls and poor gait performance in MCI. There was no significant white matter or grey matter macro-structural differences between the groups in this cohort. However, the integrity of WM microstructure in the tracts that are involved in executive and visuospatial functions were found to be preferentially affected in MCI individuals with history of falls and dual-task gait disturbances.</p>
              <p id="p0190">Our findings support the notion that white matter integrity in key brain regions is affected in older adults with MCI and history of falls and are aligned with the hypothesis that early abnormalities in WM play a role in the higher prevalence of falls seen in older adults with MCI. Future studies should explore the potential predictive ability of white matter integrity, incidence of falls and the interplay with onset of dementia.</p>
              <p id="p0195">In summary, we found that older adults with MCI and a recent history of falls may have disrupted structural connectivity. This may be associated with greater decline in both cognition and mobility in this population and subsequently increases their risk of falling.</p>
