                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The nutrigenomics, overweight/obesity and weight management trial (NOW Trial) is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of community-dwelling adults recruited from the Group Lifestyle Balance™ (GLB™) Program. The GLB™ Program (formerly referred to as the Diabetes Prevention Program) is an evidence-based, intensive weight management program, which was offered to overweight/obese patients (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in a rural Ontario community.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Patients enrolled in the GLB™ Program were invited to participate in this study. GLB™ groups were randomized 1:1 to receive either the standard GLB™ program + population-based lifestyle advice for weight management, or a modified GLB™ program + personalized, genetic-based lifestyle advice for weight management. The purpose of this study is to determine if the provision of genetic-based lifestyle guidelines is superior to the provision of population-based guidelines in a pragmatic clinical setting to promote changes in: body composition, weight, body mass index, dietary and physical activity habits, as well as attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioural control. The 12-month intervention protocol consists of 23 group-based sessions and 4 one-on-one sessions. Data collection time points include baseline in addition to 3, 6, and 12-month follow up. The comprehensive study design is described in the present manuscript, using both the extended CONSORT checklist for reporting pragmatic trials and the SPIRIT checklist as guidance during manuscript development.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Overall, this study seeks to pragmatically determine if the provision of DNA-based lifestyle advice leads to improved health and lifestyle outcomes compared to the provision of standard, population-based lifestyle advice. The results of this trial can be used to inform clinical and community nutrition practice guidelines.</p>

The Group Lifestyle Balance™ (GLB™) program is one of the most successful lifestyle-based weight management programs and is currently offered in over 80 primary care settings in the United States and is now becoming increasingly prevalent in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The GLB™ program was originally intended only for individuals with prediabetes and was formerly referred to as The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). In patients with prediabetes, the DPP lifestyle intervention reduced the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes by 58%, while the biguanide antihyperglycemic agent, Metformin, reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 31% when compared to a placebo pill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the documented success of the DPP, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care encouraged program expansion through broader eligibility criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and as such some clinics are now offering this program for general weight management (regardless of receiving a prediabetes diagnosis), since overweight and obesity are considered risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Although the GLB™ program has proven to be successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a “one-size fits all” approach to weight management has been critiqued by experts, who argue that this generalized approach yields minimal weight loss outcomes that do not satisfy the wants and needs of clinicians, researchers and patients alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Genetic testing is an innovative tool, which has the potential to facilitate positive lifestyle changes and enhance patient outcomes, though this has been widely debated in the literature in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A systematic review found that actionable lifestyle recommendations (e.g., “reduce your consumption of sodium”) facilitated behaviour change greater than the provision of simple genetic-based disease-risk estimates, and that nutrition was the most promising lifestyle habit that could be motivated by lifestyle genomics testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">A few studies have assessed change in weight from the provision of genetic-based information compared to a standard intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two studies reported that genetic testing was superior to a standard intervention for changes in weight or BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and one study showed that adherence to a genetic-based diet was correlated with greater weight loss, whereas adherence to a standard diet was not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">There have been considerable scientific advancements in knowledge pertaining to nutrition and physical activity recommendations, which can be personalized based on an individual’s genetic variation. Nutrigenomics is a science that explores the interaction between nutrition, genetics, and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The science exploring how nutrition and physical activity, alongside other lifestyle components, can impact health outcomes can be referred to as <italic>lifestyle genomics</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the genes FTO, MC4R, TCF7L2, UCP1, APOA2, and PPARg2 can impact physical activity and dietary approaches to weight management and/or nutritional habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, SNPs located within the genes ACTN3, NFIA-AS2, ADRB3, NRF2 and GSTP1 have been shown to impact genetic predisposition to excel in either endurance or strength-based activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These genetic variants were used in the genetic test provided in the present study as they are currently offered through commercial genetic testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], thus optimizing the pragmatic nature of this trial.</p>
              <p id="Par19">While genetics certainly plays a role in obesity, there are multiple factors contributing to the current obesity epidemic, including diminished energy expenditure, increased energy intake, rising food costs, the built environment, socioeconomic status, and other social determinants of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Several of these factors can be modified such as energy intake and energy expenditure.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) posits that attitudes towards a behaviour, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and actual behavioural control can be used to predict intentions and behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although the TPB is one of the most widely-accepted behaviour change theories, it has yet to be incorporated into genetic testing behaviour change research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] despite a recent call to incorporate this theory into personalized healthcare behaviour change research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. By considering this theory, we can account for many contributors impacting behaviour change and therefore account for several confounding factors, which could influence study results. The present randomized controlled trial is the first study to intentionally incorporate the TPB into genetic testing behaviour change research.</p>

We aimed to recruit 88 participants (<italic>n</italic> = 44 per group) to account for the potential dropout rate of 20%. While minimal research exists outlining a clinically meaningful change in body fat percentage, a 5% change in weight (which would come from fat mass, water weight and/or muscle mass) is often reported to be clinically meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, clinical experience from the registered dietitians involved in this study helped to determine the clinically meaningful 4% difference mentioned above. This difference has also been supported in published reference standards of body fat percentage in Caucasian adults which indicate that a 4% change in body fat percentage is associated with a 1 – 2 decile change on the reference standards charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>

Research assistants collecting and analyzing food intake data were also blinded to the study group of the participants and the statistician will be blinded to the group assignments. Since our outcomes included changes in attitudes related to genetic testing for personalized lifestyle advice, as well as change in nutrition and physical activity habits, it was inappropriate to blind the participants throughout the entire duration of the study. Therefore, participants were informed of their group assignment during the first group intervention meeting, as further outlined in section 4.9, below.

General linear regression models will further be used to assess interactions between TPB components, study group, and anthropometric measures of weight and body composition. No interim analyses will be completed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par45">The overarching aim of this study is to determine if patients have improved health and lifestyle outcomes with the provision of DNA-based lifestyle information and recommendations, compared to the provision of standard, population-based lifestyle advice. Furthermore, it aims to test the aforementioned hypotheses, based on lifestyle genomics weight management advice available to consumers globally through commercial genetic testing. This highlights the pragmatic nature of this trial, and optimizes the potential for knowledge translation on a global-scale.</p>
              <p id="Par46">The NOW Trial protocol differs from previous research in that it was designed pragmatically, using a knowledge translation approach. Furthermore, the NOW Trial aims to compare a DNA-based lifestyle change program to the gold standard, population-based lifestyle change program (the GLB™ Program), while considering and accounting for major confounding factors of behaviour change. It is also the first lifestyle genomics weight management and behaviour change study to incorporate the TPB into the study design; this may help target a sub-set of the population that may benefit most from genetic testing for weight management. This trial is also unique because the genetic information was presented to participants in a group setting, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this more efficient approach to the delivery of genetic information.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Pragmatic clinical trials are distinguished by their focus on informing clinical practice rather than confirming a physiological or clinical hypothesis. Notably, pragmatic trials help to inform real-world research questions that are applicable to broad patient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Given the novel and pragmatic nature of the study, the NOW Trial provides several original contributions to the literature. Overall, the NOW Trial will provide important, innovative health knowledge relevant to researchers, academia, consumers, the genetic testing industry, clinicians and public health authorities.</p>
