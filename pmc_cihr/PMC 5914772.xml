                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalisation in infants in developed countries. The main focus of hospital care is on supportive care, such as monitoring for hypoxia and supplemental oxygen administration, as active therapies lack effectiveness. Pulse oximetry is used to monitor hypoxia in hospitalised infants and is used either intermittently or continuously. Observational studies have suggested that continuous pulse oximetry use leads to a longer length of hospital stay in stable infants. The use of continuous pulse oximetry may lead to unnecessary clinical intervention due to readings that are of little clinical significance, false-positive readings and less reliance on the clinical status. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide which pulse oximetry monitoring strategy, intermittent or continuous, is superior in infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis with respect to patient and policy-relevant outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing two strategies for pulse oximetry monitoring in infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis. Infants aged 1 month to 2 years presenting to Canadian tertiary and community hospitals will be randomised after stabilisation to receive either intermittent or continuous oxygen saturation monitoring on the inpatient unit until discharge. The primary outcome is length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes include additional measures of effectiveness, acceptability, safety and cost. We will need to enrol 210 infants in order to detect a 12-hour difference in length of stay with a type 1 error rate of 5% and a power of 90%.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Bronchiolitis is the most common acute lower respiratory tract infection that affects infants and young children less than 2 years of age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> It presents with a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by tachypnoea, chest retractions and diffuse crackles, wheeze or both. It is a leading cause of infant hospitalisation and is cumulatively expensive for the healthcare system.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Although the illness is self-limited, some infants require hospitalisation for fast and laboured breathing, hypoxia and feeding difficulties. Systematic reviews of a large body of evidence have shown minimal effectiveness for a range of active medical treatments, specifically drug therapies including steroids and inhaled bronchodilators.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref> Thus, the focus of inpatient management is on supportive care, which includes monitoring vital signs, oxygen supplementation for hypoxia, and nutritional and/or fluid supplementation.</p>
              <p>Over the past two decades, non-invasive oxygen saturation monitoring or pulse oximetry has been widely available for identifying hypoxia.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Pulse oximetry can be used intermittently, such as every 4 hours, or continuously in hospitalised infants with bronchiolitis. Although pulse oximetry was introduced into bronchiolitis hospital management without health technology assessment, it has become common clinical practice to use continuous oxygen saturation monitoring at many centres.</p>
              <p>Observational studies have suggested that the use of continuous oxygen saturation monitoring in stable hospitalised infants with bronchiolitis may actually unnecessarily prolong hospital stay.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> It has been proposed that continuous monitoring leads to ‘over monitoring’ in stable infants. This leads to greater false-positive readings, clinicians reacting to low readings that are not clinically important and less reliance on the clinical status of the infant in decision-making around management and disposition. This then results in a longer duration of oxygen supplementation and/or prolonged observation in hospital. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the emergency department demonstrated clinician over-reliance on oxygen saturation monitoring in the management of infants with bronchiolitis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Experts concluded, “the art of medicine and clinical assessment should not be trumped by over-reliance on a single-physiologic parameter.”<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>Current clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) from the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) have recommended that clinicians ‘may not choose to use continuous pulse oximetry or administer supplemental oxygen if the saturation exceeds 90%’.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Their recommendations are graded as evidence level D (expert opinion, case reports, reasoning from first principles). Subsequent to the guideline publication, the first trial comparing intermittent versus continuous pulse oximetry monitoring was reported.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> All infants were randomised on admission to hospital. Infants randomised to intermittent monitoring were switched after the infants were non-hypoxaemic. Length of stay (LOS) was measured from the time of admission (not from the time of implementation of the intervention) and did not differ based on the oxygen saturation monitoring strategy (48.9 hours for continuous monitoring vs 46.2 hours for intermittent monitoring; p=0.77). Some limitations of this trial include: only inclusion of non-hypoxaemic infants for intermittent monitoring; powered to detect only an 18-hour difference in LOS (ie, underpowered) and initiating measurement of the primary and some secondary outcomes before implementation of the monitoring intervention. An expert commentary highlighted the need for further trials.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Two broad concerns around healthcare delivery have emerged that make this trial especially relevant. One is a concern of the widespread overuse of physiological monitoring devices and alarms in hospital care, the resulting alarm fatigue of staff, and the potential to compromise patient safety.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> Second is a concern around overdiagnosis, the detection of an abnormality that does not benefit the patient, and how it may be harming children.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A recent review on overdiagnosis highlighted the detection of clinically insignificant desaturations using continuous oxygen monitoring in bronchiolitis as an example of overdiagnosis in children.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Given these broad concerns around overuse of physiological monitoring and the evidence gap around the most effective oxygen monitoring strategy for such a common condition as bronchiolitis, high-quality evidence is needed to guide best practices and healthy policy.</p>

                <p>This is a six centre, pragmatic randomised controlled superiority trial designed with two parallel groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio with enrolment occurring over bronchiolitis seasons (each season from November to May) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for trial schemata). Trial recruitment commenced November 2016. This protocol follows Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref> for schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessment).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>

                  <title>Rationale for choice of methods</title>
                  <p>Pragmatic randomised trials seek to answer the question ‘Does this intervention work under usual conditions?’ and guides trial design decisions in 10 domains.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A pragmatic design will strengthen the generalisability and relevance of the study findings to the practice setting for which it is intended. We will include patients from both tertiary and community hospital settings; medical management will be consistent with usual clinical care and we will be measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare decision-makers including cost. This study is embedded within the environment of the knowledge users who will promote uptake of the intervention and study findings; a study conducted in several settings of different types (community regional hospital as well as free-standing children’s hospital) over more than one bronchiolitis season will also enhance generalisability and knowledge transfer.</p>
                  <p>A pilot study was conducted at one site (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01646606). The pilot study demonstrated feasibility of the trial processes (ie, number of eligible subjects, recruitment rate, inclusion/exclusion procedures, the acceptability of the intervention and willingness to randomise for clinicians, adherence to interventions, rates of completion of follow-up data) and provided data for sample size determination for this multicentre trial.</p>

                    <p>The primary outcome is length of hospital stay from time of randomisation on the GPIU to discharge. Assuming a median length of hospital stay from randomisation to discharge of 36 hours (from pilot data, published trials), a type 1 error rate of 0.05 (two sided), power (1-β) of 90%, 105 subjects per group is needed to detect a clinically significant difference of 12 hours. There will be no adjustment due to loss to follow-up as this outcome is assessed in hospital. We believe that a 12-hour difference between treatment groups is a clinically meaningful difference, based on consensus with our research team, hospital administrators and clinical experts.</p>
                    <p>Based on administrative data, there are approximately 415 bronchiolitis admissions per year in total at the six sites. Approximately, 40% will not meet the eligibility criteria and of these 30% will not be recruited due to off-season presentation (May to November) or missed, leaving 174 admissions. Assuming a conservative recruitment rate of 70% (based on pilot study), we expect approximately 120 recruited patients per season. Thus, two 6 month seasons, each from mid-November to mid-May, will be needed to recruit the 210 subjects. This seasonal definition of November to May will capture the peak months of respiratory viral infections responsible for bronchiolitis.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Bronchiolitis is one of the most common reasons for hospitalisation in infants in the developed world and accounts for significant healthcare costs. The use of pulse oximetry has become common practice in hospitalised infants, however, there is no RCT evidence on how to best use this technology in this practice context. The overall goal of our pragmatic RCT is to determine whether intermittent versus continuous pulse oximetry results in a shorter length of hospital stay in infants with a stable clinical status hospitalised with bronchiolitis. Secondary outcomes include nursing satisfaction with monitoring, parental anxiety and days missed from work, and outcomes related to safety (ICU consultation and admission, revisits after discharge, and mortality).</p>
              <p>Several aspects of this trial are important to highlight. First, our inclusion criteria were specifically designed to include infants who are in the stable phase of their illness during hospitalisation and exclude infants at higher risk of deterioration. We took this conservative approach to maximise safety and promote acceptance of clinicians to the intermittent monitoring intervention. Second, infants who are on supplemental oxygen and have a stable clinical status are eligible for randomisation. Third, we are using the same target oxygen saturation in both groups. Fourth, it is important to take a multifaceted approach to supporting this practice change to ensure adherence to the allocated arm and success of the trial. We have obtained support from clinical leadership, including nursing, physicians, respiratory therapists and hospital administrators. We will also target groups using opinion leaders using small group sessions and support front line clinicians.</p>
              <p>We took the approach of not blinding clinicians and parents to the allocated monitoring strategy in this trial for several reasons. First, it is important to simulate the monitoring strategy intended with fidelity. The act of continuous or intermittent monitoring of oxygen saturation may alter the clinical assessments of treating nurses and physicians and their decisions regarding oxygen use and need for additional days of hospitalisation as well as parental perceptions of their child’s health. For example, previous researchers have suggested that continuous oxygen saturation monitoring results in over-reliance in technology and under-reliance of clinical assessment, which leads to over use of oxygen and longer hospital stay. Thus, we are interested in understanding if knowledge of treatment arm affects clinician behaviour and decisions around oxygen use and LOS, assuming the same target oxygen saturation of 90% in both groups. By taking this approach, our estimates of effectiveness will be more applicable to usual care settings. In pragmatic trials, it has been suggested that non-blinded treatment and assessment of clinical outcomes may be important for the preservation of the ‘ecology of care’, since blinding may have a significant effect on patients’ experience.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> Further, the inclusion of objective outcome measures may reduce the potential for bias resulting from patients’ expectations about the effectiveness of each treatment. Our primary outcome measure is an objective measure of length of hospital stay. Second, although methods are available to blind group assignment in monitoring trials (eg, providing a non-true continuous reading in between intermittent oximetry spot checks), this would ostensibly result in comparing two continuous monitoring arms. Third, as we are also measuring discharge readiness as a secondary outcome (defined by the child’s clinical status), we will be able to assess differences between both arms in discharge readiness and total LOS.</p>
