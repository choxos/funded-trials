              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Obesity in childhood often persists into adulthood.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In a large, longitudinal analysis, 84% of children with obesity had obesity as adults, and all children with severe obesity had obesity as adults.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Innovative and evidence-based interventions for managing obesity are required to minimize health consequences, optimize care, reduce system-related costs, and enhance family well-being.</p>
              <p>Early childhood represents an opportune time for obesity intervention, for numerous reasons. First, obesity, even early in life, has been linked to important effects (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, mental health service utilization).<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Second, early-life behaviors and patterns (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, low physical activity, short sleep duration) are well-established correlates in the development and persistence of obesity.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Third, behavioral and lifestyle modifications appear to be more successful when implemented at a younger age.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In children younger than 12 years of age, family-based interventions addressing nutrition, physical activity, sedentary activity, and sleep represent best practice<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>; yet, evidence of effectiveness is sparse for children younger than 6 years of age.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Limited studies suggest that multicomponent interventions are effective in this age group.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Parent-focused group sessions and home visits appear to be promising intervention components for young children with obesity. Parent-focused group sessions recognize caregivers as “agents of change”<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and have shown evidence of effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Home visits have the potential to increase access and applicability of care for families.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In the literature, a single intervention has incorporated both parent-focused group sessions and home visits for young children with obesity; that intervention was effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) compared to usual clinical care.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Based on emerging evidence and expertise of specialists in obesity management, we developed a family-based intervention for young children, incorporating parent group sessions and home nursing visits—the SickKids Team Obesity Management Early Years (STOMP-EY) intervention. We planned and conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to inform a definitive assessment of clinical effectiveness, but encountered significant challenges with recruitment and participation. These challenges highlighted the need to carefully consider intervention implementation.</p>
              <p>Ensuring acceptability and feasibility, and assessing contextual factors that impact implementation in real-world settings, is critical for effective implementation.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, acceptability, and contextual factors affecting implementation of the STOMP-EY intervention.</p>

                <title>Design and Setting</title>
                <p>Between October 2017 and March 2020, we studied STOMP-EY using multiple methods: (1) a pilot RCT, to assess feasibility, (2) parent focus groups, to explore acceptability (qualitative), and (3) health care provider (HCP) interviews, to assess contextual factors impacting implementation (qualitative). This was a single-center study conducted in the SickKids Team Obesity Management Program (STOMP), a pediatric obesity management clinic within a tertiary children's hospital (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Referrals come from a variety of sources, including family physicians, primary care pediatricians, and pediatric subspecialists. STOMP uses a family-centered approach and is delivered by an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurse practitioners, psychologists, dietitians, social work, exercise therapy, and physiotherapy. The Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children approved this study. The RCT component was registered at clinicaltrials.gov.</p>

                <p>We included young children with obesity (age ≥1 year and &lt;6 years) and their parent/primary caregiver [pilot RCT and parent focus groups], plus HCPs who delivered the STOMP-EY intervention [HCP interviews].</p>
                <p>Obesity was defined as BMI ≥97th percentile for age and sex based on World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference charts at the time they were referred to the obesity management program.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This definition (corresponding to those of the WHO for children ≥5 years<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>) was selected to be consistent across age groups and to correspond to clinical referral criteria.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Developed by STOMP members in conjunction with Toronto Public Health (including C.S.B., E.D., J.H., A.T., M.K.), STOMP-EY consisted of three core components delivered over 6 months: parent-only group sessions, home nursing visits, and clinical encounters with the obesity management team (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Usual clinical care consisted of clinical encounters with the multidisciplinary team, with the same frequency as the intervention group.</p>

                <p>HCPs delivering parent-only group sessions had been trained in delivering group-based interventions and group facilitation with this age group. Public health nurses were embedded within the obesity management team and had specific training in parenting support. Parent-only group sessions and home nursing visits were manualized. In home visits, public health nurses reinforced principles from group sessions, which they cofacilitated, using a checklist to maintain fidelity.</p>

We excluded children with Prader-Willi syndrome or severe developmental delay, and families residing outside the public health unit catchment area. Recruitment occurred from October 2017 to July 2019. A research coordinator (S.M.O.) screened families referred to the obesity management clinic and sent written information to those who were eligible. At the first clinical encounter, the research coordinator met with families to answer questions and obtain signed consent (or to ask about participation, if they could not be reached prior). After three unsuccessful contact attempts, it was assumed that a family was not interested in participating.</p>

                <p>Participant eligibility, randomization, and follow-up are shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Over 21 months, 61 parent-child dyads were screened for eligibility. Only 27 parent-child dyads met criteria and 11 were enrolled: 6 randomized to the intervention group and 5 to the usual care group. Most dyads that we screened were not eligible (34/61). The most common reasons for ineligibility were the child's age (too old; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13) and residence outside the public health unit catchment area (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13).</p>

                <p>Among the six participants randomized to the intervention, STOMP-EY participation in the core components was variable. The number of group sessions attended, out of 10, ranged from 0 (3 participants) to 7 (1 participant). Uptake of home visits ranged from 0 (3 participants) to 2 (1 participant). One protocol violation was identified. The parent of a 7-year-old child who was ineligible, based on age, participated in STOMP-EY per randomization. Enrollment ceased once challenges around recruitment and participation became clear. Data pertaining to change in zBMI were collected for 10 of 11 participants (90.9%). Given the low number of participants and the low rate of intervention participation, variance around zBMI change (to inform a definitive RCT) could not be reliably estimated.</p>

                  <p>Parents reported receiving very little information about the intervention from their referring physician, which limited their understanding of the intervention. Parents talked about feeling relief and hope when referred to an obesity management program, but most did not know what STOMP-EY entailed.

Parents appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of the intervention and the team's expertise and compassion. Those who participated in home visits felt that these relieved some stresses of daily life and helped with applying knowledge gained in the intervention. The core teachings of the intervention were perceived to lay a foundation for healthy living.</p>

                  <p>Some parents perceived the group sessions as unfeasible and ineffective for various reasons: group engagement was hindered by limited and inconsistent parental attendance, decreasing engagement; difficulties committing to 10 weeks of sessions because of timing and disruptions to parents' schedules; and a feeling of being “talked at” rather than “talked to.” Parking costs and travel were also noted barriers. Most parents requested that their availability be considered in group scheduling. Some reported that their attendance was influenced by the perceived value of the intervention.</p>

These negative influences were related to the characteristics of the intervention (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, complexity), the inner setting of the intervention (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, leadership engagement, available resources, access to knowledge, and information), and the process of implementation (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, intervention participants, executing the implementation according to plan).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Addressing a gap in evidence-informed practice, we developed and implemented the STOMP-EY intervention for young children with obesity and their families. We encountered challenges with recruitment and participation in a pilot RCT of STOMP-EY, indicating a lack of feasibility in our setting: eligibility rate was &lt;50%, consent rate was &lt;50%, and half of those randomized to STOMP-EY did not participate in group sessions or home visits. Qualitative data from parents and HCPs revealed important insights on intervention acceptability and contextual factors affecting implementation. Taken together, our findings highlight important but modifiable barriers to successful implementation of STOMP-EY. These barriers were a low number of eligible participants, insufficient information provided to parents about the intervention at referral, lack of relative priority and perceived patient need, lack of tailoring to individual patient needs, poor parental motivation to engage in group sessions, and challenges related to scheduling and delivery of group sessions.</p>
              <p>The number of potential participants screened for eligibility was low, and the proportion of ineligibility in those screened was high. The obesity management clinic from which we recruited participants may have contributed to the low number of eligible participants. Relatively few new assessments were completed monthly in the eligible age group, and many patients were from outside the immediate geographic area of the tertiary care hospital (rendering them ineligible for the intervention because they lived outside the public health unit catchment). Recruitment may have been more successful from community practices within the public health catchment area. Previous studies have demonstrated relatively high recruitment, engagement, and retention with weight management interventions in primary care and/or community settings.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given that children access primary care over 11 times in the first few years of life in our locale, primary care may be a more appropriate setting to implement and test interventions for young children with obesity. Alternatively, tertiary care-public health partnerships could be expanded to better reflect the demographics of the clinical population; however, doing so in advance of demonstrating intervention effectiveness is not recommended, as this expansion would require substantial resources.</p>
              <p>As identified by both parents and HCPs, there was insufficient information provided to parents about the intervention at referral. In previous work, Smith et al. noted that, when contacted about obesity management program intake, many families were unaware of the reason for referral, or were uninterested in participating in the type of lifestyle intervention to which they had been referred.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Failure to meet family expectations has been previously identified as an important factor in attrition from pediatric weight management programs,<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref></sup> highlighting the importance of communicating about an intervention early in the engagement pathway.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Early review of STOMP-EY's approach would allow parents to decide whether the program aligns with their expectations and perceived needs.</p>
              <p>Written information on the intervention, as part of the electronic referral process, could partially address this issue. Although more resource intensive, an interactive information session for families could be implemented to ensure that the intervention has been directly, accurately, and thoroughly described.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Whiteboard-style videos, including visual depiction of the intervention, might also be useful; such videos have shown promise in increasing parents' and HCPs' self-efficacy in communicating about weight and weight management.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> We hypothesize that adequate parental understanding of the intervention would facilitate STOMP-EY implementation by increasing engagement and decreasing attrition.</p>
              <p>In the context of other medical issues, weight management's lack of relative priority emerged as a theme in parent focus groups. HCPs also perceived medical comorbidities as a barrier to successful STOMP-EY implementation. Family motivation is recognized as an important determinant of engaging in treatment and successfully managing pediatric obesity.<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> We suggest that parents should be empowered to decide not only whether to participate in STOMP-EY, but also when to participate in STOMP-EY. An explicit option to revisit enrollment at a future time might facilitate participation and engagement.</p>
              <p>Parents identified a lack of adapting program content to individual patient needs. HCPs also expressed wanting to move toward more individualized support for families. The need to tailor weight management interventions to the individual needs of each family has been previously described, and individualized care that is responsive to cultural and socioeconomic diversity, and children's needs is explicitly addressed in recommendations to improve health services for managing pediatric obesity in Canada.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> We propose increasing the interactivity of group sessions and encouraging participants to share their unique challenges and needs. Such sharing of individual experiences might be beneficial to the broader group and identify previously unrecognized commonalities.<sup><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Any individualized needs that cannot be effectively addressed in the group setting could be redirected to home visits and individual clinical encounters.</p>
              <p>We experienced low participation in group sessions, and low parental engagement in group sessions. In their interviews, HCPs reflected on some of these challenges around group dynamics and their negative influence on STOMP-EY. As social interaction and support have been identified as key drivers of ongoing attendance at community-based lifestyle interventions, we propose increasing the interactive component of sessions.<sup><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> We also propose incorporating components of motivational interviewing (MI).<sup><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Although MI has largely been applied and studied in individual encounters, it has been used in group settings, predominantly in the field of substance use and addictions.<sup><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44–46</xref></sup> Clinical encounters and home nursing visits would allow for more individualized application of MI techniques.</p>
              <p>Challenges related to scheduling and delivery of group sessions could be addressed through a more collaborative approaching to scheduling (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, working with participants to find a maximally convenient time among the group). Transitioning to an online/virtual format would address some practical challenges (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, parking costs, travel time) and might therefore increase accessibility of group sessions; however, it has been suggested that web-based interventions may actually exacerbate inequities across sociodemographic groups and the “digital divide.”<sup><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> To our knowledge, the effectiveness of virtual small group sessions in pediatric weight management has not been studied. In adults, recent studies suggest that lifestyle interventions delivered via videoconference are at least as effective as standard interventions<sup><xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49–51</xref></sup>; however, intervention or participant characteristics that contribute to the effectiveness of virtual small group sessions are not well understood. Changing STOMP-EY group sessions to an online/virtual format would therefore raise important considerations related to implementation, effectiveness, and equity.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>First, we did not require pilot RCT participation for parent focus group eligibility. We believe that including a broader sample of parents provided valuable insights into the acceptability of STOMP-EY; however, we acknowledge that the intervention may have been perceived differently based on RCT enrollment. Themes emerging were not necessarily informed by direct experience of all intervention components via trial participation.</p>
              <p>Second, we did not formally assess fidelity of STOMP-EY implementation. Assessing whether the intervention was implemented as intended would have allowed for a more comprehensive evaluation of implementation, and will be important for future iterations of the intervention.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We encountered challenges related to feasibility and acceptability of the STOMP-EY intervention and identified contextual factors affecting implementation in our setting that might have been avoided through content codevelopment and a more explicit implementation approach to delivery. Identified barriers to successful implementation are, however, modifiable and can inform the next iteration of the intervention. Our findings also have broader implications for the development and delivery of interventions for young children with obesity. We suggest that future interventions acknowledge the importance of the intervention setting, inform parents about the intervention early in the engagement process, empower families to decide whether and when to participate, offer individualized support tailored to the diverse needs of families, consider opportunities to increase engagement in group sessions, and address how best to deliver intervention components.</p>
