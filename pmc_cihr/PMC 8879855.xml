                <p>A randomized two-arm prospective superiority trial tested the efficacy of a novel structured and monitored nutrition (bi-weekly counselling for individualized energy and high dairy protein diet) and exercise program (walking goal of 10,000 steps/day) (intervention) compared to usual care (control) in pregnant women to achieve gestational weight gain (GWG) within current recommendations. Women recruited in communities in southern Ontario, Canada were randomized at 12–17 weeks gestation with stratification by site and pre-pregnancy BMI to intervention (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 119) or control (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 122). The primary outcome was the proportion of women who achieved GWG within the Institute of Medicine recommendations. Although the intervention compared to control group was more likely to achieve GWG within recommendations (OR = 1.51; 95% CI (0.81, 2.80)) and total GWG was lower by 1.45 kg (95% CI: (−11.9, 8.88)) neither reached statistical significance. The intervention group achieved significantly higher protein intake at 26–28 week (mean difference (MD); 15.0 g/day; 95% CI (8.1, 21.9)) and 36–38 week gestation (MD = 15.2 g/day; 95% CI (9.4, 21.1)) and higher healthy diet scores (22.5 ± 6.9 vs. 18.7 ± 8.5, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.005) but step counts were similar averaging 6335 steps/day. Pregnancy and infant birth outcomes were similar between groups. While the structured and monitored nutrition with counselling improved diet quality and protein intake and may have benefited GWG, the exercise goal of 10,000 steps/day was unachievable. The results can inform future recommendations for diet and physical activity in pregnancy.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite the available guidelines on gestational weight gain (GWG) from the Institute of Medicine since 2009 [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], excess GWG is highly prevalent in women across all pre-pregnancy body mass index (pBMI) categories in both Canada and the United States [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In observational studies, excessive GWG and pregravid obesity were associated with greater risk of adverse perinatal outcomes [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and risk of infant macrosomia or large-for-gestational age rises with maternal pregravid obesity and excessive GWG [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>The experimental intervention in the Be Healthy in Pregnancy (BHIP) randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was grounded in a synthesis of existing systematic reviews of RCTs with varying intervention strategies that suggested the most convincing approach to achieve reduction in GWG was a combination of physical activity and individualized diet counselling, preferably in combination with weight monitoring [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The primary objective of the BHIP study was to determine if introducing a structured and monitored nutrition and exercise program (intervention) in early pregnancy compared with usual prenatal care (control) increased the likelihood of attaining GWG within the IOM guidelines (outcome) over the pregnancy period. We hypothesized that the experimental combined structured and monitored Nutrition + Exercise intervention compared with usual care would increase the percentage of pregnant women who achieved a GWG within IOM recommendations overall and for each pre-pregnancy BMI category and site. Other pre-specified outcomes included comparison of pregnancy and birth outcomes and maternal metabolic health between intervention and control groups.</p>

                <p>The BHIP study was a two-arm, two-site prospective superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio to either the intervention group (i.e., Nutrition + Exercise with counselling and monitoring) or the control group (usual care as per Health Canada recommendations) from early pregnancy to birth. Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Boards of Hamilton Health Sciences (REB Project#12-469), Western University, London (HSREB 103272), and Joseph Brant Hospital, Burlington (JBH 000-018-14) in Ontario, Canada.

Eligibility criteria were screened at the first contact and the baseline visit [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
                <p>Block randomization to the two study arms was conducted at the second visit to the study center and was stratified by study site and pBMI category used by IOM [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as detailed previously [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The study was open-label with blinded endpoints due to the nature of the intervention as detailed [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
                <p>All participants received standard care delivered by their health care practitioner (physician or midwife) during pregnancy. After enrolment, all participants received counselling and hard copies of the advice from Health Canada at the time of the trial as published online [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The primary caretaker of each participant also received mailed copies of the same materials. A $25 Canadian grocery gift card was available for all participants on three occasions when dietary and accelerometry data were collected.</p>

                  <p>The multi-component intervention strategy included the specific active intervention of a high protein dairy diet and individualized energy intake found effective in our previous two studies in non-pregnant women [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and proven reasonable by our qualitative testing for feasibility [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In-person counselling occurred weekly or biweekly from early in the second trimester (14–17 weeks gestation) until the end of pregnancy as detailed [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The study nutritionist counselled the participants on their individual dietary goals, providing recipes and diet plans suited to meet energy requirements. The individualized goals were based on providing 25% of their energy intake from protein of which 50% of the protein was derived from dairy foods as approximately 4–6 servings daily of low-fat dairy, such as milk, cottage cheese, and yogurt according to each participant’s preference. The diet plan was set to each individual’s calculated Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) using the equations in the Dietary Reference Intake report for normal and overweight pregnant women based on their size, age, and physical activity levels, with additional energy goals added as pregnancy progressed [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Several strategies to promote adherence to the diet intervention were included such as provision of low-fat dairy foods as per participant preference as detailed previously [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For the walking-based exercise program, participants first completed a validated activity questionnaire which was reviewed by a certified exercise physiologist to assess participants’ activity levels at baseline. Participants were encouraged to follow guidelines from the PARmed-X for Pregnancy [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], walking 3–4 times each week for 25 min a session, increasing their walking time by 2 min a week until they reached 40 min. At each study visit, the research assistant walked with the participant for 30 to 40 min around campus or within the medical center/hospital during inclement weather. The goal was to walk 10,000 steps/day; any daily form of physical activity counted towards the step count, including walking sessions at study visits accompanied by research staff and daily habitual activities, and were measured through use of a pedometer with records kept on pedometer logs that were reviewed at each study visit [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

Body weight was measured by trained research assistants using a Tanita Body Composition Analyzer BF-350 scale (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) and GWG calculated as previously described [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
                <p>Demographic information was obtained at baseline using a standard questionnaire and screening for depression score used the Edinburgh Depression Scale [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Diet assessment was completed at 12–17, 26–28, and 36–38 weeks gestation and included a 21-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) adapted from the validated PrimeScreen FFQ [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to derive a score for healthy dietary practices and a 3-day food intake record to determine protein and energy intakes [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Physical activity and exercise behaviors were assessed during the same 3 days using a SenseWear armband tri-axis accelerometer (Model MF-SW:BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and analyzed to obtain step count, energy expenditure, and minutes of activity level using SenseWear Professional 8.1 Software (BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA).</p>
                <p>Obstetrical outcomes obtained from medical charts or by self-report by the participants included delivery mode, diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM defined as blood glucose of &gt;7.2 mmol/L 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test), and pre-eclampsia. At 12–17 and 36–38 weeks gestation, blood pressure was measured and fasting blood samples obtained for profiles of lipids, glucose, C-reactive protein, and hormones leptin and adiponectin by methods previously detailed [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At these two time points and at 26–28 weeks gestation, skinfold thickness was measured in triplicate (Harpenden Skinfold Caliper, Baty International, West Sussex, UK) by trained staff on the right-hand side of the body at four sites—subscapular, triceps, biceps, and supra-iliac crest for which triplicate values were averaged and sum of skinfold thickness (SFT) calculated.

                <p>The proposed sample size of 155 participants per treatment group was based on the test of the null hypothesis that the percentages of women with GWG within IOM guidelines in the two populations (intervention and control) are equal as detailed in our research design paper [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We revised our target sample size based on our a priori calculation to a sample size of 111 per group corresponding to 30% of women in the treatment group having a GWG exceeding the IOM recommendations compared to 65% in the control group. With the revised sample size (i.e., assuming a 1:1 allocation ratio), the study would have power of 80% to yield a statistically significant result assuming a binomial distribution (using an intention-to-treat principle for the analysis) of the difference between percentages of women with GWG within IOM guidelines at alpha = 0.05.</p>
                <p>Data were entered into an online Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) service hosted at McMaster University) [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Descriptive statistics of participant baselines characteristics and outcome variables (both primary and secondary) were reported as detailed previously [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The primary analysis for all outcomes was intention to treat (ITT) for 119 intervention and 122 control group participants with imputed data for missing values (28). Complete case analysis included 101 intervention and 104 control group participants who had outcome measurements for the primary outcome (GWG) available at the end of pregnancy.</p>
                <p>Multivariable regression analyses were used to determine the intervention effect on each outcome of interest, adjusting for stratification variables: study site and pre-pregnancy BMI category. Due to a low number of individuals in the underweight category (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4), these individuals were grouped with normal weight category.</p>
                <p>For the primary outcome, GWG within IOM guidelines (yes/no), both a binary regression model and logistic regression model were created. The adjusted odds ratio, 95% CI, and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value were computed using a logistic regression model (distribution = binomial, link = logit).</p>
                <p>For continuous outcomes, linear regression was performed. Outcomes where the normality assumption was not met were transformed (using natural log [Ln] or square root transformations) before being used in a model. For the remaining binary outcomes, logistic regression analyses were performed. For all models, the results are expressed as an estimate of the adjusted mean difference for continuous outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes), corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals, and associated <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values.</p>
                <p>For the PrimeScreen dietary assessment scores contrasted between allocation groups over time, generalized estimating equations (GEE) assuming autoregressive (AR(1)) correlation structure were used to account for correlated repeated outcome data within a participant over time. A normal model with identity link function was used. Analysis was controlled for maternal pBMI and study site.</p>
                <p>Sensitivity analysis was performed using per protocol analysis and complete case analysis for all outcomes. Individuals were included for per protocol analyses if they had reported gestational weight gain values during their third visit; results were reported based on analysis of imputed data. Individuals included for complete case analysis were based on data available for each outcome and independent variables adjusted in the model; results were reported based on analysis of non-imputed data.</p>
                <p>For all subgroup analyses, the treatment effect and confidence intervals for each site and each pre-pregnancy BMI level, along with the interaction <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value are reported. Forest plots were constructed for the primary outcomes.</p>
                <p>All statistical tests were performed using two-sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance. All analyses were performed using SAS software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS 25 (Chicago, IL, USA).

              <p>The BHIP structured and monitored diet with at least biweekly nutrition counselling resulted in improvements in overall diet quality, higher protein intake (106 vs. 88 g/day), and stable energy intake across pregnancy. The positive dietary response was not mirrored in achieving the exercise goal of 10,000 steps which proved challenging. Mean daily step counts remained similar across pregnancy between treatment groups and declined from baseline to 36–38 weeks gestation with fewer than 10% of women achieving the target step count despite continued encouragement and walking sessions accompanied by research staff at the bi-weekly visits for the intervention group.

This parallels the finding of a RCT of a behavioral intervention in women (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 358) from all BMI categories wherein a significant main effect for BMI category for excessive GWG was observed compared with all other weight-gain categories [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>Cardiometabolic monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profiles showed similarity between intervention and control group and few abnormalities. Only 14% of women developed impaired fasting glucose, and few (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4) developed hypertension. In the complete case analysis, fasted blood LDL, total cholesterol, and CRP were significantly lower in the intervention group but not likely of clinical significance.</p>
              <p>For infants, birth outcomes did not differ by treatment group. Birth weights were appropriate for gestational age with only 6–10% in the &gt;90th percentile range and 5–6% in the &lt;10th percentile range.</p>
              <p>In interpreting our findings compared to other recent similar clinical trials, we observed that the proportion of women meeting the IOM GWG recommendations in the BHIP study were higher than the prospective meta-analysis of 7 harmonized RCTs called LIFE-Moms in the US in which only 17.6% in the intervention (compared to 33% in BHIP) and 10.8% in the standard care group (compared to 22% in BHIP) attained GWG within the IOM recommendations despite having a significant intervention effect in lower total weight gain [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further, the 1.45 kg total lower GWG in the intervention group was twice that observed (−0.7 kg) for the intervention group reported in the individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of diet and physical activity-based interventions [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and similar to the LIFE-Moms RCT of −1.58 kg [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The observed −1.45 kg lower GWG in our intervention group represents a &gt;10% difference of the expected gain using the IOM recommendation of 11–16 kg for the normal weight BMI category. This could be considered a clinically significant difference.</p>
              <p>That the BHIP intervention did not impact maternal pregnancy outcomes is in line with previous meta analyses of RCTs that found a treatment effect on GWG but not for GDM, preeclampsia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and is also consistent with prenatal lifestyle intervention studies in the United States [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Australia [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and the recent IPD-meta-analysis that showed a significant reduction in Cesarean section with the intervention but not for GDM, hypertensive disorders, or preterm delivery [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The low rates of GDM and pre-eclampsia may reflect the general good health of our study groups. The infant birth outcomes in the BHIP study were also consistent with the majority of previous meta-analysis reviews of diet and exercise interventions wherein no significant differences were reported in infant birthweight, macrosomia, or prevalence estimates of SGA and LGA infants [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as a UK study in obese pregnant women in the United Kingdom (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1555) [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and in women of all BMI categories in Brazil (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 639) [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>The strategy of a multi-component intervention in pregnancy for GWG management as designed in BHIP aligns with recommendations of a recent evidence review [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Further, this study addressed the identified under-reporting of intervention content or “active intervention ingredients” for nutrition and exercise interventions by specific adherence measures [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The improved diet quality score and higher protein intake indicated adherence to the structured and individualized dietary guidance with counselling in the intervention group. The frequency of knowledge sharing and individualized guided support from the study nutritionist, including a nutrition handbook, in addition to the provision of self-selected low-fat dairy foods, were likely other motivating factors to improve dietary practices in the intervention group.</p>
              <p>Our results on physical activity measures align with a recent multi-component RCT in which a goal of 10,000 steps per day was not attained out to late pregnancy [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Current evidence-based Canadian pregnancy guidelines for physical activity during pregnancy recommend at least 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise a week such as brisk walking, accumulated over a minimum of three days, but do not specify a daily step count [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Since BHIP participants averaged 50 min/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity at 26–28 weeks gestation and 38 min/day at 36–38 weeks gestation, the recommended goal of 150 weekly minutes of physical activity for health benefits [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] would have been achieved over 3 days in mid and 4 days in late pregnancy. The amount of time spent being physically active by BHIP participants fell within recommendations in a recent evidence review [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Maintaining 10,000 daily steps may be an unreasonable goal, particularly in pregnancy; and it has been questioned for use even in the non-pregnant population [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Many barriers to achieving exercise recommendations for pregnancy include time limitations [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], pregnancy-specific complications [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], or the misconception that exercise will cause harm to their offspring [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
              <p>A major strength of the BHIP randomized trial was that it fulfilled many of the recently recommended attributes of a multi-component approach to influencing GWG [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and addressed several methodological issues in studies on GWG noted to limit the strength of evidence in a recent National Academy of Medicine discussion paper [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Examples include initiation in early pregnancy; supervised physical activity; individualized intervention of energy intake and diet plan with counselling; and GWG monitoring. Further, the two diet assessment tools and accelerometry for quantitative physical activity measures employed rather than questionnaires provided measures of fidelity and adherence to the prescribed goals in the intervention group and comparison between groups. The BHIP study was also conducted in a community setting and included all pBMI categories (except extreme obesity), whereas many previous studies were targeted only to women with pregravid obesity and/or overweight recruited through hospital clinics.</p>
              <p>Limitations of the study relate to generalizability of the findings. The recruitment sites were mostly primary care clinics of midwives or family doctors, and eligibility criteria excluded women with limited comprehension of the English, with documented signs of depression or a pre-pregnancy BMI above 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Our study population was mostly Caucasian, holding a university degree, and a medium to high socio-economic status, thus being representative of populations in the cities where recruitment occurred as they are modern urban centers with universities, colleges, and major commerce. Finally, due to funding constraints, we were not able to achieve the original sample size.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>While the structured and monitored nutrition and exercise intervention did not result in a statistically significantly greater proportion of women achieving recommended GWG compared to usual prenatal care offered in our community, the observed lower GWG of 1.45 kg in the intervention groups aligns with previous studies and may be clinically significant. Improvements in dietary practices within the intervention group did lead to healthier dietary practice scores and a higher protein intake as recently recommended [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The elements of the BHIP approach to improving nutrition may inform future studies of nutrition in pregnancy; and the targets for nutrient intake such as energy for normal weight, overweight, and obese women may need to be different [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the exercise goal was not attained, the average step counts and intensity observed were similar to other studies [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], were within current guidelines [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and were not associated with high blood pressure. Perhaps the attained step counts reveal the limitations of capacity to exercise in busy women during pregnancy and serve as realistic goals. Taken together, our results can inform future guidance for feasible guidance on nutrition and physical activity in pregnancy. As shown in the BHIP and other studies cited, achieving the current IOM recommendations for GWG [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-14-00810" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (now over 12 years old) is not easily attainable for many pregnant women. Our study demonstrated that a higher than recommended GWG was not associated with a preponderance of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes suggesting it might be timely to re-visit the recommendations for ideal gestational weight gain.</p>
