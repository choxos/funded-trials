                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The proposed randomised controlled trial will be a pilot feasibility study with a 1:1 randomisation to the Hands-Up programme or usual physical therapy. The programme setting is an online home exercise and education program. Outcome assessments will take place at the Roth|McFarlane Hand and Upper Limb Clinic in London, Ontario, which is a tertiary care academic centre. 74 people aged 50–65 years after distal radius fracture will be recruited. Purposeful recruitment will be conducted to include a sufficient number of men in the study. The Hands-Up program includes both exercise and education. Participants will engage in approximately 45 min of a full-body home exercise routine followed by 30 min of education in an online program. The educational modules will focus on fall prevention, nutrition for osteoporosis and learning about osteoporosis. Participants will engage in the program online, twice a week for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome of the study is feasibility. The study will be considered feasible if participants attend &gt;60% of the sessions, 74 participants are enrolled in 12 months and &gt;75% of participants attend the final study visit. For the secondary outcome, physical and self-report outcomes will be assessed.</p>

              <p>Distal radius fractures (DRF) have the highest incidence of any fractures<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and account for one-sixth of all emergency department visits.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Consequences related to DRF are pain and functional limitations, which have been reported to occur in the acute and chronic phases of recovery,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> with 16% of people with a DRF reporting pain up to 1 year after fracture.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> There have been several factors reported to be associated with negative outcomes after a DRF, such as higher age,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> female sex<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and joint involvement during play and work (i.e. jobs requiring high demands from the hand and wrist typically have worse outcomes than jobs that require minimal use of the hand and wrist)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 7</xref> are potentially related to sustained feelings of pain and disablement. Several studies have looked at the effect of DRF pain across a variety of age categories and found statistically significant differences in those aged above 65 and below 65.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In an observational cohort study of over 1500 participants the highest incidence of fracture occurred in the 51–65 age group, with men reporting the highest pain in that age group.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It was hypothesised that the high incidence of fractures found in those people aged 51–65 is likely due to changes in bone mineral density, potentially caused by osteoporosis.</p>
              <p>Osteoporosis is a bone disease that occurs from a decrease in bone mineral density, increasing the risk of non-traumatic fractures. Fractures in the wrist, hip and vertebrae are the most common. However, a fracture at the wrist is usually the first indication of the presence of osteoporosis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> People with osteoporosis who are not taught to modify their lifestyle, specifically through exercise, nutrition and fall prevention strategies, are more likely to suffer more debilitating fractures of the hip and spine later in life.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Current wrist fracture rehabilitation focuses on restoration of joint mobility and hand function,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and focuses on those over the age of 65. However, those 50–65 years of age represent the largest group of people presenting with wrist fractures.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> They may require more targeted rehabilitation approaches since their bone health and activity levels are different from older adults. Further, early intervention provides the opportunity for preventing future debilitating fractures of the spine or hip.</p>
              <p>There is little information conveniently accessible to people related to exercise, nutrition and fall prevention to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The goal of this research is to develop and test a novel exercise and education group intervention (Hands-Up) that will incorporate education on bone health, prevention guidelines, nutrition and fall prevention, with an online exercise class and a structured virtual home safety assessment. Specifically, is the Hands-Up program a feasible intervention for patients aged 50–65 with a low-impact DRF? Secondarily, will the Hands-Up programme potentially produce better, range of motion (ROM), strength and reduce pain than usual physical therapy for patients aged 50–65 with a low-impact DRF when tested in a fully powered randomised clinical trial? This multimodal intervention will target the major risk factors for secondary fractures, to enhance functional recovery and health following a DRF, compared with usual physical therapy for wrist fractures.</p>

                <p>This study is organised by the Roth|McFarlane Hand and Upper Limb Clinic (RM-HULC) in London, Ontario. RM-HULC is a tertiary care centre specialising in patients with complex conditions affecting the hand, wrists, elbows and shoulders. RM-HULC serves over 40 000 patients per year, making it a resource for recruiting patients with a DRF. The program itself will take place online.

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>This study will be a single-blinded, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing an online twice-weekly exercise and education session to usual physical therapy treatment for people with a DRF. There will be a 1:1 allocation ratio. A web-based randomisation software will be used to generate allocation assignments stratified by gender. Allocation will be concealed from therapists and patients until the first visit, and a blinded evaluator will perform all patient outcome assessments (CZ). This is protocol version 2 from September 2020.</p>

                <p>We will recruit volunteers aged 50–65 years, who are 6–10 weeks after wrist fracture, from the RM-HULC in London, Ontario. Participants will not be required to have preintervention osteoporosis or osteopenia, but we will be aiming to enrol participants with a low-impact DRF, to target participants at high risk of developing osteoporosis in the future. Participants will have had a recent DRF and will be cleared from exercise by their treating physician. We are aiming to enrol a total of 74 participants, 32 participants in the Hands-Up intervention group and 32 participants in the control group. The sample size was designed based on multiple papers and criteria for pilot studies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> and to provide sufficient data to pilot our disaggregated sex/gender-based analyses (SGBA) plan.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Given the predominance of women in this population, we will specifically recruit men to ensure that at least 40% of participants are men, to support SGBA.</p>

                <p>Previous work by our laboratory group surveyed people with osteoporosis to better understand their exercise preferences. The feedback from that survey helped to design the research question and design of the study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> People with osteoporosis were consulted on the education materials and the exercise programme to determine whether the education and exercise were relevant and thorough.

                  <p>Participants will be guided through a 45 min exercise program. In the first session, the participants will be asked to go through tutorial videos teaching them how to perform each exercise. The subsequent sessions will be a guided 45 min class of a prerecorded exercise program, where the participants can follow along with the video. The participants will track their progress on a program sheet, recording the number of sets and the number of repetitions completed for that session, and any modifications made to the exercises. An example exercise program is presented in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. The exercises will be progressed after 3 weeks, where the participants will be able to follow along with a second 45 min video demonstrating these progressed exercises. An online forum will be set up and monitored by a physical therapist to answer any questions that arise during the exercise program.</p>

                  <p>Immediately after the exercise session, participants will be encouraged to participate in a 30 min educational session. The educational sessions will be prerecorded videos. The topics will cover bone health principles, nutrition for bone health, osteoporosis practice guidelines, ways to self-monitor balance and lower extremity strength, impacts of physical activity, home hazard detection, hazards at work and in the community, postural effects on bone loading and fracture risk and integrating physical activity in daily life. Nutritional education will emphasise the importance of calcium and vitamin D, sources of both dairy and dairy-free calcium, vitamin D, the importance of protein, and meat and meat-free sources of protein. Although the participants will be encouraged to listen to the videos immediately after they exercise, they have flexibility when they listen to the modules. They will be encouraged to listen to them in order and over the 6-week intervention timeline. Participants will be asked to post any question on the online forum, which will be monitored, and the questions will be answered by a physical therapist.</p>
                  <p>The fall hazard detection will use a fall hazard checklist to identify home and workplace fall hazards and assist participants in identifying fall hazards in their home environments. Patients will complete a checklist of common home hazards and then record themselves navigating their home and talk aloud to identify potential hazards. The videos will be submitted online and reviewed by a physical therapist. The last session of the program will allow the participant to discuss the program with the physical therapist. Patients randomised to regular care and the Hands-Up program will both receive therapy as directed by their treating therapist and complete all study outcome measures. Participants in the standard treatment group will receive access to the online materials after their study participation.</p>

Adverse events will be noted at the outcome assessment visits and monitored on the online forum. The student investigator will be conducting the outcome assessments and will conduct the assessments on all the participants, which will also take place at RM-HULC.</p>

                  <p>The participants will engage in the online program through a website hosted by Wix.com, accessed with the URL: handsup-program.com. To reduce the risk of contamination of the study, a login and password are required to enter the website. Each participant will create their own login information. Security and privacy information can be accessed through the Wix website: <ext-link xlink:href="https://supportwixcom/en/article/about-domain-privacy" ext-link-type="uri">https://supportwixcom/en/article/about-domain-privacy</ext-link>. In the creation of the Wix website, we have opted to enhance the domain security to reduce the risk of identity theft. However, to make sure that all the participants can access the website it is publicly accessible. A user login helps to reduce the risk of the public accessing online forum questions; however, other participants in the study will be able to view the forum. Participating in the forum is voluntary, and if participants do not feel comfortable, they do not have to participate. Instead, participants canprivately email the lead student investigator directly.</p>

                <title>Goals and exercise modes</title>
                <p>The program was designed with four main goals in mind: (1) to improve upper body strength and mobility; (2) to improve lower body strength and mobility; (3) to improve balance; and (4) to improve functional outcomes of the wrist due to the DRF. The current study is assessing feasibility, and if the study is feasible a larger trial will be designed to determine whether these goals are met.</p>

                <title>Frequency and duration</title>
                <p>Participants will be asked to participate in the exercise and education class twice weekly for 6 weeks. Each session will last 75 min, with 45 min allocated to exercise and 30 min to education. Participants will not be explicitly encouraged to exercise beyond the program; however, they will be provided with a diary to track any exercise they might be doing outside of the program.</p>

                <title>Intensity</title>
                <p>For the upper and lower body strengthening the participants will use body weight, or a resistance band. It will be up to the participants’ discretion to determine their appropriate intensity. Since the participants will be provided resistance bands but no weights, we will ask them to increase intensity by increasing the number of reps, or sets, or the resistance on the band. It will be emphasised that the participants prioritise good form rather than high repetitions or increasing resistance. The online exercise program will be set up to have the participants complete three sets of 8–10 repetitions of exercises targeting the major muscle groups. The exercises can be progressed by increasing the resistance or by increasing the number of repetitions. Balance exercises will be held for 20–60 s, progressively increasing the difficulty by reducing the base of support, adding a mental challenge or affecting the sensory system (eg, closing their eyes). Participants will be coached on how to self-progress.</p>

              <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
              <p>We are proposing a feasibility study improving outcomes for adults after DRF. This intervention will combine exercise and osteoporosis education. This study was designed as a pilot study, a smaller scale study, to determine whether this intervention is feasible and practical for a future larger scale study. The study was designed in such a way that the intervention will be closer on the scale of pragmatic rather than explanatory as a hope of the intervention being adapted into practice. A larger trial could be expanded into other cities, provinces or countries, and in a variety of treatment centres.</p>
              <p>This will be the first study to address adults aged 50–65 with a DRF by providing them with a whole-body exercise program and osteoporosis-related education, and the first programme to offer this type of programme online. This study chooses to cater the education towards osteoporosis because osteoporosis is a very prevalent disease<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with a large gap in care in this age group.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Specifically, a DRF is often the first sign of someone having osteoporosis<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>; however, it often takes more than one fracture before osteoporosis screening or treatment begins. Meanwhile, the 50–65 years old age category is at high risk of developing osteoporosis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 24 25</xref> If we are able to teach them non-pharmacological management, they may be able to be more autonomous in their care and potentially prevent future more debilitating fractures such as of the hip or spine.</p>
              <p>This study was designed to be presented in English, potentially limiting the external validity of the study. However, over 200 million people suffer from osteoporosis worldwide,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> indicating a need for preventative management strategies. Future iterations of this programme could include translations to target a larger proportion of those individuals affected by osteoporosis. Unfortunately, it will be challenging to determine the medium-term and long-term effects of the programme, as the goal is to prevent fractures.</p>

                <title>Ethics and confidentiality</title>
                <p>The research will be conducted according to the Tri-Council Policy Statement and in accordance with the University of Western Ontario and Lawson Health Research. The study has received approval from the Research Ethics Board at the University of Western Ontario. A trial run of the study was conducted in August 2020 with a participant volunteer. Amendments will be submitted to the ethics committee by the lead student investigator. Participants will be assigned an ID to be used on the forms and in the data management system. Deidentified data will be stored in a secure area of RM-HULC. Hard copies of records with personal identifiers will be kept separately from the data. Data will be entered into the data management system by the lead student investigator.</p>

                <title>Dissemination</title>
                <p>Publishing the results will be a key strategy to provide knowledge users with the most up-to-date research for wrist fracture management in middle-aged adults. The program will be provided freely through open access to ensure academics and clinicians are informed of the study results. The results will also be disseminated to academic knowledge users through national and international conference presentations. Workshops will be held to teach clinicians the results of the study, to inform their current practice. The lead student investigator will reach out to an osteoporosis exercise training program, BoneFit, to inform physical therapy practice on managing adults in the early stages of osteoporosis.</p>
                <p>Results related to the exercise program, key nutritional points and fall prevention strategies will be made public through YouTube, also allowing for an indication of prograe uptake. Public access through YouTube will provide knowledge from the study results to individuals with osteoporosis and allow them to begin modifying their lifestyle. We will promote the study through social media to be able to reach a wider breadth of interested people.</p>
                <p>We will also be targeting patient support groups such as the Canadian Osteoporosis Patient Network and translating the results through Osteoporosis Canada. Finally, a website related to this study will be created after the programe is complete to allow the patients and clinicians to have continued access to the resources.</p>
