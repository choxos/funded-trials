                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Partial nephrectomy is a standard of care for non-metastatic renal tumours when technically feasible. Despite the increased use of partial nephrectomy, intraoperative techniques that lead to optimal renal function after surgery have not been rigorously studied. Clamping of the renal hilum to prevent bleeding during resection causes temporary renal ischaemia. The internal temperature of the kidney may be lowered after the renal hilum is clamped (renal hypothermia) in an attempt to mitigate the effects of ischaemia. Our objective is to determine if renal hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy results in improved postoperative renal function at 12‚Äâmonths following surgery as compared with warm ischaemia (no renal hypothermia).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analyses</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre, randomised, single-blinded controlled trial comparing renal hypothermia versus no hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy. Due to the nature of the intervention, complete blinding of the surgical team is not possible; however, surgeons will be blinded until the time of hilar clamping. Glomerular filtration will be based on plasma clearance of a radionucleotide, and differential renal function will be based on renal scintigraphy. The primary outcome is overall renal function at 12 months measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Secondary outcomes include change in GFR, GFR of the affected kidney, change in GFR of the affected kidney, serum creatinine, haemoglobin, spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio, quality of life and postoperative complications. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately postoperatively and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The diagnosis of renal tumours has increased by approximately 2% per year for over 30‚Äâyears.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Many new diagnoses are incidental due to more frequent use of abdominal imaging,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and in 2017, it is estimated that over 63‚Äâ000 new renal cancers will be diagnosed in the USA.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The increased detection of benign and malignant renal masses has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of renal surgeries performed per year.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Several institutions have reviewed their surgical series and reported improved renal function preservation and similar cancer outcomes for patients who receive partial nephrectomy (removing the tumour from the affected kidney) compared with radical nephrectomy (removing the entire affected kidney).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5‚Äì12</xref> It has also been suggested that partial nephrectomy patients have improved overall survival compared with radical nephrectomy patients,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> presumably because of fewer adverse effects as a result of renal insufficiency.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These insights have resulted in a dramatic shift in the treatment of small renal masses. In a recent review of Canadian tertiary care institutions, the vast majority of tumours less than 7‚Äâcm in diameter are treated with partial nephrectomy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The urological community now recognises the importance of renal function preservation, and for this reason, partial nephrectomy is the preferred treatment of renal neoplasms when technically possible.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16‚Äì18</xref>
</p>
              <p>Significant blood flow to the kidney necessitates temporary occlusion (clamping) of the renal hilar blood vessels to allow for tumour resection and precise renal reconstruction.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As a consequence, the entire kidney is exposed to a period of ischaemia during partial nephrectomy. Ischaemia causes renal parenchymal injury and longer ischaemia time is associated with more severe renal damage.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Cooling the kidney (renal hypothermia) may decrease the metabolic demand of nephrons, which in turn may decrease acute ischaemic injury and long-term renal function.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22‚Äì24</xref> Ischaemic tissue hypothermia has also been used to reduce brain damage during circulatory arrest or in the period after cerebral infarction.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> To achieve renal cooling, the kidney requires approximately 10‚Äâmin surrounded by ice slush prior to tumour resection. Therefore, hypothermia necessitates a longer period of ischaemia that may be deleterious to recovery of renal function. The beneficial effect of hypothermia may be negated by the longer duration of ischaemia required.</p>
              <p>Our objective is to determine if renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy results in improved postoperative renal function compared with warm ischaemia (no hypothermia). Our primary objective is to determine the effect of hypothermia compared with no hypothermia on preservation of overall renal function at 12 months, as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Our secondary objective is to determine the effect of hypothermia compared with no hypothermia on preservation of renal function of the affected kidney (kidney with the tumour), as measured by the product of GFR and ipsilateral renal function.</p>

                <p>This study was initiated and coordinated at The Ottawa Hospital, a regional cancer referral centre in Ottawa, Canada. Six urological oncology centres in Canada are participating in the trial (The Ottawa Hospital, University Health Network (Toronto), St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospital (Hamilton), Centre Hospitalier Universitaire¬†de Qu√©bec (Quebec City), London Health Sciences Centre and Capital District Health Authority (Halifax)). All study sites are tertiary referral centres that routinely perform open partial nephrectomy. Patients were randomised to receive either renal hypothermia (intervention) or no renal hypothermia (control).</p>
                <p>Evaluation and flow of patients prior to, during and following surgery is according to the usual standard of care. The study flow chart is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>, and timeline of study/outcome assessments is outlined in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

For patients randomised to the hypothermia group, within 10‚Äâs of clamping the renal vessels, the kidney is encased with saline ice slush for a period of 10‚Äâmin (the duration of slush encasement is based on available evidence and is in keeping with standard clinical practice<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 27</xref>). The slush is created from sterile saline using an operating room slush machine that is currently available at all participating trial locations. The slush is applied by the surgeon and lightly packed around the kidney to ensure complete coverage with at least a 2‚Äâcm layer. Slush removal is performed by the surgeon 10‚Äâmin after the ice was applied. Enough slush is removed to uncover the tumour area. Surgical incision of the kidney begins as soon as the tumour area is uncovered. When reconstruction of the kidney is complete, the slush is completely removed from the surgical field and the clamps are removed from the renal vein and artery.</p>

In general, the renal capsule is scored with electrocautery delineating the parenchymal entry around the tumour. Using sharp dissection, the tumour is excised. A frozen section of the resection bed is not required. If the renal collecting system is entered, it is repaired using fine absorbable sutures. Grossly incised blood vessels are suture ligated and argon laser coagulation or electrocautery can be used to coagulate small vessels of the resection bed. Haemostatic agents may be applied, and the renal defect is repaired using oxidised cellulose bolsters and absorbable sutures.</p>

                  <p>In this study, compliance refers only to receiving the study intervention administered during the intraoperative period. We classify patients as being fully compliant if 10‚Äâmin of renal hypothermia is administered, partially compliant if the patient is exposed to renal hypothermia for less than 10‚Äâmin and non-compliant if the patient does not receive any planned renal hypothermia. Reasons for partial and non-compliance may stem from complications or death precluding the use of renal hypothermia. We expect partial/non-compliance to be less than 5% and therefore unlikely to influence the results. However, a secondary analysis will be performed to examine the influence of compliance on treatment effects through a per-protocol analysis. Any partial or non-compliance is captured in protocol deviation or protocol violation forms.</p>

                <p>An independent trained monitor performs all study monitoring at all participating sites. The monitor is trained on ICH-GCP, Tri-Council Policy Statement 2: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, study protocol, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and study specific procedures.</p>

                  <p>The trial data, compliance and adverse events are rigorously monitored using both remote and on-site methods of surveillance. This ensures that trial-related data are accurate, complete and verifiable from source documents and that participant rights and safety are protected. The monitor verifies compliance with the regulatory requirements, protocol, GCP, study-specific procedures and participant eligibility. In addition to evaluating the reported data for accuracy and completeness, the monitor identifies any trends in data that may be indicative of insufficient documentation or protocol deviations. Discrepancies noted in the data are recorded and the site is informed of all observations in the subsequent monitoring report.</p>
                  <p>The site monitor addresses deficiencies to the appropriate study team member in order to implement corrective actions or to recommend follow-up procedures. All observations noted during the monitoring visit appear in the monitoring report. The monitor assesses study files and documentation against ICH-GCP, regulatory requirements, protocol, OHRI SOPs and any study-specific SOPs.</p>

                  <p>To ensure patient safety and data integrity, regular remote monitoring visits are performed for each study site. If remote monitoring shows discrepancies in data or lack of compliance with regulations, or if requested by the DSMB or the site Investigator, on-site monitoring is performed. The study monitor assesses: CRF source data verification (SDV), patient eligibility and consent, study-specific SOPs, delegation logs, SAEs for recording and reporting completeness, regulatory documentation (for site and/or sponsor), training documents, protocol defined endpoints, essential document maintenance, deviation/violation recording and reporting, drug accountability, privacy considerations, and any protocol-specific procedures.</p>
                  <p>For remote monitoring, de-identified data from each site are sent to the monitor via secured courier. All data to be couriered are checked by the site coordinator prior to sending to ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality are maintained. No identifying materials are sent off-site. Documentation sent to the monitor for remote SDV includes: copies of signed and dated de-identified laboratory assessments, copies of signed and dated de-identified patient assessment forms (CRFs) with corresponding de-identified source documents, copies of de-identified source documentation that supports subjects eligibility to be enrolled into the study, copies of de-identified Investigator progress notes regarding patient-related decisions, signed and dated training logs as well as copies of materials used to train study staff (slide presentations, handouts).</p>

              <p>At the completion of the trial, we will better understand the benefits and risks of renal hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy. Specifically, we will know if renal hypothermia results in improved renal function at 12 months postoperative among patients undergoing open partial nephrectomy. Given that there are few exclusion criteria and multi-institutional involvement, we expect our findings to have broad generalisability. As this is the first randomised trial evaluating the use of renal hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy, the findings may have an immediate impact on patient care. If the study is negative, we can avoid the unnecessary use of renal hypothermia. If the study reveals a benefit of renal hypothermia, we will change our standard of practice regarding open partial nephrectomy procedures. A positive trial would also have a profound impact on laparoscopic partial nephrectomy as minimally invasive methods to achieve renal hypothermia have not been established.</p>
