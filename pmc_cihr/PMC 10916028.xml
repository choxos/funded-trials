                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">A patient-centered, human-rights based approach to maternal care moves past merely reducing maternal mortality and morbidity, towards achieving a positive pregnancy experience. When evaluating an intervention, particularly in the context of the complex challenges facing maternal care in South Africa, it is therefore important to understand how intervention components are experienced by women. We aimed to qualitatively explore (i) factors influencing the pregnancy and postpartum experience amongst young women in Soweto, South Africa, and (ii) the influence of <italic>Bukhali</italic>, a preconception, pregnancy, and early childhood intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs), on these experiences.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 purposively sampled participants. Participants were 18â28-year-old women who (i) were enrolled in the intervention arm of the <italic>Bukhali</italic> randomized controlled trial; (ii) were pregnant and delivered a child while being enrolled in the trial; and (iii) had at least one previous pregnancy prior to participation in the trial. Thematic analysis, informed by the positive pregnancy experiences framework and drawing on a codebook analysis approach, was used.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The themes influencing participantsâ pregnancy experiences (aim 1) were participantsâ feelings about being pregnant, the responsibilities of motherhood, physical and mental health challenges, unstable social support and traumatic experiences, and the pressures of socioeconomic circumstances. In terms of how support, information, and care practices influenced these factors (aim 2), four themes were generated: acceptance and mother/child bonding, growing and adapting in their role as mothers, receiving tools for their health, and having ways to cope in difficult circumstances. These processes were found to be complementary and closely linked to participant context and needs.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Our findings suggest that, among women aged 18â28, a CHW-delivered intervention combining support, information, and care practices has the potential to positively influence womenâs pregnancy experience in South Africa. In particular, emotional support and relevant information were key to better meeting participant needs. These findings can help define critical elements of CHW roles in maternal care and highlight the importance of patient-centred solutions to challenges within antenatal care.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">Maternal mortality is an important metric for determining progress in maternal care, as illustrated by Sustainable Development Goal target 3.1 which aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In South Africa, maternal mortality has declined steadily since 2012, as exemplified by the maternal mortality in-facility ratio, estimated at 144.9 versus 88.0 per 100,000 live births in 2012 and 2020, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite this, rates remain high compared to high-income countries, and evidence suggests that progress is hampered by socioeconomic inequalities and access to healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Against this background, the importance of moving beyond merely aiming for reductions in mortality and morbidity, towards a positive pregnancy experience, is increasingly acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">The 2016 World Health Organisation (WHO) ârecommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experienceâ suggests a more woman-centred, human-rights based approach to maternal care, enabling populations to reach their full potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The concept of a positive pregnancy experience was defined based on a qualitative review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] that aimed to determine what is of importance to women in pregnancy care. This review identified care practices, support, and information as three equally critical elements of antenatal care. The four main factors identified as defining a positive pregnancy experience were âmaintaining physical and sociocultural normalityâ, âmaintaining a healthy pregnancy for mother and baby â including preventing and treating risks, illness, and deathâ, âhaving an effective transition to positive labour and birthâ, and âachieving positive motherhood â including maternal self-esteem, competence, and autonomyâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, 2021 WHO guidelines highlight the importance of a positive postpartum experience, by adapting to changes and maintaining or regaining health for themselves and their baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In achieving these aims, and in the realm of maternal and child health more generally, the role of community health workers (CHWs) is promising, although it has been found to be dependent on context, resources, and training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Centring pregnancy and postpartum experiences within maternal care highlights the need for data on and indicators of womenâs experiences, that extend beyond, for example, the number of visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By extension, such insight is also needed when evaluating interventions. This is particularly valuable in the context of the challenges facing maternal care in South Africa, including the convergence of communicable and infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], high rates of unintended pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], socioeconomic inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and gender-based violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of a preconception, pregnancy, and early childhood intervention, <italic>Bukhali,</italic> on participantsâ pregnancy and postpartum experiences in Soweto, South Africa. <italic>Bukhali</italic> is a randomised controlled trial evaluating a CHW-delivered intervention aimed at improving young womenâs physical and mental health, nutrition, and health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Taking a life-course approach, the intervention provides continuity of care through multiple phases, including from pregnancy to postpartum. Although the socioeconomic milieu is increasingly varied, young women living in Soweto are faced with several structural and social challenges. These include experiencing traumatic events, gender-based violence, unemployment, food insecurity, mental health challenges, and limited health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There is also a high rate of unintended pregnancies in this setting, with the 2019 South African National Antenatal HIV Sentinel Survey finding that 56.5% of pregnancies amongst women aged 20â24 years old were unintended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].Since participants are included regardless of parity, the trial provides an additional opportunity to reflect on previous pregnancies relative to the index pregnancy (during which the <italic>Bukhali</italic> intervention was received).</p>
              <p id="Par19">Evaluating the trial using qualitative methods helps to provide more in-depth, woman-centred understanding of participantsâ perceptions of context and trial processes. Specifically, we qualitatively explored (i) factors influencing the pregnancy and postpartum experience amongst young South African women, and (ii) the influence of trial-based support, information, and care practices on these factors during a second pregnancy.</p>

                <title>Study design, setting, and population</title>
                <p id="Par20">This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore young womenâs pregnancy experiences. The included women were participants enrolled in the intervention arm of the <italic>Bukhali</italic> trial in South Africa, which forms part of the global Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI) (Trial registration with the PAN African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR201903750173871, Registered 27/03/2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The trial is being conducted in the urban setting of Soweto, close to Johannesburg.</p>
                <p id="Par21">For <italic>Bukhali,</italic> community-based recruitment was conducted. Eligible women were aged 18â28 and living in Soweto, and were enrolled after giving informed consent. Participants were subsequently blinded and allocated to the control or intervention arm of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Briefly, the <italic>Bukhali</italic> intervention, designed to improve nutrition, physical health, and mental health in young South African women, is delivered by CHWs, known as âHealth Helpersâ (HHs). The intervention consists of four main components: individual sessions with the HH using Healthy Conversation Skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and trauma-informed care to support behaviour change; health literacy resource material; multi-micronutrient supplementation; and care services including health screening (for conditions such as high blood pressure (BP), obesity, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and, in the preconception phase, pregnancy screening). During pregnancy, this component also includes an ultrasound scan performed by a trained radiographer. These components and the CHW-approach are outlined in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], reproduced with permission). Although the main outcome of the trial is offspring obesity at five years old, a phased approach is used to explore specified outcomes following each phase of the trial (preconception, pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood). <italic>Bukhali</italic> was designed to align with current conditions in the South African public healthcare sector; the intervention components, including during pregnancy, are aimed at enhancing existing primary health care practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">We used purposive sampling of intervention-arm participants who had attended at least two sessions of the pregnancy phase, had completed the pregnancy phase (given birth), had given birth to a live child no more than 12 months previously, and had carried a previous pregnancy to term prior to participation in the trial. These participants were invited to participate in an in-depth interview regarding their pregnancy experiences, and contact attempts for data collection continued until the study had produced enough data and insights to meet the objectives of the study (<italic>n</italic>â=â15). To achieve these 15 interviews, contact was initially attempted with 22 participants; three were not available to attend the appointment due to lack of time or not currently being in Soweto, and four were not contactable.</p>

                <p id="Par23">Individual in-depth interviews were conducted in-person at the <italic>Bukhali</italic> study site. Interviews were conducted by researchers trained in qualitative data collection (MM), with a qualitatively trained colleague taking notes (please also see the COREQ Checklist included as Supplementary File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Both researchers were female, familiar with the trial and the local context, and able to converse in the participantsâ home languages in addition to English. The interview was conducted using a semi-structured interview guide developed by the co-authors a priori. The topics covered by the interview guide included the following: (i) information about the pregnancy and how old the baby is now; (ii) their overall experience of the pregnancy, their baby, and with <italic>Bukhali</italic>; (iii) how this pregnancy compared to their previous pregnancy, including comparison to standard care, their perceptions of pregnancy and motherhood, their knowledge, and health behaviours; and (v) their motivation to stay in the trial following the pregnancy. Observations and reflections about the interview were recorded as complementary notes, and all interviews were audio-recorded and subsequently transcribed <italic>verbatim</italic> and translated into English where necessary, by a third-party provider.</p>

                <title>Qualitative analysis</title>
                <p id="Par24">Thematic analysis was used, following the 6-phase approach outlined by Braun and Clarke for reflexive thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, our methods drew on a codebook approach for thematic analysis, as this approach lends itself to the more applied, exploratory aims of this process evaluation-based study. Following familiarisation with the transcripts and field notes, LS led the development of the coding framework based on the first three transcripts, using MAXQDA version 2020 (VERBI GmbH, Berlin). During next steps of the analysis (coding, generating initial themes, developing and reviewing themes), this initial coding framework and the preliminary themes generated were discussed and modified, where required, using a âcritical friendâ approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This included LS, KM, MM, and NN each coding the same transcript, followed by discussion, and, subsequently, the remaining transcripts being split among these same co-authors, and then merged, incorporating any additional modifications, followed by refining of the themes and writing-up of the findings by LS.</p>
                <p id="Par25">For the first objective (identifying factors influencing the participantsâ pregnancy experiences, described in "<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Aim 1: Factors influencing pregnancy experience</xref>" section of the results), the analysis approach was more descriptive, or closer to the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. An inductive approach was used to provide the flexibility to reflect these findings as participants described them and as they pertain specifically to our context. We therefore chose not to retrospectively fit these generated themes onto the four defined components of a positive pregnancy experience previouslyÂ outlined by Downe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">For the second objective (exploring in what way intervention components influence participantsâ pregnancy experiences, described in "<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Aim 2: Trial components influencing pregnancy experiences</xref>" section ofÂ the results), the more interpretive analysis approach was informed by the concept of a positive pregnancy experience and the three related pillars of care (support, information, and care practices), as described in the 2016 WHO guidance on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The ability to investigate processes (or mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) in an in-depth way is considered one of the strengths of qualitative methods whenÂ exploring potential causality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The intervention components of âsupportâ, âinformationâ and âcare practicesâ served as a conceptual framework for understanding the themes (processes through which these components influence pregnancy experiences), which were developed inductively.</p>

                  <p id="Par29">None of the participants described their pregnancies as being planned. Participants described feelings of shock, fear, and disappointment upon finding out about their second pregnancy. These feelings seemed to be attributable in part to participants and their families perceiving the pregnancy as negatively impacting their future prospects in terms of education and job opportunities. However, some described mixed feelings, feeling happiness and acceptance about the pregnancy despite the initial shock. Such mixed feelings seemed in part related to the reaction from their social network. Participants described fear of telling their family members about the pregnancy. Some participants additionally expressed frustration and disappointment over the sense that this was their second pregnancy. During the current pregnancy, a few participants reported that they considered opting for a termination of pregnancy, but ultimately decided to proceed with the pregnancy.

In reporting on how they felt during pregnancy, participants often combined their descriptions of physical and socioemotional or mental health challenges, indicating their inter-related nature.

The degree of support, and from whom it came, tended to vary significantly between their first and second pregnancies, and even over the duration of the pregnancy. These variations could be attributed to changes in the participantsâ circumstances, including the children having different fathers, experiencing loss and illness of family members, negative family response to the disclosure of either the first or second pregnancy, and frequent mobility between different households. Therefore, some participants experienced more social support in the first pregnancy, while others experienced more support in the second pregnancy, for example because of a new partner who was more involved. These findings seem to indicate a degree of instability and changeability in the participantsâ support system and circumstances.</p>

On the other hand, some participantsâ experiences were characterised by relationship problems or a lack of support from family or the father of the child. Notably, a number of participants also mentioned that they had no friends, with some indicating that their pregnancies negatively impacted friendships. Lastly, participants described experiencing social stressors and traumatic experiences. These included domestic violence, being forced to leave their home, and the deaths of important people in their lives, including to suicide. One participant implied, rather than explicitly stating, experiencing gender-based violence, contributing to a suicide attempt during the pregnancy.

Aspects of this included being unemployed (and difficulty finding employment), being financially dependent on others, and not having their own place to live. For some participants, this resulted in not being the primary caregiver for (one of) their children. At the same time, as mentioned inÂ the section "<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Unstable social support and traumatic experiences</xref>", becoming pregnant and having children was also felt to impact educational and employment opportunities. These circumstances during pregnancy were experienced as being âtoughâ and âdifficult.â

However, there was a notable overlap between the components and the themes to which they were relevant. The processes by which these pillars impact the pregnancy experience can be categorised into four main themes, namely: acceptance and mother/child bonding; growing and adapting in their role as a mother; receiving tools for their health; and having ways to cope in difficult situations, as described in more detail below.</p>

                  <p id="Par71">Participants described a number of ways in which trial-based support impacted their pregnancy experiences. Firstly, participants indicated that receiving support, in the form of emotional support (having someone to talk to), advice, and providing guidance on coping skills seemed to help them to come to terms with their unintended pregnancies (see also TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for overview).</p>

              <p id="Par125">This study identifies ways in which young Sowetan women experience the impact of a CHW-delivered intervention during their pregnancy and postpartum period. The main factors identified as contributing to participantsâ pregnancy experience were their feelings about being pregnant, the responsibilities of motherhood, physical and mental health challenges, unstable social support and traumatic experiences, and the pressures of socioeconomic circumstances. The study also highlights that trial components (support, information, and care practices) mitigated these factors through processes that facilitated âacceptance and mother/child bondingâ, âgrowing and adapting in their role as mothersâ, âreceiving tools for their healthâ, and âhaving ways to cope in difficult circumstancesâ.</p>
              <p id="Par126">Relevant and timely information, psychosocial and emotional support, and effective care practices have been identified as key components of antenatal care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our results support their importance as three equal and complementary pillars of care, from the participantsâ perspective. In fact, our results highlight that, from the participantsâ perspective, the care provided by CHWs seems to be most effective when it is holistic rather than purely clinical, as has been previously suggested in ethnographic work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This is highlighted by CHW's reported ability to help participants through processes involving psychosocial wellbeing (theme: âhaving ways to cope with difficult situationsâ) and parenthood (theme: âgrow and adapt in their role as a motherâ). The particular emphasis on the importance of information in our study likely reflects a previously identified knowledge gap around pregnancy and reproductive health among young South African women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, participantsâ emphasis on HH/CHW emotional support, trust, and mentorship, which aligns with other qualitative work around participantsâ experiences of <italic>Bukhali</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], indicates that these support elements may be key for effective receipt and use of information by participants.</p>
              <p id="Par127">Participant and local context are central to the identified ways in which the intervention influenced womenâs pregnancy experiences, as is in line with the UK Medical Research Council (UKMRC) process evaluation frameworkâs emphasis on context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As such, the theme âacceptance and mother/child bondingâ was particularly relevant due to the unplanned nature of participantsâ pregnancies, fear of telling their families about their pregnancy, and their often-unstable socioeconomic circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A better and more dynamic understanding of womenâs attitudes towards their pregnancies, as opposed to simply labelling them as âunintendedâ or unplanned, would help identify what role CHWs can play in supporting women within their social and structural realities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This could include delivering preconception care information for future pregnancies to ultimately help improve participantsâ autonomy in their reproductive decisions.</p>
              <p id="Par128">As part of their antenatal experience, participants also raised a number of unmet needs and gaps within current antenatal care. These included, for example, feeling rushed and judged during visits, lack of health provider continuity, long waiting times, and not receiving explanation or information. This aligns with previously identified challenges within antenatal care in South Africa that continue to form a barrier to maternal health, despite the provision of free public antenatal care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although the multidimensionality and complexity of these challenges will not be solved through any single approach, our results suggest that a CHW-delivered intervention such as <italic>Bukhali</italic> has potential to complement ANC services to better meet womenâs needs. These findings, amidst an ongoing trial, require further research, including into the interventionsâ integration and sustainability within existing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The outcomes of the randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will additionally provide insights into the extent to which it impacts maternal and child health outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par129">Our results also brought the limits of the scope of the <italic>Bukhali</italic> intervention, and indeed most public health initiatives, into focus. For instance, while socioeconomic circumstances, such as unemployment and financial dependence, were identified as impacting pregnancy experiences, addressing these directly falls outside the scope of the intervention. While CHW support could help women navigate such circumstances, this raises the importance of defining the (scope of the) CHW role in different settings. Similarly, intervention aspects such as the medical management of identified health issues, rely heavily on the existing health system. These considerations highlight the need for cross-disciplinary, structural support for pregnant women, alongside health interventions, which could perhaps be seen as an additional, non-clinical pillar of care that is important to the pregnancy experience in contexts such as Soweto.</p>
              <p id="Par130">This study had a number of limitations. The timing of the interviews, between 2â11 months postpartum, allowed for participants to reflect upon the entirety of the pregnancy and immediate postpartum experiences, but participants recalled their pregnancy experiences through a postpartum lens, which may have impacted their responses. Exploration of participant experiences at different stages of pregnancy could provide additional insights. In addition, the impact of the intervention on participantsâ most recent pregnancy would have been difficult to tease out from changes attributable to it being their second as opposed to first pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Lastly, the study formed part of a directed and applied process evaluation of the <italic>Bukhali</italic> trial, employing both descriptive (e.g. identified factors impacting pregnancy, which remain close to the data) as well as more explanatory, interpretive but still directed analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. While this is not necessarily a limitation, since the method provides insights relevant for the questions posed, it does result in less room for entirely open, interpretive qualitative analysis, which might complement our methods in exploring the complexity of pregnancy experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par131">In conclusion, our results suggest that a CHW-delivered intervention combining support, information, and care practices has the potential to positively influence womenâs pregnancy experience in South Africa. This impact is driven by interrelated processes that are closely tied to participant circumstances, priorities, and needs. The intervention particularly seemed to meet a need for emotional support and relevant information, which impacted participants in sometimes unanticipated ways, such as through acceptance of their (unintended) pregnancy. Understanding the ways in which key intervention ingredients are actually experienced by women, and in what way they are perceived to drive positive impacts, can therefore help redefine CHW program priorities and CHW roles in maternal care, to contribute to a positive pregnancy experience more effectively. In settings such as South Africa, with existing barriers to antenatal care, an overburdened health system, and socioeconomic inequalities, the identified pregnancy experiences also highlight the need for cross-disciplinary, patient-centred solutions for improving pregnancy experiences and potentially delivery outcomes.</p>
