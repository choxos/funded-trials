                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Concerns unique to women with breast cancer can include impact of cancer on body image, sexual well-being and changes in breast appearance and sensation. These important issues are not captured by the existing generic preference-based measures (PBMs) and no breast cancer-specific PBM currently exists. This Phase 1 protocol describes a mixed-methods study to develop and validate the descriptive health state classification system for a breast cancer-specific PBM, called the BREAST-Q Utility module.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A heterogeneous sample of women aged 18 years and older diagnosed with breast cancer who are undergoing or have had treatment for breast cancer will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews. Participants will be asked to describe impact of their diagnosis and treatment(s) on their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded using a line-by-line approach. At the end of each interview, based on each participant’s cancer treatment history, patients will complete the mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy or reconstruction module of BREAST-Q, with modified 5-point Likert scale to measure importance of the BREAST-Q concepts. Both sources of data will be analysed to identify the most important HRQOL concerns.</p>
                  <p>A conceptual framework and item pool will be developed from the qualitative dataset. Preliminary version of the BREAST-Q Utility module will be created and refined at an in-person meeting of multidisciplinary experts. Content validity of the Utility module will be examined (cognitive debriefing, expert feedback). Psychometric properties of Utility module will be evaluated in a large sample of women with breast cancer.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Annual spending on cancer care in the USA has exceeded US$125 billion and is expected to increase exponentially.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Breast cancer was responsible for the largest share of cancer-related spending (13%) in 2010.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Past data demonstrate that the rate of growth in spending for breast cancer has exceeded that observed for lung, colorectal or prostate cancer.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The survival rate for breast cancer varies by stage of breast cancer and treatments received. Non-invasive (stage 0) and early-stage invasive breast cancer (stages I and II) have higher survival rates than later stage cancers (stages III and IV).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For early-stage breast cancer, the median survival can be many years, if not decades. As survival increases, healthcare resource consumption and costs associated with breast cancer can accrue years after diagnosis.</p>
              <p>Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are used to identify the optimal allocation of healthcare resources and set funding priorities.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref> In CEA, the costs and outcomes of a new intervention (eg, diagnostic or interventional, surgical or non-surgical) are compared with the costs and outcomes of an alternate, usually standard, intervention for the same health condition.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> The incremental outcome of the new health intervention in CEA is described in terms of gains in quantity (ie, life expectancy) or quality of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The measure that combines these attributes (ie, quality and quantity of life) into a single index is called quality-adjusted life year (QALY). A QALY is the most commonly used metric in CEA and is defined as the value of living 1 year in full or perfect health.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Several approaches exist for estimating the ‘Q’ (ie, health-related quality of life (HRQOL)) in the QALY, namely, rating scales, time trade-off, standard gamble or generic preference-based measures (PBMs), such as the EuroQol-5-dimension, Short Form-6-dimension or Health Utilities Index Mark 3. The use of generic PBMs is recommended by health agencies in Australia (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Canada (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health),<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> UK for England and Wales (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence),<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Scotland (Scottish Medicines Consortium)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and other countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Generic PBMs are intended to be applicable to all interventions and patient groups allowing for intrapopulation and interpopulation comparisons. However, for conditions such as breast cancer, most existing generic PBMs fail to capture the unique concerns of patients, such as body image and sexual well-being.</p>
              <p>A systematic review of studies of breast cancer interventions published between 2005 and 2017 identified no breast cancer-specific PBM.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our programme of research addresses this gap by developing a condition-specific PBM for breast cancer. The development of this PBM will occur in two consecutive phases: phase 1—development and validation of a breast cancer-specific health state classification system (HSCS) and phase 2—valuation survey and modelling to produce values for health states described by the HSCS. An overview of the components of each phase is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. This protocol describes the phase 1 mixed-methods study to develop and validate the HSCS for the breast cancer-specific PBM. This breast cancer-specific PBM will form a new module of the BREAST-Q (hereby referred to as the BREAST-Q Utility module).</p>

              <title>Methods and analysis</title>
              <p>The first phase of developing a PBM instrument is to develop a descriptive HSCS (also called ‘measurement system’ or ‘descriptive system’). An HSCS consists of several dimensions (or attributes), where each dimension refers to an aspect of HRQOL (eg, appearance, physical symptoms, social function).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In a PBM, the number of dimensions is typically limited to 7±2, with each dimension usually measured by one item. The limited number of dimensions in a PBM makes it amenable to valuation using methods such as standard gamble, time-trade off or discrete choice experiments.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The valuation exercise (phase 2) is used to develop the preference weights that are needed for generating health utilities.</p>
              <p>There are two main approaches to developing a HSCS: the top-down approach, where existing literature, instruments and surveys are used to generate an item pool which is then reduced by classical test theory or item response theory; and bottom-up approach, where qualitative methods are used to identify dimensions based on patient input. The bottom-up approach will be used in this study. This approach is endorsed by the USA Food and Drug Administration in the development of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as patient perspective is considered to be of paramount importance.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
              <p>An interpretive descriptive qualitative study will be conducted. Interpretive description is an inductive, analytical approach that assumes prior clinical knowledge of a health event or phenomenon being studied.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This approach allows for an in-depth and systematic description of a health event or phenomenon to be explored in the context of clinical knowledge and expertise to inform and guide future practice and research.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref>

                <title>Establishing the construct being measured</title>
                <p>We will start with the conceptual framework of patient satisfaction and HRQOL in breast surgery that informed the development of the BREAST-Q.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The BREAST-Q is a PROM comprised of independently functioning scales that measure outcomes and patient’s experience of care (ie, satisfaction with the surgeon, information and medical team).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The BREAST-Q has become the gold-standard measure of HRQOL for breast surgery and has three breast cancer surgery modules—mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy and reconstruction. The BREAST-Q conceptual framework, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, consists of two overarching domains: HRQOL and satisfaction with outcome. The HRQOL domain consists of three subdomains: physical, psychosocial and sexual well-being. The satisfaction with outcome domain also consists of three subdomains: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction with overall outcome and satisfaction with care. This framework was developed from patient interviews (n=48) and refined from patient input obtained in focus groups (n=58), cognitive debriefing interviews (n=30) and from expert feedback (n=17). As such, the BREAST-Q is grounded in the patient’s voice and experiences.</p>

                <p>Health technology assessments and health policy decisions are focused on the health benefit gained from an intervention. Therefore, for a PBM to be used in QALY calculations and subsequently in CEAs, it should be able to describe and assess the health or HRQOL gain from an intervention(s). Hence, the BREAST-Q Utility module will be designed to measure the impact of breast cancer or its intervention(s) on the HRQOL of women with a diagnosis of breast cancer.</p>

                  <p>A heterogeneous sample of women with a diagnosis of breast cancer aged 18 years or older will be recruited from two breast cancer centres in Ontario, Canada (Juravinski Cancer Centre, Hamilton and Toronto General Hospital (TGH), Toronto) and one in the USA (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York). Women undergoing diagnostic or prophylactic interventions for breast cancer or women who are unable to participate due to language barriers, cognitive or neurological deficit will be excluded from this study.</p>
                  <p>Potential study participants will be approached to participate in the study at the hospital during their clinical visit or via telephone call by a member of the clinical team within their circle of care. Patients will be provided with the study information sheet (in-person or email). After the patient has had time to review the information sheet and ask study-specific questions, their contact information will be shared with a member of the research team. Potential participants will be contacted to describe the study further and to set up a time and preferred place for the interview.

                  <p>We will aim to recruit a maximum variation sample<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> of women who vary by age, pathological stage of breast cancer (stages 0–4) and type and stage of surgical (ie, mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy or reconstruction) or non-surgical (ie, adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy) breast cancer treatment. Recruitment will continue until the investigators determine that sufficient data to understand the experiences of women diagnosed with breast cancer has been obtained. According to Thorne <italic>et al</italic>, in interpretive description, data saturation is not the desired outcome and can be ‘problematic’.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This is because theoretically the experiences of patients can represent an infinite number of variations.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Hence, the focus in interpretive description is on obtaining a deeper and richer understanding of the patient’s perspective while recognizing that outliers may exist. For this study, we established a stopping criterion for data saturation as the point at which redundancy is achieved in the domains at the level of minor themes (ie, no new information is obtained). This approach is in line with the PROM development methodology.</p>

We will also include specific participant (eg, age, country), clinical and treatment characteristics in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Constant comparison of codes will be used to refine and finalise the codes, that is, codes that have common elements will be merged to form minor themes (eg, codes about intensity, frequency, type, location and impact of pain be coded in a ‘pain’ category). The minor themes with common elements will be combined to form major themes (eg, pain, swelling and bruising will be grouped under ‘symptoms’). The related major themes will be combined to form the top-level domain (eg, symptoms and physical function will be grouped under ‘physical well-being’ domain). The interview guide and codebook will be revised throughout the study as new concepts emerge. Regular team meetings will be held to review changes to the codebook. The item pool developed from the codes will be analysed to identify concepts of importance across patient, clinical and treatment characteristics. The quantitative data on the BREAST-Q item ratings of importance will be analysed descriptively using SPSS, V.25.0 (IBM Corporation for Windows/Apple Mac). Subgroup analyses using analysis of variance tests or equivalent non-parametric tests will be conducted to explore if the differences in item ratings differ by patient demographics (eg, age), clinical (eg, stage of breast cancer) or treatment (eg, type of treatment) characteristics.</p>
                  <p>The item pool will be used to draft the HSCS that contains concepts that are common across surgical and non-surgical breast cancer treatments. We will retain the language used by the participants in the wording of the items and response options. We will ensure that the item and response options are worded clearly, are easy to understand, relevant and appropriate to grade 6 reading level. Double-barreled, negatively worded or vague quantifiers will be avoided. Decisions regarding the type (eg, frequency or severity) and the number of response options to include will be guided by how the concepts are described in the qualitative data.</p>

                  <p>To enhance credibility, several techniques will be used as follows: (a) use of audio recording and verbatim transcription by a professional transcriptionist: this will ensure errors in transcription; (b) pilot coding: the first 10 interviews (or as many as necessary) will be coded independently by two members of the research team who have experience in qualitative data analysis. The two coders will meet to review their codes, establish consensus on the definition of codes and to create a codebook. Once consistency in coding is achieved, the remaining interviews will be coded by one team member; (c) ongoing feedback: the transcribed interviews will be reviewed by a senior team member (AK) who will provide feedback on maintaining or improving quality of data collection by improving questions, altering probes or providing strategies to pursue specific aspects in greater detail; (d) member checking: the concepts elicited during the interviews will be confirmed in subsequent interviews by the interviewer; (e) debriefing: the results of the data analysis will be discussed with team members routinely via teleconference and triangulation: the conceptual framework, qualitative and quantitative data and review of the literature will be used to develop the HSCS for the Utility module.</p>

              <p>Our patient-centred approach engages women with breast cancer and healthcare providers in all stages of our research as experts and research team members. The use of qualitative methods ensures that the issues most important to women with breast cancer are included in the BREAST-Q Utility module. Ongoing engagement of patients in this research is ensured by inviting women who participated in the initial interviews to take part in scale refinement interviews to ensure that the Utility module is easy is understand, relevant and comprehendible.

              <p>The patients will be invited to participate by a member of the clinical team, but the consent will be obtained by the research coordinator to ensure there is no coercion to participation. Participation in this research is voluntary. As no intervention will be provided in the course of the study, there is no direct risk to participants. However, talking about experiences with breast cancer can evoke negative feelings and unwanted recollections. If a participant feels distressed or is determined to be at risk to self or others postinterview, they will be put in touch with a skilled therapist. Participants will be made aware that they do not need to answer any question(s) that make them uncomfortable and can choose to end the interview or withdraw from the study at any time. There is no direct benefit to the participant for participating in the study except for the opportunity to contribute to improving treatment outcomes in breast cancer research. Participants in the interviews and cognitive interviews will be given a US$50 gift card as a thank you for their time.</p>
              <p>Participants will be informed of the steps taken to protect their identity and maintain confidentiality. Any written document (eg, notes, interview transcripts, demographic forms and questionnaires) will be de-identified to ensure confidentiality. Electronic data will be stored in secure, password-protected servers and hardcopy files will be stored in a locked cabinet at the senior researcher’s office at McMaster University, Canada.</p>
              <p>The results of this study will be published in a series of articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at local, national and international conferences or meetings. Once developed, the BREAST-Q Utility module will be made available free-of-cost to non-profit users (eg, clinicians, researchers and students). Information on use, scoring and interpretation of BREAST-Q Utility module will be posted on the Q-portfolio webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.qportfolio.org">www.qportfolio.org</ext-link>).</p>
