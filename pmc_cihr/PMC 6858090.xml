                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The surviving opioid overdose with naloxone education and resuscitation (SOONER) project uses co-design and trial methods to develop and evaluate a point-of-care overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) tool. We plan to conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of our OEND tool in comparison with best available standard of care by observing participantsâ performance as a responder to a simulated overdose. Recruiting and retaining people at risk of or likely to witness opioid overdose raises scientific, logistical and bioethical challenges. A feasibility study is needed to establish the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies and acceptability of study procedures prior to launching the full trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Strategies to enhance recruitment include candidate-driven recruitment, verbal informed consent, and attractive, destigmatising materials. Adults at risk of or likely to witness opioid overdose will be recruited through an urban emergency department, inpatient and ambulatory addiction medicine service, and outpatient family practice settings. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive our OEND intervention; those in the control arm will be referred to existing OEND programme. Retention procedures include participant reminders, flexible scheduling, cash and comfort compensation, and strategies to maintain a consistent relationship between individual study staff and participants. Within 2âweeks following recruitment, participants will engage as a responder to a manikin-simulated overdose, and complete overdose knowledge and attitudes questionnaires. The primary outcome is recruitment and retention feasibility, defined as the recruitment of 28 participants within 28 days of recruitment and &lt;50% attrition at the overdose simulation. Staff and participant feedback will also be collected and considered.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Deaths from opioid overdose represent an important and expanding global epidemic.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programmes train and equip people who are likely to witness overdose to recognise these emergencies and administer essential first aid interventions including naloxone, a widely known and effective competitive opioid antagonist.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â4</xref> Policymakers and practitioners have called for expanded access to OEND programme in clinical settings or âpoint-of-care OENDâ. Point-of-care OEND would improve access to this potentially life-saving intervention, and may have a role in emergency departments, family practice, addiction medicine and other inpatient and ambulatory care settings. Although clinicians are willing to provide OEND in principle, the complexity, time requirements for training and current design of naloxone kits remain a barrier to widespread implementation. Effective tools are a prerequisite for widespread OEND implementation in a variety of ambulatory and inpatient care settings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â8</xref>
</p>
              <p>We plan to conduct a randomised control trial to assess the effectiveness of a point-of-care OEND intervention in comparison to the current standard of care in an emergency department, family medicine and addictions medicine settings, by observing participantsâ performance in a simulated overdose emergency.</p>
              <p>Conducting trials among people who use drugs or who are likely to witness overdose involves scientific, logistical, sociocultural and bioethical challenges. These challenges contribute to the persistent underevaluation of interventions to enhance the health of this population, and threats to study validity when retention rates are low.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There is also limited precedent for conducting resuscitation simulations for research participants who are patients or members of the lay public rather than healthcare trainees.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Most OEND research and programme evaluations involve uncontrolled studies and convenience sampling without active follow-up, with elevated rates of attrition.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 11</xref> The only published simulation-based study of OEND education is an uncontrolled study among 103 people recently released from prison. The study achieved 82.5% retention (85 participants) at a 1-month follow-up simulation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Before conducting a full-scale point-of-care OEND trial involving overdose simulations, a feasibility study is needed to establish the effectiveness of our planned recruitment and retention strategies and the acceptability of study procedures in local recruitment sites. A feasibility study will permit the evaluation of randomisation and data collection procedures, and create an opportunity to reconsider study design and analysis.</p>

                <p>This feasibility study is part of the larger Surviving Opioid Overdose with Naloxone Education and Resuscitation (SOONER) Project, which combines co-design, clinical trial and community engagement methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.soonerproject.ca">www.soonerproject.ca</ext-link>). The goal of the SOONER Project is to develop and evaluate an effective point-of-care OEND tool, and to reduce opioid-related stigma and inequity. The SOONER Project consists of three phases: phase I is a service design and participatory co-design initiative, where scientists, design researchers and community members cocreated a point-of-care OEND toolkit<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> which will be evaluated in subsequent phases. Phase II is the feasibility study presented in this protocol, and phase III is the subsequent randomised trial that will be developed based on the results of this feasibility study.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p>Based on our budget and timelines for the proposed randomised control trial, we determined that a minimum recruitment rate of one participant per day of active recruitment and a minimum retention rate of 50% are required for the underlying RCT to be logistically feasible and scientifically acceptable. For logistical and budgetary reasons, we prepared to operate 28 days of participant recruitment. Therefore, we plan to recruit approximately 28 participants to the feasibility study, composed of between 8 and 12 participants from each of emergency department, family medicine and addictions medicine sites. Study investigators working at each of the study sites confirmed that many more than one eligible patient candidate present to each of the recruitment sites per day. Given that both patients and visitors to the study sites are eligible for recruitment, we therefore conclude that a recruitment rate of one participant per day is a viable target.</p>
                  <p>To exclude retention rates &lt;50%, we computed a CI for the binomial distribution based on 28 participants. With a sample of 28 enrolled participants, we will be able to estimate a retention rate of 65% with a one-sided 95% CI of 14.8%:</p>

                <p>We expect our underlying study could be affected by attrition, as many participants experience unstable housing or incarceration, overdose or other health problems, may be difficult to reach by phone, and may experience stigma associated with opioid use. The recruitment and retention strategies under investigation in this feasibility study build on existing research on incentivising and improving clinical trial participation among people who use opioids.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>: study schematic, recruitment and retention strategies.)</p>

                    <p>Candidates will be identified and recruited to the study according to a uniform general procedure, with site-specific modifications according to the practice patterns and operational needs of the three different clinical settings. All patients will be given an ultra-brief information card asking (1) if they take opioids or have a friend or family member who uses opioids, and (2) if they would be interested in participating in a study concerning OEND training. The card will indicate that patients should notify any of the clinical staff if they answer âyesâ to both of these questions. The clinician or administrative staff will then notify study personnel, who will approach the candidate to determine eligibility, obtain informed consent, randomise the participant and implement the intervention.</p>
                    <p>This âcandidate-drivenâ recruitment procedure was designed to reduce recruitment biases and the stigma of study recruitment by informing all patients of the study and allowing people in clinical settings to self-identify as interested and potentially eligible for study enrolment. By distributing the informational card to all patients, this recruitment method reduces the effect of clinician biases and prejudices regarding which patients are at risk of opioid overdose because all patients are alerted to the study. Candidates may self-identify their potential eligibility in circumstances where clinicians are unaware of their eligibility. By using an information card rather than the more conventional practice of recruitment posters, patients and study candidates can be alerted to the study and discuss their interest in participating with staff discreetly, without having to point at or read a poster placed in a public area. This serves to protect confidentiality, normalise the information given to all patients, and positions patients as the initiators of the recruitment process. The candidate-driven approach is further enhanced by encouraging clinicians to discuss the study with potentially eligible patients or visitors directly.</p>

We therefore favour oral or verbal consent for this trial.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A systematic review on strategies to improve informed consent processes in trials found that having a study team member spend more time talking one-on-one with trial candidates was the most effective available way of improving research participantsâ understanding.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Informed consent will be obtained through a verbal process, assisted with a visual map of study procedures and a brief script, with ample time for participants to ask questions and discuss each phase of the study.</p>

We will collect multiple points of contact based on participant preferences, including phone numbers (for phoning and text messages), email addresses and mailing addresses. As an alternate means of contact, we will ask to collect the names of two friends, relatives, case managers, clinics, community centres or shelters with whom participants have regular contact.

                    <p>Based on advice from community representatives on the study steering committee, we developed a communication and reminder strategy to suit the participantsâ diverse needs and contexts. Many members of the target population face tenuous housing and limited financial resources, but many do have cellular phones. For many, communication by letter mail will be untimely and ineffective. Limited financial resources mean that many participants may not have daytime telephone âminutesâ and do not take incoming calls, preferring instead to communicate by text message. We emphasise the use of text message reminders, drawing on research demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of text messaging for participant retention in randomised trials.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>

Participants will be contacted by their preferred and secondary method 5, 3 and 1âday(s) before their scheduled simulation and on the morning of their simulation to confirm attendance or reschedule, with up to three attempts on each of the days of contact. In addition, consenting participants will receive a letter prior to the outcome assessment. Participants will be contacted 1âweek before the 3-month assessment via their preferred method of contact. Communication scripts will be used when contacting participants and messages will not refer to details of the study or to opioid use.</p>

              <p>The proposed study will test study procedures and the feasibility of an integrated recruitment and retention strategy for people likely to witness opioid overdose in the context of an OEND trial using a simulated opioid overdose event for outcome assessment.</p>
              <p>Published strategies to improve participant retention include the involvement of community members in study design and implementation, cash and comfort compensation for study participation, regular follow-up through multiple communications media, building trust and improving communication around trial methods, and flexible hours and scheduling for follow-up assessments.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30 34 36</xref> Attention to patient-centred, destigmatising and participatory language in research processes may also enhance participant recruitment and retention.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The integration of these elements is the primary strength of our proposed recruitment and retention strategy. Additional strengths include our use of participatory co-design methods for the development of study interventions and materials, and ongoing engagement with people with lived experience of opioid use for study implementation. Recruitment and retention for this study might be further strengthened by engaging peer workers directly in participant recruitment and retention. Although this approach has been successful in other studies with similar populations, in the context of a study designed to test the effectiveness of OEND in a broad variety of clinical settings, we felt that the introduction of peer workers would act as a cointervention and reduce the scalability of the intervention.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 43â45</xref>
</p>
              <p>Since the study is occurring in an urban population and a randomised trial, our results may not be generalisable to other settings, clinical contexts or study designs. However, if the study demonstrates feasibility, this recruitment and retention strategy will be ready for deployment in a full-scale trial, and potentially for adaptation to other settings.</p>
