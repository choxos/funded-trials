                  <p id="Par2">Local solutions to improve LTBI management were informed by a baseline evaluation of the LTBI cascade and questionnaires administered to index patients, HHCs, and health care workers at the study site in Offinso, Ghana. Solutions aimed to reduce patient costs and improve knowledge. We evaluated the impact and acceptability of the solutions. Specific objectives were to: 1) Compare the proportion of eligible HHCs completing each step in the LTBI cascade of care before and after solution implementation; 2) Compare knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) before and after solution implementation, based on responses of patients and health care workers (HCW) to structured questionnaires; 3) Evaluate patient and HCW acceptability of solutions using information obtained from these questionnaires.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Pre and Post-Solution LTBI Cascades included 58 and 125 HHCs, respectively. Before implementation, 39% of expected &lt;â5-year-old HHCs and 66% of â¥5-year-old HHCs were identified. None completed any further cascade steps. Post implementation, the proportion of eligible HHCs who completed identification, assessment, evaluation, and treatment initiation increased for HHCs &lt;â5 to 94, 100, 82, 100%, respectively, and for HHCs â¥5 to 96, 69, 67, 100%, respectively. Pre and Post-Solutions questionnaires were completed by 80 and 95 respondents, respectively. Study participants most frequently mentioned financial support and education as the solutions that supported LTBI management.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Implementation of locally selected solutions was associated with an increase in the proportion of HHCs completing all steps in the LTBI cascade. Tuberculosis programs should consider prioritizing financial support, such as payment for chest x-rays, to support LTBI cascade completion.</p>

              <p id="Par15">Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) management is a key component in the World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Household contacts (HHCs) of individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) have a high risk of developing active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent WHO guidelines recommended LTBI treatment for all HHCs diagnosed with LTBI in both low and high incidence TB countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Management of HHCs is a multistep process that begins with identification and concludes with treatment completion. This process has been referred to as the LTBI Cascade of care (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Recent systematic reviews have identified substantial patient losses at steps throughout the LTBI Cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The largest proportion of losses occurs prior to LTBI treatment initiation, but few studies have examined reasons, or evaluated solutions for these losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

              <p id="Par17">Ghana is a high incidence TB country, with an estimated incidence rate of 152 per 100,000 population in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. TB care in Ghana is provided through the Ghana National Tuberculosis Program (NTP). The 2015â2020 NTP strategic plan identified provision of isoniazid preventative treatment to high risk HHCs as a key activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is no published evaluation of the implementation of these targets in practice in Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">A multi-centre cluster randomized trial of a programmatic public health intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation in HHCs was completed in 2019 (Enhancing the Public Health Impact of LTBI Diagnosis and Treatment (ACT4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). As part of this study local stakeholders selected and implemented solutions to improve LTBI management based on local LTBI cascade and questionnaire data.</p>
              <p id="Par19">We have evaluated the impact and acceptability of the locally implemented solutions to strengthen LTBI management at the study site in Ghana. Specific objectives were to: 1) Compare the proportion of eligible HHCs completing each step in the LTBI cascade of care before and after implementation of the local solutions; 2) Compare knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) related to LTBI management before and after implementation of the solutions, based on responses of patients and health care workers (HCW) to questionnaires; 3) Evaluate patient and HCW acceptability of solutions using information obtained from these questionnaires.</p>

                  <p id="Par20">ACT4 was a pragmatic cluster randomized trial at 24 sites in 5 countries. The full protocol has been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Intervention sites received a two-phase intervention. In Phase 1, sites performed a standardized evaluation to identify and understand local gaps and barriers to LTBI care for HHCs of pulmonary TB patients. This included an evaluation of the LTBI cascade of care at each site, and questionnaires that were administered to Patients (index patients, adult HHCs, parents of child HHCs) and HCW. Site-specific solutions were then developed in consultation with local stakeholders. The solutions at the Ghana study site, summarized in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, targeted barriers related to knowledge, stigma, and patient cost. In Phase 2, sites implemented their solutions with financial support provided by the research trial.

                  <p id="Par21">For this study we used a quasi-experimental design to compare the LTBI cascade of care before (AprilâJune 2017; âPre-solutions cascadeâ) and after solution implementation (February to April 2018;âPost-solutions cascadeâ). The Cascades included all HHCs of index patients diagnosed with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB. In an earlier study conducted in Ghana, no HHC completed any LTBI cascade steps past âIdentificationâ, meaning that no HHCs were investigated, nor treated. Based on this, we calculated that the expected number of HHC identified for 6 index patients (<italic>n</italic>â=â56 HHCs) Post Solutions would provide &gt;â80% power to detect a 30% increase in Identification. Due to variability in the number of index patients identified per month, a three-month period was selected for the Pre and Post cascades to ensure an adequate sample size. Cascade data was collected for HHCs from Step 1, Identification, to Step 4, Treatment Initiation.

The specific questions within each questionnaire differed according to the group surveyed (index patients versus HHCs versus HCW). Responses to open ended questions were coded into common themes. All questionnaires were pre-tested for clarity. For the post-solutions questionnaires, shortened versions of the pre-solutions questionnaires addressing KAP were used. Open-ended questions evaluating the respondentsâ perspectives on the solutions were added (available on request from authors). The pre-solutions questionnaires were shortened to remove redundant and non-informative questions based on structured content analysis and feedback from study sites. A trained research assistant administered all questionnaires with the exception of the post-solutions questionnaire for HCW, which was self-administered. Questionnaires were administered in the participantsâ primary language (Twi). The self-administered HCW questionnaire was in English. We aimed to interview 20 persons from each of the participant groups in the pre and post-solutions questionnaires.</p>

Therefore, if at least 30% of patient respondents listed the same solution as helpful, this solution was considered to have âgoodâ acceptability. Mention of any item by at least one respondent was considered to represent âmoderateâ acceptability. The same criteria were used for HCW, with the exception that if a solution was reported as âmost helpfulâ it was judged to have âgoodâ acceptability.

              <p id="Par45">In this assessment of strategies to improve LTBI management in Ghana, the implementation of locally selected solutions was associated with large improvements in the LTBI cascade. Financial support and patient education were the most frequently reported factors that supported LTBI cascade completion.</p>
              <p id="Par46">In low and middle-income countries, the cost of chest x-ray alone can be a major financial burden on patients with TB and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this study, payment for chest x-rays was implemented as a solution to financially support HHCs. The average monthly salary prior to TB diagnosis among patients with active TB in Ghana has been estimated at approximately 300 GHC ($62 USD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At the time of the study, the local cost for one chest x-ray was 40 GHC ($10 USD). If two or three HHCs from one family require a chest x-ray for LTBI medical assessment, as is often the case, it is clear that the cost for this step alone could be a major barrier.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Several studies of HHCs have reported significant knowledge gaps surrounding TB transmission, screening measures, and infection status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The solutions at the Ghana site included education for HCW and patients. Patient education was consistently reported by HCW, and by the HHC themselves, as contributing to LTBI cascade completion.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Our study has several limitations. The lack of an external control group for comparison limits our ability to attribute the improvements in the cascade to the study solutions. However, no other changes were made to the LTBI management program during this time so the impact of other or external factors should have been minimal. Secondly, our data is limited to a single site. Sample size calculation was based only on Step 1- Identification; however, given the large improvements at all steps this likely has minimal impact on interpretation of our results. Post-solutions questionnaires were administered after some solutions had been discontinued. Therefore, some respondents may not have been exposed to all solutions, thereby limiting their assessment. Post-solutions HCW questionnaire was self-administered. This likely reduced response bias, however, some respondents misinterpreted some questions, which limited the number of informative responses. Finally, we were not able to assess possible interaction effects of different program strengthening activities and solutions on each other.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Based on our results, reducing the financial burden for HHC should be a key priority for the Ghanaian NTP. Education of the index TB patients and their HHCs should also be a priority. Finally, despite improvements in LTBI cascade completion, some gaps persisted at the study site. In order to continuously improve TB programs, repeated assessments of the LTBI cascade are needed.</p>
