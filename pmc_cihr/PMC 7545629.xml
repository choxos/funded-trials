                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV plasma viral load (pVL) to very low levels, which allows for some immune recovery. Discontinuation of ART leads to pVL rebound from reservoirs of persistence and latency, and progressive immunodeficiency. One promising but controversial strategy targeting CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against α4β7 integrin has shown promise through sustained virological remission of pVL (SVR) in SIV<sub>239</sub>-infected rhesus macaques. We propose to assess the safety and tolerability of vedolizumab, a licensed humanised mAb against human α4β7 integrin, in healthy HIV-infected adults on ART. This study will also assess, by analytical treatment interruption (ATI), whether vedolizumab treatment can induce SVR beyond ART and vedolizumab treatment.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The HIV-ART-vedolizumab-ATI (HAVARTI) trial is a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial in healthy HIV-positive adult volunteers receiving ART. Twelve consenting persons will be enrolled in sequential groups of 4 to each serial dosing vedolizumab regimen (300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg). The primary outcomes are: (1) to assess the safety and tolerability of seven serial infusions of vedolizumab at each of three doses; (2) to identify the immunovirological measures, including pVL and T-cell kinetics, that characterise HIV/ART cases before, during, after vedolizumab treatment and ATI; and (3) to seek SVR of pVL after ATI. Secondary outcomes will include immune reconstitution and pVL suppression as well as immune reconstitution and long-term safety following re-initiation of ART in the absence of SVR.</p>

                  <p>The study protocol was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network-REB and by the Health Canada Therapeutic Products Directorate. A Data Safety Monitor will review safety information at regular intervals. The final manuscript will be submitted to an open access journal within a year of study completion.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>HIV is a chronic active infection of leucocytes resulting in a progressive and profound depletion of lymphocytes, and ultimately in AIDS. Newly infected cells may undergo lytic productive infection on activation (lymphocytes) or undergo chronic productive infection (macrophages). In addition, an infected lymphocyte may remain dormant with latent, integrated HIV infection, which expands the latent reservoir of infected cells. Continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV viraemia and allows some degree of immune healing, so as to permit near-normal health and life expectancy. However, ART is not a cure for HIV infection. ART interruption is nearly always followed by rebound of plasma viral load (pVL) to the pre-treatment viraemia levels, referred to as the viral set point, followed by resumption of progressive immunodeficiency.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref></p>

                <title>Induction of post-treatment control in rhesus macaques with SIV treated by a monoclonal antibody against α4β7 integrin</title>
                <p>A promising finding of sustained virological remission of pVL (SVR) and stable CD4 cell count was reported in <italic>Science</italic> by Dr Byrareddy and colleagues in a rhesus macaque Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection model.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> SIV (and HIV) appears to preferentially infect CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes expressing α4β7 integrin, a lymphocyte homing receptor for trafficking to gut mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) that was the target of mAb therapy in this study. This anti-α4β7 mAb was administered serially every 3 weeks at 50 mg/kg for eight doses to acutely infected macaques on ART and was followed by ATI and subsequent discontinuation of mAb administration. SVR and low GALT-associated VLs for 24 months was observed in eight of eleven animals, after a low-level pVL rebound in five of the eight. In these animals, subsequent iatrogenic CD8 T-cell depletion resulted in viral rebound, indicating control but not eradication of virus (Byrareddy, unpublished). The mechanism of this post-treatment control is unknown, and later attempts to replicate this finding have been unsuccessful.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> One small human trial of vedolizumab in HIV infection did not observe SVR,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but was limited in its ability to detect post-rebound suppression. In human HIV infection, SVR over time without evidence of progressive immunodeficiency in the absence of ART would meet definitional criteria of a ‘functional cure’, where pVL suppression is maintained without ART and without eradication of virus.</p>

                <p>Humanised anti-α4β7 integrin mAb (vedolizumab, Entyvio<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>) is a licensed treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Vedolizumab has a safety record of 4811 person-years observation, in which 2830 patients received vedolizumab from one to 1977 (median 328) days, during which there was no increased risk of any infections (&lt;1% overall for tuberculosis (TB) or other serious infection), and no reported case of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), compared with placebo and standard non-biological therapy.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Modelling shows that cumulative exposure to vedolizumab still has a very low risk of PML compared with other biologics such as natalizumab that non-selectively targets α4 integrin.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>

                <title>Study rationale</title>
                <p>A human clinical trial of anti-α4β7 integrin monoclonal antibody is feasible, given that a safe humanised product is available. A pilot study to assess the translation of this intervention’s anti-HIV effects from a non-human primate model to humans is needed to inform the design of larger trials. We describe a dose-finding and exposure-finding pilot trial in healthy adults with ART-treated chronic HIV infection to assess vedolizumab safety and anti-HIV activity or SVR after ATI. This trial proposal is of a short duration (~1 year) and simple design to assess short-term safety and tolerance of vedolizumab according to dose. It will also assess whether pVL rebound and/or SVR occurs after ATI, in relation to dose, duration and systemic exposure to vedolizumab.</p>
                <p>In planning novel HIV treatment strategies, a combination of approaches will be necessary in order to address all aspects of HIV infection including the active, latent and concealed reservoirs of persistent infection. The anticipated mechanism of possible SVR with short-term vedolizumab intervention is not eradication or a virological cure, but a functional cure with immunological-maintained viral suppression in absence of ART and after withdrawal of the intervention. This trial design accommodates the collection and cryopreservation of biological specimens (sera, plasma, peripheral blood lymphocytes, rectal biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and stool) that will permit mechanistic immunological and virological studies in the event that treatment effects are seen.</p>

                <title>Rationale for dosing</title>
                <p>In the macaque model, a mAb against α4β7 integrin was used at a dose of 50 mg/kg per infusion, with infusions given every 3 weeks.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In humans, 300 mg per infusion given every 4 to 8 weeks is the highest licensed dose of vedolizumab (equivalent to 4 mg/kg/infusion in a 70 kg adult) and therefore was the highest dose used in this study protocol. A dose reduction in sequential groups will be implemented to assess for a dose-related treatment effect on pVL rebound kinetics or SVR. As compared with the existing human study by Sneller <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> our protocol provides the majority of vedolizumab doses after ATI, with only initial loading occurring before ATI. Ongoing vedolizumab exposure after treatment interruption is hypothesised to be important for the development of remission and is more in keeping with the original animal model.</p>

                <title>Primary outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcomes will be (1) the safety and tolerability of vedolizumab treatment at different doses in seven infusions as defined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and pre-specified side effects, and (2) the incidence and (3) duration of pVL remission during and after vedolizumab treatment following ATI determined by serial measurement of pVL.</p>

              <sec id="s2-3">
                <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                <p>The secondary outcomes will be (1) the incidence and (2) magnitude of pVL rebound after ATI during and after treatment with vedolizumab, (3) the success of re-suppression of pVL with ART in the event of recurrent sustained pVL, and (4) the kinetics of pVL and CD4 T lymphocyte count during the study period.</p>

                <title>Study design, settings, sample size and recruitment strategy</title>
                <p>HAVARTI is a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial of serial vedolizumab infusions for the induction of HIV SVR in adults with chronic HIV infection on ART. Twelve consenting volunteers respecting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled sequentially in groups of four to receive vedolizumab by infusion in 2-week to 4-week intervals for a total of seven doses. After three doses of vedolizumab, the participants will initiate the ATI portion of the study. During the ATI, participants will discontinue ART but continue with the four remaining scheduled vedolizumab treatments and monitoring of pVL and immunological markers. They will also have regular clinical assessment at each infusion visit. Participants will restart ART according to CD4 T-cell count and pVL threshold levels and trajectory, personal choice, or consensus judgement of the volunteer patient, treating physician and/or study investigators. Decisions to continue ATI or restart ART in the presence of CD4, pVL and clinical indicators will be reviewed by an independent expert medical monitor and reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in a timely manner.</p>
                <p>Study participants will be recruited from The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) HIV clinic and referring primary care facilities. Informed consent will be obtained from those patients who are documented to be eligible for the trial after pre-screening. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the safety laboratory tests and concomitant medication surveys to be done during screening. Individuals who wish to discuss enrolment in the trial with family, partner, friends or their treating physician may take the time and choose to enrol at a subsequent clinic visit. Once enrolled, the participant will be followed concomitantly by the principal investigator and study staff at TOH for the duration of the trial.</p>

                    <p>Overview of vedolizumab treatment intervention and analytical treatment interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART). There are three groups of 4 participants each that will be sequentially recruited. Each group will receive 7 infusions of vedolizumab, at weeks 0, 2, 5, 8, 12, 26 and 20. Group 1 will be recruited first and receive 300 mg of vedolizumab per infusion, the highest licensed dose. Group 2 and group 3 will receive 150 mg and 75 mg per infusion, respectively. Screening and baseline will take place approximately 3–6 months apart. Baseline and week 0 assessments can take place at one visit or be split into two visits (ie, the baseline rectal biopsy can take place up to 4 weeks prior to the week 0 visit (or at the same time) when the vedolizumab intervention is started. Participants will start vedolizumab at the week 0 visit, but continue on their pre-study ART regimen until week 6/7 (analytical treatment interruption, ATI). There will be four doses of vedolizumab after ATI at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 (each 4 weeks apart from each other). The participant will subsequently visit every 4 weeks until week 52 as per study visit schedule (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). ART will be re-initiated prior to week 52 if there is a sustained rebound of plasma viral load as detailed in Methods section.</p>

                <p>Threshold criteria for clinical consideration of ART re-initiation will include (1) sustained recurrence of HIV viraemia, (2) confirmed absolute CD4 count below 350 cells/µL or by more than 10% from pre-ART baseline CD4 value, or (3) development of an AIDS-defining or related illness. Following ATI, sustained recurrence of HIV viraemia will be defined by confirmation by repeat testing of (1) pVL reaching ≥0.5 log of the patient’s viraemia peak prior to ART and (2) pVL rebound extending beyond a period of 12 weeks from initial detection after ATI. If sustained viraemia is observed after ATI, ART may be re-initiated and participants monitored until pVL suppression is re-established. Study visits as per the study schedule will continue in these patients. The decision to re-initiate ART is a personal choice of the participant and non-study advisors, the trial investigators and staff, or an experienced and independent medical judgement on the aggregate of timely clinical and laboratory information at hand, with the interests of the patient primarily in mind.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The report of sustained SIV remission in rhesus macaques treated with an anti-α4β7 mAb<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> is the foundation on which the HAVARTI trial was developed. The present study will aim to determine if vedolizumab, the humanised anti-α4β7 mAb available on the Canadian market, is safe for healthy HIV-infected adults at a licensed or permitted dosage. In addition, the goal is to assess vedolizumab for SVR after ATI. Towards these goals, several design elements were taken into special consideration during the development of the HAVARTI trial, with an effort to closely follow the macaque study while keeping the safety of the participants primarily in mind.</p>
              <p>The HAVARTI trial is designed as a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial. No placebo control arm will be used because (1) this is an exploratory pilot study of a novel investigational agent; (2) pVL rebound occurs reliably after analytical or other ART interruption, and the SVR outcome of interest is not a small effect; and (3) in small trials, neither randomisation nor controls may protect from large expected biases related to biological variation. Placebo controls from an Ottawa/Montreal randomised controlled trial of therapeutic HIV vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune experienced a median time to viral rebound of ~2 weeks<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> after ATI and will be used as a historical control for comparison, among other more recent reports and studies.</p>
              <p>ATI, the intentional interruption of suppressive ART to assess an investigational product’s ability to induce virological control, remains the gold standard for investigation of novel therapies for HIV cure research.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although the SMART study conducted in the context of clinical management research showed that participants who interrupted ART were at higher risk of developing AIDS and non-AIDS events compared with those who did not interrupt ART,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> it also revealed that ATI can be done safely when the individual has suppressed plasma viraemia (pVL &lt;50 copies/mL), high current CD4 count (&gt;500 cells/µL) and high CD4 nadir (&gt;200 cells/µL), in the context of a carefully monitored trial.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 20–22</xref> Therefore, participants in the HAVARTI trial will be screened for these inclusion criteria to decrease risks associated with ART interruption in a different context. Furthermore, successful re-initiation of ART and suppression of pVL is a priority, so prospective study participants will not have a history of drug-resistant HIV, treatment-refractory pVL response or non-adherence to ART. Certain HLA phenotypes have been shown to be protective and prevent viral rebound following ATI<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and therefore HLA typing should be performed if any controller phenotypes emerge following vedolizumab treatment.</p>
              <p>The rationale behind threshold criteria and judgement for re-initiation of ART stems from the rhesus macaque model, where ATI was followed by initial rebound of SIV pVL in most animals before subsequent sustained remission was achieved.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> If vedolizumab has the same effect in HIV-infected humans, it is hypothesised that there may be a similar short-term pVL rebound prior to SVR. Re-initiation of ART at first detection of pVL rebound would prevent detection of subsequent, perhaps immunologically mediated, SVR.</p>
              <p>While the present trial is modelled on the macaque study,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> there are some notable differences in the dosing regimen. Primatised anti-α4β7 mAb has Fc-receptor avid Fc-fragment, whereas vedolizumab is a masking antibody, without Fc-receptor avidity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Macaques were infused with 50 mg/kg of α4β7 mAb; in this study, the highest vedolizumab dose is 300 mg per infusion, about 4 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans showed saturation of peripheral blood lymphocyte target receptors at doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> with robust saturation at doses of 2 mg/kg.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Vedolizumab is shown to be clinically effective for IBD at doses of 0.5–2 mg/kg,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> with 300 mg per infusion being the recommended dose for patients with IBD.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The half-life of vedolizumab is 18–25.5 days<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> versus a half-life of 11.4 days for the α4β7 mAb used in the macaque study; therefore, after initial loading of three doses over 5 weeks, the regular dosing interval is 4 weeks for this study as compared with 3 weeks in the macaque study. Finally, participants will receive seven infusions of vedolizumab instead of the eight received by macaques. In the macaque study, pVL suppression was evident by 6 weeks after ATI in all treated animals. Viral rebound occurred within 2 weeks in five of eight animals and was subsequently re-suppressed within 4 weeks.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Virological control was therefore robust throughout the remaining α4β7 mAb treatments and after its discontinuation. The number of necessary infusions is unclear; however, data from the macaque model suggest that immunological control developed early after withdrawal of ART, and that ongoing mAb therapy after viral suppression may not be necessary.</p>
              <p>Another difference between the macaque study and our participant population is the chronicity of infection prior to ART treatment and duration of suppressive ART. Macaques were infected with SIV 5 weeks before initiation of ART,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the equivalent of treatment during primary HIV infection (PHI). For the present human trial, we are recruiting participants who are chronically infected with HIV and on suppressive ART for 2–10 years. Most people living with HIV (PLWH) are not diagnosed during primary infection. Meaningful impact in HIV cure research requires interventions accessible to this majority population who have chronic HIV infection on effective ART.</p>
              <p>Design of the HAVARTI protocol aims to maximally protect study participants from developing ADA. In the macaque study, 3 of 11 animals developed antibodies against the α4β7 mAb.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, these animals were excluded from analysis and the effect of ADA on HIV treatment efficacy remains uncertain. The GEMINI trials demonstrated a 4% immunogenicity rate for patients with IBD who received continuous vedolizumab treatment, with rates of persistent positive antibody and neutralising antibodies at 0.6% and 2.3%, respectively.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> However, the immunogenicity rate was 10% when patients were off vedolizumab treatment, suggesting the rate may have been underestimated due to decreased ability to detect low to moderate ADA titres during continuous treatment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 31</xref> Since ADA development is more likely for low-level and intermittent exposure, this study is designed with short dosing intervals to avoid recurrent prolonged periods of low mAb levels.</p>
              <p>PLWH are required to take daily ART indefinitely. The SIV<sub>239</sub>-infected rhesus macaques that were functionally cured by treatment with ART and a mAb against α4β7 integrin give us hope that a similar functional cure could be possible for PLWH. This is the first study to employ a clinical trial design involving multiple dosing arms to assess safety, tolerability and best anti-HIV effect of vedolizumab in the context of chronic HIV infection. A licensed drug such as vedolizumab with a novel anti-HIV mechanism of action would be of great clinical interest in the pursuit of HIV cure.</p>
