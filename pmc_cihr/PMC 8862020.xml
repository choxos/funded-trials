                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a serious illness decision aid (Plan Well Guide) in increasing the engagement of substitute decision-makers (SDM) in advance care planning (ACP).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This trial was conducted (2017â2019) in outpatient settings in Ontario, Canada, aiming to recruit 90 dyads of patients aged 65 years and older at high risk of needing future medical decisions and their SDM. Participants were randomised to receive the intervention immediately or to a 3-month wait period. The Plan Well Guide was administered to the patient and SDM by a facilitator. Outcomes were change on the validated 17-item SDM ACP Engagement Survey (primary) and 15-item patient ACP Engagement Survey (secondary).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 136 dyads approached, 58 consented and were randomised and 45 completed the study (28 immediate intervention, 17 delayed intervention). The trial was stopped early because of difficulties with enrolling and following up participants. The mean changes on the SDM ACP Engagement Survey and the patient ACP Engagement Survey favoured the first group but were not statistically significant (mean difference (MD)=+0.2 (95% CI: â0.3 to 0.6) and MD=+0.4 (95% CI: â0.1 to 0.8), respectively). In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, significant treatment effects were seen in SDMs with a lower-than-median baseline score compared with those at or above the median.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this statistically underpowered randomised trial, differences in SDM ACP engagement between groups were small. Further information is needed to overcome recruitment challenges and to identify people most likely to benefit from the Plan Well Guide.</p>

              <title>Background rationale</title>
              <p>Many seriously ill older adults, at some point, will lack the capacity to make their own medical treatment decisions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the event that a patient becomes incapable of making medical decisions, substitute decision makers (SDM) will be approached to make decisions on the patientâs behalf. SDMs report challenges making medical decisions on behalf of loved ones due to lack of a clear understanding of their loved oneâs values and wishes, which can lead to distress.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In order for the SDM to engage in medical decision-making with the healthcare team in a way that upholds the patientâs values and previous wishes, the SDM would ideally have a greater understanding of the patientâs values and wishes.</p>
              <p>Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals and preferences regarding future medical care.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Studies have shown that previous engagement in ACP by the patient is associated with increased likelihood that a patientâs previously expressed wishes will guide medical treatment decisions,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â7</xref> increased likelihood of receiving hospice services and reduced likelihood of hospitalisation and provision of intensive treatments (according to patientsâ wishes) at the end of life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>
</p>
              <p>While ACP has clear benefits to patients and healthcare systems, studies continue to document problems with the quality or quantity of communication and decision-making during serious illness,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> suggesting that ACP has not been undertaken successfully. Patients can express preferences for the use or non-use of life-sustaining treatments, however they also report considerable decisional conflict about the preference. Furthermore, patients often hold conflicting values from a medical perspective, such as living as long as possible and also minimising invasive treatments.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is misunderstanding among the public of the benefits and harms of treatments during serious illness such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and palliative care<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and a lack of understanding of the SDM role.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These common misunderstandings that undermine successful ACP likely contribute to the decisional conflict and regret experienced by some SDM.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

              <p>The novel decision aid, (the Plan Well Guide tool; <ext-link xlink:href="www.planwellguide.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.planwellguide.com</ext-link>), was created to help patients clarify their authentic values and be truly informed about the medical treatment options in the context of serious illness. In a randomised trial of the Plan Well Guide in primary care, some aspects of decisional quality improved while reducing the physicianâs time to accomplish goals of care decisions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Although one would imagine that improved decision-making would have a positive effect on the patientâs SDM, this trial did not investigate the effect on SDMs.</p>
              <p>We conducted a randomised trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Plan Well Guide used with a patient in the presence of the patientâs SDM, in increasing the SDMâs ACP engagement behaviours. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of the Plan Well Guide to increase ACP engagement behaviours of the patient. We were also interested in feasibility of recruiting SDMs in the community for ACP research.</p>

For most participants, physicians identified the patient as potentially eligible at a visit and referred them to the research assistant on site.

SDMs were invited at the time of the clinic visit with the patient or they were contacted by the research assistant after receiving permission from the patient.</p>

                <p>Details of the Plan Well Guide slide show version used in this study (slides with voiceover) have been described previously.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A trained research nurse who had practiced the intervention in mock sessions, ran the interactive Plan Well Guide for the patient and SDM on a laptop computer and completed the structured paper-based values clarification and preference questions with the patient when prompted by the decision aid. The research nurse could assist the patient through their deliberations about the values and preferences questions and review the information from sections of the tool as needed until the patient was comfortable expressing a preference, but did not provide advice about personal medical decisions.</p>
                <p>The Plan Well Guide (1) describes the difference between serious illness and terminal care, and the significance of making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, (2) defines personal values, why these are important in decision-making and how trade-offs are sometimes required, (3) provides education about different approaches to care in hospital and the outcomes of various treatment options (resuscitative/intensive care, medical care, comfort care) in probabilistic terms with visual aids and (4) guides the patient through a values and preference elicitation process, explicitly linking values to preferences using rating scales and a grid (see <ext-link xlink:href="www.planwellguide.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.planwellguide.com</ext-link>). The grids are used to provide structured guidance to the patient helping them link their stated values to reasonable treatment preferences. If the patient indicates a preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a CPR information video is shown describing the benefits and risks of this procedure.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> If the patient feels there is discordance in the treatment preference highlighted on the grids (eg, their values regarding prolonging life and willingness to tolerate interventions are inconsistent with treatment preference aligned on the grid), the research nurse reviews the patientâs values, and which values are most important to determine if they would like any changes. The final step is to elicit a treatment preference for the use of life-sustaining treatments. A previously published taxonomy describing different levels of the use or non-use of life-sustaining treatments is used.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref>

Within each domain, questions pertain to Behaviour Change Processes on 5-point Likert scales where a score of 1 indicates the lowest level of engagement and 5 indicates the highest. Actions are based on questions of whether an ACP action such as asking someone to be an SDM or documenting wishes, was completed.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Several versions of varying lengths have been validated.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The 17-item SDM ACP Engagement Survey was created to measure the impacts of ACP tools and interventions on SDMs and elicits knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, readiness and actions with respect to the SDM role.

</p>
                <p>The primary analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat approach. For the intention-to-treat analysis, multiple imputation was used, assuming missing data followed a missing at random pattern. In total, five data sets were imputed. The pooled effect estimates in terms of MD along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Sensitivity analysis was done using the per-protocol approach.</p>
                <p>The overall scores of the SDM ACP Engagement Survey and the patient ACP Engagement Survey were calculated as the mean of all questions on the 5-point response scales for the entire survey. ACP actions were elicited within the âreadinessâ questions, which includes responses of âI have never thought about itâ; âI have thought about it but I am not ready to do itâ; âI am planning to do it in the next 6 monthsâ; âI am definitely planning to do it in the next 30 daysâ; and, âI have already done itâ. If a patient reported âI have already done itâ, they were considered to have completed that action for that behaviour.</p>

              <p>Anecdotally, the main reasons for not participating were lack of interest on the part of the patient or SDM due to the perception that ACP had already been undertaken through completion of wills, funeral plans and so on. In-person recruitment was done only on days when a research assistant could be present and when convenient for the clinic. New clinics were added over time to boost recruitment. When the research assistant began noticing the same patients returning for visits over time, they felt that recruitment had been âsaturatedâ at that site.</p>
              <p>Thirty-four dyads were randomised to the immediate intervention group and 24 to the delayed intervention group. Complete follow-up measurement was obtained for 28 (82.4%) dyads in the immediate intervention group and 17 dyads (70.8%) in the delayed intervention group. Reasons for loss to follow-up mainly related to worsening illness, and in the delayed intervention group lack of interest in completing the second baseline survey and receiving the intervention (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>The mean age of patient participants at baseline in the immediate and delayed intervention groups was 76 and 74 years, and 50% and 58% were women (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomised trial in 45 SDMs of older adult patients, enrolment was stopped early because of recruitment difficulties. Within the small data set accrued, the use of the Plan Well Guide serious illness decision aid did not result in statistically significant differences in SDM engagement in ACP behaviours compared with a control group who received usual care. Patient engagement in ACP behaviour change processes and actions also did not change more in the intervention group compared with the control group. Scores on the measures increased in both groups and our expected effect size was not achieved. In a post-hoc analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between groups for overall SDM ACP engagement and for the subscale of contemplation, among the subgroup of SDM who had a baseline below the median overall score.</p>
              <p>The Plan Well Guide encourages patients to share the values and preference elicitation exercise with their SDM. We hypothesised that the presence of the SDM while the patient works through the tool would lead to changes in behaviour change processes of the SDM including knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, readiness and actions. There may be several explanations for the lack of detectable differences, besides the underpowered statistical tests due to small sample size. Given the nature of the patient population, participants may have already had conversations about serious illness decision-making. On a contemplation question such as how often the SDM had thought about talking with their loved one about wishes, a response of three is âa few timesâ and four is âseveral timesâ. Given that most mean subscale scores on the survey were above 3.5 of a possible 5 at baseline, there may have been little room for improvement. Another explanation may be that SDMs were often present with the patient when responding to the survey and they may have been reluctant to admit lack of readiness for their role.</p>
              <p>Our study used the SDM ACP Engagement Survey as an outcome measure, and while some of the psychometric properties have been assessed, it has not been evaluated for responsiveness to the Plan Well Guide intervention. Previous studies of interventions to prepare SDM for decision-making involvement have used SDM decision-making confidence and dyad congruence on preference for use of life-sustaining treatments.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In an international consensus panel of important outcomes of ACP, deciding on and sharing values and care preferences with the SDM were voted to be among the most important outcomes.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These outcomes are upstream of actual decision-making quality such as dyad congruence. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether ACP interventions improve SDM processes of preparation for decision-making.</p>
              <p>Recruiting and retaining patients with significant health concerns and their SDM in the community through outpatient clinics was challenging. Poor health and mobility problems have been reported to be barriers to research participation in frail elderly people.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We were not able to recruit the SDM of all patients who were potentially interested. Other studies have reported similar challenges recruiting and retaining patient and SDM dyads in studies of end-of-life communication.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35â37</xref> Shields <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported that one-third of consenting patients could not be enrolled in a trial of dyads because the surrogate did not consent.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> More understanding is needed on the best way to recruit older patient and SDM dyads for ACP studies because of the importance of the SDMâs role. There were more losses to follow-up in the delayed intervention group due to worsening health and lack of interest. A shorter follow-up period should be considered for future studies in this population.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. Most notably, recruitment was lower than expected and the study was statistically underpowered. The recruitment challenges related mainly to SDMs, who were more difficult to reach and engage compared with patients. Some deviations were required from the published protocol, such as conducting the baseline measure after randomisation, to ensure participant recruitment and retention. Nevertheless, baseline measures between groups were similar, and the small magnitude of difference in outcomes suggests that there was no bias towards over-estimating effects. The Plan Well Guide has not been translated to languages other than English or adapted for varying cultures, therefore study participants may represent the typical Caucasian English-speaking population as found in many previous studies of ACP.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Models of adapting ACP tools for other populations exist<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and should be considered in the future.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this statistically underpowered trial that was stopped early, differences between groups were small, however there was a larger and statistically significant effect in SDM participants with lower baseline ACP engagement. Further information is needed to overcome recruitment challenges and to identify people most likely to benefit from the Plan Well Guide.</p>
