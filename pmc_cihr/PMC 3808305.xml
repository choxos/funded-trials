                <p>Persistent viruses are kept in check by specific lymphocytes. The clonal T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), once established following primary infection, exhibits a robust stability over time. However, the determinants contributing to this long-term persistence are still poorly characterized. Taking advantage of an <italic>in vivo</italic> clinical setting where lymphocyte homeostasis was transiently perturbed, we studied EBV antigen-specific CD8 T cells before and after non-myeloablative lympho-depleting chemotherapy of melanoma patients. Despite more advanced T cell differentiation, patients T cells showed clonal composition comparable to healthy individuals, sharing a preference for <italic>TRBV20</italic> and <italic>TRBV29</italic> gene segment usage and several co-dominant public TCR clonotypes. Moreover, our data revealed the presence of relatively few dominant EBV antigen-specific T cell clonotypes, which mostly persisted following transient lympho-depletion (TLD) and lymphocyte recovery, likely related to absence of EBV reactivation and <italic>de novo</italic> T cell priming in these patients. Interestingly, persisting clonotypes frequently co-expressed memory/homing-associated genes (<italic>CD27</italic>, <italic>IL7R</italic>, <italic>EOMES, CD62L/SELL</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>) supporting the notion that they are particularly important for long-lasting CD8 T cell responses. Nevertheless, the clonal composition of EBV-specific CD8 T cells was preserved over time with the presence of the same dominant clonotypes after non-myeloablative chemotherapy. The observed clonotype persistence demonstrates high robustness of CD8 T cell homeostasis and reconstitution.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with massive viral replication. In spite of the generation of a robust T cell specific immune response, EBV establishes a latent infection in B cells [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, healthy EBV-infected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout their life due to viral containment by antigen-specific memory CD8 T lymphocytes [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As increasing attention is devoted to optimizing therapeutic vaccination strategies against cancer, the immune control of chronic EBV infection represents an interesting model system to study the mechanisms involved in the generation and maintenance of life-long protective immune responses.</p>
              <p>The antigen-primed CD8 T cell pool is highly heterogeneous and comprises T cell subpopulations at varying degrees of cellular differentiation based on their phenotype, function and anatomic location, thus making the distinction between “effector” and “memory” cytolytic T cells challenging [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Generally, memory-like T cells display long-term survival and self-renewal abilities, high proliferative potential, and the capacity to rapidly and efficiently produce effector cells in response to antigen re-encounter [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, effector T cells have the capacity to migrate to the site of inflammation, to kill antigen-bearing target cells and secrete various cytokines (e.g. IFNγ, TNFα) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Whether memory cell responses are maintained for prolonged periods or periodically “renewed” remains a matter of debate. It is a particularly difficult question to address in humans since it requires in-depth analysis of protective immune responses over extended periods of time. In this regard, the T cell receptor (TCR) is an excellent marker that allows antigen-specific responses to be followed along T cell differentiation and over time [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thorough analyses of both viral and tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses have revealed that the antigen-specific T cell repertoire is generally composed of highly frequent (also defined as dominant) as well as less frequent (defined as non-dominant) T cell clonotypes [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Through a process known as TCR clonotype selection, certain clonotypes may become more dominant along T cell differentiation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or throughout the time course of infection [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Persistence of human virus-specific T cell clonotypes over several years has been demonstrated in humans with various viral infections: influenza [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], herpes simplex virus [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], EBV [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], cytomegalovirus (CMV) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, Klarenbeek and colleagues [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] addressed the question of whether the clonal repertoire that is established during the early phase of infections against CMV and EBV is maintained over extended periods of time. They found that immune responses were very stable, and once established did not evolve during the 5-year follow up [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While herpes virus-specific T cell responses revealed an unprecedented stability of the TCR clonotype repertoire over time following primary infection, less is known regarding their persistence during conditions of immunological stress in asymptomatic carriers.</p>
              <p>In the present study, we examined the robustness of the EBV antigen-specific responses in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting where the balance between virus and immune response may be temporarily compromised following transient lympho-depletion (TLD). Specifically, we evaluated the EBV antigen-specific CD8 T cell clonotype composition and persistence in melanoma patients who were treated with non-myeloablative chemotherapy regimen, followed by adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To quantitatively assess virus-specific T cell responses, direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> clonotypic analyses combined to gene expression profiling of individual antigen-specific T cells were performed [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The anti-viral T cell responses in patients were more differentiated compared with healthy individuals, comprising both memory and effector CD8 T cells. Dominant TCR beta-chain clonotypes, including several public TCR sequences, were found to persist with time in healthy individuals and following TLD and ACT among patients. We then studied T cell clonotypes with fluctuating frequencies following TLD and immune reconstitution, and observed that clonotypes with increased frequency carried a polyfunctional memory/homing gene expression profile (<italic>CD27</italic>, <italic>IL7R</italic>, <italic>EOMES, CD62L/SELL</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>). Altogether, our data suggest that the EBV-specific T cell repertoire persists not only under steady-state conditions but also during transient immunological perturbations.</p>

                <p>TCR spectratyping [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was used to identify all TCR clonotypes, which were classified according to the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) nomenclature proposed by Lefranc and colleagues (http://imgt.org/)[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To rapidly identify TRBV segment usage, cDNA pools of EBV antigen-specific CD8 T cells were initially subjected to individual PCR using a set of previously validated fluorescent-labeled forward primers specific for the 22 TCR <italic>BV</italic> subfamilies and one unlabeled reverse primer specific for the constant region of the beta chain of the TCR [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This TRBV-CDR3 spectratyping analysis represents a prescreening step that allows saving time and reagents (data not shown).

In the last step, PCR products of interest were directly purified and sequenced with the reverse primer (Fasteris SA, Geneva, Switzerland). The majority of PCR products were sequenced, however for several dominant TCR clonotypes (n = 8 for HDs; n = 10 for patients), unique primers corresponding to the <italic>CDR3</italic> gene segment were designed and used for clonotyping PCRs as previously described [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

                <title>The ex vivo EBV antigen-specific CD8 T cell repertoire following transient lympho-depletion reveals clonotype persistence despite frequency fluctuations</title>
                <p>We previously developed a strategy of global cDNA amplification at the 5-cell level suitable for the direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> assessment of individual TCR BV-CDR3beta (TRBV) gene segment usage [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, cDNA pools of EBV epitope-specific CD8 T cells were initially generated and used as a screen for recurrent TRBV families. Subsequently, the dominance of each TRBV family was determined by testing every single 5-cell sample, comprising the pool for the positive TRBV families, and representing the equivalent of 300 to 450 virus-specific CD8 T cells per individual. The amplified TRBV-CDR3-JB gene segments were ultimately sequenced or PCR-clonotyped to identify the unique TCR signature of each T cell clonotype, as described in Materials and Methods. Using this approach, we initially compared the TCR clonotype repertoire of directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> sorted 5-cell of EBV-specific T cells with that of single T cells generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> limiting dilution cultures. Comparable proportions of individual TCR clonotype signatures were found when using the <italic>ex vivo</italic> sorted 5-cell and the <italic>in vitro</italic> T cell cloning approaches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078686.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), in agreement with previous studies [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, independently performed <italic>ex vivo</italic> sorting experiments on single virus antigen-specific T cells, revealed similar relative frequencies of dominant T cell clonotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078686.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that our direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> approach allows the high-resolution molecular characterization of the clonotype repertoire <italic>in vivo</italic> in well-defined antigen-specific subpopulations. </p>
                <p>We next determined the persistence of EBV BMFL1-specific T cell clonotypes in healthy individuals over time. The majority of clonotypes were present at both early and late time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, a correlation showed a statistically significant association between the frequencies of clonotypes detected over a period of 4 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; Rho = 0.739, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Spearman’s correlation). We could observe the appearance of new clonotypes over time, however these newly detected clonotypes were of low frequencies (</p>

Together, these results are in line with those previously reported by our group [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and others [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and indicate that once established in healthy adults, the clonal composition during chronic herpes viruses infection is kept stable for at least several years.</p>

                <p>A major similarity of EBV epitope-specific CD8 T cells between healthy adults and patients was the preferential <italic>in vivo</italic> selection of dominant clonotypes with TRBV chains belonging to the <italic>TRBV14</italic>, <italic>TRBV20</italic> and <italic>TRBV29</italic> families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We also identified at least fourteen public TRBV sequences, with two CDR3 motifs RDxTGNGY and VGxGGTNEKL, which were over-represented and shared within healthy individuals and melanoma patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Public clonotypes are defined by the presence of the same identical TRBV-CDR3-BJ sequence found in at least two unrelated individuals. In line with previous reports [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], several of the public TRBV clonotypes identified in the present study were encoded by two or three different nucleotide sequence variations. When we compared the frequencies of public TRBV clonotypes within the overall EBV-specific CD8 T cell responses, a third of them represented dominant clonotypes (with frequencies &gt;5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Between 35 to 48% of EBV antigen-specific clonotypes were found at low frequencies (between 1 and 5%), while about one quarter were found only once in healthy donors or patients. Together, our data showed evidence for a high level of similarity of EBV BMFL1-specific CD8 T cells between melanoma patients and healthy individuals, as illustrated by (i) the sharing of frequent public TRBV sequences and (ii) the persistence of these public TRBV clonotypes with time and following TLD.</p>

                <p>Recently, we optimized the previously described strategy of global cDNA amplification for the direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> single cell gene-expression profiling [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and applied it here with the aim of determining the fine changes in gene expression signatures over the course of TLD and ACT treatment in individual T cells. Gene-specific PCR was done for multiple memory/homing-associated molecules (<italic>CD27</italic>, <italic>IL7R</italic>, <italic>EOMES, CD62L/SELL</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>), as well as effector-related genes known to be upregulated along T cell differentiation (<italic>PRF1, KLRD1, IFNG</italic> and <italic>GZMB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The highest overall expression of memory-associated genes was found at Leuka I in the early-differentiated EM28<sup>pos</sup> virus-specific subset, whereas the equivalent late-differentiated EMRA T cells exhibited the greatest expression of effector-related genes. Importantly, EM28<sup>pos</sup> virus-specific T cells at Leuka II showed enhanced expression of effector-associated mRNA transcripts compared to EM28<sup>pos</sup> found after Leuka I (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). </p>
                <p>We then analyzed the level of co-expression patterns of either memory/homing-associated or effector-associated genes in individual EBV antigen-specific T cells from the early-differentiated EM28<sup>pos</sup> subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g005">Figure 5</xref>). T cells from Leuka I showed the largest proportion of cells co-expressing at least four memory-associated genes, followed by the virus-specific T cells isolated from the Leuka II EM28<sup>pos</sup> and D15/22 subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g005">Figure 5</xref>, top pies). Interestingly, the EM28<sup>pos</sup> specific T cells from Leuka I depicted again limited co-expression of effector genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g005">Figure 5</xref>, bottom pies), contrasting with the increased gene expression diversity observed in both memory- and effector-associated genes following the second round of lympho-depletion (Leuka II and D15/22). These findings further support the notion that TLD and immune recovery induced T cell differentiation of EBV-specific CD8 T cells, while maintaining memory-related gene co-expression to a relative high level. </p>

We then extended our analysis to patient LAU 1013 and performed highly sensitive single cell gene expression analysis on four EBV-specific T cell clonotypes selected based on their persistence following the two rounds of TLD and ACT. From Leuka I to Leuka II, clonotypes BV29c1 increased in frequencies (4% to 24%), clonotype BV20c2 was stable (5% to 7%), whereas clonotypes BV29c3 and BV20c1 decreased in frequencies (42% to 2% and 31% to 4%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

                <p>We assessed the memory/homing-associated gene expression profiles of the four T cell clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) at Leuka I time-point. The persisting BV29c1 clonotype showed significantly enhanced expression of <italic>CD62L/SELL</italic>, <italic>IL7R</italic> and <italic>CD27</italic>, compared to the BV29c3 and BV20c1 clonotypes, which declined after the first round of TLD (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.041 respectively; ANOVA). No major difference in the overall gene expression of effector mediators could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078686.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We also analyzed the gene expression polyfunctionality by determining the direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> co-expression patterns of memory/homing-related genes within the co-dominant virus-specific clonotypes in patient LAU 1013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Again, the BV29c1 clonotype, which persisted after both lympho-depletion regimens, revealed the highest degree of memory co-expression genes at Leuka I (largely co-expressing four to five memory-associated genes). Conversely, the non-persistent BV29c3 and BV20c1 clonotypes, showing statistically significantly reduced co-expression of mRNAs coding for memory/homing-mediating molecules. Finally, and despite its low clonotypic frequency, the BV20c2 clonotype maintained robust memory/homing-related gene co-expression after the first round of TLD (Leuka II). Of note, complete gene expression profiling of the BV7c1 clonotype, which was selected following several rounds of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; Leuka II), was not possible at Leuka I, as we were unable to identify sufficient individual T cells for the analysis.</p>
                <p>Collectively, these results suggest that distinct co-expression patterns of memory-mediating molecules may be involved in the selection and persistence of EBV antigen-specific CD8 T cell clonotypes following transient immune-suppression. Furthermore, this polyfunctional expression profile characterized by high levels of co-expression of memory/homing-related genes may represent a hallmark of T cell clonotypes that are able to survive treatment with cytotoxic drugs and persist over extended periods of time.</p>

              <p>The capacity of the EBV-specific immune response to efficiently control viral infection is evidenced by the absence of disease in long-term EBV-infected healthy individuals. Severe immunosuppression following transplantation or HIV infection can result in deficient EBV-specific immunity, which may lead to EBV-associated pathology such as lymphoproliferative disease. Transient lympho-depletion (TLD) induced by non-myeloablative chemotherapy has become of high interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy, as it strongly favors <italic>in vivo</italic> survival and expansion of adoptively transferred cells [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the ability of EBV-specific T cells to avoid resurging viral infection and spread following temporary state of immunosuppression remains unknown. </p>
              <p>In the present study, we examined the robustness of the EBV-specific T cell response following TLD in comparison to steady-state conditions over a period of four years. We found that, similarly to the total CD8 population [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], EBV antigen-specific T cells also recovered efficiently following TLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although the proportion of differentiated effector-like T cells was variable among the different patients at the leukapheresis time-point, this T cell population uniformly increased following TLD and immune reconstitution. These results are consistent with previous reports describing enhanced T cell differentiation associated with immunosuppressive treatments [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as with our formal study showing a decline in naïve CD8 T cell numbers following TLD and a proliferative expansion of differentiated effector-memory T cells [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, we found no evidence of EBV viral reactivation shortly after ACT and at later time-points (200 days, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g001">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that the lympho-depleting regimen was not severe or long enough to cause EBV reactivation. From a clinical point of view, these findings are encouraging as they provide further support for the safety of short-term non-myeloablative chemotherapy regimens [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Owing to a high fidelity DNA polymerase, viruses belonging to the herpesviridae family are genetically stable [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], thereby allowing the tracking of viral antigen-specific T cells over time. We characterized the TCR beta-chain clonotype repertoire and selection of BMFL1-specific T cells from EBV<sup>pos</sup> healthy donors under steady-state conditions as well as EBV<sup>pos</sup> patients undergoing short-term chemotherapy. We found that the T cell clonotype selection and composition of the CD8 T cell response to an immunodominant epitope among patients closely resembled that of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, both groups displayed a similar degree of clonotype diversity, with selection for dominant T cell clonotypes bearing preferential <italic>TRBV20</italic> and <italic>TRBV29</italic> gene segments. Interestingly, we identified several public TRBV-CDR3 sequences that dominated the T cell clonotype repertoires of healthy donors and patients, including the previously identified archetypal AS01 ubiquitous TCR sequence (<italic>TRBV20-1</italic>/<italic>TRBJ1-2</italic> CSARDGTGNGYTF) [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These findings indicate that the T cell clonal composition generated against the BMFL1 epitope in lympho-depleted melanoma patients showed structurally conserved TCR features, highly similar to those found in healthy individuals. The pattern of antigen-specific TCRs has been recently shown to influence the potency of immune responses during SIV/HIV infections [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In particular, the number of public clonotypes correlated inversely with the viral load after SIV challenges [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. T cell populations with public clonotypes also exhibited a greater functional avidity, which was associated with relative HIV control [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], providing new insights into the immune parameters that mediate the spontaneous control of chronic viral infections.</p>
              <p>Persistence of herpes virus-specific T cell clonotypes with time has been previously documented in humans [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. More recently, using <italic>ex vivo</italic> new generation-sequencing, Klarenbeek and coworkers [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported on the stability of the repertoire of anti-viral CD8 T cell responses to CMV and EBV in renal transplanted recipients by demonstrating that nearly all virus-specific clonotypes appearing during the acute phase of infection were maintained over time. Importantly, they showed that the hierarchy of dominance of individual clonotypes was preserved during several years, highlighting the robustness of virus-specific T cell responses. In the present study, we extended on these findings by showing that the <italic>in vivo</italic> BMFL1-specific T cell repertoire was also stable following transient immunosuppression, with the frequent TCR clonotypes remaining dominant despite fluctuations in frequencies of low-dominant clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The small number of patients (n = 5) may represent a limitation of the current study, which primarily reflects the small number of patients undergoing phase I clinical trials using lympho-depleting chemotherapy. Nevertheless, this cohort of EBV<sup>pos</sup> carriers represents a unique opportunity to study the EBV-specific responses during transient immunological perturbations, in well-defined clinical settings, and not only over time under steady-state conditions.</p>
              <p>The persistence of the EBV antigen-specific clonal repertoire following TLD and immune reconstitution represents an interesting observation as more pronounced fluctuations might have been expected. These include <italic>de novo</italic> T cell priming and thus the emergence of novel TCR clonotypes, and/or loss of (less frequent) clonotypes, presumably because of increased competition for survival factors. Moreover, the immune reconstitution period following TLD is generally associated with a skewing of the global CD8 T cell repertoire, in part due to early preferential expansion of antigen-primed T cells, followed by the slow repopulation with new thymic emigrants that eventually re-establish a high TCR repertoire diversity (reviewed in [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). Furthermore, a recent analysis of the TCR repertoire following stem cell transplantation showed that the dynamics of recovery of the TCR repertoire diversity largely depends on the source of donor cells, with cord-blood cells being the most efficient, whereas T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells the least efficient at rapidly establishing TCR diversity [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Since the source of our re-infused cells was autologous unmodified PBMCs, we did not expect this to have a major impact on the overall TCR diversity following ACT. Specifically, our results did not show evidence of TCR repertoire significant narrowing following transient lympho-depletion and immune reconstitution since the majority of dominant EBV-specific T cell clonotypes survived efficiently to TLD.</p>
              <p>Narrowing of the CD8 TCR repertoire can be observed in old age and/or by CMV infection, leading to increased susceptibility to infection [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the present study, the CMV positive status did not correlate with a more restricted EBV-specific TCR repertoire (e.g. patients LAU 618, LAU 672 and LAU1013), however the most restricted EBV-specific TCR repertoires before treatment were observed for the two oldest patients in our cohort (LAU 1144 and LAU 618). Nevertheless, despite the advanced age and restricted TCR repertoires, total and EBV-specific CD8 T lymphocyte counts recovered well following chemotherapy and adoptive cell transfer. </p>
              <p>Technological advancements in the characterization of T lymphocyte responses reveal an unforeseen degree of heterogeneity of the antigen-primed T cell pool. Moreover, the level of polyfunctionality manifested by individual T cells can often be under-estimated when studying defined cellular populations by flow cytometry. In contrast, single cell analyses allow the accurate characterization of the functional phenotype of individual T cells. Our group and others have developed sophisticated laboratory techniques to analyze the gene expression signatures in individual T cells directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Such analyses provide significant advantages in the context of characterizing antigen-specific immune responses. Single cell gene expression profiling can complement flow cytometry data by expending the number of genes/populations markers used to define specific subpopulations, thereby offering a more detailed characterization of memory or effector subsets. For instance, this technique has proven useful in identifying previously unrecognized subsets of CD8 T cells differentially induced by various vaccines [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] as well as revealing important differences between the polyfunctional gene-expression profiles of T cells induced after vaccination with two closely related tumor antigenic peptides [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In these studies, gene expression analysis was extensively validated by comparisons with expression at the protein level using multi-parameter flow cytometry [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>Direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> single T cell gene expression analyses allows the accurate determination of the genes expressed by (multiple representatives of) individual TCR clonotypes. As the generation of clonotypic-specific mAbs to identify such individual clonotypes by flow cytometry still remains technically challenging, the identification of single T cell clonotypes is currently most reliably performed at the gene expression level. We have previously shown strong concordance between TCR repertoire analysis performed on <italic>ex vivo</italic> sorted cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T cell clones [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as well as between independently performed <italic>ex vivo</italic> single-cell sorted experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078686.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data were obtained from <italic>ex vivo</italic> sorted single cells, representing the equivalent of 300 to 450 cells per healthy donor or melanoma patient. They indicate the high sensitivity of our molecularly based approach for assessing gene expression in individual antigen-specific T cell clonotypes directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and allow the fine characterization of the parameters involved in memory T cell formation and maintenance over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g004">Figures 4 to 6</xref>). </p>
              <p>ACT studies performed in mice show that T cell populations expressing L-selectin (CD62L) and IL-7Ra display improved survival compared with subsets lacking the expression of these markers [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Results from clinical trials involving ACT in humans suggest that early-differentiated central memory T cells have a survival advantage <italic>in vivo</italic> due to their enhanced proliferative and self-renewal capacities after adoptive transfer [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. We recently reported that under steady-state conditions, the early-differentiated EM28<sup>pos</sup> EBV-specific T cells show high co-expression of memory/homing-related genes and relatively infrequent effector-gene expression [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that the persisting anti-viral CD8 T cell clonotypes might exhibit a memory-associated phenotype, which would favor their persistence following TLD. By profiling the expression of genes related to memory/homing and effector T cell properties, we found that persisting clonotypes (such as the BV29c1 clonotype from patient LAU 1013 and BV14c1 from patient LAU 618) showed specific and robust gene co-expression of <italic>CD27</italic>, <italic>IL7R</italic>, and <italic>CD62L/SELL</italic> prior to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078686-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Conversely, we observed significant differences in the memory gene expression profiling among two other dominant but non-persisting T cell clonotypes (BV29c3 and BV20c1 from patient LAU 1013). Although this in-depth analysis was only possible on few clonotypes, our data suggest that a polyfunctional memory/homing gene co-expression profile before TLD may be predictive of TCR clonotypes with improved survival during the immune reconstitution period. These results are in line with the concept that polyfunctional viral-specific T cells have also been observed in responses to the persistent and well-controlled CMV viral infection [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as well as within long-term non-progressors of HIV-infected individuals [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Identifying specific gene expression profiles involved in the survival and persistence of antigen-specific T lymphocytes over time will help us in understanding correlates of immune protection and are essential to promote therapeutic immune intervention like vaccination or adoptive T cell therapy. </p>
              <p>CD27 expression on T cells is associated with resistance to apoptosis, high IL-2 production, and increased T cell expansion [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], while IL-7Ra is a hallmark of primed CD8 T cells with the capacity to develop into long-lived memory cells [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As a result of cytoreduction following lympho-depleting chemotherapy, there is an increase in serum levels of IL-7 and IL-15 due to diminished competition for these cytokines [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As such, T cells expressing IL-7 and IL-15 receptors are expected to have survival and proliferative advantages during the immune reconstitution period. Our group previously reported that serum levels of IL-7 were detectable in these patients before TLD and ACT, and remained elevated for long periods of time following treatment [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Here, we show that despite the induction of T cell differentiation following TLD and immune recovery, anti-viral persistent T cell clonotypes retained relative high gene expression of <italic>IL7R</italic> and <italic>CD27</italic> even after two rounds of lympho-depletion treatment. Collectively, these data provide further support for the crucial role of IL-7 in memory T cell homeostasis and persistence, and the potential clinical benefits of including IL-7 administration in future vaccination and ACT strategies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, detailed analyses of phenotype, gene expression and TCR clonal repertoire of EBV antigen-specific CD8 T cells in healthy donors and melanoma patients revealed that the anti-viral specific clonotypes persisted over time and showed the ability to resist cytotoxic chemotherapy. Importantly, the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting studied here differs from the well-established allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in which the immunological perturbations are likely more profound. It also differs from the phase I clinical trials, which involve the same non-myeloablative lympho-depleting chemotherapy regimens, but with the transfer of either tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or autologous CD3 T lymphocytes engineered with antigen-specific TCRs [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Future studies are needed to characterize the impact of these <italic>in vivo</italic> settings on the dynamics of anti-viral T cell responses. Furthermore, direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> high-resolution molecular characterization of individual T cells at the clonotype level, as shown here, provides enhanced insights in the processes shaping the <italic>in vivo</italic> long-term survival of anti-viral specific T cells. </p>
