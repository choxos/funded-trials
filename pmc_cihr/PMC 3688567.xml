                <p>Loss of CD4 T cell help correlates with virus persistence during acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the underlying mechanism(s) remain unknown. We developed a combined proliferation/intracellular cytokine staining assay to monitor expansion of HCV-specific CD4 T cells and helper cytokines expression patterns during acute infections with different outcomes. We demonstrate that acute resolving HCV is characterized by strong Th1/Th17 responses with specific expansion of IL-21-producing CD4 T cells and increased IL-21 levels in plasma. In contrast, viral persistence was associated with lower frequencies of IL-21-producing CD4 T cells, reduced proliferation and increased expression of the inhibitory receptors T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing-molecule-3 (Tim-3), programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on HCV-specific CD8 T cells. Progression to persistent infection was accompanied by increased plasma levels of the Tim-3 ligand Galectin-9 (Gal-9) and expansion of Gal-9 expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs). <italic>In vitro</italic> supplementation of Tim-3<sup>high</sup> HCV-specific CD8 T cells with IL-21 enhanced their proliferation and prevented Gal-9 induced apoptosis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gal-9 in Treg cells rescued IL-21 production by HCV-specific CD4 T cells. We propose that failure of CD4 T cell help during acute HCV is partially due to an imbalance between Th17 and Treg cells whereby exhaustion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells through the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway may be limited by IL-21 producing Th17 cells or enhanced by Gal-9 producing Tregs.</p>

                <p>In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying failure of the CD4 helper T cell response during acute hepatitis C infection. We demonstrate that this failure is primarily due to loss of IL-21-producing CD4 T cells in individuals who progress towards chronic infection. This is accompanied by exhaustion of virus-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells through upregulation of the exhaustion markers Tim-3, PD-1 and CTLA-4, higher plasma levels of the Tim-3 ligand Galectin-9 (Gal-9) and increased frequency of Gal-9 producing regulatory T cells (Tregs). <italic>In vitro</italic> supplementation with IL-21 rescued HCV-specific CD8 T cells from Gal-9 induced apoptosis. Blocking Gal-9 expression in Tregs restored IL-21 production by virus-specific CD4 helper T cells. Altogether, our results suggest that failure of CD4 T cell help during acute HCV may be partially meditated by an imbalance between IL-21-producing CD4 T cells and Treg cells whereby exhaustion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells through the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway is counteracted by IL-21.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The outcome of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection towards spontaneous resolution or persistent viremia is dictated by the magnitude, breadth and quality of the virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Rehermann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The essential role of CD4 helper T cells in mediating spontaneous viral clearance was demonstrated by several observations. First, the loss of CD4 helper T cell proliferative responses during acute HCV was associated with viral recurrence and the development of chronic infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Gerlach1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Diepolder1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Second, broad HCV-specific CD4 T cell responses are induced early in most acutely infected individuals but they undergo progressive loss of IL-2 production and diminished proliferation as infections progress towards viral persistence <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Lucas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Third, CD4 T cell depletion in the chimpanzee model of HCV infection led to persistent low level viremia, the loss of CD8 function and the development of escape mutations in targeted CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Grakoui1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These observations strongly suggest that CD4 helper T cells are critical in sustaining the functions of HCV-specific CD8 T cells. However, the underlying helper signals and the mechanisms of CD4 T cell failure remain elusive.</p>
              <p>T cell exhaustion has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the dysfunction of HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells during acute infection. The over-expression of inhibitory receptors like T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing-molecule-3 (Tim-3), programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and 2B4 was observed on HCV-specific CD8 T cells in the blood and liver of individuals developing chronic HCV infection (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Callendret1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). Blockade of these inhibitory pathways restored proliferation and cytokine production by HCV-specific CTLs <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Callendret1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The differential level of expression of these inhibitory receptors on virus-specific T cells and their respective ligands in certain tissues may contribute to various levels of exhaustion. For example, higher levels of exhaustion and apoptosis are observed in the liver where greater levels of the PD-1 ligand-1 (PDL-1) and the Tim-3 ligand Galectin-9 (Gal-9) are expressed <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Radziewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Using MHC class II tetramers, Raziorrouh et al. have observed the increased expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on virus-specific CD4 T cells from patients with chronic HCV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Raziorrouh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Blocking the PD-1 pathway restored the proliferation of HCV-specific CD4 helper T cells and the production of the Th1 cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Raziorrouh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Whether this exhausted phenotype affects the production of other helper cytokines and mediators of CD4 T cell help was not investigated.</p>
              <p>Other possible mechanisms of T cell failure include inhibition of proliferation by Tregs or imbalance between the different CD4 helper T cell subsets (e.g. Th1, Th2, Th17) during the progression of HCV infection. Increased Treg frequencies were observed in chronic HCV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Manigold1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Tregs can have a direct inhibitory effect on virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells through production of the immuno-modulatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Raziorrouh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or through expression of Gal-9 as observed during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Elahi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Another subset that has become increasingly important is Th17 cells that produce a variety of cytokines including IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-22. IL-17A-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells are highly enriched in the liver <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Billerbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and HCV-specific Th17 cells were detected in the peripheral blood during chronic HCV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Rowan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, a temporal association was observed between increased virus-specific IL-17 responses and spontaneous recovery from recurrent hepatitis C in a liver transplant recipient <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Seetharam1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Th17 cells were also associated with the control of several bacterial and viral infections <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and are a potential source of IL-21 that has been recently identified as a major helper cytokine during chronic viral infection. Studies in the mouse model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) have demonstrated that IL-21 is required to sustain proliferation and effector functions of virus-specific CD8 T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Frohlich1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Similarly, data from HIV-infected individuals have demonstrated that IL-21 is associated with viral control and slower disease progression <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Chevalier1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, the role of Th17 cells and that of IL-21 as a helper cytokine during acute HCV infection were not studied.</p>
              <p>In this study, we performed a longitudinal analysis of CD4 helper T cell function and interaction between CD4 and CD8 T cells during acute HCV infection in individuals with spontaneous resolution <italic>vs</italic> persistent viremia. We specifically focused on IL-21 producing Th17 cells and the means by which Tregs control helper activity of CD4 T cells. We demonstrate a delicate balance between IL-21-producing Th17 cells and Gal-9 producing Tregs. This balance may favor either exhaustion or survival of HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells during acute HCV infection.</p>

                <p>The first goal of this study was to longitudinally examine and compare the magnitude and functional profile of HCV-specific CD4 T cells during acute HCV infections with different outcomes. However, the very low frequency of virus-specific CD4 T cells and the limited availability of HCV MHC class II tetramers prevented us from performing direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis of these cells. Thus, we developed an assay combining carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) proliferation and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to determine the cytokine profile of HCV-specific CD4 T cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003422.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). This is a qualitative rather than a quantitative assay that provides a general overview of the quality and function of HCV-specific CD4 T cells during different stages of infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were depleted of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells before stimulation to limit inhibition of antigen-specific proliferation by Tregs and facilitate detection of HCV-specific T cells activated during the <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation. Treg-depleted-PBMCs from HCV patients were labelled with CFSE and stimulated with HCV recombinant proteins in a standard 6 day CFSE proliferation assay as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003422.s001">Figure S1A</xref>. Virus-specific CD4 T cells were identified by the dilution of CFSE staining coupled with the up-regulation of CD25, used as an early activation marker. FACS plots from a representative proliferation assay are presented in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003422.s001">Figure S1B</xref>. At the end of the proliferation on day 6, cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate (PMA) and ionomycin in a standard ICS assay to reveal their cytokine profile by gating on proliferating (CFSE<sup>low</sup>) cells. Due to the fact that proliferation and PMA/ionomycin induce down-modulation of CD4, HCV-specific CD4 T cells were defined by gating on CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>neg</sup> T cells and examining the cytokines produced by CFSE<sup>low</sup> cells. We monitored the production of the Th1 cytokine: IFN-γ and TNF-α as well as the Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-21.

RORc was highly expressed in CD161<sup>high</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells as compared to the CD161<sup>neg</sup> CD4 T cells thus validating their Th17 lineage. However, c-MAF mRNA was specifically up-regulated in Th17 cells from resolvers (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003422.s003">Figure S3C</xref>).

Altogether, these results confirm the specific expansion of IL-17A<sup>+</sup>IL-21<sup>+</sup> Th17 CD4 T cells during acute resolving HCV. This is the first description of HCV-specific Th17 cells during acute HCV infection and suggests that these cells and the cytokines they produce may play an important role in spontaneous clearance of HCV.</p>

Based on the levels of Tim-3 expression we were able to define three distinct patterns: Tim-3<sup>neg</sup> for no exhaustion Tim-3<sup>low</sup> for partial exhaustion and Tim-3<sup>high</sup> for a fully exhausted phenotype. Tim-3<sup>neg</sup> cells were mostly detected in SR patients (n = 4) and were found to be negative for the exhaustion markers PD-1 and CTLA-4 but expressed high levels of the memory marker CD127, associated with poly-functional T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Badr1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In contrast, Tim-3<sup>low</sup> and Tim-3<sup>high</sup> cells were detected in CI patients during acute HCV (n = 7). Tim-3<sup>low</sup> cells were PD-1<sup>high</sup>CTLA-4<sup>neg</sup> and expressed intermediate levels of CD127. Tim-3<sup>high</sup> CD8 T cells were PD-1<sup>high</sup>CTLA-4<sup>high</sup> but CD127<sup>neg</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). These diverse expression patterns suggest different exhaustion statuses based on the increased expression of Tim-3, PD-1 and CTLA-4 and the reduced expression of CD127. Indeed, we observed a reduction in the proliferative capacity of HCV-specific cells in response to cognate HCV peptides with increased expression of Tim-3 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003422.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Given that the frequency of HCV-specific T cells correlated with plasma levels of IL-21, we hypothesized that IL-21 may preserve the functions and limit the exhaustion of HCV-specific T cells and enhance their survival. We examined the correlation between the frequency of exhausted T cells (PD-1<sup>+</sup>Tim-3<sup>+</sup>HCV-tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells) and the plasma levels of IL-21. We established a negative correlation between these two parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, p = 0.0005, n = 11). This suggests that the frequency and the functionality of HCV-specific CD8 T cells may be dependent on IL-21, a T-helper cytokine.</p>

                <p>To further dissect the mechanisms contributing to the loss of the helper T cell response and, consequently, the inhibition of the CD8 T cell antiviral function, we examined the specific emergence of suppressive Tregs during acute HCV infections progressing to chronicity. First, we examined the frequency of peripheral CD4 Tregs using the classical markers CD25<sup>high</sup> CD127<sup>low</sup> and FoxP3<sup>+</sup>.

                <title>Exhaustion as a potential mechanism for failure of IL-21-producing HCV-specific CD4 helper T cells</title>
                <p>We have demonstrated that progression to chronic HCV infection is associated with a shift from Th1/Th17 virus-specific CD4 T cells to Gal-9-expressing Tregs. This led to a failure in the maintenance of CD4 T cells which produce a key helper cytokine, IL-21. This prompted us to investigate if the reduced frequency of IL-21 producing Th17 cells and therefore, the reduced levels of IL-21 in the plasma could be the mechanism restricting CD4 T cell help in acute infections with chronic evolution. IL-21 production could be limited directly through exhaustion of IL-21 producing Th17 cells or indirectly through modulation of Th17 cell function and cytokine producing capacity by inhibitory Tregs. Given that the exhaustion of HCV-specific Th17 cells could not be evaluated directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> because of a lack of appropriate HCV MHC class II tetramers, we investigated whether IL-17A and/or IL-21 could be restored upon the blockade of several inhibitory pathways in 6 patients during the late acute phase of HCV infection (30 wks±6 wks PEI). As described above, we used the combined CFSE/ICS assay to monitor the restoration in proliferation and to determine the functional profile of HCV-specific CD4 T cells following stimulation with the HCV NS4 antigen in the presence of isotype control antibodies or of neutralizing antibodies directed against PD-L1, CTLA-4 and Tim-3. We used this triad of blocking molecules to optimize the functional restoration of exhausted T cells. At the end of the 6 days CFSE proliferation assay, cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin to assess the intracellular production of cytokines. The restoration in cytokine production upon blockade of the inhibitory pathways is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. Blocking the inhibitory pathways slightly enhanced the proliferation of HCV-specific CD4 T cells in response to NS3 and NS4 (data not shown). Nevertheless, this blockade led to a significant increase in the percent of NS4-specific proliferating T cells which produce the Th17 cytokines, IL-17A and IL-21 (p = 0.0078 and p = 0.0039, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and the Th1 cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α (p = 0.0078 and p = 0.0039, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar results were observed upon NS3 stimulation (data not shown). Restoration was also tested in an additional group of 6 patients who had HCV-specific CD4 responses during the early acute phase that became undetectable during the late acute phase. Neutralizing the inhibitory pathways did not restore proliferation or cytokine production by CD4 T cells in this group suggesting that immune restoration is dependent on the maintenance of a minimal frequency of HCV-specific T cells (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that HCV-specific Th17 cells are exhausted during acute HCV with chronic evolution and that there is a narrow window of opportunity where exhaustion can be reversed via interference with the implicated inhibitory pathway(s).</p>

                <p>We have demonstrated that HCV-specific CD8 T cells can develop different levels of exhaustion according to the level of expression of Tim-3. Furthermore, we demonstrated that progression to chronic HCV-infection is associated with lower plasma levels of IL-21, increased Gal-9 and increased frequencies of Gal-9 expressing Tregs. Gal-9 can induce apoptosis of T cells upon interaction with its ligand Tim-3 <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and may thus contribute to the inhibition of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> HCV-specific CD8 T cells. So, we hypothesized that IL-21 may rescue HCV-specific cells from Gal-9-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect of IL-21 was tested during a short-term exposure of HCV-specific T cells expressing different levels of Tim-3 to Gal-9. PBMCs collected from SR or CI patients during acute HCV (n = 12) were stimulated with Gal-9; the irrelevant ligand Galectin-3 (Gal-3) (used as a negative control) or Staurosporin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) (used as a positive control). Apoptosis was assessed by examining the co-expression of Annexin-V and caspase 3 in total CD8 and HCV-tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells. Representative data of the responses from 5 patients with different patterns of Tim-3 expression (Tim-3<sup>high</sup> (n = 2), Tim-3<sup>low</sup> (n = 2) and Tim-3<sup>neg</sup> (n = 1)) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g006">Figure 6B</xref>. Spontaneous apoptosis was higher directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> in Tim-3<sup>high</sup> cells as compared to Tim-3<sup>low</sup> and Tim-3<sup>neg</sup> cells. Furthermore, the addition of Gal-9 but not Gal-3 triggered apoptosis in 1.13 to 77.2% (median value 26.6%) of HCV tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells from all HCV patients. Cell death was found to be more pronounced in patients with higher levels of T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The addition of IL-21 reduced this Tim-3 mediated apoptosis to 3.66 to 68.4% (median value 20.75%) (p = 0.0098), which is similar to the non-specific apoptosis induced by Gal-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

                <p>We have demonstrated the implication of the Gal-9/Tim-3 pathway in the functional inhibition of both HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and that IL-21 may reverse this inhibitory effect. In addition, we have demonstrated the expansion of Gal-9-expressing Tregs during acute HCV with chronic evolution. Thus, we hypothesized that Tregs may contribute to inhibiting HCV-specific IL-21 production not only through the production of the classical Treg immuno-modulatory cytokines like TGF-β or IL-10, but also through the activation of the Gal-9/Tim-3 inhibitory pathway. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we performed a combined CFSE/ICS in the presence of regulatory T cells transfected with siRNA-specific for the Gal-9 gene (<italic>LGALS9</italic>) or control siRNA (scramble sequence) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003422.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we demonstrated an important role for IL-21 as a major helper cytokine during acute HCV infection by limiting the T cell dysfunction induced by the Gal-9/Tim-3 interaction. We have demonstrated a direct correlation between higher levels of IL-21 production and cell proliferation, as well as cell survival and the inhibition of exhaustion of HCV-specific CD8 T cells. Moreover, our results have identified three different mechanisms of CD4 helper T cell failure during acute HCV infections with chronic evolution. First, the exhaustion of HCV-specific helper T cells may lead to decreased IL-21 production and failure to sustain efficient CTL responses. Second, an imbalance between inflammatory (Th17) and regulatory (Treg) CD4 T cells may have a direct inhibitory effect on HCV-specific CTL responses. Third, we have identified CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs as a potential source of Gal-9 during chronic HCV infection and demonstrated that Gal-9-expressing Tregs can directly inhibit proliferation and IL-21 production by HCV-specific CD4 T cells. These mechanisms combined may limit CD4 T cell help, trigger exhaustion and apoptosis of HCV-specific T cells and favor virus persistence.</p>
              <p>The helper role of IL-21 during acute HCV can be mediated through direct and indirect effects. IL-21 acts directly to prevent exhaustion <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Frohlich1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and to enhance the cytotoxic capacity of virus-specific CTLs through the up-regulation of perforin <xref rid="ppat.1003422-White1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Spolski1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and granulysin <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Hogg1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Also, it sustains the proliferation and survival of virus-specific memory CTLs <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Allard1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and decreases senescence and susceptibility to apoptosis through the modulation of caspase-3 expression <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Sabbagh1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Indirectly, IL-21 production by Th17 cells favors their development by increasing the expression of the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and thus enhancing the sensitivity to this Th17-polarizing cytokine <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Korn2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. IL-21 also inhibits the differentiation of Tregs by interfering with FoxP3 expression <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Nurieva1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-Littman1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Moreover, it can counteract Treg-mediated suppression by inhibiting T cell IL-2 production, which leads to the impairment of Treg homeostasis through IL-2 deprivation <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Attridge1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
              <p>We have observed a specific increase in the frequency of IL-21-producing Th17 cells, identified as CD161<sup>high</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells, during acute resolving HCV. The limited expansion of this subset seen in acute infections with chronic evolution can be due to its exhaustion status. Indeed, we have demonstrated that blocking the PD-1/Tim-3 and CTLA-4 inhibitory pathways can rescue IL-21 production. Another possibility is the modulation of the inhibitory effect of Tim-3 via human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)-associated transcript 3 (Bat3) <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Rangachari1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. We have observed lower expressions of Bat3 in Th17 cells from chronically infected HCV patients when compared to SR patients (data not shown). This is similar to features of T cell exhaustion during chronic HIV infection as well as in a mouse model of cancer <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Rangachari1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p>
              <p>IL-21-producing Th17 cells may preferentially home to the liver. Several studies have reported an increase in the frequency of Th17 cells in the livers of patients with chronic liver diseases, including infections with HBV and HCV <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of CD161 on liver-resident HCV-specific IL-17-producing CD8 T cells (Tc17 cells) was found to be tightly linked to the expression of CXCR6, a liver homing chemokine receptor <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Northfield1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Due to ethical constraints that restrict any liver biopsies during acute HCV infection, we examined the homing potential of Th17 cells from SR and CI patients by evaluating the expression of the homing receptors CCR5, CXCR3 and CXCR6. However, we did not observe any significant differences between the two groups (data not shown). This result does not exclude the possibility that such liver homing cells were not detected because they are no longer in circulation. Similarly, we could not assess the contribution of other IL-21-producing cellular populations, such as follicular helper T cells which are mainly found in the lymph nodes and NKT cells which are mainly found in the liver.</p>
              <p>We have observed three levels of expression of the inhibitory receptor Tim-3 on HCV-specific CD8 T cells. The combination of Tim-3 with PD-1, CTLA-4 and CD127 identified different degrees of functional impairment: un-exhausted (Tim-3<sup>neg</sup>PD-1<sup>neg</sup>CTLA-4<sup>neg</sup>CD127<sup>high</sup>), partially exhausted (Tim-3<sup>low</sup>PD-1<sup>high</sup>CTLA-4<sup>dim</sup>CD127<sup>dim</sup>) and fully exhausted (Tim-3<sup>high</sup>PD-1<sup>high</sup>CTLA-4<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>neg</sup>) HCV-specific CD8 T cells. Such a hierarchical model of exhaustion was proposed to explain the progressive loss of virus-specific CD8 T cell functions in LCMV <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Blackburn1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and HCV infections <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Callendret1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Bengsch2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Although we did not observe any significant differences in the expression of CD160 (data not shown), other inhibitory receptors such as 2B4, LAG-3 and KLRG1 may also be critical in defining the exhaustion level of HCV-specific T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Bengsch2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Wherry1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Schlaphoff1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Moreover, the level of expression may also be affected by the host's HLA genotype. Recent data have demonstrated that HIV patients carrying the protective HLA alleles (HLA-B27 and HLA-B57) exhibited limited up-regulation of Tim-3 at the surface of HIV-specific CD8 T cells after cognate epitope stimulation <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Elahi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In contrast, patients carrying the less protective alleles (including HLA-A3) exhibited higher up-regulation of Tim-3 and were more susceptible to functional impairment. Interestingly, HLA-B27 has been associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution in acute HCV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-NeumannHaefelin1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Dazert1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> and it is possible that it may play a similar role in limiting T cell exhaustion during acute HCV. Differential up-regulation of inhibitory receptors could be due to variable affinities of the peptide/MHC interactions with the T cell receptors that lead to multiple thresholds of activation.</p>
              <p>A blockade of the three inhibitory receptors, PD-1, Tim-3 and CTLA-4, rescued IL-17A and IL-21 production by HCV-specific CD4 T cells. This suggested that these pathways are implicated in helper T cell failure and exhaustion during acute HCV. In addition, it suggested that the hierarchical model of T cell exhaustion, previously observed in CD8 T cells, is also applicable to CD4 T cells. Indeed, gradual and progressive loss of CD4 helper function was observed in HCV infections progressing to chronicity where the earliest function lost was IL-2 production followed by proliferation then IFN-γ production <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Semmo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the present study, we could not restore CD4 T cell function in patients with chronic evolution where the response was undetectable during the late acute phase suggesting that there is a minimal threshold of T cell frequency and a window of opportunity for immune restoration to succeed. Interestingly, the blocking of all three pathways on exhausted HCV-specific CD8 T cells restored proliferation, but only Tim-3 blockage restored cytotoxic function <xref rid="ppat.1003422-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Data from HIV and LCMV infections suggest that the level of expression of each inhibitory receptor could also dictate the efficiency of immune restoration upon its blockade <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Blackburn1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Porichis1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Given the difficulty in phenotyping HCV-specific CD4 T cells directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, further research is still needed to examine the individual contribution of each inhibitory receptor in defining the level of CD4 T cell exhaustion. It is also noteworthy that higher levels of expression of such inhibitory receptors were observed on HCV-specific CD8 T cells in the liver during chronic HCV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Radziewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003422-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and this may limit immune restoration strategies and the immuno-modulatory role of IL-21.</p>
              <p>Tregs were expanded during the acute phase of HCV infection in CI patients and may exert a direct inhibitory effect on the function of virus-specific T cells. In addition, we observed a specific expansion of Tregs co-expressing CTLA-4 and CD39. CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs were also found to be expanded in HIV <xref rid="ppat.1003422-SchulzeZurWiesch2" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> and chronic HBV infections <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> and were shown to counteract or inhibit the expansion of Th17 cells during remission of patients with multiple sclerosis <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Peelen1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Moreover, a polymorphism in the CD39 gene was recently identified and associated with a slow progression to AIDS in HIV-infected patients <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Nikolova1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Similar genetic susceptibility may explain the differential induction of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs in HCV-infected patients. Other signals driving cross-regulation between regulatory T cells and IL-21-secreting Th17 CD4 T cells may involve TGF-β <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Jonuleit1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Bettelli1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref> and/or Notch signaling <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Kared1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Keerthivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. In summary, HCV infection may disrupt the balance between Th17 cells and Tregs and, therefore, tamper inflammation while diminishing the effector functions of HCV-specific T cells thus facilitating virus persistence <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Barnaba1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>.</p>
              <p>We have observed the preferential expression of Gal-9 by CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs which contributes to their suppressive capacity <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Deaglio1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Mandapathil1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref> through interaction with Tim-3 on the surface of exhausted T cells as recently seen in HIV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Elahi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It is important to note that there are other sources of Gal-9 <italic>in vivo</italic>, specifically Kupffer cells in the liver that may contribute to the increase in apoptosis of liver-resident T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003422-Mengshol1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We demonstrated a direct link between inhibition of HCV-specific T cell function and the expression of Gal-9 by Tregs during acute HCV infection. A delicate balance between IL-21 and Gal-9 can control survival, exhaustion and apoptosis of HCV-specific T cells and could be a major determinant of infectious outcome.</p>
              <p>We propose a model where HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are induced early during acute HCV infection but multiple mechanisms could contribute to failure of the immune response during the late acute phase. First, failure to expand IL-21-producing Th17 cells leads to diminished survival and function of HCV-specific CD8 T cells. Second, failure to control viral replication leads to the exhaustion of both virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells due to the up-regulation of different inhibitory receptors including PD-1, Tim-3 and CTLA-4. T cell exhaustion further aggravates the situation as IL-21 becomes limited, especially in the liver where HCV-specific CD8 T cells become dysfunctional and more susceptible to apoptosis. Finally, to counteract liver inflammation, Tregs are induced and act to further inhibit expansion of Th17 CD4 T cells while producing Gal-9 which can lead to the apoptosis of Tim-3 expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells. Polymorphism in the CD39 gene and the capacity of different HLA alleles to up-regulate inhibitory receptors may be the tipping point in determining the level of exhaustion and the outcome of infection in HCV patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003422-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

All participants signed informed consent forms upon enrolment and experiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were followed at scheduled 3-month intervals with a maximum duration of 22 weeks between visits. Acute infection was defined as either (i) detection of positive HCV RNA in the absence of HCV antibodies, followed by sero-conversion; (ii) a positive HCV antibody test following a previous negative test in the presence of positive HCV RNA; or (iii) a positive HCV antibody and RNA test within 3 months of a high-risk exposure. All patients tested negative for HIV and HBV. The estimated time of infection at recruitment was defined as the median time (in weeks) between the last negative test and first positive HCV RNA or antibody test. Spontaneous viral resolution (SR, n = 13) or chronic infection (CI, n = 24) was defined as the absence or the presence of HCV RNA at 24 weeks post-estimated time of infection (PEI), respectively. Two time points were studied for acutely infected patients: early acute (10 wks±1 wk PEI) and late acute (30 weeks±6 weeks PEI). Two additional categories of patients were studied: long-term HCV spontaneous resolvers (R) (n = 8), defined as HCV RNA negative and antibody positive at two consecutive tests &gt;60 days apart, and long-term HCV chronically infected patients (C) (n = 27), defined as HCV RNA and antibody positive at recruitment with no prior negative test data.

For Th17 progenitor cells, purified CD4 T cells were labeled and sorted according to viability and the expression of CD3, CD4, CD127, CD161, CCR6 and CD26. CD127<sup>low</sup> Tregs were excluded from the sort by gating on CD127<sup>high</sup> CD4 T cells. Two populations were collected: CD127<sup>high</sup>CD161<sup>neg</sup> or CD127<sup>high</sup>CD161<sup>high</sup>CCR6<sup>hi</sup>CD26<sup>hi</sup> CD4 T cells. Sorted cells were stimulated for 48 hours with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 before mRNA extraction and RT-PCR. For the purification of Tregs, CD4 T cells were isolated, labeled and sorted according to viability and the expression of CD3, CD4, CD127, CD25 and CD39. Three populations were collected: effector T cells (CD25<sup>neg</sup>CD127<sup>hi</sup>), CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs (CD127<sup>low</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD39<sup>+</sup>) and CD39<sup>neg</sup> Tregs (CD127<sup>low</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD39<sup>neg</sup>). Sorted cells were washed, and immediately lysed to extract mRNA as described below or fixed using a Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eBiosciences) to perform the intracellular staining of FoxP3 and CTLA-4, according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
