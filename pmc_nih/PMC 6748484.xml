                <p>Effective approaches to promoting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and linkage to PrEP
care among those who may benefit the most from PrEP has proven to be a major challenge. We
designed and pilot tested a strengths-based case management (SBCM) intervention for PrEP
linkage. Adults interested in PrEP and meeting criteria (n = 61) were randomized to
passive referral (control) or active SBCM (treatment). Outcomes measured were completion
of provider visit, initiation of PrEP, and time to initiation of PrEP. Overall, 34%
initiated PrEP by 12 weeks: 9 (29%) in the control group and 12 (40%) in the treatment
group. The mean time to PrEP initiation was 13.1 weeks (95% confidence interval,
12.0-14.2) with no difference between groups (<italic>P</italic> = .382). There was a 21%
difference in achieving a provider visit between the treatment and control groups (53.3%
versus 32.3%) by 12 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .096). Participants encountered financial,
logistical, social, and provider-related barriers to PrEP access. Strengths-based case
management–based patient navigation is a promising strategy for assisting PrEP seekers in
obtaining a medical provider visit and initiating PrEP.</p>

              <p>Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with oral tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) can
reduce the risk of new HIV infections by more than 90% when taken daily, disparities exist
in PrEP access and delivery.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr3-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> South Florida includes the 3 metropolitan areas with the highest rates of new HIV
infections in the United States,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but suboptimal levels of PrEP prescribing have been observed in this region compared
to other areas of the United States.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Among participants in a demonstration project that provided PrEP free of charge in a
research environment,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> those located in Miami and minority participants, particularly young black and
Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM), were unlikely to utilize PrEP beyond completion of
a demonstration project study compared to white, non-Hispanic/Latino MSM, and those in San Francisco.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Despite previous experience with PrEP and expressed high interest in continuing PrEP,
study participants reported pessimism about accessing PrEP on their own.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Potential PrEP candidates report perceptions of high cost, difficulty identifying a
PrEP provider, discomfort communicating sexual risk to a provider, lack of accessible
medical care, and fear of community and provider stigma regarding HIV and sexual behavior as
barriers to PrEP linkage.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr9-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Strengths-based case management (SBCM) is a model of community-based case management that
focuses on a participant’s own abilities/strengths and assets, recognizes and supports goal
setting, and encourages use of the community as a resource for support.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Strengths-based case management is the only intervention that has shown, in a
randomized controlled trial, effectiveness in linking newly HIV-positive individuals to
their initial HIV care visit.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The individualized approach of SBCM is well suited to racially, economically, and
ethnically diverse populations such as those found in Miami-Dade County. Varied challenges
to linkage to care including financial concerns, complexities of immigration status, stigma,
and provider access may be addressed through SBCM.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The SBCM approach, in which the individual’s abilities and assets are recognized and
supported by a patient navigator, while also identifying sources of support and resources in
the community and encouraging engagement, may effectively counter frequently observed
despondent attitudes regarding linkage to prevention care and encourage positive engagement
in the process.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>

                  <title>What Do We Already Know about This Topic?</title>
                  <p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention strategy when taken as
directed by people who are at increased risk of HIV infection. For many people who could
benefit from PrEP, linkage to a prescribing provider is a major barrier to receiving
PrEP. These barriers disproportionately impact people who are socioeconomically
disadvantaged. Strengths-based case management has been effective in facilitating
linkage to HIV treatment in other studies but has not been tested for PrEP linkage.</p>

                  <p>New strategies for linking people to PrEP care more effectively are needed. This study
finds that use of a strengths-based case management approach for PrEP linkage is
promising. Delineation of the barriers encountered by PrEP seekers in this study also

                  <p>This study provides support for further investigation of a strengths-based case

              <p>The objective of this study was to test and evaluate the efficacy of an adaptation of the
evidence-based antiretroviral treatment access study,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> using a brief, SBCM intervention to facilitate linkage to PrEP/HIV prevention care in
a majority of low-income, urban, nonwhite sample population. Specifically, we aimed to
assess the percentage of participants who started PrEP, as well as time to PrEP initiation.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has evaluated the impact of an SBCM
intervention on linkage to PrEP care. Additionally, descriptive data regarding barriers
faced by participants and interventions required by navigators to overcome these barriers
were obtained to inform future patient navigation interventions and public health
interventions involving patient navigators.</p>

              <p>To assess the impact of the SBCM intervention on successful linkage to a PrEP-competent
provider and PrEP uptake, this study recruited individuals at risk for HIV infection by the
following criteria: (1) were eligible for PrEP based on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC; 2014) clinical practice recommendations for PrEP use<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and (2) had not previously accessed PrEP in a nonresearch setting. Study flyers were
distributed inside outpatient clinics that belonged to a large public hospital in the Miami
Metropolitan area and community-based organizations where PrEP was not offered on-site.
Also, a message beginning “Interested in PrEP? Not sure how to get it?” was broadcasted
locally through GRINDR, a social networking smartphone application. Our recruitment strategy
aimed to enroll participants from diverse racial, ethnic, and sexual orientation-based
backgrounds in South Florida with previously encountered challenges to PrEP linkage.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The recruitment period was from January 26, 2016, to October 20, 2016.</p>
              <p>Prospective participants were currently uninfected with HIV by self-report. They were 18
years of age or older, able to meet the project interviewer/patient navigator at the
research site, able to give informed consent, willing to provide personal contact
information and to be contacted by phone, and appropriate for consideration of PrEP based on
criteria from the CDC Clinical Practice Guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Those candidates meeting study inclusion criteria were then asked to provide informed
consent and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization to obtain
medical records from their provider regarding visits, HIV test results, and PrEP
prescriptions. All participants were informed that they would be responsible for the cost
associated with the provider visit and associated HIV testing per the health center’s
policies.</p>
              <p>All study procedures and informed consent documents were approved by the University of
Miami Human Subject Research Office Institutional Review Board (approval number 20150121).
All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.</p>
              <p>Following study enrollment, participants completed an interviewer-administered baseline
survey (see description of assessments, below). Participants were then immediately
randomized to receive either the intervention condition (patient navigator individualized
assessment and follow-up using SBCM) or the control condition (enhanced standard of care
including a PrEP Starter Package). Randomization occurred by computer-generated block
randomization with randomly selected block sizes. Randomization was stratified by 2
subgroups: one for MSM and transgender women and one for heterosexual men and women. Cards
with study group assignment were placed in sealed, signed envelopes by the data manager (who
did not interact with participants during the study). The sequentially numbered envelope was
opened following the completion of the baseline study.</p>

                <p>Our SBCM intervention focused on participant’s abilities, strengths, and community
support and engagement for enacting desired change. The 5 principles of SBCM include: (1)
encourage identification and the use of strengths, abilities, and assets; (2) recognize
and support participant control over goal setting and the search for needed resources; (3)
establish an effective working relationship; (4) view the community as a resource and
identify sources of support; and (5) conduct case management as active, community-based activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This pilot intervention addressed these principles systematically using the
following activities subsequent to the baseline assessment and during the first visit with
the patient navigator: building the relationship; emphasizing personal strengths; learning
to make contact. All SBCM intervention arm participants had 1 in-person session with the
patient navigator lasting 45 to 60 minutes to develop these elements (either directly
following the screening, informed consent, and enrollment procedures or at a scheduled
follow-up appointment). Participants had the option to attend 4 additional follow-up
visits and/or phone/text message contact to revisit personal strengths, reevaluate
available resources, and focus on the remaining SBCM elements of reviewing progress and
completing the work. Each of these activities were aligned with specific objectives and
are described in the intervention manual.</p>

available patient assistance and co-pay assistance programs for PrEP. Patient navigators

                <p>Trained study staff functioned as navigators for the study. Following assessment,
navigators provided information regarding PrEP, discussed available resources in the
community for prevention services with participants, and supported and motivated the
participant’s efforts to engage in HIV prevention strategies inclusive of PrEP. Patient
navigators collected semistructured study notes for each treatment arm participant
encounter on barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake. Navigators also discussed
strategies to overcome barriers. As part of the SBCM protocol, barriers confronted (eg,
difficulties scheduling appointment, communicating with provider, paying for visit, etc)
were assessed at each encounter and documented in these study notes.</p>

                <title>Assessment and Study Flow</title>
                <p>Assessments at baseline, 6-, and 12-week follow-up consisted of an
interviewer-administered questionnaire conducted in either English or Spanish, by
participant preference. Measures were aligned with the SBCM model. The length of the
baseline assessment was 30 to 45 minutes. Measures included sociodemographics, experiences
with PrEP and/or nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis, risk perception, risk
behaviors, current prevention strategies, experiences with providers and clinics on HIV
prevention care, perceived barriers and facilitators to obtaining PrEP, knowledge,
beliefs, and attitudes towards PrEP, adherence self-efficacy, health literacy and
numeracy, depression, quality of life, and social support.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome of completion of a visit with a PrEP provider was defined by
participant self-report. The PrEP initiation was defined as participant self-reported
receipt of a PrEP prescription and initiation of PrEP. Outcome measures were queried at 6
and 12 weeks and by brief time-matched check-ins at weeks 4 and 10 to ensure accurate
recording of events occurring between follow-up assessments. Time was scaled in weeks. If
a participant initiated PrEP within the 12-week observation period, the event was coded as
1; if there was no PrEP initiation within the observation period, this was coded as 0; and
participants lost to follow-up were censored and assigned a time of 16 weeks to ensure
that every participant is counted in the analysis.</p>

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>To address the primary study hypotheses that SBCM would increase the proportion of
participants who complete a physician visit for discussion of PrEP and start PrEP
medication, χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was conducted for each time point an assessment was
delivered to a participant. Participant’s reports of having made an appointment to see a
provider about PrEP and initiating PrEP within 12 weeks were yes–no scales asked at 4, 6,
8, and 12 weeks; if the participant was lost to follow-up, they were assigned a no
response. To assess time to obtaining PrEP, a Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis was
utilized. Time was scaled in weeks. If a participant initiated PrEP within the 12-week
observation period, the event was coded as 1; if there was no PrEP initiation within the
observation period, this was coded as 0; and participants lost to follow-up were censored
and assigned a time of 16 weeks. Censoring considers all participants by assigning a value
to each participant ensuring that every participant is counted in the analysis. The
Mantel-Cox log-rank test was used to compare the survival distributions of participants in
the control and treatment groups. Statistical analysis was conducted in R (RStudio version
1.0.153, 2009-2017; RStudio, Inc, Boston, MA, USA), using packages Survival and Mosaic.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>

                <p>A sample size of 61 participants gave stable estimates of rates in each group and had
over 80% power in uncovering absolute risk differences of 25% to 30% between groups.
Subgroups (race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, sexual behavior) were combined for
the primary analysis, and differences by subgroup presented descriptively with an emphasis
on effect size rather than hypothesis testing. We estimated that 75% of study participants
randomized to the intervention arm would achieve linkage.</p>
                <p>Barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake were examined using both descriptive analysis of
the repeated survey data and qualitative assessment of the study notes prepared by patient
navigators. Barriers were categorized as “logistical,” “financial,” “provider related,” or
“social.” Solutions offered by patient navigators to attempt to overcome each barrier were
recorded. Success obtaining PrEP medication was recorded by the type of barrier
encountered. The effort and extent of patient navigator contact with participants (number
of hours of active case management and number of encounters) was also calculated and
described.</p>

reached. Of those randomized to receive the control intervention, 18 (58.1%) of 31 were lost
to follow-up (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325958219848848">Figure 1</xref>). All

              <p>A 14% difference, which favored the treatment group over the control group (40% versus
25.8%), was seen in PrEP provider consultation by 6 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .367). At
the 12-week follow-up, there was a 21% difference between the treatment and control groups
(53.3% versus 32.3%), again favoring the treatment group (<italic>P</italic> = .096).</p>
              <p>Participants encountered numerous barriers during their attempts to obtain PrEP; a summary
of the barriers experienced by those in the intervention condition and potential strategies
offered by patient navigators to attempt to overcome them is provided in <xref rid="table3-2325958219848848" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All participants
experienced at least 1 barrier, with a median of barriers in 2 of the 4 categories (range:
1-3). Logistical barriers were reported by 70.0% (21/30) participants, financial barriers by
67.7% (20/30), provider-related barriers by 50.0% (15/30), and social by 16.7% (5/30). Rates
of PrEP initiation varied from 20.0% (1/5) for those experiencing social barriers to 53.3%
(8/15) for those experiencing provider-related barriers.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This pilot study explored the impact of providing an adapted SBCM intervention to high-risk
individuals with HIV seeking PrEP in the Miami metropolitan area. In our heterogeneous group
of largely racial/ethnic minority PrEP seekers, our SBCM-based patient navigation strategy
resulted <italic>in a nonsignificant</italic> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .1) difference
between the proportion of participants obtaining PrEP in the 2 study groups. Time to
initiating PrEP was longer than expected in both the SBCM intervention and control groups
(&gt;12 weeks), and loss-to-follow-up was frequent. Participant adherence to PrEP among
those successfully initiating PrEP medication was comparable and moderately high in both
groups.</p>
              <p>Prior studies have demonstrated that knowledge of PrEP and its efficacy does not
necessarily lead to successful PrEP linkage in real-world settings. Barriers to obtaining
PrEP that do not exist within the context of research studies can hinder PrEP initiation.
Some of these barriers include perceptions and realities of high cost and difficulty
identifying PrEP providers.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> While PrEP navigators are frequently employed within PrEP clinical settings, we
observed that, for many individuals, there is a need for navigation and assistance with the
process of identifying a PrEP provider. We also observed needs related to preparing for the
visit and provision of reassurance that financial and logistical barriers can indeed be
overcome. In fact, study navigators had to utilize several strategies in order to mitigate
barriers, found to be common, and which preceded an initial PrEP provider visit. As an
example, a register of provider contacts who were known to be PrEP competent was developed
and provided to participants as necessary. Navigators also scheduled PrEP visits for
participants when appropriate; for example, for participants who could not access a phone or
did not feel confident in scheduling the appointment themselves. Some participants had to be
informed and reminded of documentation they needed to bring with them to the appointment.
Further, study navigators often explained to participants how the utilization of certain
patient assistant programs could remove or at least reduce the costs associated with PrEP
initiation.</p>
              <p>We observed that ability to overcome barriers varied; “social” barriers, those related to
the need to disclose to or depend on others for PrEP access, were most difficult to
overcome. Several of study participants were insured through their parents but were
unwilling to disclose their PrEP seeking for various reasons. For these individuals, options
for PrEP linkage were very limited, as patient assistance programs are not available to
individuals who are insured. Thus, these participants could not utilize their insurance
without incurring the risk of discovery. In this instance, navigators provided contacts for
low-cost health resources for which participants would have to pay out of pocket for
services. Those participants who could not afford to pay (3 of 4) were unable to access
PrEP. This highlights a major need for interventions that address this PrEP access “donut
hole.” It also suggests there may be a potential benefit of providing PrEP navigation to
at-risk individuals who may have the knowledge and some financial means, but not the
complete capacity to acquire PrEP on their own.</p>
              <p>Further, prolonged appointment delays and need for multiple appointments prior to beginning
PrEP lead to discouragement and, frequently, abandonment of the process of obtaining PrEP.
Shorter time to initiation of PrEP has been associated with longer term outcomes such as
increased persistence in care.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Streamlining of appointments and protocols may allow more prompt initiation of PrEP
medication and improved overall engagement.</p>
              <p>Participants reported complicated processes and prolonged wait times for an appointment
with a provider, even when the patient navigator was involved, as reasons they discontinued
the process. A substantial number of participants in both the control and treatment groups
were lost to follow-up within the first 6 weeks of the study, and a lesser percentage
completed the study without initiating PrEP. As documented by the 4-week check-in, most
participants had at least attempted to schedule an appointment with a provider about getting
PrEP. This finding highlights the significance of barriers to PrEP during early stages of
attempting access and a need for interventions that improve linkage to PrEP providers.</p>
              <p>Administrative delays that compromise PrEP linkage in South Florida may result in
frustration and abandonment of PrEP seeking. As such, strategies that combine community
patient navigation, with streamlining of scheduling requirements, such as financial
assessments required at many Federally Qualified Health Centers, may be warranted. These
strategies should focus on direct and timely scheduling of a provider visit and immediate
PrEP initiation.</p>
              <p>While we did not observe any HIV seroconversion events in our short time frame and small
participant group study, delays of more than 3 months appointments also confer a risk of
seroconversion while awaiting PrEP for individuals at increased risk of HIV. Additional
strategies to improve timely and consistent linkage to PrEP providers may include tracking
of referrals and timeliness of appointment outcomes and directing PrEP-seeking patients to
the most effective providers</p>
              <p>Individuals at elevated risk of HIV acquisition may require additional support in
.attaining PrEP.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2325958219848848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The majority of this study’s sample was comprised of individuals from racial and
ethnic minorities with low income in South Florida; lower than expected success in obtaining
PrEP in both the control and the treatment groups suggests that persistent structural
barriers are in place that require additional targeted intervention. Although our SBCM
intervention was able to address some barriers among these populations, for example,
assistance with completing necessary paperwork and delivering information in a lay manner to
those who may be less literate, social obstacles such as need for documents from a spouse or
family member or concern about disclosure of PrEP use via insurance documentation was
difficult to overcome. Additionally, we observed that the indirect costs associated with
PrEP linkage such as those for transportation, absence from work, and obtaining
documentation were frequent but often overlooked barriers to obtaining PrEP. Facilitating
these logistical arrangements may ease entry into PrEP care.</p>
              <p>Limitations of our study include small and heterogeneous participant groups that preclude
subgroup analysis. As we were only able to recruit approximately 50% of eligible
participants, there is a risk that the study may overestimate the potential effectiveness of
the intervention in real-world settings. In contrast, our recruitment strategies may have
also enriched our study population for individuals having difficulty obtaining PrEP and
therefore may paint a more pessimistic picture of PrEP linkage that does not reflect the
experience of those with straightforward PrEP access not seeking the navigation assistance
offered through the study. Longer than expected wait times for appointments and
loss-to-follow-up prevented full assessment of the impact of the intervention; however, it
is likely that those that were lost did not initiate PrEP. Nevertheless, our study
participants reflect the social and economic demographics of many individuals at risk of HIV
infection in the United States. The PrEP-seeking experiences described here are likely
common to many others with socioeconomic challenges living in geographic areas with low
structural support for PrEP.</p>
              <p>Our pilot data suggest that barriers to PrEP access and linkage, among certain
disenfranchised groups, are extensively varied and systemic. As such, these barriers proved
to be somewhat difficult to overcome using this SBCM-based patient navigation intervention.
The intervention may still be a promising strategy for assisting PrEP seekers in obtaining a
medical provider visit and initiating PrEP. However, further research involving a more
substantial study sample is needed to determine whether this multifaceted approach,
combining SBCM strategies with improved structural support and provider education, is
effective in facilitating PrEP linkage and access.</p>
