                <p id="Par1">Edible insects are often considered a nutritious, protein-rich, environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional livestock with growing popularity among North American consumers. While the nutrient composition of several insects is characterized, all potential health impacts have not been evaluated. In addition to high protein levels, crickets contain chitin and other fibers that may influence gut health. In this study, we evaluated the effects of consuming 25 grams/day whole cricket powder on gut microbiota composition, while assessing safety and tolerability. Twenty healthy adults participated in this six-week, double-blind, crossover dietary intervention. Participants were randomized into two study arms and consumed either cricket-containing or control breakfast foods for 14 days, followed by a washout period and assignment to the opposite treatment. Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after each treatment period to assess liver function and microbiota changes. Results demonstrate cricket consumption is tolerable and non-toxic at the studied dose. Cricket powder supported growth of the probiotic bacterium, <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic>, which increased 5.7-fold. Cricket consumption was also associated with reduced plasma TNF-α. These data suggest that eating crickets may improve gut health and reduce systemic inflammation; however, more research is needed to understand these effects and underlying mechanisms.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">The human gastrointestinal tract is home to a host of bacterial cells. These cells outnumber human cells by a factor of three<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and encode at least 100 times more genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which influence human physiology, metabolism, and gene expression pertinent to immune function, energy, and even mood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Extensive research demonstrates that microbiota in the gut respond to nutritional cues and generate hormone-like signals influencing normal physiology, nutritional status, metabolism, immune function, as well as disease progression and overall wellbeing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Imbalances in the gut microbiota, also known as dysbiosis, and low microbial diversity are associated with metabolic and non-communicable diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, allergies, asthma, and even neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Diet is an especially relevant factor in defining the composition of gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and even small shifts have demonstrated meaningful effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Dietary diversity is linked with a more diverse, healthy microbiota that is more adept at adjusting to perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Indigestible dietary carbohydrates (dietary fibers) are the primary energy sources for gut microbiota, and thus shape microbial growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Not surprisingly, dietary fiber intake has been shown to contribute to the health of the gut microbiome by increasing diversity in fecal microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and high fiber intake has been associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, diverticular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, coronary heart disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Edible insects are hailed as an excellent source of protein and other nutrients, but they also provide a relatively understudied fiber source, chitin, that could influence the gut microbiota. For western consumers, edible insects are a novel food that is just now gaining traction in certain areas.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Motivations to eat insects stem from their cultural and nutritional value, as well as their numerous environmental benefits. The current pressures on global food security, including climate change, population growth, and shifting dietary preferences, have ignited a search for more environmentally sustainable protein sources. Given that livestock production alone is responsible for about 14.5% of total human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> there is a mounting need for more efficient animal production systems. Edible insects have been touted as one such option, as they typically emit fewer GHGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and require less land, water, and feed to survive and thrive than traditional livestock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The result is a significantly lower environmental impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and high desirability due in part to insects’ large edible body mass percentage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, high feed-conversion ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and ectothermic thermoregulation, which limits energy expenditure on temperature regulation.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, is not new however; it has been recorded throughout human history across the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Today, insects are regularly consumed by approximately 2 billion people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> spread across 80% of the world’s populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> in 130 countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Edible insects are gaining traction in North America and Europe, in addition to regions that traditionally practice entomophagy. The commercial industry was valued at 33 million USD in 2015, with future growth estimated at more than 40% by 2023<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Insects that have been eaten historically are generally considered safe for human consumption if properly processed like other animal products, although some people are allergic to insect proteins and chitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Generally, insects are a good source of bioavailable animal protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> including all essential amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, as well as B vitamins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, minerals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and essential fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Insects also contain relevant levels of crude fiber, most predominately in the form of chitin, derived from the exoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. A recent estimate of chitin and chitosan based on percent dry weight of whole ground crickets found values between 4.3–7.1% and 2.4–5.8%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Chitin (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>5</sub>N)<sub>n</sub>) is a modified polysaccharide (poly-beta-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine) containing nitrogen with a structure analogous to indigestible cellulose; it is considered an insoluble fiber with potential prebiotic properties that could benefit human health by selectively promoting the growth of beneficial bacterial species in the intestines, though this relationship is not well understood. Chitin is the primary component of the exoskeleton, respiratory linings, digestive and excretory systems of arthropods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and given the variation in insect anatomy chitin levels in common feeder insects vary widely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par7">While the nutritional value of edible insects is widely documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, other potentially beneficial properties of edible insects beyond nutrition have not been evaluated. To-date, no comprehensive clinical studies have investigated the impact of insect consumption on the human microbiome. Additionally, the health implications and the tolerability of insects, insect-based food, and insect-derived dietary fibers, including chitin, have not been assessed. The tolerability and safety of edible insects as a food and fiber source, as well as the effects of insect consumption on human microbiota, mucosal immunity, and other host parameters must be better understood in order to anticipate and optimize the effects of edible insects on human health for the 2 billion people that regularly eat them – as well as future consumers in the globally ascendant market for edible insects.</p>
              <p id="Par8">In this pilot study, we use a randomized, double blind, crossover diet intervention to evaluate the effect of consuming a commercially available 100% whole cricket powder (<italic>Gryllodes sigillatus</italic>) on gut microbiota composition in healthy adults. This study aims to determine if insect powder acts as a prebiotic, supporting growth of selective commensal bacterial species that confer health benefits. Additionally, we assessed safety and tolerability using comprehensive metabolic panels and gastrointestinal symptom questionnaires, several fecal metabolites, and markers of both systemic and local inflammation and immune function. The objective of this study was to gain baseline information regarding the impact of cricket consumption on gut microbiota in healthy adults, and to ascertain tolerability levels.

                <p id="Par9">Twenty healthy adults, aged 18–65 were recruited via flyer in Fort Collins, Colorado. Since no previous crossover trials have evaluated insect consumption impacts on microbiota, a sample size of 20, with balanced design and ten people per treatment, was selected for this pilot study using a 5% significance level (one-sided) to obtain 90% power. A crossover design was appropriate to address research questions and because intra-individual variances are lower than inter-individual variances. Eligibility was determined using an in-person eligibility screening questionnaire at an initial visit after which informed consent was obtained. Participants were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (a) younger than 18 or older than 65, (b) BMI outside of the 18.5–29.9 range, (c) pregnant or breastfeeding, (d) use of antibiotics in the last 2 months, (e) regular use of prebiotics or probiotics, (f) any intestinal or metabolic disease, cancer, liver or kidney disease g) self-reported presence of food allergies, (h) unwillingness to limit alcohol consumption to 1–2 drinks per day, no more than 7 per week, or (i) current medication or dietary supplement use that may impact gut microbiota. These conditions are known to affect baseline microbiota populations. Additionally, only healthy volunteers were selected because standard care practices for people with various medical conditions would confound measured endpoints, including microbiota composition. This would include taking statins, metformin, NSAIDs, MAO inhibitors, and botanical supplements that target the GI tract or gut microbiota. Healthy individuals are more likely to comply with study requirements and experience fewer adverse events. To be eligible, participants had to confirm willingness to eat one prepared breakfast per day (treatment or control) at home for a total of 28 days (two treatment periods of 14 days each), attend three clinic visits, and provide three blood and stool samples.</p>

An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to assess taxonomic differences across treatment groups, and genewise negative binomial GLM (DiffAbund; adjusted p-value for statistical significance was set as q &lt; 0.1) was used to determine differential analysis of taxa relative abundance between treatments. Measures of alpha (CHAO1 estimates, Shannon diversity index) and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis distances) were statistically analyzed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. All descriptive statistics were calculated using R (V 3.3.3).</p>

                <p id="Par39">A total of 1,304,100 reads were used for microbiota analysis, and 855 sequence variants were detected. No significant changes in phyla-level microbiota composition were observed across the treatment groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4[A]</xref>). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes made up ~90% of sequences at phyla level. There were also no significant differences in OTU richness or Shannon diversity scores. In general, inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition were greater than treatment effects. Principle Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) using Bray-Curtis distances suggests that samples from an individual were more similar than samples between individuals, regardless of treatment group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(B)</xref>); however, levels of response varied with certain individuals displaying a large amount of variability between sample time points (i.e., Hop4, Hop7, Hop15 and Hop20) (see Supplemental Materials Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Changes in Participant Microbiota at Baseline, Post-Cricket, and Post-Contro.

It is a measure of tolerance, and major shifts in sIgA might indicate reduced mucosal immunity (low levels) or an inflamed gut (high levels). No changes between baseline, treatment, and control were observed for fecal sIgA. We observed high sIgA heterogeneity across participants. Most participants in this study retained normal stool levels of sIgA (510–2040 µg/ml) at baseline and after consuming both the control breakfast and the cricket breakfast (see Supplemental Materials Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par44">The goal of this pilot cross-over study was to assess the tolerability and impact on the microbiota of consuming whole cricket powder. Findings suggest that consumption of 25 g of cricket (<italic>G</italic>. <italic>sigillatus</italic>) daily for 14 days is safe and does not yield adverse clinical outcomes. All 20 adult participants completed the study and self-reported consuming &gt; 85% of the allotted study foods, suggesting that study protocol was achievable for volunteers. The study utilized a balanced, even crossover design (AB/BA), along with a 2-week washout period, to prevent sequence carryover effects. Previous studies have indicated that diet-induced changes to the microbiota can revert to baseline levels within 24 hours of cessation of intervention foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Gastrointestinal symptom self-assessments and data from comprehensive metabolic panels suggest that cricket consumption was both safe and tolerable in our study population.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Cricket consumption during the study period did not dramatically disrupt the healthy adult microbiota. However, cricket intake was associated with an increase in abundance of five bacterial taxa, one of which most closely aligned to sequences of <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic>. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>animalis</italic> is a Gram-positive, non-spore forming, lactic acid producing bacteria. It is one of the best studied probiotics, and a commercial strain, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic> BB-12<sup>®</sup> has been shown in clinical studies to improve gastrointestinal function, protect against diarrhea, reduce side effects of antibiotic treatment, and increase resistance to common respiratory infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Chitooligosaccharides, similar to those found in cricket, are reported to be bifidogenic at between 0.1–0.5% <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. In culture, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>adolescentis</italic> can utilize N-acetylchitooligosaccharide as a carbon source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, this is the first time a whole food containing chitin has demonstrated bifidogenic potential in healthy humans.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Pathogen inhibition is one of the primary mechanisms by which probiotics influence human health, along with enhancing gut barrier function. Probiotics also interact with the immune system. In assays, BB-12<sup>®</sup> displayed antagonistic activity toward pathogens, including enteropathogenic microorganisms such as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cerus</italic>, demonstrating an ability to generate inhibitory zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. BB-12<sup>®</sup> also helps reduce cellular attachment of pathogens, as was demonstrated in a pig study where treatment of intestinal mucus with the probiotic significantly reduced adhesion of tested pathogens including <italic>Salmonella</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that BB-12<sup>®</sup> may be able to interact with immune cells and have an overall beneficial effect on immune system function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Cricket consumption was associated with suppression of <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> among participants. Increased relative abundance of <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> has been associated with linear growth deficits in infants from Malawi and Bangladesh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. While linear growth deficits are not relevant in the current study population, there may be important implications for cricket consumption in maternal and child health in low-resource settings. Another notable change in gut microbiota associated with cricket consumption included a 3 to 4-fold decreased abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>. (including <italic>L</italic>. <italic>reuteri</italic>) and <italic>Leuconostoc</italic>. Reduced abundance of certain LAB with cricket consumption could be related to substitutions made to breakfasts or potentially to the antimicrobial properties of chitin. LAB is common in yogurt, which is a typical breakfast food for many American consumers. We suspect that by fully substituting breakfasts for study participants, some observed decreases in LAB may be due to reduced ingestion of common LAB-containing foods. In addition, LAB are commonly consumed as supplemental probiotics. Although all participants were asked to stop consuming any probiotic supplements for at least one week prior to the start of the study and refrain from probiotic consumption throughout the study, it is possible that higher baseline levels might have reflected previous probiotic use. Future studies may consider collecting daily diet records in order to gain further understanding of how cricket consumption influences intake of other foods.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Moreover, chitooligosaccharides were previously shown to have potent inhibitory activity against <italic>Lactobacillus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, and chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, has antimicrobial activity against <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>. responsible for beer spoilage in breweries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. This suggests that treatment with chitin and chitosan may also exert effects on the microbiota through antimicrobial activity. Long-term impacts of cricket consumption on LAB require further investigation.</p>
              <p id="Par50">SCFAs serve as signaling molecules between microbiota and their human host, helping to regulate intermediate and peripheral metabolism. SCFAs are known to influence gut integrity, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, appetite regulation, and immune function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Fecal SCFAs levels are often reflective of dietary fiber intake and are generally thought of as a useful biomarker for gut microbiota activity and health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> even though 90–95% are typically absorbed in the intestines. This study assessed excreted SCFAs to measure changes in microbial metabolism. We observed small reductions in excreted acetate and propionate with cricket consumption, although butyrate levels were unchanged. These reductions suggest that the full breakfast substitution could have removed some crucial soluble fibers from the diet (e.g., oatmeal) which generate these SCFAs through fermentation. Alternatively, while chitin is found in shellfish and fungus, whole crickets are a novel food and fiber source in the diet of this target population. Thus, it is possible that participants’ gut microbes were not fully equipped to digest insect fibers. Previous research has shown that different consumer populations exhibit variable microbial activity when exposed to the same diet. For example, a recent study demonstrated that trimethylamine production from dietary carnitine found in red meat was a result of gut microbial metabolism in the gut of omnivores, whereas a vegetarian/vegan population consuming dietary carnitine lacked the necessary microbes for this conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Another study has suggested an extinction of microbes capable of metabolizing microbiota-accessible carbohydrates in populations that consume a typical western diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, supporting the hypothesis that an unadapted microbiota may not be able to utilize novel fiber sources like chitin.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Chitin may also be effective in the control of lipid absorption in the intestines. Chitin intake at 5% by weight of total food intake in rats led to lower total plasma cholesterol and lower LDL-cholesterol, as well as to higher excretion of triglycerides in feces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. However, we did not examine plasma lipids due to the short duration of the study, and our results did not indicate any changes in lipid metabolism as indicated by fecal triglyceride and bile acid secretion. These results are in concurrence with a pilot test of chitosan consumption in healthy adult men on a high fat diet, where they did not observe any effects on fat absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Finally, we examined parameters of mucosal immunity and systemic inflammation. Cricket consumption did not significantly alter sIgA, a measure of mucosal immunity. Low sIgA (&lt;510 µg/ml) is associated with compromised mucosal immunity, which could be related to a mild GI condition or stress while high sIgA (&gt;2000 µg/ml) typically occurs with pathogen exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. There was a high amount of variability in baseline sIgA and some individuals were either above or below the normal clinical range. However, a lack of treatment-related effects was likely due to the fact that our participants were primarily young, healthy normal weight adults. Since the majority of study participants were college students, it is reasonable to assume that stress-related factors could account for the baseline variability seen in this population.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Examination of 13 chemokines/cytokines revealed that TNF-α in plasma was reduced with cricket consumption relative to the control diet. TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and increased levels have been associated with intestinal inflammation and several inflammatory gut conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. TNF-α is upregulated downstream of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and reduced levels may be due to improvements in gut barrier function, resulting in less LPS translocation from the intestinal lumen into systemic circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Indeed, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> supplementation has been shown to modulate improvements in barrier function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. Additionally, clinically low ALP is associated with poor nutrient absorption, and some participants fell below the clinical reference range (42–141 U/L), although average ALP values were within range across treatments, suggesting increases were not pathological. Thus, our observation of significantly increased ALP combined with reduced circulating TNF-α may be indicative of an overall improvement in intestinal homeostasis. Moreover, the influence of diet on production of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α has been linked with a number of important health endpoints including cancer incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>, cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup> and major depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Whether consumption of edible insects should be recommended as a strategy to improve overall diet quality and positively influence these health endpoints requires additional empirical evidence.</p>
              <p id="Par54">This study provides preliminary evidence that edible cricket consumption at dose of 25 g per day is safe and may alter specific populations within the gut microbiota. Since participants’ diets outside of the provided breakfasts were not controlled, we cannot confirm that observed changes in measured outcomes were due exclusively to cricket consumption. However, cricket represents a novel food for American populations, and participants were instructed to continue to eat their regular diet during the study period. Additionally, we were unable to assess the dose response of cricket consumption in this study. More research, including clinical trials with greater sample sizes and completely controlled dietary interventions, is needed to assess the precise impact of cricket consumption on the healthy gut microbiota. Moreover, nutritional impacts of insects, specifically due to chitin, warrant further exploration; it is possible that dietary chitin interacts with nutrient absorption.</p>
              <p id="Par55">In the current study, it is impossible to conclude that the observed changes were due to chitin rather than to other insect components as we used a whole ground cricket powder in our study population. While cricket chitin may function as a prebiotic, dietary intervention studies that test chitin in isolation are needed to confirm prebiotic effects. Regardless of the function of specific cricket components, whole cricket powder consumption did not have any apparent negative effects on gut health in our healthy population and may have exerted some benefits. These findings suggest that evaluation of the impact of insect consumption on individuals with environmental enteropathy is warranted. The prevalence of entomophagy across parts of southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that currently face high rates of malnutrition and food insecurity raises an interesting question regarding the health benefits of insect consumption, as long-term dietary patterns are the primary determinants of taxonomic and functional structure of gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par56">To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to evaluate the impact of edible cricket consumption on the human gut microbiota. We provide evidence that cricket supplementation selectively changes the gut microbial and metabolite environment, but it does not dramatically shift the global gut microbiota after a 14-day dietary intervention. Similarly, we demonstrate that cricket consumption was safe over the study period and was not associated with major GI side-effects. These findings support the need for future research to evaluate the health impacts of edible insects, <italic>beyond</italic> their nutritional value, on human microbiota. This may be particularly relevant in populations at risk for malnutrition or environmental enteropathy. Further scrutiny is justified to determine how these observed changes translate into health outcomes. Studies with greater sample sizes, longer durations, and variable doses of insect consumption are warranted. It would also be prudent to evaluate the impact of isolated insect chitin on the gut, and to compare these findings with other studies that have investigated chitin and chitin derivatives from other sources. Studies enforcing a fully controlled dietary intervention are needed to elucidate the precise impact of cricket powder on microbiota without other confounding dietary factors. Lastly, we propose epidemiological studies of entomophagy among diverse populations that already consume insects to measure population level effects of insect consumption on the microbiome.</p>
