                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is preventable, as screening leads to the identification and removal of precancerous polyps. African-American men consistently have the highest CRC mortality rates, and their CRC-screening uptake remains low for complex reasons. Culture-specific masculinity barriers to care may contribute to the low uptake among African-American men. Examining these barriers to care is vital as CRC screening may challenge cultural role expectations of African-American men, whose tendency is to delay help-seeking medical care. Barbershops provide a pathway for reaching African-American men with masculinity barriers to care who are not regularly receiving healthcare services and CRC screening. This study aims to develop and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific, barbershop-based intervention targeting masculinity barriers to care and CRC-screening uptake among African-American men ages 45–75.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Guided by the theory of planned behaviour and the behaviour change wheel, we will use a multistage mixed-methods study design, beginning with an exploratory sequential approach to validate items for subsequent use in a pilot mixed-methods intervention. First, we will collect and analyse qualitative data from focus groups, cognitive interviews and expert item review to validate and test a culture-specific Masculinity Barriers to Care Scale (MBCS) among African-American men. Next, we will administer the MBCS to our target population as an online quantitative survey and evaluate the association between scores and CRC-screening uptake. Then, we will consider existing evidence-based approaches, our integrated results (qualitative +quantitative), and community input to design a culture-specific, behavioural intervention aimed at increasing CRC-screening uptake among African-American men and feasible for barbershop delivery. We will test the peer intervention in a pilot study with a two-arm cluster randomised design (six barbershops, randomised by site) to reduce contamination and account for barbershop culture differences. Our primary outcomes for the pilot are recruitment, sample size estimation, preliminary efficacy and acceptability.</p>

                  <p>By drawing on constructs of the theory of planned behaviour and the behaviour change wheel, our study will be among the first to offer a structured approach to designing a behavioural change focused, culture-specific arm for our pilot intervention, while considering a range of psychosocial factors associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among African-American men.</p>

                  <p>Our study proposes a new, culture-specific Masculinity Barriers to Care Scale for understanding and reducing CRC-screening disparities among African-American men.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>Given the rising CRC burden among young adults, our study engages African-American men starting at age 45 years.</p>
                </list-item>

              <p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most treatable and preventable cancers. Despite CRC screening’s (CRCS) life-saving potential, however, nearly 28% of Americans aged 50–75 years have not received timely screening.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Across all gender and racial/ethnic groups, African-American men have the highest CRC mortality and shortest survival.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In 2010, national CRCS uptake rates among African Americans (56%) were significantly lower than among non-Hispanic whites (62%).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> CRC incidence and mortality rates are 27% and 52% higher, respectively, among African-American men than among non-Hispanic white men.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 6</xref></p>

                <title>Recommendations for CRCS</title>
                <p>The US Preventive Services Task Force endorses a CRC-screening age range of 50–75 years for average-risk men and screening initiation at age 40 years for those with a family history of CRC.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Because African-American men are more likely than non-Hispanic white men to be diagnosed at both a younger age and a more advanced disease stage,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the American College of Gastroenterology has lowered its recommended age of screening initiation to 45 years for African-American men.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3 8</xref> The proportion of CRC cases diagnosed in individuals aged under 55 years has doubled in the past two decades, and CRC incidence among younger adults (aged 35–49 years), including African-American men, is predicted to increase 28%–46% by 2030.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>

                <title>Masculinity and psychosocial factors may contribute to low CRCS</title>
                <p>Masculinity is an important aspect of gendered and cultural identity for men<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> and plays a critical role in African-American men’s healthcare use, health behaviours and mortality.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref> Because CRCS challenges some cultural role expectations of African-American men, who tend to delay seeking medical care, examination of masculinity barriers to care is perilous. However, the specific influence of cultural masculinity perceptions on African-American men’s CRCS rates is not well studied. An unacknowledged sense of vulnerability that conflicts with culturally accepted gender norms is also often inherent in men’s experience of CRCS. Previous research suggests that inadequate existing validated measures and biases towards Western culture (norms, values, customs, etc, associated with Europe and European descent) may explain the absence of a significant association between masculinity and CRCS attitudes among African-American men.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–23</xref> In a systematic review of the literature examining connections between masculinity, racism, social support and CRCS uptake among African-American men,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> few studies have examined how masculinity relates to poor CRCS uptake and, of these, none used validated measures. Further, no validated masculinity measures have been developed for African-American men in the context of CRCS uptake or medical care.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 24 25</xref></p>
                <p>Consideration of how psychosocial factors relate to CRCS uptake is also critical. Previous research<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref> with African-American men has documented the influence of factors such as attitudes, knowledge, racism and perceived barriers (eg, embarrassment, fear) on CRCS. Medical mistrust is another widely cited attitudinal barrier to CRCS and treatment seeking<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 26 27</xref> and is related to the low health services utilisation among African-American men,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> yet it is unclear whether trust-related barriers are related to CRCS.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 26–31</xref> Since each of the aforementioned factors represents deeply intricate aspects of the social milieu in which African-American men make health decisions, the first author leads the creation and psychometric evaluation of the reliability and validity of his Male Role Norms, Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceptions associated with CRCS (MKAP-CRCS) survey.<sup>21</sup> On average, our sample of young adult African-American men (ages 19–45) disagreed with traditional masculinity ideology—as measured by the 21-item Male Role Norms Inventory-Short Form (MRNI-SF) scale.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Our principal component analysis revealed the MKAP-CRCS measure was psychometrically sound, but some participants may have withdrawn prematurely from the MRNI-SF portion as they found the measures’ norms offensive/taboo, or felt awkward sharing beliefs about the roles expected of men. We concluded that research focused on developing a scale explicitly considering African-American men’s masculinity beliefs in the medical care context and with more rigorous psychometric assessments (eg, exploratory factor analysis) is needed.</p>

                <title>Barbershops as a site for interventions to improve CRCS</title>
                <p>Barbershops serving African-American men are favourable settings for reaching our target population.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Previous multicomponent, barbershop-based trials have been conducted with African-American men on HIV risk reduction, prostate cancer education, heart disease control and hypertension detection.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34–36</xref> Few trials of CRCS uptake among African-American men have found significant results. The MISTER B study, the first and to date only barbershop-based CRCS trial, tested a phone-based patient-navigation intervention to urge CRCS among older (mean age 57 years), low-income African-American men with uncontrolled hypertension.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Intervention completion was associated with a 16-fold increase in the odds of CRCS uptake by 6 months; however, although nearly 70% of participants voiced the intent to obtain colonoscopy screening in the next 6 months, only 17% in the intervention groups and 8% in the control group did so. Our study will help fill this gap between uptake and intention by creating a new, culture-specific intervention that directly addresses masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors and CRCS uptake among African-American men beginning at age 45, then test its feasibility and acceptability in a cluster randomised pilot intervention (at the barbershop level).</p>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p>Disparities associated with CRCS uptake for African-American men, the failure of previous interventions to significantly increase screening rates, and the novel idea of using the barbershop as an intervention setting led to the current study, with the following objectives: (1) validate and test a culture-specific Masculinity Barriers To Care Scale (MBCS) relative to psychosocial factors and CRCS uptake among African-American men and (2) develop and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific peer intervention that targets masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors and uptake of CRCS (specifically, of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT)) among African-American men. Culture-specific refers to the embodiment of ‘an (African-American male’s) real-life experiences within a given cultural context (eg, neighbourhood) and his understanding of those experiences.’<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p>

We will begin with an exploratory sequential approach intended to validate items for subsequent use in a pilot mixed-methods intervention. For Objectives 1A and 1B (years 1–2), we will collect and analyze qualitative data from focus groups, cognitive interviews and expert item review to validate and test a culture-specific MBCS among African-American men. Questions for the MCBS will stem from modifications to the (1) the <italic>Barriers to</italic> Help<italic>-Seeking Scale</italic> developed by Mansfield <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> (2) the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale developed by Thompson <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> (3) Mincey <italic>et al</italic> Masculinity Inventory Scale,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> (4) the MRNI-SF by Levant <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Bowleg <italic>et al</italic> Black Men’s Experiences Scale,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and the Masculinity Salience scale developed by Hammond <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Six factors are expected for the underlying structure of the 21 items in the MBCS: (1) need for control and self-reliance, (2) minimising health problems and resignation (3) medical mistrust, (4) privacy, (5) emotional control and (6) black masculinity. For all factors, individual items will be assessed on a Likert-type scale. Higher scores will indicate a greater degree of endorsement of masculinity barriers to care. Next, we will administer the MBCS as an online quantitative survey of our target population to evaluate the association between scale scores and CRCS uptake.</p>

To reduce contamination and account for differences in barbershop culture, we will pilot test the peer intervention in a two-arm cluster randomised intervention (six barbershops, with participants randomised by site). Our primary outcomes for the pilot are recruitment, sample size estimation, preliminary efficacy and acceptability. We will also conduct postintervention interviews with participants from both arms to evaluate acceptability (ie, why and how each arm was or was not successful). To ensure confidentiality, data dispersed to project team members will be blinded of any identifying participant information.</p>

                  <p>During year 2, we will recruit 400 African-American men to complete an online survey, administered via smartphone, to test the relationship between masculinity barriers to care and CRCS. Eligible respondents are men who (1) self-describe as non-Hispanic black/African American; (2) were born in the USA; (3) are aged 45–75 years; (4) reside in the Salt Lake City or Twin Cities metro area; (5) have a telephone with internet access and (6) speak English. With the aid of barbers and culture-specific marketing materials, we will recruit participants from African-American male serving barbershops. Survey participants will have the opportunity to participate in drawings for one of five incentives: (1) a US$50 visa gift card, (2) a US$75 gas station gift card, (3) a US$100 grocery store gift card, (4) an Apple iPad or (5) Samsung 43’ 4K UHDTV.</p>
                  <p>Barbershops are cultural hubs of trust essential in the growth and development of African-American men. Men usually spend at least 30 min waiting for or getting a haircut or chatting with others in the barbershop. Using PsychData, participants will be able to complete our survey within 15 min on their smartphones while waiting for or getting a haircut in participating barbershops. PsychData prevents survey alterations and eliminates transcription errors.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> The PI has a successful record of recruiting African-American men to complete surveys using mobile technology,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 21 22</xref> and African Americans outpace all groups for smartphone use.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> For men who want to complete the survey but do not own a smartphone, each participating barbershop will be provided one smartphone courtesy of the study.</p>

                  <p>With a sample of 400 African-American men, we will have 80% power at the 0.05 level to detect a masculinity barriers to care effect on the odds of having had CRCS, assuming 35% of men with a masculinity barriers to care index equal to the mean have had CRCS compared with 25% of men with a masculinity barriers to care index 1 SD above the mean. We estimate that the average screening rate will be 35%, as the screening rate for African Americans is 53.1% in Utah and 52% in Minnesota and African-American men in both states tend to have lower CRCS rates than women.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6 12 45</xref> This assumes a moderately strong relationship between the masculinity barriers to care index and confounders (ie, R<sup>2</sup>=0.25 for the linear model that regresses the masculinity barriers to care index on the confounders). If the relationship between the confounders and the masculinity index is weaker, the power will be higher: 82% power with R<sup>2</sup>=0.2% and 87% power with R<sup>2</sup>=0.1. Power calculations were performed using PASS V.15.</p>

                  <p>We will test for associations between masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors and CRCS uptake. Our central hypothesis is that masculinity barriers to care will be negatively associated with CRC S uptake. The masculinity barriers to care items emerging from objective 1 will be used to create a latent variable that represents the construct being measured. The CRCS uptake outcome will be a binary variable that indicates whether a participant self-reported CRCS uptake (ie, answered yes to either BRFSS dependent-variable question). We will fit a structural equation model with CRCS uptake as the outcome and masculinity barriers to care as the predictor. We will adjust for potential confounders (eg, age, educational level). We will also present the estimate and 95% CI for the OR comparing the odds of CRCS uptake between participants with a one-point difference in masculinity barriers to care scores. Descriptive statistics will summarise the participants’ characteristics.</p>

                <p>We anticipate that the culture-specific arm will include at least two core components: barbers as motivational interviewers and InSure FIT kits distributed by barbers. MI is ‘a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person’s own motivation and commitment to change.’<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> Telephone-based MI is an effective way to improve cancer screening among under-represented groups. Community-member–led MI has proved successful, but it is unknown if barbers as motivational interviewers can assist with reducing CRCS inequalities among African-American men.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70–73</xref> Also, randomised trials have shown that the FIT is the first-choice fecal occult blood test for CRCS, is less invasive, less costly and may be better accepted than other CRCS tests.<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref> If we choose this route for the culture-specific arm, preliminary data from our barbers suggest that the PI may teach the barbers the MI technique using content stems from objective 1 findings. Additional components for this arm may be developed during the APEASE process.</p>
                <p>Based on the PI’s research<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref> and evidence-based strategies,<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> the control arm will include an informational CRCS brochure developed by the American Cancer Society<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> plus an FIT kit distributed by the barbers. Since the FIT kits will be free and the study will cover postage and processing fees, participants will be able to complete screening regardless of whether they have health insurance. Participants will mail the completed FIT kits to our local laboratory for processing. We will refer participants with positive FIT results to Huntsman Cancer Institute for a colonoscopy.</p>

                <title>Participants and procedures</title>
                <p>Intervention participants will be non-Hispanic black/African-American men (n=60) who (1) have never completed CRCS; (2) are aged 45–75 years; (3) were born in the USA; (4) reside in the Salt Lake City metro area; (5) have a telephone with internet access and (6) speak English. As a feasibility intervention, sample size is not based on the power to detect a certain effect size.<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> Rather, n=60 (30 per arm) was chosen based on practical considerations (eg, cost, recruitment).</p>
                <p>The intervention will comprise a recruitment phase and an implementation phase. The recruitment phase will occur during the last 6 months of year 3. With the assistance of barbers and culture-specific marketing materials, we will enrol 10 eligible African-American men at each of 6 barbershops. At baseline, participants will complete the demographic portion of our online survey. Once total enrolment is reached and consent obtained, the six barbershops will be randomised to the culture-specific or control arm using a permuted block size of 6. Then the implementation phase will begin. These distinct phases provide advantages in a cluster randomised design. First, we eliminate recruitment bias as we blind participants to the intervention at enrolment.<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> Second, the distinct phases allow each man to be exposed to the intervention for the same amount of time. We foresee the recruitment phase lasting 3 months and the implementation phase 7 months, resulting in a 10-month intervention, allowing ample time for participants to obtain CRCS.</p>
                <p>During the last 6 months of year 4, our coding team will conduct exit interviews. Prior literature documents that 6–12 individual interviews per homogeneous group are sufficient to reach data saturation.<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78 79</xref> Thus, 18 in-depth, 60 min participant interviews (2 participants from each of the 6 barbershops plus 3 barbers from each arm) will permit us to obtain rigorous outcomes data as well as participant accounts of what worked well and what did not for our two-arm intervention’s implementation.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>African-American men have the highest CRC mortality across all gender and racial/ethnic groups. Moreover, national findings predict a 28%–46% increase in CRC incidence among adults ages 35–49 years, including African-American men, by 2030.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our study aims to aid in reducing CRCS inequities among African-American men by creating a new, culture-specific intervention that directly addresses masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors, and CRCS uptake among African-American men beginning at age 45 years. Subsequently, we will test its feasibility and acceptability in a cluster randomised pilot intervention.</p>
              <p>Completing our objective will provide the preliminary data needed for an R01 application to test the new intervention’s efficacy in a large-scale, well-powered, cluster randomised controlled trial. More broadly, this research will demonstrate that decisions regarding CRCS uptake are not detached from cultural and other influences. We will use the culture-specific survey instrument we create to more rigorously assess the association between masculinity barriers to care and CRCS uptake. This will strengthen our scale’s predictive utility while endorsing optimal health for African-American men as warranted by Healthy People 2020.<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Additionally, our scale could be adapted for use in research on other types of cancer (eg, prostate cancer) that disproportionately affect African-American and other under-represented men.</p>
              <p>Overall, our efforts will serve as a model for more culture-specific tailored approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment, a goal aligned with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Moonshot initiative.</p>
