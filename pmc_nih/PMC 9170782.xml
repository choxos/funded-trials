                <p id="Par1">Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder that is commonly treated with glucocorticoids. An imprecise understanding of the immunologic changes underlying sarcoidosis has limited therapeutic progress. Here in this open-label trial (NCT03910543), 10 patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis are treated with tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor. The primary outcome is the change in the cutaneous sarcoidosis activity and morphology instrument (CSAMI) activity score after 6 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes included change in internal organ involvement, molecular parameters, and safety. All patients experience improvement in their skin with 6 patients showing a complete response. Improvement in internal organ involvement is also observed. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived IFN-γ is identified as a central cytokine mediator of macrophage activation in sarcoidosis. Additional type 1 cytokines produced by distinct cell types, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-15 and GM-CSF, also associate with pathogenesis. Suppression of the activity of these cytokines, especially IFN-γ, correlates with clinical improvement. Our results thus show that tofacitinib treatment is associated with improved sarcoidosis symptoms, and predominantly acts by inhibiting type 1 immunity.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder that most commonly affects the lungs, however, any organ including the skin can be involved. Glucocorticoid-based regimens (prednisone and corticotropin gel) are the only approved therapies. Prednisone remains the recommended first-line treatment for both pulmonary and extra-thoracic sarcoidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, this is not ideal as chronic therapy is often required and glucocorticoid-associated toxicities are common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Methotrexate is commonly used as a steroid-sparing agent, but it is often inadequate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. TNF inhibitors have also been evaluated; however, the benefit in controlled trials has been marginal, with several studies finding no benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. TNF inhibitors can also induce or exacerbate sarcoidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A hallmark of sarcoidosis is the non-caseating granuloma, which is observed microscopically in affected tissues. Although the pathogenesis of granuloma formation in sarcoidosis is incompletely understood, it appears to involve coordinated activity of several cytokines, chemokines, and other signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. While many studies have identified a predominantly type 1 immune response in sarcoidosis (e.g. cytokines including IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-γ); others have identified type 3 cytokines (e.g. IL-17 family), or co-production of Type 1 (IFN-γ) and Type 3 (IL-17) cytokines (Th17.1 phenotype)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Other studies have even implicated Type 2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, the core cytokine drivers of this disease, and those correlating most closely with disease activity and response to therapy, remain imprecisely defined and have hindered therapeutic progress in sarcoidosis.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Many cytokines implicated in sarcoidosis including IFN-γ and IL-2 (Type 1), IL-23 (Type 3), and IL-4 and IL-13 (Type 2) signal via the JAK – signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Indeed, JAK-STAT pathway activation has been reported in tissues and blood of patients with sarcoidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. JAK inhibitors are oral small molecules that attenuate the activity of JAK-STAT-dependent cytokines. We and others have recently described effective treatment of individual patients with sarcoidosis using tofacitinib (JAK1/3 &gt; 2 inhibitor) or ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor); however, this approach has not yet been evaluated in a prospective fashion and the key cytokines targeted remain to be fully elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Given the potential promise of JAK inhibition, through inhibition of cytokine activity, in sarcoidosis, here we prospectively evaluate tofacitinib in 10 patients with long-standing cutaneous sarcoidosis (mean duration: 13.2 years), 9 of whom had internal organ involvement. In all 10 patients, disease control with a tofacitinib-based regimen was superior to the preceding immunotherapeutic regimen, particularly for skin involvement. Molecular analyses identify type 1 cytokines (particularly IFN-γ, but also IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and GM-CSF), but not type 2 or type 3 cytokines, as being activated at baseline and correlating closely with disease activity and response to therapy. Overall, JAK inhibition appears to be effective in sarcoidosis and larger studies to further evaluate this therapeutic approach are warranted.</p>

                <p id="Par31">Given the similarity in the pattern of baseline immune dysregulation between complete and partial responders, we wondered if the magnitude of the dysregulation might play a role in the degree of improvement observed with therapy. To examine this, we overlaid 1) proteins upregulated in sarcoidosis plasma at baseline versus controls with 2) proteins modulated by tofacitinib therapy in sarcoidosis plasma, and in doing so revealed a 14-protein plasma signature of sarcoidosis that we termed, “sarcoidosis plasma signature” (SPS). The SPS included IFN-γ, IFN-γ targets (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11), macrophage activation proteins (CHIT1, CHI3L1, and FBP1) and TNF <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9d</xref><bold>)</bold>. We then evaluated whether differences in SPS profiles correlated with response to tofacitinib. To do so, we compared SPS levels in the 4 best responders (retrospectively defined as a complete response in skin and complete/near complete response internal organs) to the other 5 patients <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9e</xref><bold>)</bold>. We found that the best responders group tended to have lower baseline levels of SPS and tofacitinib resulted in relative normalization of SPS to levels comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, the other patients tended to have higher baseline SPS activity (or were heavily immunosuppressed when the baseline samples were collected, e.g. Pt4 and Pt5) with SPS levels tending to remain elevated above those seen in healthy controls even with tofacitinib <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9d</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>

                <p id="Par32">Given that relatively higher baseline SPS levels in plasma and persistent IFN-γ activity in skin were associated with partial improvement on tofacitinib, we hypothesized that in some patients, a higher dose of tofacitinib might be required. In order to explore this further, a single patient with partial improvement in cutaneous, pulmonary, and extra-thoracic lymph node sarcoidosis after 6 months of tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily during the trial <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9f, g</xref><bold>)</bold> was subsequently treated with a higher dose of tofacitinib (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg at night) obtained through insurance after the trial.

A relative normalization of the SPS signature was also observed on the higher dose <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9h</xref><bold>)</bold>. In an additional partial responder, we have since archived a complete cutaneous response by increasing tofacitinib to 10 mg twice daily.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par33">In this open-label trial of tofacitinib, we demonstrate efficacy in 10 sarcoidosis patients with cutaneous involvement. In all 10 patients, disease control with a tofacitinib-based regimen was superior to the patients preceding immunotherapeutic regimen, particularly for skin involvement. Four of five patients entering the study taking prednisone were able to discontinue or significantly reduce the dose.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Our mechanistic evaluation suggested that IFN-γ is a key driver of sarcoidosis and is a critical cytokine targeted by tofacitinib with effective treatment. This observation is consistent with prior work showing that IFN-γ is elevated in circulation and in tissues of sarcoidosis patients and correlates with disease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and makes teleological sense given the fundamental role of IFN-γ in classical macrophage activation, granuloma formation, and protection against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Tofacitinib appears to provide an effective means of suppressing IFN-γ, which signals via JAK1/2, in sarcoidosis.</p>
              <p id="Par35">We also found that the activity of other cytokines including GM-CSF (JAK2), IL-15 (JAK1/3), IL-6 (JAK1/2), IL-12 (JAK2/TYK2) and TNF (JAK-independent) are also evident in sarcoidosis. GM-CSF has been shown to promote the differentiation of monocytes into inflammatory macrophages in autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, IL-15 can re-enforce CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell effector responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and IL-6 is an additional proinflammatory cytokine implicated as a potential treatment in sarcoidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. IL-12 has previously been implicated in sarcoidosis, however, interestingly, a clinical trial using ustekinumab, an inhibitor of p40 (both IL-12 and IL-23) was not effective in pulmonary sarcoidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This suggests that isolated inhibition of IL-12 in sarcoidosis may be insufficient. Although we do not exclude a role for TNF in sarcoidosis, we do implicate these additional cytokines that may need to be inhibited for maximal response to therapy. A potential advantage of JAK inhibition (compared to TNF inhibition) is the simultaneous, direct inhibition of multiple cytokines. Furthermore, we observe a reduction in TNF production and activity with tofacitinib, suggesting that TNF production may occur, at least in part, downstream of these JAK-STAT dependent cytokines.</p>
              <p id="Par36">While all patients improved, some patients still had disease activity on tofacitinib. This was associated with incomplete suppression of IFN-γ, suggesting that higher doses might be required in some patients. Indeed, in a single patient, and later an additional patient, after the trial period, a higher dose of tofacitinib led to remission of disease. This is consistent with a prior case report, showing a better response of widespread sarcoidosis to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily than to 5 mg twice daily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moving forward, improved suppression of IFN-γ activity could be achieved by either an increased dose of tofacitinib in some patients, or potentially, by evaluation of more targeted JAK inhibitors, such as a JAK1- or JAK1/2-specific inhibitors.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Limitations of the study include the small sample size and focus on cutaneous disease. Also, all patients had cutaneous involvement and thus may not be fully representative of sarcoidosis as a whole, where cutaneous involvement is present in about 1/3 of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. These data are promising and support further evaluation of JAK inhibition in the treatment of sarcoidosis.</p>

CSAMI is a validated cutaneous sarcoidosis scoring tool that incorporates the degree of inflammation, induration, and surface change in lesions as well as the amount of skin affected into the score. In general, patients with a score of ≥10 would be considered candidates for systemic therapy based on the degree of their cutaneous involvement. Patients less than 18 years of age, with a history of chronic, untreated infections, and malignancy were excluded. Nine patients also had internal organ involvement, including pulmonary involvement (3 patients had a history of Scadding stage 1 disease and 6 patients a history of Scadding stage 2 disease) <bold>(</bold>Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref><bold>)</bold>, but presence or absence of internal organ involvement was not used as a criterion to determine eligibility. All participants, including the healthy controls, provided written informed consent, including consent to publish clinical images. Participants were compensated 50 USD for each clinic visit and 250 USD for each PET scan. The data was collected at the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, United States.

Only the activity portion of the CSAMI instrument was utilized for this study.

A separate, 8 min single bed position cardiac acquisition was then performed (cardiac protocol described further below).</p>
                <p id="Par48">Resting Rb-82 perfusion imaging was processed and interpreted visually with 4DM (Invia). Quantitative and visual analysis of cardiac FDG uptake was performed on the AW software platform (GE) on the dedicated 3D cardiac acquisition window (single 47 slice bed position) and reported as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. (Quantitative and visual analysis of extra-cardiac FDG update is described below.) When present, the relationship between the location of inflammation and perfusion defects was characterized. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) in the heart was used to represent the peak level of inflammation. The volume of inflamed myocardium, cardiac metabolic volume (CMV), was identified as myocardium exceeding a SUV threshold that was derived for each patient by multiplying the left ventricular (LV) blood pool (background) activity by 1.5 as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

This tool allows semi-automatic determination of maximal and mean standardized uptake values (SUV) (SUV<sub>max</sub> and SUV<sub>mean</sub>, respectively), metabolic tumor volume (MTV, cm<sup>3</sup>), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG, product of SUV<sub>mean</sub> and MTV) of individual sarcoidosis lesions, and subsequent automatic calculation of MTV and TLG for the whole body. In the absence of a dedicated inflammatory lesion lexicon, the oncology lexicon was used to define metabolic parameters for sarcoidosis burden assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The initial automatic segmentation (lesion contouring) performed by the software was based on a predefined threshold which was defined by placing a 3 cm diameter sphere in the right lobe of the liver. The threshold value was determined using 1.5 * liver SUV<sub>mean</sub> + 2 * liver standard deviation, as defined by PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. All voxels above this value were segmented and volumetrically separate regions were made into single volumes of interest (VOIs). The automatic segmentation was subsequently corrected by consensus of 3 readers, a dual-boarded radiologist and nuclear medicine physician (15 years of experience) (D.P.), a board-certified cardiologist (B.D.Y.), and a board-certified dermatologist (W.D.). During the correction process, the readers rejected false-positive lesions (mostly attributed to physiological uptake or pathologic uptake deemed sarcoidosis-unrelated) and made any necessary additional edits (modifying segmentation to avoid physiological uptake). All regions were combined into a total lesion burden VOI that encompassed all approved lesions for that timepoint.</p>
                <p id="Par52">All lesions were tracked across time at the follow-up study. On follow-up scan, we placed a liver reference region in the right lobe of the liver to calculate the threshold value specific to this timepoint.

We adjusted the tracked lesion VOIs as described above, if necessary. Next, similarly to the baseline timepoint, the rest of the image volume, not including the tracked lesions, was segmented with the PERCIST value specific to the follow-up timepoint. We followed the same steps as described above on the baseline timepoint to approve and finalize a total lesion burden VOI for the follow-up timepoint.</p>
                <p id="Par53">The software then calculated all metabolic parameters from the total lesion burden VOI based on final lesion contours created by semi-automatic segmentation and individually tracked lesions were compared across both timepoints.

                <p id="Par54">For internal organ involvement, complete/near complete response was defined retrospectively as reduction of TLG by 98% or greater after 6 months of therapy. Partial response was defined as any reduction in the TLG less than 98% after 6 months of therapy.</p>

Clusters consisting of cells with low/null expression of <italic>GAPDH</italic> (non-cells) were removed from further analysis using the SubsetData command, resulting in 24,034 cells for analysis. For lung BAL samples, we analyzed scRNA-seq data from Liao et al. (<italic>n</italic> = 4 sarcoidosis BAL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and Mould et al. (<italic>n</italic> = 10 control BAL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To minimize potential batch effects, we normalized reads with SCTransform and integrated the data using the reciprocal PCA method with Seurat (v4.0.4) for analysis of the pulmonary sarcoidosis samples. The resulting data was visualized by performing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction.</p>

For immune cell subsets, cell type assignments for each cluster were verified by comparing with ImmGen datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. T cell, myeloid cell, and fibroblast clusters were subsetted, and singlets were re-analyzed separately using the approach described above. Stacked histogram plots were generated in R (Version 3.6.0) using ggplot2 (v3.3.3), ggrepl (v0.9.1) and dplyr (v1.0.3) were used to generate dot plots.</p>

Canonical pathways, upstream regulator and causal network analyses were utilized to compare differentially expressed gene lists generated using Seurat (scRNA-seq) or Partek Flow Version 9.0 (bulk RNAseq). ggplot2 v3.3.3, ggrepl (v0.9.1) and dplyr (v1.0.3) were used to visualize the results by plotting Z-score versus p-value. Selected genes or pathways were labeled at the investigators’ discretion. Heatmaps were generated using gplots (v3.0.4) heatmap.2 function. Raw values were scaled using the scale function. Manhattan clustering was utilized. For Cellphone DB (version 2.1.4), normalized counts and meta data were exported from Seurat and imported into CellphoneDB. The statistical_analysis command was used. Dotplots were generated using the dot_plot command.</p>

Samples were compared to 11 healthy, roughly age matched controls <bold>(</bold>Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref><bold>)</bold>. Blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and centrifuged; the buffy coat was removed and stored separately from the plasma, which was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Plasma was analyzed using the Olink Explore 1536 panel. This is a multiplexed panel that quantifies 1536 protein analytes simultaneously using a proximity extension approach. Detection of individual proteins requires binding by two matched, oligo-barcoded antibody pairs for each target. When both antibodies are bound, the oligo tags come in close proximity to each other and hybridize forming a unique template for DNA polymerase-dependent extension. After PCR amplification, next generation sequencing is performed and processed by Olink (Boston, Massachusetts). Log-fold changes and p values were calculated for pre- vs post- treatment and pre-treatment vs healthy. The data was then imported into R (Version 3.6.0) to generate heatmaps and volcano plots using ggplot2 (v3.3.3), ggrepl (v0.9.1), gplots (v3.1.1) and dplyr (v1.0.3).</p>

There were 76 patients in the GRADS dataset with untreated sarcoidosis available for analysis, including 24 untreated Scadding stage 1, 40 untreated stage 2/3, and 12 untreated stage 4 patients. We downloaded and analyzed the FPKM data contained in the file ‘GSE109516_SARCOIDOSIS_fpkmdata_BAL_clean_withannot_ gradsids_added.tsv’ for these sarcoidosis patients. A total of 6 healthy control patients had data available for analysis from the GSE136587 dataset. FPKM data was not provided, so we uploaded the raw data into Partek Flow version 9 using the BioProject ID PRJNA562768. We performed quality control by trimming low quality bases from the 3′ ends and removing low quality reads; this was done using the ‘trim bases’ tool with the default settings. Next, we mapped reads to the hg38 reference genome using STAR and quantified the aligned reads to an annotation model. Gene counts were then normalized using Cufflinks to calculate FPKMs. FPKM data for sarcoidosis and control samples was imported into Python (Version 3.8.8) and gene expression levels were visualized and compared using the boxplot and swarmplot functions from Seaborn (v0.11.1).</p>
