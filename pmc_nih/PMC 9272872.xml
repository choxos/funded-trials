                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The purpose of this study is to describe and assess a remote height and weight protocol that was developed for an ongoing trial conducted during the SARS COV-2 pandemic.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Thirty-eight rural families (children 8.3 ± 0.7 years; 68% female; and caregivers 38.2 ± 6.1 years) were provided detailed instructions on how to measure height and weight. Families obtained measures via remote data collection (caregiver weight, child height and weight) and also by trained staff. Differences between data collection methods were examined.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Per absolute mean difference analyses, slightly larger differences were found for child weight (0.21 ± 0.21 kg), child height (1.53 ± 1.29 cm), and caregiver weight (0.48 ± 0.42 kg) between school and home measurements. Both analyses indicate differences had only minor impact on child BMI percentile (− 0.12, 0.68) and parent BMI (0.05, 0.13). Intraclass coefficients ranged from 0.98 to 1.00 indicating that almost all of the variance was due to between person differences and not measurement differences within a person.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Results suggest that remote height and weight collection is feasible for caregivers and children and that there are minimal differences in the various measurement methods studied here when assessing group differences. These differences did not have clinically meaningful impacts on BMI. This is promising for the use of remote height and weight measurement in clinical trials, especially for hard-to reach-populations.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">The outbreak of the SARS COV-2 virus has had significant impacts on ongoing research, especially research that involved contact with patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many clinical trials were halted in the spring of 2020 due to concerns about infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Some clinical trials were able to resume after changes to study protocols to protect patient safety while also achieving their stated scientific aims. Many of these changes involved moving to remote data collection.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Height and weight are common measures obtained as part of clinically oriented research, yet very little is known about obtaining height and weight remotely. Objective measures collected by study staff using standard research-grade equipment are preferred over self-report methods as they are less subject to bias and are more accurate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One solution for collecting these measures remotely is to have participants weigh themselves on a scale provided by the study team, or to use an existing home scale, and then report their weight to study staff.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Remotely collecting height and weight has proven to be feasible. Studies examining weighing protocols where participants take their weight at home using e-scales support feasibility and concordance in measures compared to clinic staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], in adult populations. E-scales also remove potential reporting bias by participants by transmitting data directly to researchers/clinicians. While there are many benefits to using e-scales, their technology requirements (smart phone, app, internet connection) may be prohibitive to integration in large research studies or for certain populations (such as rural individuals). Studies using regular scales (e.g., not smart scales or e-scales) and stadiometers also support feasibility of protocols but demonstrate potential room for bias and more detailed instructions for the measurements are required. For instance, Paez and colleagues (2014) recruited 30 women from a larger study to self-report their height (without measuring) and to report their weight from scales provided by the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research staff provided participants with a weighing protocol via printed instructions and through an instructional phone call. Within 2 weeks of participants reporting their weight, researchers visited the homes of a subset of these participants to remeasure their weight using a scale of the same model and obtain a height measure. Self- and researcher-measured weight had an overall mean difference of 0.93 ± 0.27 kg. Additionally, self-reported height differed from researcher-measured height by an overall mean difference of 0.56 ± 1.91 cm. More recently, Ghosh-Dastidar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] conducted an in-lab study where the research team led participants through a standard protocol to collect their own height and weight via video-conferencing, then immediately after this, height and weight were checked by a trained research team member. This study observed small overall mean differences between participant and researcher-reported data (weight differed by 0.04 ± 0.09 kg; height differed by 0.11 ± 0.02 cm); these differences were not determined to be clinically meaningful.</p>
              <p id="Par11">There may be additional considerations when conducting remote height and weight collection with children and adolescents. Specifically, when measuring child height and/or weight remotely, caregivers will typically be responsible for the measurement, and there may be additional biases that impact how caregivers report a child’s height and/or weight. In a recent study of adolescents with overweight or obesity, data from smart scales demonstrated that participants were less likely to report their weight if it was a higher value compared to previous days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Another study observed that caregivers of children with overweight/obesity under-reported their child’s height measurements resulting in a difference of 0.86 cm compared to a difference of 0.1 cm for children in the normal weight category. Despite these differences in height measurements, caregivers reported comparable weight measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] across all weight classifications. It remains unclear how accurate remote height or weight measurements are for school-aged children.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Although these studies indicate that it may be possible to obtain height and weight remotely, more applied examples of remote validation of height and weight measures are needed in real-world clinical trials, especially clinical trials with pediatric patients. Therefore, the aim of the current paper is to describe the implementation of a fully remote height and weight collection protocol as part of a family-based healthy lifestyle clinical trial for underserved, rural children with overweight or obesity and their caregivers. Additionally, we aim to describe the discrepancies observed in height and weight among both adults and children, as well as assess factors that may have impacted the validity of the home height and weight measurements.</p>

Children (8.3 ± 0.7 years; 66% female) with overweight/obesity (body mass index percentile [BMI%ile] ≥85th) and their primary caregivers (38.2 ± 6.1 years; 92% female) who were attending one of 18 participating rural elementary schools in a single midwestern state were invited to participate.

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p id="Par14">Per the initial study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], child height and weight and caregiver weight were to be taken at their local elementary school by a fully trained school staff member on research grade equipment provided by the study at three primary timepoints: baseline, 8 months (post-treatment), and 20 months later (long-term follow-up) as well as monthly during the initial 8-month period. Caregiver height was measured at baseline and this height measure was used for the remainder of the study. In March of 2020, the SARS COV-2 pandemic began to impact school schedules and resulted in the closure of school buildings. As the intervention for the study was delivered fully remotely via interactive televideo, the decision was quickly made to transition the collection of height and weight to be fully remote as well. This decision allowed the clinical trial to continue as scheduled and largely as planned during the time of the pandemic. For the height and weight measures during school closures, families chose whether to use existing equipment in the home or use new equipment mailed to them by the study. Written (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and video instructions were developed and shared (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKcKodvYBnk&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKcKodvYBnk&amp;feature=youtu.be</ext-link>) with the participating families.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Written instructions given to participating families</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12874_2022_1669_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par15">Between September 2020 and February 2021, participating families from 5 of the 18 schools in the trial were invited to participate in the current sub-project to validate the newly developed home height/weight procedures for their 8-month or 20-month measures, depending upon where they were in the protocol timeline. Baseline data were previously collected per protocol for each of these families, prior to implementation of the remote home height/weight procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All measurements taken at the school were obtained by the trained school staff. All study procedures were approved by and followed local IRB guidelines and regulations. Participant consent and/or assent were obtained prior to data collection.</p>

Home scale weights were taken on an existing home scale (models not noted) or on a scale provided by the research team that was widely available during the time of the pandemic despite supply chain and shipping issues experienced at that time (Etekcity High Precision Digital Body Weight Bathroom Scale with Ultra-Wide Platform and Easy-to-Read Backlit LCD; 440 Pounds). All weights were taken with light clothing and no shoes in triplicate and recorded to the nearest 0.1 lb. (for home weights) or 0.1 kg (for school weights); mean values were used in analyses. To compare the home scale to the school scale, each family was asked to bring their existing home scale or research-provided scale to the school during a school measurement session, and the two scales (one brought from home and one at the school) were used to obtain measures during the same session.</p>

                <p id="Par25">Of the participants in this study, 87% of child measurements and 97% of caregiver weight measurements were taken at the school, comparing school scale to home scale in the same measurement session. Three families were unable to bring in their home scale to the school measurement session and were therefore asked to self-report their weight once they returned home, based upon a new measurement on their home scale (using procedures in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For children, the average absolute mean difference between school scale weight and home scale weight was 0.21 kg (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This absolute mean difference was statistically significantly different from zero [t(22) = 4.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, d = 0.97] but in terms of clinical significance was less than the reported standard errors from other studies (0.45 ± 0.8 kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Sixty-five percent of the home measurements for children were within 0.2 kg of the school measurement and 87% were within 0.5 kg of the school measurement. For caregivers, the absolute mean difference between school scale weight and home scale weight was 0.48 kg. This was also statistically significantly different from zero [t(31) = 6.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), d = 1.15], but in terms of clinical significance was well within differences (0.93 ± 0.27 kg) reported in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Forty-three percent of the home measurements for caregivers were within 0.2 kg of the school measurement and 67% were within 0.5 kg of the school measurement.</p>
                <p id="Par26">Regarding the overall mean difference in weight for the children (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the mean for the home scale weight was 0.10 kg higher than the mean for the school scale weight on average. This was not a statistically significant difference [t(22) = − 1.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.10, d = .36]. Regarding the overall mean difference in weight for the caregivers, the mean home scale weight was 0.22 kg higher than the mean school scale weight on average.

                  <p id="Par28"><italic>Measurement type</italic>. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated between school scale and home scale weight measurements for both children and caregivers and for height measurements for children between child home height and child school height. Coefficients ranged from 0.98 to 1.00 indicating that very little variance in measurements was due to the measurement type. <italic>Number of days between measurements - children.</italic> The impact of number of days between the two weight measurements was examined. For children, almost all participants were weighed on the same day on the home scale and the school-scale; one child was measured with a one-day separation. The difference in this child’s weight was 0.41 kg which is within one and a half standard deviations of the mean difference between measurements. There were five children whose weight was assessed on the same day that were more discrepant than this one weight that was on different days. Thus, the weight difference with a time delay for children was not extreme within the distribution of all discrepancies. <italic>Number of days between measurements – caregivers.</italic> Regarding caregiver weights, two adults were weighed with a lag between measurements. For the first, measures were separated by 3 days and the weight difference was 0.27 kg. For the second, the measures were separated by 2 days and the difference was 0.67 kg. There were eight participants who were measured on the same day with larger differences than 0.67 kg, which was within one standard deviation of the average discrepancy. Thus, the weight differences with a time delay for adults were well within the distribution of discrepancies. <italic>Existing home scale</italic> vs. <italic>research provided home scale.</italic> Next, the impact of using an existing home scale compared to using a newly purchased research provided home scale was assessed. Results indicated a greater tendency for participants using new research-provided home scales (as opposed to existing home scales) to over-estimate weight as compared to measurements obtained on school scales. For children, measurements on new research scales overestimated by an average of 0.18 kg, which was statistically significantly different from 0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02. Measurements of children on existing home scales were under-estimated by 0.03 kg on average, which was not significantly different from zero. Similarly, measurements of parent weight on new research-provided scales were overestimated by 0.32 kg on average, which was significantly different from 0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002. While parent measurements on existing home scales were also overestimated compared to measurements obtained on school scales by an average of 0.02 kg, this was not statistically significantly overestimation.</p>

In children, the differences in weight measurements were slightly smaller and height measurements were slightly larger compared to results found by Tenenbaum et al.; they observed differences of 0.45 ± 0.8 kg and 0.1 ± 1.3 cm between home and clinic measures when the assessments were obtained 1 day apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, the differences in weight measurements for caregivers were slightly lower compared to three of the four previous studies (range of weight differences observed in previous studies was 0.6–1.1 kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Only Ghosh-Dastidar et al., reported smaller mean differences in weight (0.02 ± 0.4 kg) when compared to our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Overall, these findings indicate negligible differences in BMI between measurement methods which would likely not have a systematic or meaningful impact on BMI in trial results.</p>
              <p id="Par36">To add to the literature, our study also conducted analyses using the absolute mean difference statistic. These types of analyses are important to understand how variation in measurement methods may impact the results of a single individual over time, rather than of a group of participants over time. The absolute mean difference analyses conducted here, specifically for child BMI%ile and adult BMI, were statistically significant, implying that varying equipment/methods across measurements may have a significant impact on findings for a single individual. This extends the literature in this area and to our knowledge is the first time that absolute mean difference has been applied in a measurement validation paper of this type. We also evaluated several factors which may have contributed to the lack of agreement between measurements (lag time between measures, home-supplied scale vs. researcher supplied scale, caregiver education). Analyses indicate that the only factor that had a significant impact on the measurements was a research-provided scale; specifically, the research provided scales seemed to overestimate weight to a greater degree than existing home scales when each was compared to the research grade school scale. Although home and research scales were not calibrated in the current study, future research may want to assess whether the lack of calibration contributed to differences or whether there are other reasons for these differences (such as lack of voiding prior to measurement, or time of day of measurement).</p>
              <p id="Par37">This study has several strengths, including that it is the first to evaluate the accuracy of remote height and weight measurement procedures among school-age children. Second, the equipment used was highly practical (inexpensive and purchased from an online web vendor with free delivery to participant homes; not requiring internet in the home or a smart phone; minimal set up), thus potentially making our procedures more applicable for other clinical trials in ‘real-world’ remote settings. Finally, our use of absolute mean difference analyses is new to the field and has implications for studies considering this type of methodology or clinicians who may want to implement similar procedures. Limitations within the study include the predominantly white, rural sample and the age range of elementary school children and their parents. These results may not be generalizable for the assessments of infants, adolescents, or children from different backgrounds. Also, the research provided home scales were not e-scales; future researchers may wish to study the feasibility of using these types of e-scales with participants as the findings may be different than those obtained here. Additionally, we were not able to account for time-of-day differences taken between home and school measurements, although some studies indicate time-of-day may not have meaningful impact on these measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Finally, we did not include a measure of caregiver fidelity to the at-home collection protocol, which is an area of planned future research.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par38">In sum, these data suggest that these height and weight measurements by families of school-aged children enrolled in clinical trials is not only feasible but is relatively accurate. Remote collection of height and weight may increase the feasibility of conducting research with rural and other underserved populations who are unable to travel for study visits as well as conducting research during pandemics in which physical distancing is critical for public health and safety. Finally, these results suggest that remote height and weight collection can be executed at a low cost, as existing home scales were largely accurate, and the materials sent to participants (who did not have their own materials) were low cost readily available to ship and required little to no set up. Overall, these results are promising for the potential to continue to rely on remote height/weight measurement in weight management clinical trials with school-aged children.</p>
