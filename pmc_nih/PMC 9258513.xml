                  <p>Opioid analgesics are often used to treat moderate-to-severe acute non-cancer pain; however, there is little high-quality evidence to guide clinician prescribing. An essential element to developing evidence-based guidelines is a better understanding of pain management and pain control among individuals experiencing acute pain for various common diagnoses.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This multicentre prospective observational study will recruit 1550 opioid-naïve participants with acute pain seen in diverse clinical settings including primary/urgent care, emergency departments and dental clinics. Participants will be followed for 6 months with the aid of a patient-centred health data aggregating platform that consolidates data from study questionnaires, electronic health record data on healthcare services received, prescription fill data from pharmacies, and activity and sleep data from a Fitbit activity tracker. Participants will be enrolled to represent diverse races and ethnicities and pain conditions, as well as geographical diversity. Data analysis will focus on assessing patients’ patterns of pain and opioid analgesic use, along with other pain treatments; associations between patient and condition characteristics and patient-centred outcomes including resolution of pain, satisfaction with care and long-term use of opioid analgesics; and descriptive analyses of patient management of leftover opioids.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Opioid analgesics are often used to treat moderate-to-severe acute non-cancer pain; however, there is little high-quality evidence to guide clinician prescribing. A recent high quality systematic review of the comparative effectiveness of treatments for acute pain found substantial limitations in the strength of evidence on basic questions of comparative effectiveness of opioids versus both pharmacological and non-pharmacolgical treatments. None of the primary pharmacological treatments for acute pain—opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen—were found to be superior to the others across the range of acute pain conditions, and the evidence did not address whether treatment effectiveness may vary across patient populations. Opioid prescribing in the USA has been declining over the past 10 years, but remains common. Substantial variation in opioid prescription characteristics (eg, number of pills prescribed) for similar patients has been observed and may indicate a lack of consensus about the ideal dose and duration of treatment for various types of common painful ailments. Many studies report the efficacy of opioids for acute pain, but few address the ideal dose and duration of treatment for various types of pain. Among the many clinical guidelines that recommend a specific duration of treatment or number of pills, most rely on expert consensus in the absence of higher quality evidence.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Appropriate opioid prescribing for acute pain must balance both potential benefits and risks to patients and broader risks to public health.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Current knowledge</title>
                <p>There is no consensus on the definition of acute pain; one definition is pain that is time limited and of sudden onset.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Acute painis often treated differently depending on the practice setting in which patients find themselves and the specific providers from whom they receive care. For example, a recent study of postsurgical pain conducted at Mayo Clinic demonstrated substantial variation across surgeons in the amount of opioids prescribed (measured in milligram morphine equivalents (MMEs)) which could not be explained by patient factors for 25 of the most common surgical procedures.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This finding was replicated using national data from insurance claims.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The large observed variability across surgeons in opioid volume prescribed, even after accounting for patient characteristics, suggests that clinicians lack evidence-based guidance on opioid prescribing for postsurgical pain. A recent systematic review found that studies of postsurgery opioid prescribing commonly reported 50%–70% of prescribed opioid tablets were left unused.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These unconsumed opioids suggest overprescribing and pose a potential risk to patients and the community if the opioids are diverted for non-medical use.</p>
                <p>Data are limited with regard to the experience of acute pain, rates of opioid prescribing, clinical outcomes, alignment with recommendations and disparities in care, particularly outside of surgical care, such as emergency departments (EDs), primary care/urgent care settings and dental and oral surgery centres.</p>

                <title>Emergency department</title>
                <p>An analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 1996 to 2012 indicated that overall opioid prescribing increased 471% during that time but that the contribution of prescriptions from EDs decreased from 7.4% to 4.4%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> While more recent data demonstrate a high level of adherence to recommended guidelines for prescribing of opioids in the ED,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> there is still limited evidence around the best approaches for pain control and opioid use after initial prescription in the ED. Additionally, the guideline recommendations for dose and duration of treatment are largely based on expert opinion and lower-quality evidence.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–14</xref> Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis and systematic review found that Black and Hispanic patients in US EDs were less likely to receive treatment for acute pain than their White counterparts; few studies assessed data for Asian and Native American patients, making the estimates less robust, but the data suggested there may be similar disparities.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>

                <title>Primary care/urgent care</title>
                <p>Although primary care providers may treat a larger proportion of patients with chronic pain than their surgical or emergency medicine colleagues, providers in primary care and urgent care settings still treat a diverse array of conditions associated with acute pain, including headaches, dental pain and musculoskeletal injuries. Preliminary studies have suggested that prescriptions for 7 or fewer days of opioid medications are adequate for most patients<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> seen in primary care. However, a study of primary care visits for common acute pain conditions found that 46% of the opioid prescriptions filled after these visits were for more than 7 days’ supply, and 10% were for 30 or more days’ supply.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Additionally, when US primary care providers prescribe opioids, they are the most common type of provider to provide a long-term prescription, with 40% of these initial prescriptions exceeding a 7-day supply.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>

                <title>Dental care and oral surgery</title>
                <p>A recent study comparing opioid prescribing by dentists practicing in the USA and UK found that US dentists were much more likely to prescribe opioids than UK dentists (58.2 opioid prescriptions per US dentist per year vs 1.2 opioid prescriptions per UK dentist per year).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This large difference may indicate that US dentists are over prescribing opioids, but without additional detail on patients’ use and disposal of their dental opioid prescriptions, we cannot determine what harms may be associated with this presumed over-prescription. Despite this comparatively high rate of opioid prescribing by US-based dentists, dentists are less likely to prescribe long courses of opioids when compared with other types of prescribing providers in the USA.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p>Opioid prescribing to adolescents may be associated with an increased risk of later substance use disorders and overdoses. For example, a population-based study in Sweden found a 30%–40% relative increase in a composite measure of substance-related morbidity compared with matched cohorts not receiving an opioid.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In the USA, dentists were the most common prescribers of opioids for people aged 0–21 years, writing 38.2% of these prescriptions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Among adolescents and young adults (age 12–25), tooth extractions were by far the most common procedure associated with a new dental opioid prescription (79.4%).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>It is not known whether dental prescribing is likely to progress to long-term opioid use or whether unused opioids from dental prescribing are likely to be retained.</p>

                  <title>Study aims</title>
                  <p>The purpose of this study is to as certain and describe the trajectories of pain experienced bya diverse group of opioid naïve patients who are prescribed an opioid analgesicfor acute pain. Using a digital health-based patient-centred data aggregation platform, we aim to characterise patterns of use of opioids and other pain medications. We aim to enrol a total of 1550 patients receiving primary and urgent care, ED care, ordental care in five healthcare systems, along with several community dental practices. Opioid naïve patients offereda new short-acting opioid prescription for acute pain will be recruited and followed prospectively for 6 months to assess pain trajectories, analgesic and non-pharmacological treatment use, activity and healthcare service use. A patient-centred health data aggregatingplatform (Hugo Health; further information below) will be used to collect patient-reported outcomes and structured data from pharmacy and electronic health record (EHR) patient portals as well as patient-generated data collected through personal activity tracking devices (Fitbit).</p>

              <p>This is a prospective cohort study using a novel, patient-centred electronic health data aggregating platform to follow study participants for 180 days, gathering rich data on the course of acute pain, how people treat their pain, and how this acute pain affects their social and emotional functioning.</p>
              <p>Opioid naïve patients offered an opioid prescription for acute pain will be recruited at the point of care where the prescription was written. The population will be a convenience sample of patients who are either present in the care setting when a study coordinator is available to recruit in person or who are reachable by telephone for recruitment after their visit. They will be followed for 180 days, during which they will use their personal smartphone or other web-connected device to answer questionnaires that track the location, severity and daily consequences of their pain; treatments they are using to manage their pain; treatment effectiveness; mood and potential indicators of problematic opioid use. Structured information from EHR and pharmacy patient portals will be collected to record prescriptions that were written and filled, healthcare service use, and healthcare service-related outcomes (eg, ED visits).</p>
              <p>The study will be based at five primary investigative sites in the USA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>): Yale University (Connecticut), Mayo Clinic (Minnesota), University of Alabama at Birmingham, Monument Health (South Dakota) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Southern California). Participants will be recruited at both community and academic hospitals and clinics associated with these sites, along with community dental practices in several southeastern states along the southern Appalachian Mountains (enrolment coordinated through University of Alabamaat Birmingham). Recruitment will stop when approximately 1550 subjects have been enrolled. Enrolment targets (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) are stratified by study site and care setting (ED, primary and urgent care, and dental care), with overall demographic targets to ensure the study population is diverse in both racial and ethnic representation and rural/urban residence. Rural dwelling will be determined using participant home ZIP code. Race and ethnicity will be determined by participant self-report, offering the opportunity for participants to select multiple races. People who self-define as part of a racial or ethnic minority and as white will be classified by their non-white race or ethnicity for purposes of counting enrolment quotas.</p>

                <p>Overview of electronic health data aggregating technology: Hugo is a patient-centred health data aggregating platform developed to foster partnership between research study/clinical trial participants and investigators. Hugo currently enables the secure, automatic and ongoing deposit of three types of data: clinical data via retrieval from patient portals; patient-generated data with support for a growing number of wearable/medical devices; and patient-reported data via a flexible survey feature. Hugo survey links can be delivered directly to users by email or text enabling the collection of encrypted responses for a wide range of questions including validated patient-reported outcome measures. Proprietary software harmonises data from different sources, aligning data types and eliminating duplicate information. By leveraging each person’s right to access his or her own data, Hugo’s patient portal-based approach solves patient identity matching issues and removes the need for data sharing agreements with health systems and institutions.</p>
                <p>Questionnaires will be sent by Hugo to patients at varying intervals throughout the follow-up period, with the specific questions and frequency dependent on patient-reported pain and opioid use (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>When patients report in their daily questionnaires that pain is resolved (for 3 days in a row the patient reports an overall pain rating of 0), the daily questionnaires will be stopped, and patients will instead only receive weekly and monthly questionnaires. Two sets of weekly and monthly questionnaires are available; one for those actively reporting pain and one for those not reporting pain. The appropriate questionnaires will be sent to patients based on their response to previous questionnaires. Should they begin reporting pain again in a weekly questionnaire, the ‘in pain’ questionnaire schedule will resume until they again report they have stopped experiencing pain, or until the follow-up period ends.</p>
                <p>Two weeks after patients report that they have stopped taking an opioid to treat their pain, they will receive an additional questionnaire that will examine reasons for opioid discontinuation, pain treatment satisfaction, medication disposal and whether they experienced any potential indicators of medication misuse. Patients continuing opioid use through the end of the follow-up period will be asked the questions on pain treatment satisfaction and medication misuse at the end of the follow-up period.</p>
                <p>Using the Hugo platform, we will collect data from electronic medical records from each participating system, all other locations where patients receive care, and from pharmacy portals (Walgreens, CVS and Walmart) related to medication fills (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Together, this will allow us to capture information on comorbidities, opioid and non-opioid analgesics prescribed, and prescription opioids and non-opioid analgesics dispensed.</p>

                <p>An important goal of this project is to develop evidence to support condition-specific prescribing guidelines that address common acute pain conditions for which opioids are prescribed.</p>
                <sec id="s2-4-1">
                  <title>Primary analyses</title>
                  <p>The primary statistical analyses will be descriptive analyses of the outcomes derived from patient questionnaires describing the acute opioid analgesic use of participants. Each outcome will be summarised across care setting populations (ie, primary care, dental care, ED) and also stratified by race and ethnicity, rurality, gender, age group and opioid indication/patient condition.</p>
                  <p>Specific aim 1: To assess patients’ pain and opioid use patterns in episodes of acute pain for which opioids were prescribed, tracking pain severity and persistence, as well as other prescription and over-the-counter pain medication use.</p>

                <p>The Hugo platform will collect all information available in the EHRs, pharmacy records, and through the wearable devices and questionnaires. No data will be collected by investigators directly from the health systems at which patients are receiving care. All linked health portals are password-protected and all account links are verified by the study participant on set up. Patients authenticate themselves through the use of their unique device account username and password.</p>
                <p>The data will reside within the Hugo cloud-based platform and will be transferred to Mayo Clinic via a secure file transfer service. The data will then reside on secure servers at Mayo Clinic. The analytical data files stored at Mayo Clinic will not be deidentified but will be treated as a limited data set where patient identifiers are stored in a separate linkable file. The analytical data files will have other protected health information such as dates of service, etc and will be used for enrolment, troubleshooting and data monitoring.</p>
                <p>The data collected as part of this project will not be part of the medical record and will not be provided back to the clinical care team. Patients will be made aware of this as part of the informed consent process and will be asked to contact the care team directly if they have any concerns related to their health.</p>
                <p>Data will be stored at Mayo Clinic for 5 years after the end of the study. At the end of the 5 years, data will be archived in secure storage at Mayo Clinic similar to clinical trial and other prospectively collected data.</p>
                <p>Deidentified data will be stored at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indefinitely for sharing both with internal investigators as well as external researchers. The informed consent will be explicit in that participants are agreeing for their deidentified data to be used by external groups for research or regulatory purposes.</p>

                  <p>The research staff will regularly monitor the status of the portal data (EHR/pharmacy/Fitbit) coming into the Hugo platform using the version of the Hugo dashboard only available to research staff. Within this dashboard, the research staff will be able to review the connection status of all of the portals connected to each patient’s Hugo account. Should a connectivity issue be noticed by research staff, they will note the connection issue reported by the dashboard and determine if the issue is limited to one participant or if multiple participants are experiencing the same problem. The research staff will then follow-up directly with the Hugo support team. Once the source of the issue is identified, the research staff will follow-up with the affected patients as needed to correct the issue in a timely fashion.</p>
                  <p>Research staff will also keep track of any technical issues directly reported by patients during their follow-up period. If the technical issues are not able to be resolved by the research staff, or if multiple patients report the same problem, the research staff will forward the issue to the Hugo support team to identify and correct the issue and in order to follow-up with those patients affected.</p>
                  <p>The study was selected to receive quality monitoring oversight using the FDA Office of Translational Sciences Quality Management System (QMS) for human subject research conducted or supported by the FDA. The QMS involves the use of standard operating procedures, checklists and templates when conducting quality assurance monitoring activities including site visits. In 2020, four virtual pre-enrolment visits (due to COVID-19 restrictions) were completed as well as one onsite interim visit in 2021 and three virtual interim visits in 2022. Individuals contracted to monitor the study on behalf of the FDA may access personal information collected as part of this study, including all of the information shared with the research team from the patients’ Hugo account. Monitoring activitiesare done to ensure adequate projection of the rights, welfare and safety of human subjects and the quality of the clinical trial data. These individuals are all obligated to maintain confidentiality by the nature of their work or are bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>
