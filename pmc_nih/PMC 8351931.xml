                <p>Improved sanitation has been hypothesized to reduce soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections by reducing the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs/larvae in soil. We evaluated the effect of a randomized sanitation program (providing households with an improved dual-pit latrine, tools for child/animal feces management, and behavioral messaging) on reducing the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in soil from household courtyards. We collected soil samples from 1405 households enrolled in the sanitation intervention (n = 419) and control (n = 914) groups of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (WASH Benefits) in rural Bangladesh approximately 2 years after the initiation of the interventions. We analyzed samples for <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris trichiura</italic>, and hookworm eggs by microscopy. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and egg count ratio (ECR) to compare the prevalence of STH eggs and arithmetic and geometric mean egg counts for STH eggs per gram of soil in the sanitation and control arms. Among intervention households, latrines achieved high and sustained user uptake by adults while child open defecation remained common and most households did not dispose of child feces hygienically. In courtyard soil from control households, the prevalence of any STH eggs was 75.7% and the prevalence of any larvated STH eggs was 67.3%. <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> was detected in 63.0% of control samples and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> in 55.7% of control samples; hookworm was not detected in any sample. In the control arm, the arithmetic mean egg count for any STH was 3.96 eggs/dry gram, while the geometric mean was 1.58 eggs/dry gram. There was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the prevalence of any STH eggs (PR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.05)) or mean egg counts (ECR = 0.08 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.26) for geometric mean and 0.07 (95% CI: -0.22, 0.37) for arithmetic mean). Adjusted models gave similar results. A compound-level sanitation intervention that provided improved latrines and tools for disposal of child and animal feces did not have an impact on STH eggs in soil. In order to effectively reduce the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in the environment, sustained, widespread use of sanitation strategies to isolate and hygienically dispose of child and animal feces may need to complement traditional strategies for containment of adult human feces.</p>

              <p>Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections affect more than 1.5 billion people worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These infections include <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> (roundworm), <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> (whipworm), and <italic toggle="yes">Necator americanus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Ancylostoma duodenale</italic> (hookworm) infections. The principal approach to mitigating the impact of STH infections is mass drug administration, often delivered through school-based programs or integrated into vaccination programs [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Anthelmintic benzimidazoles drugs such as albendazole and mebendazole are effective in reducing STH infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The WHO recommends annual mass drug administration in areas where STH prevalence is 20% or more because rapid reinfection following treatment is common [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that, 12 months post-treatment, the infection prevalence can revert to 94% of pre-treatment levels for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, 82% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> and 57% for hookworms [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The frequent and widespread use of anthelmintic drugs may result in the emergence of drug resistance, which would substantially reduce the effectiveness of the limited number of drugs currently available for treatment of STH infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Sanitation systems that isolate human feces from the environment should prevent potential new hosts from ingesting STH eggs from the feces of infected individuals. Hence, sanitation improvements that interrupt environmental transmission cycles of STH may be critical to sustainably reduce the global burden of STH infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Two systematic reviews have found that households that reported access to and use of any sanitation facility had approximately half the odds of STH infection compared to households with no reported availability or use of sanitation facilities [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; however, this evidence was mostly based on observational studies of low quality. In rural India, Bangladesh, Kenya and Timor-Leste, randomized controlled trials of sanitation interventions providing on-site latrine access, alone or combined with water and hygiene interventions, have either found no effect on STH [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or reductions in some but not other STH species [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, a study in urban Brazil found that increasing household connections to sewerage halved the prevalence of STH infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sanitation interventions are hypothesized to reduce STH infection through reducing the prevalence and/or concentration of STH eggs in the environment. However, there are little empirical data on the impact of sanitation interventions on this intermediate outcome [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>The impact of sanitation interventions on environmental transmission of STH may be assessed by quantifying STH eggs in the soil, a necessary component of the STH life cycle. Unembryonated eggs of all three species are passed in stool and incubate in soil. <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs can survive in soil for months, becoming infective in 1–15 weeks [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hookworm eggs, on the other hand, quickly hatch in soil; the larvae that hatch seek moisture and can survive for weeks and become infective within 2 weeks [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As such, it is more likely to find <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs than hookworm eggs in the soil. Egg survival is longer in warm and moist environments without direct sunlight [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Methods exist to enumerate STH eggs in soil, biosolids, and water, and on produce and vegetation [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. STH eggs have been detected in outdoor soil in various settings in South/Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], South America [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. STH eggs have also been detected on floors inside homes in the Philippines [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and in classrooms with soil floors in Nigeria [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These studies were mostly descriptive, and sample sizes were relatively small, ranging from 15 [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to 330 [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] people. One study assessed the effect of a randomized sanitation intervention on STH eggs in environmental reservoirs in rural Kenya and found no effect [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here, we examine the effect of a randomized sanitation intervention on the presence and concentration of STH eggs in courtyard soil in rural Bangladeshi households. We conducted this study among a subset of households enrolled in a cluster-randomized controlled trial (WASH Benefits Bangladesh, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01590095) that measured the impact of individual and combined water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition interventions on linear growth, cognitive development, and enteric disease, including STH infections, in young children [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The trial also measured pathogens and indicators of fecal contamination in the environment in a subset of enrolled households as intermediate outcomes between the interventions and child health outcomes.</p>

                <title>Study setting and design</title>
                <p>In Bangladesh, the WASH Benefits trial enrolled participants in four rural districts. Eight pregnant women in their second or third trimester who lived in nearby households were grouped into clusters and eight adjacent clusters were grouped into a block. Clusters were block-randomized into one of six intervention arms or a double-sized control arm. The intervention arms consisted of single and combined water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions. This study involved households in the control and sanitation arms of the WASH Benefits trial.</p>
                <p>The prevalence of STH infection among children aged 2–12 years old in the control arm was 36.8% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, 9.2% for hookworm, and 7.5% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Bangladesh has conducted school-based deworming for school-aged children and immunization-based deworming for pre-school-aged children with mebendazole two times per year since 2008 [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A 2010 evaluation of the 2009 mass drug administration campaign in two districts of Bangladesh found that for children aged 5–14 years old treatment coverage for one of the twice-annual campaigns was 46–54% depending on district and campaign month [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Among children aged 4–12 years old enrolled in WASH Benefits, 74% of children in the sanitation arm and 70% of children in the control arm were reported to have received deworming within the last six months [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Intervention components</title>
                <p>The compound-level sanitation intervention included upgrading or replacing existing latrines with improved latrines that were lined with concrete rings and had two pits so that after the first pit filled, the superstructure could be moved to a second pit while the contents of the first pit were left to undergo natural inactivation of pathogens such as STH eggs. The intervention also included potties for young children, and sani-scoop hoes to remove animal and child feces from households and courtyards. Households in Bangladesh are clustered in multi-family compounds that share a central courtyard; each household in compounds with study households received a latrine upgrade, potty and sani-scoop. Locally recruited community health promoters visited households in the intervention group at least twice a month to deliver sanitation-related behavior change communication focused on safe management of human and animal feces. Promoters did not visit control households.</p>

                <title>Intervention uptake</title>
                <p>Structured observations of intervention uptake were conducted by WASH Benefits staff members as part of the intervention uptake assessment, approximately 15 months after the intervention delivery and 9 months before our STH assessment [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. At this timepoint, adults were observed to use a hygienic latrine, defined as a latrine with a functional water seal and no feces visible on the latrine slab or floor, in 94% of sanitation-arm households and 40% of control-arm households [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, open defecation by children and unhygienic child feces management remained prevalent. The percentage of children reported to defecate in the open was 81% among children 0–2 years old, 37% among children 3–7 years old, and 9% among children 8–14 years old in the sanitation arm; prevalence of open defecation was similar among children in the control arm [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Open defecation by children commonly occurred in the compound courtyard and child feces were typically disposed of unhygienically, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., thrown into bushes, open waste heaps and drains, or left on the ground [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Households were observed to unhygienically dispose of child feces in 64% of sanitation-arm households and 84% of control-arm households [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hence, human feces were observed in 21% of sanitation-arm compounds and 30% of control-arm compounds [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Further details of the trial design, intervention delivery, and uptake assessments have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

                <title>Soil sample collection and analysis</title>
                <p>Soil was collected from a random subset of households enrolled in the sanitation or control arms of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial from May 2015 to April 2016. From 1991–2020, the average rainfall ranged from a low of 7.4 mm in January to 498.0 mm in August [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Data collection followed the order of intervention roll-out among participating households so that samples were collected approximately 24 months after initiation of interventions in each household. Data collection spanned one year, allowing for comparison of samples collected in the wet and dry seasons.</p>
                <p>Field staff sampled courtyard soil from the area just in front of the entrance of the enrolled household [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previous work has found STH eggs concentration in soil to be similar in front of the household entrance and the latrine entrance [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Field staff marked a 30 x 30 cm area using an ethanol-disinfected metal stencil and used an ethanol-disinfected metal trowel to scrape the area once horizontally and once vertically to collect approximately 50 g of topsoil in a sterile Whirlpak bag. Samples were transported on ice to the field laboratory of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh and processed within one day to quantify eggs of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, and hookworm using a protocol adapted from the USEPA method for enumerating <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> eggs in fecal sludge [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The adapted protocol demonstrated a recovery efficiency of 73% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> eggs in laboratory experiments [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As the method was optimized to detect <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, the recovery efficiencies for other STH species were likely lower.</p>
                <p>In brief, a 15 g soil aliquot was soaked overnight in 1% 7X detergent solution (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA), then hand-shaken for 2 minutes and vortexed on 2000 rpm for 15 seconds to dislodge STH eggs from soil particles. The solution was poured through a 50-mesh sieve to remove large soil particles. The supernatant was left to settle for 30 minutes and then aspirated without disturbing the soil at the bottom. Approximately 40 mL of 1% 7X solution was added to the precipitate and the solution was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes; the supernatant was discarded. 5 mL of zinc sulfate flotation solution (1.25 specific gravity) was added to the precipitate, vortexed for 30 seconds, centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant was saved; this procedure was conducted a total of three times. The combined supernatant from the three flotation steps was filtered through a 500-mesh sieve to capture STH eggs. The sieve was rinsed into a Falcon tube using distilled water, the rinse water was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed with a pipette until there was 1 mL left at the bottom of the tube. 25 mL of 0.1 N sulfuric acid solution was added to the tube. The tube was capped loosely and incubated at 28° C for 28 days to allow viable eggs to develop larvae. At the end of the incubation period, the solution was centrifuged at 1000 g for 3 min and aspirated to a final volume of 1 mL. The 1 mL solution was transferred to a Sedgewick-Rafter slide and examined under the microscope for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, and hookworm eggs using a visual identification chart to distinguish the type of egg and whether it was larvated or non-larvated [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The numbers of larvated and non-larvated eggs for each species were recorded separately to differentiate viable and non-viable eggs. An additional 5 g soil aliquot was oven-dried overnight to determine moisture content and dry weight.</p>
                <p>For quality control, a laboratory blank was processed once every other day by repeating the protocol without a soil sample. 10% of samples were processed twice, with the second sample referred to as the technical replicate. 10% of samples were counted by two independent analysts to assess interrater reliability. Additionally, for each sample, lab technicians took a picture of the first occurrence of each type of egg (larvated <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, non-larvated <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> etc.); the pictures were reviewed for accuracy of categorization by study investigators (LHK, AE).</p>

                <title>Minimum detectable effect size</title>
                <p>Internal pilot data from the first 100 samples in the control arm found that the prevalence of eggs in soil was 67% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, 36% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> and 78% for either one of the species; hookworm was not detected, potentially because fragile hookworm eggs degraded while the sample was soaked in detergent overnight or during other processing steps. The pilot data were used to calculate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) by geographical area of 0.05 for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 0.26 for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>. Based on the daily processing capacity of the lab, we aimed to sample 1500 compounds. This sample size allowed a minimum detectable relative reduction in prevalence between arms (with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05) of 13% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, 33% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> and 10% for any STH.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Full replication of blinded analysis was conducted by two authors (LHK and AE) according to the pre-specified analysis plan (<ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/6u7cn/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/6u7cn/</ext-link>). We calculated the prevalence of total and larvated eggs in soil for each species (<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, hookworm), for any STH, and for multiple species of STH. We calculated the concentration of STH in soil for each species and for any STH. Prevalence was defined as the presence of STH eggs of the specified species, and concentration was defined the number of eggs of the specified species per dry gram of soil.</p>
                <p>We estimated prevalence differences (PD) and prevalence ratios (PR), as well as relative egg count ratio (ECR) between the sanitation and control arms. PD was defined as the difference in the prevalence and PR as the ratio of the prevalence in the sanitation vs. control arm. ECR was defined as the ratio of egg counts in the sanitation vs. control arm minus 1 such that values &lt;0 indicate a reduction in the sanitation arm. We calculated ECRs using both arithmetic and geometric means. Arithmetic means are more sensitive to high infection intensities that are associated with higher morbidity burden and higher likelihood of transmission; geometric means are less sensitive to extreme data points that skew arithmetic means [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Geometric means were calculated by taking the natural log of the egg count values after replacing counts of 0 eggs per gram [epg] with 0.5 epg. Technical replicates (the second aliquot of a sample analyzed) were dropped from the analysis. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted intention-to-treat effects using the R (version 3.3.2) package for targeted maximum likelihood estimation with SuperLearner; SuperLearner is an algorithm that uses cross-validation to test and weight multiple machine learning models to optimize predictive accuracy [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We used robust standard errors that accounted for clustering. We defined a result as significant if the corresponding 95% confidence intervals did not cross 1 for prevalence and egg count ratios or 0 for prevalence differences.</p>
                <p>As randomization led to very good baseline balance of sociodemographic and water, sanitation, and hygiene characteristics across arms [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (<xref rid="pntd.0008815.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), bias due to confounding due to these factors is unlikely. Additionally, adjustments are unlikely to substantially improve the precision of binary outcomes such as prevalence [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, we report unadjusted effect estimates as our primary parameters. Secondary adjusted analyses accounted for the lab staff member who processed or counted the sample, sampling month, soil moisture content, mother’s education level (stratified into no education, primary or secondary), degree of household food insecurity, number of children &lt;18 years in the household, total number of individuals living in the compound, reported time to the household’s primary drinking water source, housing materials (floor, walls, roof), presence of electricity, and household assets (a table, chair, wardrobe, bed, stool, clock, radio, landline phone, mobile phone, working black/white or color TV, working refrigerator, adult bicycle, motorcycle, sewing machine). Covariates were included in the adjusted analysis if bi-variate models using the likelihood ratio test indicated that the covariate was associated with the outcomes (p&lt;0.2). Categorical covariates that occurred in &lt;5% of the sample were excluded from models.</p>
                <p>We conducted the following pre-specified subgroup analyses, which account for climactic factors and the load of STH eggs potentially entering the environment: 1) wet season (Jun-Oct) vs. dry season (Nov-May); 2) number of individuals living in the compound (&lt;10 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. ≥10); 3) reported deworming of children in the compound within the prior 6 months (&lt;2/3 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. ≥2/3 dewormed); and 4) reported deworming of children in the cluster (8 nearby study compounds) within the prior 6 months (&lt;2/3 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. ≥2/3 dewormed). The cut-off values for number of individuals living in the compound and proportion of children dewormed correspond to the median of the empirical data across both arms.</p>

                <p>We sampled courtyard soil from 914 control and 491 intervention households. Randomization led to very good covariate balance across arms among the subset of sampled households (<xref rid="pntd.0008815.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Few households had animals that can spread STH by passage after consuming human feces (pigs, dogs) and/or are known hosts for the STH species we investigated (<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> in pigs, <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">ceylanicum</italic> in dogs and cats). During all 8 rounds of surveillance, at most 4/750 households (0.5%) owned one or more pigs and 8/750 households (1.1%) owned one or more cats or dogs. Within the control arm, the prevalence of total eggs (larvated or non-larvated) was 63.0% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 55.7% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>; hookworm was not detected in any sample and therefore hookworm data is omitted from all presentations of results (<xref rid="pntd.0008815.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Considering only <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, the prevalence of any STH eggs was 75.7% and the prevalence of multiple species of STH eggs was 43.0%. The prevalence of larvated (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., viable) STH eggs was 54.9% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 46.2% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> (<xref rid="pntd.0008815.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The prevalence of any larvated STH eggs was 67.3% and the prevalence of multiple species of larvated STH eggs was 33.8%.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have demonstrated that nearly three-quarters (75.7%) of courtyard soil samples were contaminated with <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs in rural Bangladeshi households, with two-thirds (67.3%) of samples contaminated with larvated eggs that are expected to be infectious. Among households in the sanitation arm, where adults regularly used hygienic latrines but only a third of households safely disposed of child feces [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], the prevalence and concentration of total or larvated <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs in courtyard soil was not significantly lower compared to households in the control arm.</p>
              <p>The prevalence of STH eggs we found in courtyard soil were on the higher end of estimates from other settings. In other studies, the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> in soil ranged from 6% in Thailand [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to 61% in Nigeria [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> in soil ranged from 6% in Nepal [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to 41% in the Philippines [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While other studies have found that the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> in the soil was higher during the wet season than the dry season [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we found that the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> was not significantly different between seasons, and the prevalence and concentration of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> was higher during the dry season.</p>
              <p>In our study’s sister site (WASH Benefits Kenya), the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> in soil in front of households was 19% using the same sampling and enumeration protocol [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The geometric mean of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs in our study (2 epg) was also higher than what was observed in Kenya (0.05 epg). This is consistent with the higher prevalence of STH infection in the study population in Bangladesh vs. Kenya and with the higher population density of Bangladesh, which would be expected to provide more opportunities for environmental contamination with STH eggs. In Bangladesh, 37% of children enrolled in the WASH Benefits trial were infected with <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 8% with <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, with the geometric mean fecal egg count of 5.2 epg for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 0.4 epg for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In Kenya, 23% of enrolled children were infected with <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 1% with <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, with the geometric mean fecal egg count of 4.0 epg for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 0.5 epg for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Differences in ambient and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture and soil texture may also have increased the survival of STH eggs in the soil in Bangladesh compared to Kenya. Mean soil moisture during the study was 15.8% in Bangladesh vs. 11.0% in Kenya [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Use of improved sanitation facilities would be expected to reduce environmental contamination with STH eggs by reducing open defecation and isolating feces from the environment until STH eggs have degraded. Given that approximately 30% of children &lt;2 years old in the control and sanitation arms were infected with <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 3–5% were infected with <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> in our study population, continuing child open defecation and unsafe disposal of child feces in the sanitation arm could be a source of STH eggs to contaminate courtyards and contribute to the lack of impact on STH eggs in the environment from the sanitation intervention.</p>
              <p>Another reason for why the prevalence and concentration of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs was not significantly lower in the sanitation arm compared to the control arm could be that Bangladeshi households periodically build up the height of their courtyard and household floor using agricultural soil. This soil may have been contaminated by non-study households that lived in the same community as study households. The WASH Benefits trial only enrolled approximately 10% of households in a given geographical area (due to the trial’s eligibility criteria), and enrolled households were therefore surrounded by non-enrolled households that continued their day-to-day sanitation practices. Their sanitation practices may have contaminated the soil with soil-transmitted helminths. STH-contaminated soil may also have been carried on the soles of household members’ shoes or feet back to the courtyard soil of study households, but this practice on its own is unlikely to account for the high STH levels observed.</p>
              <p>Domestic animals are known reservoir hosts for some human-infecting STH (<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> in pigs, <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">ceylanicum</italic> in dogs and cats). These domestic animals are uncommon in rural Bangladesh. However, the domestic animals that are present may distribute STH eggs across household courtyards by passage after coprophagia. In the control arm, 91% of households had chickens, 69% had cows, and 39% had goats and/or sheep, and 56% households allows their animals to roam freely [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These animals may step on feces in the courtyard, in neighboring compounds, in agricultural fields or patches of bush, and then track STH eggs on their feet and hooves back to the courtyard where they stay. Additionally, animals may intentionally or inadvertently consume feces contaminated with STH eggs or food contaminated with soil that contains STH eggs and deposit these eggs in their own feces. After chickens were fed viable porcine <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> (formerly known as <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">suum</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">suis</italic> eggs, these eggs were recovered in their feces and, after embryonation in vermiculite, were able to cause infection in pigs [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The ten chickens studied passed through 61% of porcine <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> and 42% of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">suis</italic> eggs they ingested. Twelve days after pigs had been inoculated with embryonated eggs that had passed through the chickens, 34% of porcine <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> eggs and 82% of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">suis</italic> eggs were recovered from the pig feces [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This suggests that chickens may act as transfer hosts for STH species that are infective to humans. Animal feces were observed in 85% of sanitation compounds and 92% of control compounds [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], indicating that animal feces, in addition to human feces, may contribute to the re-inoculation of soil with STH eggs. In future studies, use of molecular detection methods could distinguish STH species that commonly infect animals from those that more commonly infect humans.</p>
              <p>Community-level, sustained sanitation and/or animal confinement interventions could prevent community-wide STH-contamination of soil, thereby limiting exposure to STH ova and larvae. We are not aware of any studies that have examined the impact of community-wide animal confinement interventions on STH in soil or STH infections in children. With regards to community-level human feces management, previous work has found mixed evidence on whether increased access to latrines is associated with reduced STH infection rates. An observational study in rural Ethiopia found that, after adjusting for individual, household, and community characteristics, hookworm prevalence was not associated with community-level latrine usage (defined as the proportion of households in a cluster that had observed indicators of latrine use such as a defined path to a latrine and feces observed in the latrine pit) [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the same study, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> prevalence and <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> prevalence were higher in communities where community latrine usage was ≥60% <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. &lt;20%. Household latrine usage did not modify the effect of community latrine usage for hookworm or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> prevalence. In communities with latrine usage ≥80%, children in households with a latrine in use had a significantly lower prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> compared to children in households without a latrine. In contrast, in communities with sanitation coverage &lt;20%, children in households with a latrine in use had a significantly <italic toggle="yes">higher</italic> prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> compared to children in households without a latrine. The authors posited that higher community latrine usage may be associated with urbanization, which has been associated with increased STH prevalence and may not have been fully accounted for by including population density in their models. They also suggested that <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> prevalence in communities with low coverage of latrines may be driven by increased latrine sharing. In India, a cluster-randomized trial of latrine promotion and construction found that 46% of people in the intervention arm had access to a functional latrine at the end of the trial compared to 15% of people in the control arm. Despite this, the intervention had no effect on the prevalence or intensity of hookworm, <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In an observational study in Vietnam, 98% of households had latrines, but infection with STH was 58% for hookworm, 45% for <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic>, and 14% for <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. One hypothesis for this finding was that households in this community use fresh night soil as fertilizer. These finding suggest that the impact of community-wide sanitation may be mediated by factors such as household latrine use, latrine sharing, and use of human fecal waste for fertilization, and confounded by factors such as urbanization.</p>
              <p>Our finding that the sanitation intervention did not significantly reduce prevalence or concentration of STH eggs in courtyard soil compared to the control arm is consistent with findings from the WASH Benefits trial that the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> infection in children was not significantly different in the sanitation <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. control arms [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This could indicate that persistent <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> eggs in soil continued to infect children in the sanitation arm, that infected children continued to contaminate the soil in the sanitation arm, or a combination of both. In contrast, the WASH Benefits trial found a 29% reduction in <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> infection in children in the sanitation vs. control arms. However, this could be a chance finding as there was no significant reduction of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> infection in the other trial arms that included a sanitation component [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our findings of no difference in the prevalence or concentration of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> in soil between the sanitation and control arms supports the possibility that the observed reduction in <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> infection in the sanitation arm could be a chance finding. Our findings are also consistent with other environmental measurements conducted among trial households showing no reduction in <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> contamination or bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens in soil (or other types of environmental samples) between the sanitation and control arms [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A parallel study nested within the WASH Benefits Kenya trial also found no reduction in STH eggs in soil from the sanitation intervention [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with the theory that water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions are more effective when coupled with mass drug administration [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], our pre-specified subgroup analyses showed that the sanitation intervention had a modest reduction effect on STH eggs in soil in clusters and compounds in which ≥2/3 of children were dewormed. We cannot rule out the role of chance in these findings as the effects were borderline and multiple subgroup analyses increase the likelihood of chance findings.</p>
              <p>One limitation of this study is that we were unable to recover hookworm eggs from the soil and therefore cannot draw conclusions about their presence in the environment. The WASH Benefits trial found a borderline 24% reduction in hookworm infection in children in the sanitation arm [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; we could not assess the effect of the sanitation intervention on hookworm eggs in soil as we did not detect any. Detection of hookworm eggs in soil has been reported in only two studies; of 345 total samples in these studies, hookworm eggs were detected in three samples [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The inability of other studies to detect hookworm eggs in soil indicates that these three samples may have had eggs of other species misclassified as hookworm. It is possible that hookworm eggs degraded during our sample processing steps. In order to assess the prevalence and concentration of hookworm in soil, hookworm larvae (rather than eggs) can be recovered from soil samples. One study successfully used damp gauze pads placed on the soil surface to recover hookworm larvae [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A related limitation is that our method was optimized for the recovery of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">lumbricoides</italic> eggs from soil [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the recovery efficiency of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs is unknown. While this does not affect the estimated effect of the sanitation intervention on <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> eggs in soil, it influences the interpretation of the prevalence and concentration of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">trichiura</italic> we observed in soil. Finally, we relied on microscopy to quantify STH eggs. Microscopic inspection is vulnerable to misclassification of STH eggs [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to DNA-based diagnostics [<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008815.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Future work to validate DNA-based methods for detection of STH in soil could improve the reliability of future studies and allow for inclusion of more fragile STH species, such as hookworm.</p>
              <p>A compound-level sanitation intervention consisting of lined pit latrines, child potties and scoops for feces disposal was not effective in reducing the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in courtyard soil in rural Bangladesh. Access to and use of latrines by adults was insufficient to prevent feces from contaminating the domestic environment when the majority of young children continued to practice open defecation in the household courtyard and the feces of children and animals were not disposed of hygienically. In order to effectively reduce the transmission of STH infections in low-resource contexts, interventions may need to focus on widespread access to and use of hardware for hygienic disposal of child and animal feces in addition to adult feces.</p>

              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors sufficiently describe the study objectives and design. The design is appropriate, high quality, and well-described in this manuscript. Further details on the WASH Benefits study are available elsewhere. The population is clearly described, and the sample size is appropriate. The statistical analysis is appropriate. I have no concerns about ethical issues.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: • This study is a substudy as part of the larger WASH Benefits clinical trial, and as such the main study population is already defined.</p>
              <p>• The authors clearly state the aim of this paper – to assess the impact of a compound sanitation intervention on the prevalence and abundance of several different species of STH in soil obtained from outside control and intervention households</p>
              <p>• The study design is appropriate, though I would like to see mention of (and ideally inclusion of) additional potential confounders in this study. The authors state that they are primarily interested in unadjusted effects, and state that “as randomisation led to a good balance across arms, bias due to confounding in our dataset is unlikely”. However, the authors mention in the introduction that 94% of adults in the intervention group of the main trial use latrines provided in the intervention, compared with 40% in the control group (though I note it is unclear if this percentage means 40% of control households that already have a hygienic toilet actually use it, or 40% of the whole control population actually have a hygienic toilet). They also report that open defecation is still a problem in both arms, with high percentages of children still practicing OD (e.g. 81% of children aged 0 – 2 years). They also mention that unhygienic disposal of child faeces is also common, with 84% of control and 64% of intervention households not safely disposing of child faeces. However, none of these factors are measured or adjusted for in the analysis, and I am concerned they may be unmeasured confounders. They seem likely predictors of STH infection of soil in a household compound. Were these factors measured in this subanalysis? If so they need to be adjusted for, and if not, then they need to be mentioned as a limitation or possible explanation for why there is no difference between control/intervention</p>
              <p>• The methodology (and introduction) would benefit from a few more definitions. For example, defining what “abundance” means (eggs per gram of soil), and interpreting ICC values e.g. excellent/good/moderate/fair/poor to help the reader. Also, a brief explanation for how prevalence ratios are calculated. They mention “randomisation leading to a good balance”, but would be useful to add “a good balance of sociodemographic characteristics” and add in a reference to table 1.</p>
              <p>• The authors do not provide detail about how the analysis is carried out in R. They mention and reference use of R – “We estimated unadjusted and adjusted intention-to-treat effects using the R (version 3.3.2) package for targeted maximum likelihood estimation with SuperLearner (42,43)”, but no additional information is given. This makes it very difficult for the reader to understand how the analysis was conducted, especially adjusting for potential confounders</p>
              <p>• The data collection also took place over a year (May 2015 – May 2016), which is a long period of time, though I assume this is because of the need to include wet and dry seasons. It would be good to see “time since intervention” included as a measured factor, as I’m not sure how fieldwork was planned/enacted over this long period of time, and if there were different lengths of time between intervention enactment and soil sample analysis (e.g. 12 months for one household, vs, 24 months for others - there could be a significant influence of time between intervention and analysis that could impact the results) </p>
              <p>• Authors mention carrying out “replicate” samples, but would be good to state if duplicate or triplicate. The authors mention “Replicates were dropped from the analysis”, but do not say if they were averaged first across replicates, or how they decided which to drop – would be good to explain this.</p>
              <p>• Authors reference the clinical trial number that this substudy is nested under, but do not mention ethical approval – this should be stated to ensure the study has been approved</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The analysis is appropriate and well described. The results are sufficiently and clearly presented. The figures are clear and appropriate.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: • Overall the results demonstrate that there was no significant impact of the intervention on STH prevalence or abundance</p>
              <p>• The analyses carried out support the research question outlined, though as noted above, it is difficult to understand how the analysis is conducted with the limited information provided about the R package used (without digging around to find out more yourself).</p>
              <p>• The authors should consider if there is a better way to convey the information in the tables and graphs more concisely - they are difficult to navigate as a reader as there is so much information presented</p>
              <p> o I would recommend that the individual graphs in figure 1 are combined into a single graph rather than 8 individual graphs that have the same axes; I would make the same recommendation for figure 2 and 3 – this would also help the reader to compare the different results between species more easily as well as reducing the number of individual graphs</p>
              <p> o For tables 2 – 5, I would recommend moving substantial amounts of this data into supplementary figures, and choose only the most important information to include in the main paper. This is a lot of information to include in the main paper, and I don’t feel it adds value to include it all. The authors should decide which are the most important table values to include – some suggestions could be to choose to show “any eggs” results in the main paper and “larvated eggs” results in the supplementary figures? Or just show adjusted figures in the main paper and unadjusted in the supplementary (though I realise the primary parameters chosen are unadjusted so this might not work). Or just show unadjusted overall figures in the main paper and move the sub-analyses results to the supplementary figures. There are a few ways to do it – the authors should decide which are the most important findings to show in the main paper and move the rest to supplementary</p>
              <p>• It was also difficult to compare adjust vs unadjusted values – adjusted were given as supplementary and unadjusted were in the main tables. </p>
              <p>• Again would be good to help the reader by interpreting the ICC values</p>
              <p>• In the subgroup analyses the authors make a number of statements about differences in STH egg prevalence/intensity values in the dry vs. wet season, and use the word “significant”. The authors need to add a brief explanation/justification as to how they are deciding a finding is significant or not, as there doesn’t seem to be justification/evidence/calculations of how some differences are judged significant and others are not e.g. p values</p>
              <p>• In the final paragraph of the results section the authors mention modest reductions in prevalence of ascaris in the deworming subgroup analysis – again, it would be good for the authors to expand on how they are determining what is considered a real statistically significant difference and how this is justified - is it just the confidence intervals they are using in this instance?</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The conclusions are supported by the data presented and some limitations are addressed. The authors address the public health relevance of the results.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: • The authors provide a number of interesting and reasonable arguments to support why no significant difference was observed between control and intervention arms for a number of parameters. For example, how it was common to top up soil in courtyards (and so STH could be introduced this way), or how household members could walk STH into the courtyard from other nearby soil on their shoes</p>
              <p>• In the opening paragraph of the discussion, the authors mention hygienic latrine use and disposal of child faeces in the intervention arm (“Among households in the sanitation arm, where adults regularly used hygienic latrines but only a third of households safely disposed of child feces the prevalence or abundance of total or larvated A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura eggs in courtyard soil was not significantly lower compared to households in the control arm”). These factors do not appear to have been measured or adjusted for in this substudy analysis. The authors do at least touch on how “continuing child open defecation and unsafe disposal of child feces in the sanitation arm could be a source of STH eggs to contaminate courtyards and contribute to the lack of impact on STH eggs in the environment from the sanitation intervention”, but it would be good to make this clearer and more obvious as a limitation in this study (as it doesn’t seem to have been measured or adjusted for, and would potentially be a strong risk factor)</p>
              <p>• I am again uncomfortable about mention of “significant differences” without justification in the results section</p>
              <p>• The authors mention future use of qPCR to detect STH (especially hookworm, which they weren’t able to detect using their methodology) but I think this could be a stronger recommendation with authors recommending urgent work to validate this method (which is successfully used to detect STH species from faecal samples already) in soil samples.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Line 51: "isolate and hygienically dispose of" - should include "adults"</p>
              <p>Introduction section - Suggest inclusion of some information about the Bangladesh context; paper generally reflects little if anything about STH epidemiology and STH control in Bangladesh - that's to the detriment of the manuscript in my opinion. </p>
              <p>Line 75: Per previous comment - Bangladesh WHO recommends "annual" MDA but Bangladesh treats school-attending school-age children 2x annually, with little documented coverage of non-school attending SAC or preschool age children. Those issues are relevant to your results (including around young children). </p>
              <p>Line 97: unclear language</p>
              <p>Lines 107-9: Suggest moving this sentence to paragraph starting on Line 82</p>
              <p>Lines 123-4: "Eight nearby pregnant..." You mean households with pregnant women? Presumably, you mean nearby to one another.</p>
              <p>Line 143: "structured observations" - observed by who, when? </p>
              <p>Line 191: remove "quality assurance." Confirmatory testing would be considered, quality control. </p>
              <p>Line 228: "...analyses accounted for [the] lab staff member who..."</p>
              <p>Line 241 &amp; 243: would remove the word, "status" - confusing</p>
              <p>Discussion: Discussion is focused and clearly presented. And I would suggest consideration and discussion of the context of the study even though that context is outside of WASHBenefits - it speaks directly to implications and public health relevance. Regarding the comparison with Kenya - the contexts are quite different as you touch on. However, you don't discuss preventive chemotherapy coverage across the entire pop in each country or baseline prevalence. </p>
              <p>Lines 335-7: Excellent point and one that I think is central to the broader relevance of the work - but unfortunately not discussed. </p>
              <p>Line 339-42: You intentionally sampled one small, specific, high-traffic (in front of main entrance to household) area across all HHs, (how) does that affect results? </p>
              <p>Lines 407-409: See comments from lines 335-7. Suggest that instead of leaving this for the last sentence, a more thorough discussion be had, and evidence (or the lack thereof) from other RCTs/studies of this quality be raised.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The main recommendation would be to modify the figures and tables significantly so they are easier to interpret and understand. It may be better for the authors to decide their priorities rather than an editor given there is a lot of data. For example, combine the individual graphs into one for figures 1/2/3, and pick the most important information to present from the tables (rather than presenting everything).</p>
              <p>There are a few minor editorial issues I noticed e.g. “STH eggs in soil have been detected in outdoor soil in various settings” [don’t need to say in soil twice]; “As the method was optimized to detect A. lumbricoides, the recovery efficiency for other STH species was likely was lower” [remove one of the “was” occurrences]; “Based on the daily processing capacity of the lab, we targeted to sample approximately 1500 compounds” [we “aimed/planned/set out to sample” may be better English] etc.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Well-executed study and well-written manuscript. Data analysis is appropriate and well presented. While beyond the immediate aim of WASH Benefits, I would encourage you to more thoroughly discuss the broader relevance of your findings (e.g. need for sustained community-level WASH interventions instead of HH-level interventions, etc.). Obviously, there are practical challenges (e.g. cost) with implementing a similar RCT at community-level.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This paper was interesting, and I believe important findings and ideas are presented that will be very interesting to others working in this area.</p>
              <p>In general, the details in the methods and results need tightening up, with additional definitions/clarifications added to avoid confusion or misunderstanding by the reader. For example, an explanation for how significance is assessed; acknowledgement of unmeasured confounders (such as household behaviour with regard to sanitation usage and child faeces disposal practices) is also important – is this information available and could it be included in the adjusted analysis?; and more information about how the analysis was carried out (what the R package does).</p>
              <p>My recommendation would be to revise all of the tables and figures (excluding the sociodemographics table, which is fine) to make them easier to navigate, and a lot more concise, and by moving less important information to the supplementary figure section. </p>
              <p>I believe this paper would be suitable for publication after a moderate revision. Minor revisions are needed to the text (e.g. additional clarifications), and some more major adjustments to the figures/tables.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Kwong,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Effect of sanitation improvements on soil-transmitted helminth eggs in courtyard soil from rural Bangladesh: Evidence from a cluster-randomized controlled trial" for consideration at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic. Based on the reviews, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, providing that you modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations. </p>
              <p>The authors have addressed all of the reviewer's comments from the first submission. In my editorial review, I have noted some errors or misunderstandings which need to be addressed before this article may be accepted. These are detailed below:</p>
              <p>Lines 71 &amp; 72: Ancylostoma ceylanicum should now be included in any list of the human hookworms. It is the second most common hookworm of humans in the Asia/Pacific region, with high prevalence in some regions.</p>
              <p>Lines 155-157: What exact month or months of what year were the soil samples examined in this study collected? The degree of rainfall at the time of collection will be very pertinent to results and should be made available to readers.</p>
              <p>Lines 197, 202, 208: Please add the manufacturer and city of manufacture for 7X detergent solution, zinc sulfate and sulfuric acid.</p>
              <p>Lines 227-228. Note also because of the markedly different life cycles of this STH meaning that eggs are less likely to be present in any tested patch of soil [Hookworm larvae hatch after 48-72 hours and seek moisture, so you see them in moisture areas (particularly dewy grass) close to deposited faeces, whereas Trichuris and Ascaris eggs remain viable in the soil for up to three years or more. The hookworm larvbae only live for two or three months in the environment. So, you don’t have years worth of hookworm eggs floating around in dust after desiccation of the faeces, to be picked up on hands and shoes and brought into households, as you do with Trichuris and Ascaris].</p>
              <p>Lines 386-402: I assume that household dogs are not present in Bangladesh? These provide a reservoir of A. ceylanicum hookworm and also disseminate T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides from human faeces via coprophagia. What about cats? They are also a reservoir of A. ceylanicum.</p>
              <p>A. Suum has been shown to be a at most a sub-genotype of A. lumbricoides and more likely the same species, just in a different host. Pigs may often be infected with the human genotype of A. lumbricoides and vice versa, particularly in LIMC settings. Please change any reference to A. suum to A. lumbricoides. Also note that change line 386, which is incorrect, pigs may be a host for human A. lumbricoides. You can use the terms “porcine A. lumbricoides” or “porcine ascariasis” if you need to differentiate human from pig infections. Please see links to references supporting this below:</p>

              <p>
                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I would like to thank the authors for consideration of, and revisions in response to, my comments. Unfortunately some of the corrected statements require some rewriting for clarificiation as in their current form they might confuse the literature. The identified issues and some suggested corrections are listed below. </p>
              <p>Lines 294-295:</p>
              <p>I think that it is important to clarify which species of STH may cause patent infection in these animals. Currently, these lines read as,</p>
              <p>"Few households had animals that can spread STH by consuming human feces (pigs, dogs) and/or are known hosts for the STH species we investigated (pigs, dogs, cats)."</p>
              <p>I'd suggest the following potential change,</p>
              <p>""Few households had animals that can spread STH by passage after consuming human feces (pigs, dogs) and/or are known hosts for the STH species we investigated (A. lumbricoides in pigs, A. ceylanicum in dogs and cats)."</p>
              <p>Lines 392-394:</p>
              <p>"Domestic animals that consume human feces (pig and dogs) or are known hosts for Ascaris spp. (pigs, dogs, and cats) are uncommon in rural Bangladesh. However, the domestic animals that are present may distribute STH eggs across household courtyards."</p>
              <p>- Cats and dogs are patent hosts for A. ceylanicum, but not hosts for Ascaris (though this is has been suggested for dogs once or twice in the literature, it has not yet been proven). Pigs are true patent hosts for Ascaris.</p>
              <p>Suggested alternative-</p>
              <p>"Domestic animals are known reservoir hosts for some human-infecting STH (A. lumbricoides in pigs, A. ceylanicum in dogs and cats). These domestic animals are uncommon in rural Bangladesh. However, the domestic animals that are present may distribute STH eggs across household courtyards by passage after coprophagia."</p>
              <p>Following these comments being addressed, I have no further revisions.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Kwong,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'Effect of sanitation improvements on soil-transmitted helminth eggs in courtyard soil from rural Bangladesh: Evidence from a cluster-randomized controlled trial' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
              <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
              <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Kwong,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Effect of sanitation improvements on soil-transmitted helminth eggs in courtyard soil from rural Bangladesh: Evidence from a cluster-randomized controlled trial," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
