                  <p>Estudio PARTO was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Western Massachusetts from 2013–17. Hispanic women who screened positive for gestational diabetes mellitus were randomized to a Lifestyle Intervention (LI, n = 100) or to a comparison Health and Wellness (HW, n = 104) group during late pregnancy. Exercise goals in LI were to meet American College of Obstetrician &amp; Gynecologists guidelines for postpartum PA.

                  <p>Compared to baseline levels, both groups had significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA at 6 months and one year postpartum (i.e., LI: mean change = 30.9 MET-hrs/wk, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05; HW: 27.6 MET-hrs/wk, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), with only LI group experiencing significant increases in vigorous PA (mean change = 1.3 MET-hrs/wk, <italic>p =</italic> 0.03). Based on an intent-to-treat analysis using mixed effects models, we observed no differences in pattern of change in PA intensity and type over time between intervention groups (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10). However, there was the suggestion of a greater decrease in sedentary activity in the LI group compared to the HW group (β = -3.56, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, the number of people with diabetes is projected to rise from 382 million in 2013 to 592 million in 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Simultaneously, the age at onset of type 2 diabetes is decreasing which highlights the importance of identifying high-risk groups early in order to implement prevention efforts [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Women who develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or milder glucose intolerance in pregnancy are at high risk for type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; and women who develop GDM in pregnancy have a 7-fold higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>According to a systematic review, the highest risk period for the development of type 2 diabetes is within the first 5 years after a diagnosis of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; with 50% of Hispanic women developing type 2 diabetes during this time period [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is consistent with findings showing a rapid postpartum change in glucose tolerance among women with GDM and with milder degrees of progressing to prediabetes or diabetes as early as one year postpartum [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, the pregnancy and postpartum periods represent critical opportunities for interventions designed to prevent subsequent onset of diabetes in susceptible populations.</p>
              <p>Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that postpartum women attain 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (PA) in the absence of any delivery complications [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, postpartum PA levels among women with GDM rarely meet these recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and, among Hispanic postpartum women, 51% reported being inactive and only 11% reported engaging in moderate-intensity PA, substantially lower rates as compared to non-Hispanic whites [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For women with young families, the lack of time, cost of childcare, physical limitations, and feeling tired are major barriers to participation in PA [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Low PA following pregnancy may also be due to lack of PA self-efficacy, which is an individual’s confidence in their ability to be physically active [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Many lifestyle interventions designed to increase PA among non-pregnant adults at risk of diabetes have had a positive impact on reducing risk of type 2 diabetes in general population samples [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and among US Hispanic adults as well [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, lifestyle interventions designed to increase PA among postpartum women are sparse and among the few that targeted women with previous GDM [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] many occurred after the index pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, lifestyle interventions that start during pregnancy and continue postpartum may be more effective by taking advantage of the “teachable moment” of pregnancy. In addition, many prior postpartum lifestyle interventions required travel to a gym or clinic and did not utilize a theoretical framework to guide intervention development. Few studies measured the impact of their interventions on PA self-efficacy.</p>
              <p>Finally, few postpartum interventions specifically targeted at-risk Hispanic women. Hispanic women have higher rates of overweight and obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, and GDM as compared to non-Hispanic white women [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is critical as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the US with the percentage of Hispanic women of childbearing age projected to increase 74% by 2060, in contrast to an expected 35% decline in non-Hispanic whites over the same time period [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, as compared to non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic women with a history of GDM are less aware of diabetes risk factors and prevention strategies (e.g., PA, dietary behaviors, and weight management) [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, despite these findings, socioeconomic, health literacy, and language barriers have limited the access of Hispanic women to interventions that promote healthy lifestyles.</p>
              <p>Therefore, our aims were to examine the effect of a lifestyle intervention on postpartum PA levels and PA self-efficacy in at-risk Hispanic women who screened positive for GDM. The intervention was designed to be a low-cost high-reach strategy such that findings could readily be translated into clinical practice in underserved and minority populations. We hypothesized that women randomized to a Lifestyle Intervention (LI) group would report less sedentary time and greater moderate and vigorous intensity PA and sports/ exercise), and would be more likely to meet ACOG PA guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] compared to those randomized to a comparison Health and Wellness (HW) Intervention. We also hypothesized that women randomized to LI would demonstrate greater PA self-efficacy compared to women randomized to HW.</p>

                <p>Estudio PARTO (Project Aiming to Reduce Type two diabetes) study [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was a randomized controlled trial conducted from January 2013 to December 2017 at Baystate Medical Center in Western Massachusetts to test the efficacy of a culturally and linguistically modified, individually-tailored lifestyle intervention to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including low levels of PA and self-efficacy, among postpartum Hispanic women who screened positive for GDM. The study was approved by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Baystate Health Institutional Review Boards (IRB reference #: BH-12-111).</p>
                <p>Eligible women were recruited by bilingual/bicultural health educators at the time of routine screening for GDM (24–28 weeks gestation) and randomly assigned to either a LI or HW Intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236408.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Randomization was stratified by the results of the diagnostic 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using thresholds defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA): 1) no glucose values meeting or exceeding the ADA thresholds; or 2) one or more glucose values meeting or exceeding the ADA thresholds) [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <p>In both intervention groups, an introductory phase (~29 weeks gestation to the time of birth) was followed by an active phase (6 weeks postpartum– 6 months postpartum) and then a maintenance phase (6 months–one year postpartum). Both the introductory phase and the active phase were kicked-off with an in-person session, after which participants received weekly, biweekly, and monthly telephone booster calls and mailings. Tailoring questionnaires administered at 6 weeks, 6 months, and one year postpartum were used to inform culturally-tailored and motivational individually-tailored feedback. All print-based intervention materials were in Spanish or English depending upon participant preference.</p>
                <p>Trained bicultural/bilingual health interviewers, blinded to the intervention group, conducted assessments at baseline, and at 6-weeks, 6-months, and 12-months postpartum.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>Eligibility was limited to Hispanic women at elevated risk for developing type 2 diabetes, defined by having an abnormal result (i.e., ≥135 mg/dL) on the GDM screen. Hispanic ethnicity was identified via self-report by asking, “Are you Hispanic or of Spanish or Hispanic origin or descent? (response options: yes, no)” in the manner of the U.S. Census.</p>
                <p>Women were excluded if they had: 1) a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or chronic renal disease, 2) &lt;16 or &gt;45 years of age, 3) contra-indications to engaging in moderate PA and consuming a low fat/high fiber diet, or 4) self-reported inability to read English or Spanish at a sixth grade level.</p>
                <p>A total of 585 participants were approached and screened for eligibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236408.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Of these, 263 women met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. Fifty-nine were subsequently excluded prior to randomization because they were no longer interested (n = 25), &gt;37 weeks gestation (n = 26), or developed other medical contraindications (n = 8). The remaining 204 women were randomized to LI (n = 100) or to HW Intervention (n = 104). Of these women, 54 chose not to participate in the study after delivery, and thus were excluded due to missing PA data at all three postpartum time points. Therefore, the final sample included 150 women: LI (n = 71) and HW Intervention (n = 79).</p>

                <title>Lifestyle intervention</title>
                <p>The LI was designed by utilizing constructs from both Social Cognitive Theory [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the Transtheoretical Model [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and took into account the social, cultural, economic, and environmental resources and challenges faced by Hispanic women [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. During the introductory phase, the goal of the lifestyle intervention was to shift women along the continuum of pre-contemplation for PA to contemplation and preparation for the postpartum active intervention phase. The goal of the active phase was to achieve ACOG guidelines for postpartum PA [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Participants were asked to choose which type of PA they felt was safe, enjoyable, and easy to incorporate into their daily lives, and were given pedometers and activity logs to help track their weekly PA.</p>
                <p>Mailed materials, based upon the tailoring questionnaires, included culturally-tailored stage-matched manuals which emphasized benefits of exercise, how to build social support for PA, and strategies to overcome barriers to PA. Tip sheets included information for women to be physically active with their baby.</p>
                <p>Each telephone session involved review of progress towards previous PA goals, problem solving for challenges faced in achieving these goals, and the setting of new PA goals.</p>

                <p>HW served as the comparison group and received the same number of in-person sessions, telephone calls, and mailings at the same time points as LI. Content was limited to general information available to the public from the ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These included, for example, mailed booklets on non-exercise and non-dietary general wellness topics (e.g., cigarette smoking) in English or Spanish. These booklets represented high-quality, standard, low-cost self-help material currently available to the public. In this manner, we controlled for contact time while keeping the content of the two interventions distinct [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Postpartum physical activity levels</title>
                  <p>The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) was used to measure pregnancy and postpartum PA. The PPAQ is a semi-quantitative instrument, previously shown to be valid and reliable in this population, that measures the duration and intensity of time spent in household/caregiving, occupational, transportation, and sports/exercise activities [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The number of minutes spent in each reported activity was multiplied by its metabolic equivalent of task (MET) level and summed to arrive at an estimate of average weekly MET-hours/week.</p>
                  <p>We calculated the average number of MET-hrs/wk spent in each type of PA (i.e., household/caregiving, transportation, occupational, and sports/exercise) and in each intensity-level of PA (i.e., sedentary [&lt;1.5 METs], light [1.5–&lt;3.0 METs], moderate to vigorous [MVPA ≥3 METs], and vigorous intensity PA [≥6 METS]). Meeting ACOG guidelines was categorized as ≥ 7.5 MET hours/week of moderate-vigorous sports and exercise [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Self-efficacy</title>
                  <p>Self-efficacy for PA was measured using the 5-item scale Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that contains five items designed to assess participants’ confidence in their ability to exercise despite various situations. Participants were asked to rate their level of confidence on a 5-point scale with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy. We also calculated the self-efficacy t-score which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.</p>
                  <p>The Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Questionnaire has adequate internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and concurrent validity and has been found to be reliable and valid among a sample of Hispanic women [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

                <title>Covariate assessment</title>
                <p>Demographic and behavioral characteristics were collected at baseline via standardized questionnaires. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, education, marital status, annual household income, living situation, number of adults and children in the household, and generation in the continental US. Acculturation was assessed with the Psychological Acculturation Scale (PAS) [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PAS scores between 1 and &lt;3 were categorized as low acculturation, and scores ≥3 were categorized as high acculturation. Sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] as a continuous measure ranging from 1 to 21 with lower scores indicating better quality sleep. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and categorized as at least probable minor depression using the recommended cutpoint of ≥13 [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
                <p>Clinical characteristics of the pregnancy were abstracted from the medical record and included parity and prepregnancy BMI. Glucose tolerance in pregnancy was categorized as: 1) isolated hyperglycemia: blood glucose &gt;140mg/dL for the one hour oral glucose challenge test followed by a normal OGTT for all four measures; 2) impaired glucose tolerance: blood glucose &gt;140 mg/dL followed by an OGTT with one abnormal result; and 3) GDM: blood glucose &gt;140 mg/dL followed by an OGTT with ≥2 abnormal results.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>Two-sample t-tests and chi square tests were used to explore differences in intervention group characteristics at baseline. Within-group differences in mean changes from baseline (late pregnancy) to 6-weeks, 6 months, and one year postpartum, respectively were assessed with Wilcoxon signed rank tests for continuous variables and with McNemar tests for categorical variables.</p>
                <p>We used an intent-to-treat analysis to evaluate the impact of the LI on the adoption and maintenance of increased PA and self-efficacy as compared to the HW group. Specifically, mixed models were used to evaluate differences in the change in PA variables from baseline to one year postpartum between the intervention groups. These models accounted for the repeated measures of PA with random subject effects, and incorporated fixed assessment time effects using baseline PA as the reference. We used generalized estimating equations (proc genmod) to evaluate differences in the percent of women meeting ACOG guidelines between intervention groups over follow-up time.</p>
                <p>We then conducted several sensitivity analyses. We limited the analysis to women in LI who were compliant with the intervention defined as: 1) meeting the ACOG guidelines and 2) returning ≥1 tailoring questionnaires during the postpartum period. We repeated the analysis limiting the sample to those with prepregnancy overweight or obesity as some prior studies have found that interventions may be more effective in this population [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis where women who did not attend a postpartum assessment visit were categorized as not having met ACOG guidelines at that time point. Finally, we compared those missing all PA data to those with PA data at any time point.</p>
                <p>All analyses were considered statistically significant at an alpha &lt;0.05. SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for all statistical analysis.</p>

              <p>Participants had an average age of 27.7 ± 5.7 years, mean prepregnancy BMI of 31.0±7.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and the majority were in the obese category (<xref rid="pone.0236408.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). One-third (32.4%) of the participants were married and the majority reported living with a spouse or partner (67.6%). Approximately one third of the participants had been diagnosed with GDM. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in sociodemographic factors or medical history variables, however the LI group had more mild forms of glucose intolerance compared to the HW group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003).</p>

Other domain specific changes were similar to LI. For example, mean sedentary MET hours/week decreased from baseline to 6 months (-3.9 ± 13.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and to one year (-5.4 ± 14.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). MVPA increased significantly from baseline to each follow-up time period; for example, at 1 year postpartum, the mean increase in MVPA was 27.6 ± 87.8 MET hrs/wk as compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Household activity increased from baseline to 6 weeks (59.0 ± 94.2 MET hrs/wk, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and to 6 months, while occupational activity decreased over this time frame (-20.6 ± 61.5 MET hrs/wk, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002).

              <p>We then evaluated the impact of the intervention on PA self-efficacy.

However findings from mixed models yielded no greater improvement over time in self-efficacy in LI vs HW from baseline to one year postpartum (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31).</p>
              <p>We then conducted several sensitivity analyses. Findings were virtually unchanged after limiting the analysis to women who were compliant with LI defined as meeting the ACOG guidelines at any postpartum time point (30.8–42.0% of the LI group), or after limiting the analysis to participants in either group who returned one or more tailoring questionnaires during the postpartum period (42.9% in LI and 57.1% in HW). Findings were similarly unchanged after categorizing women who did not attend postpartum assessment visits as not having reached ACOG guidelines. When we repeated the main analysis among women with prepregnancy overweight or obesity (78.9% in LI, and 76.0% in HW), findings were also virtually unchanged.</p>
              <p>Finally, women missing data did not differ from those in the final sample according to the majority of sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and PA variables.

              <p>In this randomized trial of a culturally modified, motivationally targeted, individually-tailored intervention targeting Hispanic women with glucose abnormalities in pregnancy, we did not observe that LI led to a greater improvement in postpartum PA and self-efficacy over HW. However, we did observe the suggestion of a greater decrease in sedentary activity in LI compared to HW. In addition, compared to baseline levels, both groups experienced significant increases in MVPA at 6 months and one year postpartum, with LI only experiencing significant increases in vigorous PA at these time points.</p>
              <p>Our findings are comparable to the majority of prior trials among women with GDM that commenced soon after pregnancy and tended to observe no impact of on postpartum PA [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with only one observing a small increase (e.g., 11 min/day) in leisure time activity [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among trials that began during pregnancy, a Diabetes Prevention Program-derived lifestyle intervention among 2280 participants (22.2% Hispanic) found greater improvements in vigorous intensity PA as measured by the PPAQ in the intervention group compared to the control (mean difference = 15.4 minutes/week, 95% CI = 4.9, 25.8) but no impact on walking, moderate intensity PA, or total PA [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the only study targeting Hispanic women, Hawkins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found a slightly higher increase in vigorous PA as measured by the PPAQ at six weeks postpartum in LI compared to the standard care group (0.5 ± 0.5 MET hours/week vs. -0.9 ± 0.5 MET hours/week, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046). Similarly, we found that only women in LI reported a significant increase in vigorous activity from baseline, however this change was not significantly different from HW. These studies did not evaluate the impact of their interventions on sedentary PA.</p>
              <p>The significant increases in MVPA reported by both groups were largely due to increases in household/caregiving and occupational activity over the postpartum year, as opposed to sports/exercise, and were consistent with the increased demands of caring for a newborn and returning to work. Specifically, MVPA was made up of 17 types of activity more than half of which were moderate household/caregiving activities, occupational activities or transportation activities.</p>
              <p>Few prior studies have evaluated the impact of their intervention on PA self-efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In their clinic-based trial among Taiwanese pregnant women, Huang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found significantly greater improvements in postpartum self-efficacy scores in the intervention group while the Norwegian Fit for Delivery study found no significant differences between groups [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In the current study, LI reported a significant increase in self-efficacy while HW reported a non-significant decrease however the difference in the change between groups was not significant.</p>
              <p>Our findings and those of others indicating that a LI yielded none or only modest improvements in PA among postpartum women with glucose intolerance in pregnancy could be due to several reasons. During pregnancy, factors such as health concerns for the safety of the fetus, physical limitations, and lack resources contribute to poor adherence to PA recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. After delivery, the pressures of caring for a new baby and work related obstacles have been reported to be major barriers to an active lifestyle over the postpartum year [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Findings that these barriers remain consistent from delivery to 12 months postpartum suggest that they are difficult to overcome [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>Differences in findings between our study and prior studies could be due to differences in the dose of the lifestyle intervention, the time since the index pregnancy, and in the race/ethnicity of the study samples. Most importantly, differences may be due to our use of a contact-time comparison group that received the same amount and frequency of materials/sessions, enabling us to control for contact time while keeping the content of the interventions distinct. In this manner, we could isolate the impact of LI on PA and rule out the possibility that the social support provided by study staff contributed to differences between groups. Among Hispanic women in particular, social support has been identified as a major facilitator of behavior change [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In contrast, previous trials utilized usual care control groups and therefore cannot rule out the role of social support in observed improvements in the lifestyle arm [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0236408.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>In addition, unlike some prior studies, we attempted to use a low-cost high reach strategy that involved fewer face-to-face visits and no supervised exercise sessions. While this approach addressed child care and transportation barriers, the intervention dosage may not have been high enough to impact PA one year postpartum. On the other hand, prior studies have reported low compliance rates with supervised exercise sessions; for example, only 16% of participants the in the FitFor2 trial followed at least half of the training sessions [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We found that 43–57% of women were compliant in returning tailoring questionnaires, and 31–42% of women in LI met ACOG recommendations. Low levels of adherence may be due to the fact that women with glucose intolerance in pregnancy do not perceive themselves as being at high risk for diabetes after delivery [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Given that more than half of our participants (63%) had more mild forms of glucose abnormalities, as opposed to frank GDM, they may have been even less likely to perceive themselves at risk.</p>
              <p>Our study faced several limitations. Self-reported assessment of PA may be subject to social desirability bias; however, PA was collected using a validated questionnaire, which minimized potential bias. Participants in this study were not blinded to their intervention group and therefore the LI group may have been more likely to overestimate their exercise. However, total PA included household/caregiving and occupational PA which would be less susceptible to social desirability bias. Approximately one-quarter of women did not participate in the study after delivery and therefore were missing PA data. This group was less likely to be low income and born outside the continental US. To the extent that these factors were associated with postpartum PA, they may have confounded our results. In addition, missing data led to a lower sample size and therefore reduced power to detect differences in change between groups.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>In conclusion, in this trial of a postpartum intervention in Hispanic women, we did not observe that a lifestyle intervention led to a greater improvement in postpartum PA or self-efficacy. However, women in both intervention groups appeared to benefit from participation in a postpartum intervention. With the growing rates of diabetes and obesity in U.S. women, efforts to improve the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for the prevention of diabetes in high-risk women becomes critical.</p>
                <p>Such interventions should focus on self-selected activities that are sustainable over time and use low-cost strategies such as mail and telephone based interactions to reduce participant burden (e.g., transportation and child care needs). In addition, lifestyle interventions that start during pregnancy would take advantage of the “teachable moment” of pregnancy by addressing the observation that women with glucose intolerance in pregnancy do not perceive themselves as being at high risk for diabetes. Use of such high-reach, low-cost design strategies would facilitate translation of such interventions into clinical practice in underserved and minority populations [<xref rid="pone.0236408.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Chasan-Taber,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Specifically, the reviewers suggets some changes in the statistical methods section to clarify some steps taking in analysing the data.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that your decision is justified on PLOS ONE’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">publication criteria</ext-link> and not, for example, on novelty or perceived impact.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jul 25 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Important note: This review pertains only to ‘statistical aspects’ of the study and so ‘clinical aspects’ [like medical importance, relevance of the study, ‘clinical significance and implication(s)’ of the whole study, etc.] are to be evaluated [should be assessed] separately/independently.</p>
              <p>This study is excellently planned &amp; executed/conducted and manuscript is nicely drafted (no doubt about that). However, there are few suggestions [may please be considered as they may need to be clarified/told clearly at appropriate places in the text]:</p>
              <p>1. In ‘Materials and methods - Study Design’ section it is said that “Randomization was stratified by the results of the diagnostic 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)” but ‘what exactly is done’ is neither clear in further text nor from Figure 1 [Flow chart of participant recruitment and retention; Estudio PARTO 2013-2016]. It appears to be simple random allocation (may be by using permuted randomized blocks to ensure nearly same size in groups).</p>
              <p>2. This study has taken data (it is a secondary data analysis then – please clarify) from some other trial {Estudio PARTO was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Western Massachusetts from 2013-17} for which the data were collected till 2017 then (my question is) ‘why this delay?’</p>
              <p>3. Statistical comparison of baseline characteristics [last ‘p-value’ column in Table 1 (Distribution of Covariates according to Intervention Group; Estudio PARTO 2013-2016)] is not desirable at all [because even if P-value turns out to be significant (while comparing baseline characteristics despite random allocation), it is, by definition, a false positive] as you are supposed to be testing ‘randomization’ then, which in any single trial may not balance all baseline characteristics as ‘randomization’ is a sort of ‘insurance’ and not a guarantee scheme.</p>
              <p>(Reference: Harrington D, D’Agostino RB, Gatsonis C, Hogan JW, Hunter DJ, Normand ST, et al. New guidelines for statistical reporting in the journal. N Engl J Med 2019;381:285-6)</p>
              <p>4. It is known that ANCOVA has more ‘power’ than ‘change scores’ analyses [Reference: ‘The use of percentage change from baseline as an outcome in a controlled trial is statistically inefficient – a simulation study’ by Andrew Vickers in BMC Medical Research Methodology 2001, 1:6] displayed in table-3, however, it was necessary to use non-parametric tests [like Wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous variables, &amp; McNemar test for categorical variables] on data yielded by tools [like Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) and the Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Questionnaire]. Moreover, ANCOVA involves few assumptions which are many times not fulfilled (&amp; are unlikely be fulfilled in this case).</p>
              <p>5. Agreed that final analyses included Lifestyle Intervention (N=71) &amp; Health &amp; Wellness Intervention (N=79) but baseline data in table-1 should have all who were randomized to start with [were randomized to a Lifestyle Intervention (LI, n=100) or to a comparison Health and Wellness (HW, n=104) group]. Is not that so? ‘Covariate assessment’ section states that “Demographic and behavioral characteristics were collected at baseline via standardized questionnaires”. ‘Statistical analyses’ section states that “We used an intent-to-treat analysis to evaluate the impact of the LI on the adoption and maintenance of increased PA and self-efficacy as compared to the HW group”.</p>
              <p>Otherwise everything else [including Using Mixed Models] is faultless. Except above minor ‘revision’ points, I recommend the publication of this article in our journal.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Summary:</p>
              <p>This study assess the change in physical activity (PA) of a RCT using an individually-tailored approach for postpartum Hispanic women. The study design and statistics are exceptional. This study is an important addition to the literature because it focuses on Hispanic, postpartum women at high risk for chronic disease and assess the use of a targeted intervention, which is more culturally appropriate and has the potential to advance the field of PA. I applaud these authors for this work and hope to review more studies like this in the future.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Important note: This review pertains only to ‘statistical aspects’ of the study and so ‘clinical aspects’ [like medical importance, relevance of the study, ‘clinical significance and implication(s)’ of the whole study, etc.] are to be evaluated [should be assessed] separately/independently. This study is excellently planned &amp; executed/conducted and manuscript is nicely drafted (no doubt about that). However, there are few suggestions [may please be considered as they may need to be clarified/told clearly at appropriate places in the text]</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and address their suggestions below.</p>
              <p>1. In ‘Materials and methods - Study Design’ section it is said that “Randomization was stratified by the results of the diagnostic 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)” but ‘what exactly is done’ is neither clear in further text nor from Figure 1 [Flow chart of participant recruitment and retention; Estudio PARTO 2013-2016]. It appears to be simple random allocation (may be by using permuted randomized blocks to ensure nearly same size in groups). </p>
              <p>We have revised the Study Design section (page 6, paragraph 1) to now clarify that randomization was stratified by the results of the diagnostic 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using thresholds defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA): 1) no glucose values meeting or exceeding the ADA thresholds; or 2) one or more glucose values meeting or exceeding the ADA thresholds) [24]. </p>
              <p>2. This study has taken data (it is a secondary data analysis then – please clarify) from some other trial {Estudio PARTO was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Western Massachusetts from 2013-17} for which the data were collected till 2017 then (my question is) ‘why this delay?’</p>
              <p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. We have revised the Study Design section (page 5, paragraph 2) to now clarify that this is a primary data analysis. In other words, one of the primary aims of Estudio PARTO was to evaluate the impact of the intervention on PA and self-efficacy. The reviewer is correct that data was collected on active participants until the end of 2017. We then received a no-cost extension from NIH to allow us additional time to conduct data analysis and interpretation. This, combined with the availability of the coauthors, led to our finalizing the manuscript at the end of 2019 and submitting it in early 2020. </p>
              <p>3. Statistical comparison of baseline characteristics [last ‘p-value’ column in Table 1 (Distribution of Covariates according to Intervention Group; Estudio PARTO 2013-2016)] is not desirable at all [because even if P-value turns out to be significant (while comparing baseline characteristics despite random allocation), it is, by definition, a false positive] as you are supposed to be testing ‘randomization’ then, which in any single trial may not balance all baseline characteristics as ‘randomization’ is a sort of ‘insurance’ and not a guarantee scheme.</p>
              <p>(Reference: Harrington D, D’Agostino RB, Gatsonis C, Hogan JW, Hunter DJ, Normand ST, et al. New guidelines for statistical reporting in the journal. N Engl J Med 2019;381:285-6) </p>
              <p>The reviewer makes an excellent point and we have revised Table 1 to no longer include the p-value column. </p>
              <p>4. It is known that ANCOVA has more ‘power’ than ‘change scores’ analyses [Reference: ‘The use of percentage change from baseline as an outcome in a controlled trial is statistically inefficient – a simulation study’ by Andrew Vickers in BMC Medical Research Methodology 2001, 1:6] displayed in table-3, however, it was necessary to use non-parametric tests [like Wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous variables, &amp; McNemar test for categorical variables] on data yielded by tools [like Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) and the Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Questionnaire]. Moreover, ANCOVA involves few assumptions which are many times not fulfilled (&amp; are unlikely be fulfilled in this case).</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer regarding their approval of our change scores analysis and our use of non-parametric tests. </p>
              <p>5. Agreed that final analyses included Lifestyle Intervention (N=71) &amp; Health &amp; Wellness Intervention (N=79) but baseline data in table-1 should have all who were randomized to start with [were randomized to a Lifestyle Intervention (LI, n=100) or to a comparison Health and Wellness (HW, n=104) group]. Is not that so? ‘Covariate assessment’ section states that “Demographic and behavioral characteristics were collected at baseline via standardized questionnaires”. ‘Statistical analyses’ section states that “We used an intent-to-treat analysis to evaluate the impact of the LI on the adoption and maintenance of increased PA and self-efficacy as compared to the HW group”.</p>
              <p>We have revised Table 1 to now include all the participants who were randomized to start with (LI, n=100) and (HW, n=104) as per the reviewer’s suggestion.</p>
              <p>6. Otherwise everything else [including Using Mixed Models] is faultless. Except above minor ‘revision’ points, I recommend the publication of this article in our journal.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Summary:</p>

              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Since the comments made on earlier draft by me (and hopefully by other respected reviewers also) are attended positively/adequately, I am satisfied and, in my opinion, the manuscript is improved a lot. I recommend acceptance, without any hesitation, as now it has achieved acceptable level of our journal, in my opinion.</p>
