                <p id="P1">Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their development has been linked to CD28 costimulation. We tested whether Tfh were decreased by costimulation blockade using the CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (Abatacept) in a mouse model of diabetes and in individuals with new onset T1D. Unbiased bioinformatic analysis identified that ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh, and other ICOS<sup>+</sup> populations including T-peripheral helper cells, were highly sensitive to costimulation blockade. We were able to use pre-treatment Tfh profiles to derive a model that could predict clinical response to Abatacept in individuals with T1D. Using two independent approaches we demonstrated that higher frequencies of ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh at baseline were associated with a poor clinical response following Abatacept administration. Tfh analysis may therefore represent a new stratification tool, permitting the identification of individuals most likely to benefit from costimulation blockade.</p>

          <body>
            <p id="P2">CD28 costimulation licenses T cells for effective activation and is a key therapeutic target in autoimmunity. The natural regulator of CD28 is the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, and a soluble version of this molecule has been developed for therapeutic use. Soluble CTLA-4 (a fusion protein with human immunoglobulin; CTLA-4-Ig) is widely used in autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Studies in the NOD mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) suggested a protective effect of CTLA-4-Ig in this disease setting<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> leading to a trial of the clinically licensed CTLA-4-Ig molecule Abatacept (Orencia<sup>®</sup>; Bristol-Myers Squibb) in individuals with new onset T1D. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that adjusted C-peptide levels were 59% higher in recipients of Abatacept at 2 years compared with placebo<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and the beneficial effects were largely maintained a year following therapy cessation<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, although it was clear that some individuals benefited more than others. Thus, CTLA-4-Ig-based costimulation blockade in both mice and humans implicates the CD28 pathway in T1D pathogenesis, however the precise CD28-dependent processes involved remain ill-defined. Identifying and monitoring these could potentially help explain, and even predict, why certain individuals make a better response to costimulation blockade than others.</p>
            <p id="P3">Although T1D has classically been considered to be a T<sub>H</sub>1-mediated pathology, a signature of follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation was identified in this disease setting<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Tfh support B cell responses within the germinal centers (GC) of secondary lymphoid tissues and are characterised by markers such as CXCR5, ICOS and PD-1 as well as the transcription factor Bcl6<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Memory Tfh in the blood share T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes with their lymphoid tissue counterparts<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and can home to GC in response to secondary immunisation<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Murine T cells responding to a pancreatic self-antigen adopted a Tfh phenotype and GC were formed in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PanLN) of mice developing diabetes<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Likewise, in humans with T1D a higher proportion of blood-borne Tfh were observed within the memory compartment than in matched non-diabetic individuals<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and similar data were obtained in two independent T1D patient cohorts<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies showed that circulating cells with a Tfh phenotype were increased in children with multiple islet autoantibodies at risk of developing T1D<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Thus, circulating Tfh-like cells have been associated with T1D in multiple patient cohorts, and increases in these cells may precede the development of overt disease.</p>
            <p id="P4">CD28 has long been implicated in the development of Tfh and the provision of T cell help for antibody responses. Mice deficient in the CD28 ligands, CD80 and CD86, fail to form GC<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, associated with an inability of their T cells to upregulate the chemokine receptor CXCR5 that guides T cells towards B cell follicles<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. More recently, it was reported that Tfh differentiation was sensitive to the strength of CD28 engagement, and that this could be modulated by CTLA-4<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. A clear prediction of these studies is that use of CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept) to inhibit CD28 costimulation would be expected to decrease Tfh differentiation, and there are already suggestions that this may be the case in primary Sjogren’s syndrome<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and multiple sclerosis<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We were therefore interested to assess the impact of Abatacept on Tfh populations in T1D.</p>
            <p id="P5">Here we show that Tfh are a sensitive biomarker of costimulation blockade in both mice and humans with T1D and reveal that pre-treatment Tfh profiles can be used to predict response to Abatacept. These data ascribe new value to Tfh analysis and suggest its potential as a stratification tool prior to immunotherapy.</p>

                <title>Abatacept decreases immunisation-induced Tfh in mice</title>
                <p id="P6">Costimulation blockade using antibodies against CD80 and CD86 decreased the capacity of adoptively transferred TCR transgenic T cells to differentiate into Tfh following immunisation<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. We predicted that costimulation blockade with Abatacept would yield similar results, since this reagent binds to CD80 and CD86 in a manner that inhibits their engagement of CD28. We sought to confirm this, and concurrently to probe the kinetic requirements for effective Tfh inhibition, by providing Abatacept at different timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We reasoned that the timing of costimulation blockade was an important consideration given that in autoimmune settings, treatment is likely to be delivered when the T cell response is already underway. Initiation of Abatacept treatment one day prior to immunisation (d-1) with ovalbumin (OVA) resulted in DO11.10 T cells exhibiting a significantly lower frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>) and absolute number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) of Tfh than in Control-Ig treated animals. This was associated with inhibition of GC B cell formation as well as a decrease in expression of molecules involved in T cell / B cell collaboration such as CD40L and ICOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>). Delaying costimulation blockade until 2 days after immunisation partially reduced its capacity to inhibit Tfh, and delaying it until day 4 abrogated the effects on Tfh and GC B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, costimulation blockade with Abatacept reduced Tfh, but delaying its administration rendered it less effective.</p>

                <title>Abatacept decreases Tfh in a mouse model of diabetes</title>
                <p id="P7">The inability of Abatacept to inhibit Tfh when delivered 4 days after immunisation raised the possibility that T cells already engaged in a response to autoantigen may be resistant to the Tfh modulating effects of this drug. To explore this idea, we examined the same TCR transgenic T cells responding to a pancreas-expressed, rather than immunised, protein. Mice that express the DO11.10 TCR transgene in conjunction with its cognate antigen in pancreatic beta cells (DO11.10 x RIP-mOVA mice) develop spontaneous islet autoimmunity and diabetes with 100% penetrance<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In these mice, islet-expressed OVA is presented to T cells in the PanLN<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and this is associated with T cell differentiation to a Tfh phenotype<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. All mice manifest autoimmune islet infiltration by 5 weeks of age and we have established that CD28 costimulation is required for diabetes development (data not shown). To assess the impact of costimulation blockade on Tfh cells in the setting of an ongoing immune response to pancreatic autoantigen, we administered a short course of Abatacept to DO11.10 x RIP-mOVA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The results of this experiment revealed a decrease in Tfh at the site of antigen presentation (PanLN) as well as the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Thus, even though T cell priming and Tfh differentiation were already underway prior to treatment, Abatacept was able to suppress the Tfh response.</p>

                <p id="P8">To assess whether Abatacept decreased circulating Tfh in humans with T1D, we obtained access to frozen samples from individuals with new onset T1D treated with Abatacept or placebo <italic>via</italic> Trialnet Study TN09 (NCT00505375). We were provided with samples from 36 Abatacept-treated individuals and 14 placebo-treated individuals, with 3 samples typically being available for each individual: baseline, and 1 and 2 years post treatment. Associated clinical data revealed a relative preservation of C-peptide in Abatacept-treated individuals compared with placebo-treated individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), in line with the original trial results from the entire cohort<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Samples were stained with a panel of T cell markers including ones associated with a Tfh phenotype (for gating strategy see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Since we previously showed that circulating CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells (Tfh) were overrepresented in humans with T1D<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, we first examined whether this population was Abatacept-sensitive. Our analysis revealed that Tfh were significantly decreased after Abatacept treatment at both 1 and 2 year timepoints, whereas this was not the case in the placebo-treated control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Principal component analysis of gated flow cytometry data revealed that the highest proportion of variance in this dataset is explained by Abatacept-induced changes, since treated samples are separated from untreated samples along PC1 for Abatacept treatment but not placebo treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The major cell population contributing to this separation was T cells expressing CXCR5 and ICOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). CCR7<sup>lo</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells, previously identified as circulating Tfh precursors that correlate with disease activity in autoimmunity<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, also contributed to PC1 and were decreased by Abatacept treatment (here called CCR7<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Graphed datapoints for the ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh and CCR7<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh populations are provided for illustrative purposes, and depict the Abatacept-induced change in cell frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). To study the impact on Tfh subsets, additional trial samples were analysed with a panel incorporating the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The Abatacept-induced reduction of Tfh, and particularly ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup>Tfh, was corroborated, however there was no obvious skewing of the Tfh subpopulations defined by CXCR3 and/or CCR6 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Overall, these findings demonstrated that cells expressing Tfh markers were amongst the populations most affected by costimulation blockade.</p>

                <title>Additional Abatacept-sensitive populations in type 1 diabetes revealed by CellCnn</title>
                <p id="P9">Given the bias associated with manual gating, we tested whether unbiased analysis would also identify a change in Tfh-like cells following Abatacept treatment. We used the machine-learning algorithm CellCnn<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, a representation learning approach using convolutional neural networks designed to identify rare cell subsets associated with disease status in a data-driven way. When samples are split into 2 groups (e.g. Abatacept versus placebo), this approach is able to establish marker expression profiles (termed filters) of individual cells whose frequency is associated with the assigned group. In our analysis, CellCnn identified a filter whose corresponding cells were present at high frequencies in all samples at baseline and in placebo treated samples, but were significantly reduced in Abatacept-treated samples after two years of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that this particular filter was associated with Abatacept-induced changes. Since filters detected by CellCnn do not necessarily represent a homogenous cell population, k-means clustering was applied to identify individual cell types affected by Abatacept treatment. In total, 6 clusters were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) that showed distinct expression profiles of the selected markers. By overlaying these cell clusters on flow cytometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) we ascribed names to them that we believe reflect their identity, and assessed the change in the frequency of these populations in Abatacept or placebo treated individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Consistent with our original manual gating approach, CellCnn identified both ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh (cluster 1) and ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> Tfh (cluster 2) to be decreased by Abatacept. A third cluster, comprising memory cells that lack CXCR5 but co-express ICOS and PD-1 (cluster 3), was also identified as Abatacept responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This phenotype is reminiscent of T-peripheral helper cells (Tph) that were identified in the rheumatoid joint and are increased in individuals with higher disease activity<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Manual gating of Tph confirmed a significant reduction in this population in people receiving Abatacept but not placebo at both year 1 and year 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). CellCnn also identified Treg (cluster 4) to be Abatacept-sensitive, consistent with published literature<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, in addition to two other clusters characterised by ICOS expression (ICOS<sup>+</sup> memory; cluster 5, ICOS<sup>+</sup> naive; cluster 6). Note that the term “naive” is used as shorthand to reflect the fact that the cells in cluster 6 are CD45RA<sup>+</sup>, however their CD45RA expression level is slightly lower than bona fide naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, cluster 6), suggesting they are antigen experienced. Thus machine-learning identified 2 Tfh populations and 4 additional populations to be Abatacept-sensitive, all of which expressed ICOS.</p>
                <p id="P10">Since Tph have not previously been reported to be costimulation dependent, and ICOS<sup>+</sup> naive cells have not previously been described, we explored these populations further in our mouse model of diabetes. Cells with a “Tph” or “ICOS<sup>+</sup> naive” phenotype could be identified in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,d</xref>), were enriched in autoimmune animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,e</xref>), and were reduced following Abatacept treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,f</xref>). These murine data provide additional support for the costimulation sensitivity of these 2 populations.</p>
                <p id="P11">To further explore the identity of the “Tph” population identified by CellCnn, additional trial samples were analysed. “Tph” cells were also decreased by Abatacept in this set of samples, and their expression of markers such as CCR5, CCR2, HLA-DR and CD38 was similar to that of Tph identified by standard gating (CXCR5<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a-c</xref>). Applying CellCnn to these data identified a cluster of cells expressing Tph markers to be costimulation-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Overall, machine learning approaches indicated that populations with the characteristics of Tfh and Tph, as well as additional ICOS<sup>+</sup> populations, were strongly reduced after Abatacept treatment.</p>

                <title>Baseline Tfh phenotype is associated with clinical response to Abatacept</title>
                <p id="P12">We next explored whether an individual’s clinical response following Abatacept treatment could be predicted from their T cell phenotype at baseline. Clinical response was assessed by relative C-peptide retention at the 2-year timepoint. Gated flow cytometry data were used, with a Tph gate and an ICOS<sup>+</sup> naive gate being added on the basis of their identification in the above analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Age at diagnosis was also included since there is evidence that diagnosis at a young age is associated with a more rapid loss of beta cells<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Within the Abatacept-treated subjects, the 10 with the best clinical response (responders) and the 10 with the poorest response (non-responders) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>) were used to build a predictive model using gradient boosting<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Pairwise correlation comparisons were conducted between features to identify and remove features that were highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.95), ensuring feature importance could be legitimately interpreted from our gradient boosting model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>): where two features were shown to be highly correlated, the one least correlated with outcome was removed from the set of features used to build the predictive model. The gradient boosting model was constructed using nested leave-one-out cross validation. Each of the <italic>n</italic> patients was iteratively removed from the dataset and kept aside for testing purposes. The remaining <italic>n-1</italic> baseline samples were used for model training and hyperparameter (learning rate, maximum depth and number of estimators) tuning using 3-fold cross validation. The optimal model from this training process was then used to make a prediction on the “left-out” sample, and feature weights were recorded.</p>
                <p id="P13">We were able to predict response to Abatacept with 85% accuracy and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The two features that emerged as being most important in predicting C-peptide retention following Abatacept treatment were ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>ICOS<sup>+</sup>) and CXCR5<sup>+</sup> naive cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Again, the term “naive” is used as shorthand for CD45RA<sup>+</sup>, however cells in this gate have lower expression of CD45RA than naive T cells (see “CXCR5<sup>+</sup> naive” quadrant in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> Tfh also contribute to predictive power in this model, with opposing directionality to ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). The CCR7<sup>lo</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells shown previously<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> to correlate with an active Tfh program were also identified in the model (CCR7<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Grouped time-series plots illustrate the dynamic change in the frequencies of these cell populations over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>) illustrating that responder and non-responder populations are broadly non-overlapping both before and during Abatacept treatment. Note that only baseline data were used to generate the model, avoiding the caveat that Abatacept treatment directly alters the frequencies of some of these populations.</p>
                <p id="P14">As an independent approach, we were interested in whether data-driven analysis would detect similar cell subsets at baseline that differed between individuals who went on to make good or poor clinical responses following Abatacept therapy. Using CellCnn we were able to identify two filters, one of which shows higher frequencies of corresponding cells in samples from the 10 individuals exhibiting the poorest clinical response, while the other exhibits an inverse relationship, leading us to label these filters as “Non-Responder” and “Responder”, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). In the non-responder filter, k-means clustering revealed 3 statistically significant T cell clusters; ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup>Tfh, ICOS<sup>int</sup>PD-1<sup>lo</sup>Tfh and ICOS<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>lo</sup>CXCR5<sup>−</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). The first 2 of these provide independent support for the predictive power of the ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh population identified in our gradient boosting model. Indeed, cells identified by CellCnn in those clusters overlaid the manual gates used for the predictive model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Tfh partially encompasses the CCR7<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh population also identified by the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Conversely, the clusters identified in the filter found for responder patients were dominated by ICOS<sup>−</sup> cell populations, including ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> Tfh, ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> memory cells, ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> memory cells and naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 6c,d, Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P15">The difference in ICOS expression between patients that go on to be Abatacept responders <italic>versus</italic> non-responders is clear from a combined analysis of all cells contributing to clusters identified in both filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref>). Although overall PD-1 expression also differed between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref>), its relationship with clinical response is more complex since certain PD-1<sup>+</sup> populations are associated with a good response (e.g. ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> memory) and others with a poor response (e.g. ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh). Notably, both ICOS and PD-1 can influence Tfh migration and function<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Analysis of Abatacept-treated mice showed that an analogous staining panel could be used to build a predictive model of clinical response with 84% accuracy and an AUC of 0.83 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>). CellCnn identified filters that were enriched in mice that went on to be responders or non-responders, with ICOS being expressed at higher levels in the cells within the non-responder clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 8c,d,e</xref>). Overall, both the predictive model and the CellCnn algorithm suggested that analysis of Tfh markers in baseline blood samples could predict clinical response following Abatacept immunotherapy.</p>

              <p id="P16">Heterogeneity in the response to costimulation inhibitors like Abatacept limits their utility as first line therapies, and therefore the ability to predict response to these reagents would have significant impact on how they are deployed. However, a fine-grained understanding of CD28-sensitive immune subsets, and their link to pathogenicity, has been lacking.</p>
              <p id="P17">We show here that in both mice and humans experiencing ongoing autoimmune responses, costimulation blockade reduced Tfh frequencies, with principal component analysis identifying the loss of CXCR5<sup>+</sup>ICOS<sup>+</sup> T cells as the biggest contributor to Abatacept-induced change. Since the majority of CXCR5<sup>+</sup> T cells are central memory cells<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, it is plausible that the Abatacept-induced decrease in central memory T cells previously reported<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reflects the loss of Tfh.</p>
              <p id="P18">Importantly, we identified several new Abatacept-sensitive populations, including a population resembling Tph cells, thought to provide T cell help to B cells in the rheumatoid synovium<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Emerging data suggest these cells are expanded in children with islet autoantibodies who go on to develop diabetes<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and are associated with disease activity in SLE<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and RA<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, suggesting insights into their drug sensitivity could have broad applicability. Furthermore, we found that cells resembling circulating Tfh precursors<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> also exhibit Abatacept sensitivity, as do a population of T cells expressing CD45RA and intermediate levels of ICOS. These could comprise recently activated T cells that have not yet lost CD45RA, or alternatively revertants that have lost, then re-expressed, this marker. Such revertants were first described in rodent models<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, where it was shown that they retained the capacity to provide B cell help<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. ICOS<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells may therefore warrant further investigation in T-cell dependent autoimmune diseases featuring autoantibody production.</p>
              <p id="P19">Tfh that remain post-Abatacept treatment exhibit an altered phenotype with a decrease in the frequency of Tfh expressing ICOS, PD-1 or both, and a reciprocal increase in Tfh expressing neither marker. The impact on ICOS expression appears dominant; accordingly, changes in ICOS<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> Tfh were a clear contributor to the Abatacept-induced variation in principal component analysis, while changes in ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh were not. The ability of CD28 signaling to promote ICOS expression is consistent with the original identification of ICOS as an “Inducible Costimulator”, responsive to CD28 engagement<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Our new data suggest a continuous requirement for CD28 signalling to sustain ICOS expression, implying that this hierarchy is perpetuated even after T cell activation. Consistent with this, RNAseq analysis identified <italic>Icos</italic> to be highly CD28-sensitive in human memory T cells<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P20">ICOS signalling is critical for maintaining Tfh characteristics, with loss of ICOS permitting upregulation of Klf2 and a reversion of Tfh phenotype<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that while CD28 blockade primarily inhibits early Tfh differentiation, prolonged CD28 blockade may effectively inhibit ICOS signalling, by ensuring that remaining Tfh are ICOS-negative. Since ICOS is required for Tfh maintenance, this may explain why CD28 blockade remains capable of decreasing Tfh during an ongoing autoimmune response. Alternatively, the ability of CD28 blockade to inhibit differentiation of new Tfh would lead to a decrease over time if turnover of Tfh was high.</p>
              <p id="P21">Using gradient boosting, an ensemble machine learning method, on gated flow cytometry outputs from pre-treatment samples, we were able to build a predictive model of Abatacept sensitivity that could assign the clinical response at year 2 with 85% accuracy. There are two caveats to this model; first, it is built on data from a relatively small number of patients and second, it intentionally focuses on the best and worst responders. Thus, while it may work with high accuracy in these patient groups, it may be less effective in individuals showing a borderline response. Notwithstanding these caveats, the model highlights several T cell populations whose collective frequencies appear to inform the clinical response to Abatacept. Chief among these is the ICOS<sup>+</sup>Tfh population, for which higher frequencies are associated with a poor clinical response. Reciprocally, ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> Tfh contribute to the model, with a higher frequency being associated with a better clinical response following Abatacept treatment.</p>
              <p id="P22">Since Abatacept has only been trialled once in new onset T1D, we were unable to apply our predictive model to an independent dataset. We therefore sought an alternative means of validation. Using CellCnn we obtained independent corroboration for key aspects of our model. Notably this approach confirmed that a poor clinical response was associated with higher frequencies of ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh at baseline, while a good response was associated with higher frequencies of ICOS<sup>−</sup>PD-1<sup>−</sup> Tfh. In addition, this analysis also revealed an effect of ICOS expression on CXCR5-negative cells. Thus, ICOS appears to be the most discerning cellular marker associated with preservation of beta-cell function following Abatacept treatment as assessed by two independent approaches, with data from a mouse model providing additional support.</p>
              <p id="P23">Robust predictive markers of responsiveness to Abatacept are currently lacking, although there are suggestions that individuals with greater inflammatory activity exhibit a better clinical response<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. A recent study using whole blood RNASeq detected changes in expression of B cell genes that were associated with clinical response in subjects with T1D treated with Abatacept<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, however these were not apparent until 84 days post treatment initiation. Since interventions that target Tfh inevitably alter B cell phenotype, it is tempting to speculate that such changes could be secondary to the altered T cell phenotypes observed here.</p>
              <p id="P24">Our report is the first to suggest that baseline Tfh phenotypes have the potential to predict clinical response to an immunotherapy. It will be important to confirm these findings in a separate cohort of patients and to explore their wider applicability. For example, it remains to be established whether the T cell phenotypes we have identified can predict the response to Abatacept in other clinical settings, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or whether they are specific to T1D. Similarly, it will be important to ascertain whether these populations predict clinical response to other immunotherapies targeting costimulatory pathways or T cell / B cell collaboration. Broader implications aside, the incorporation of Tfh analysis could alter the landscape for the rational use of Abatacept and novel versions of this molecule with improved affinity, stability and pharmacokinetics that are emerging.</p>

<sup>−/−</sup> mice from Taconic Laboratories. BALB/c RIP-mOVA mice (expressing the ovalbumin transgene under control of the rat insulin promoter, from line 296-1B) were a gift from W. Heath (Doherty Institute, Melbourne, Australia). DO11.10 mice were crossed with RIP-mOVA mice to generate DO11.10 x RIP-mOVA mice. Mice were housed according to Home Office guidelines in individually vented cages with environmental enrichment (e.g. cardboard tunnels, paper houses, chewing blocks) in a temperature and humidity-controlled facility with a 14 h light–10h dark cycle and ad libitum feeding at University College London Biological Services Unit. Experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant Home Office project and personal licenses following approval from the University College London Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body.</p>

<sup>−/−</sup> recipients. 24h later, recipients were immunised i.p. with 200 μg of OVA/alum (Sigma). Where indicated mice were injected i.p. with 500 μg Abatacept (Royal Free Hospital Pharmacy) or control antibody (human IgG1, BioXCell) at the same time as adoptive transfer (d-1). Subsequently, mice received 250 μg Abatacept or control antibody every 2-3 days over the course of the experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). For experiments using DO11.10 x RIP-mOVA mice, 6-13 week old animals were injected i.p. with 500 μg Abatacept or control antibody. Mice were subsequently treated with 250 μg Abatacept or control antibody every 2-3 days over a period of 11 days. For experiments in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S8</xref>, DO11.10 x RIP-mOVA mice with a blood glucose reading between 180 and 290 mg/dL were injected i.p. with Abatacept, 500 μg for the initial dose then 250 μg three times weekly, for four weeks and blood glucose was monitored. Mouse spleen and lymph nodes were mashed to create single cell suspensions and 2-10 x 10<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> cells were used for flow cytometry staining. All injections were carried out in the absence of anesthesia and analgesia, and mice were returned immediately to home cages following the procedure. The welfare of experimental animals was monitored regularly (typically immediately post procedure, then at least every 2–3 days). No unexpected adverse events were noted during the course of these experiments.</p>

                <p id="P32">Statistical analysis was performed using R v3.5.1 and Python v3.7. Two-sided Mann–Whitney U was used for comparison of two unpaired means. For comparison of paired means two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. Comparison of more than two means was performed using two-sided ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction. Equality of histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S8e</xref> was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normality was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variance was tested using Levene’s test. All measurements were taken from distinct samples. For boxplots, the black horizontal line indicates the median, the boxes represent interquartile range (IQR, Q1-Q3 percentile) and whiskers show minimum (first quartile - 1.5 * IQR) and maximum (third quartile <sup>+</sup> 1.5 * IQR). Principal component analysis was performed on scaled and centered data. Plots were produced using either CRAN packages ggplot2, ggpubr, ggsignif, RColourBrewer and scales in R or matplotlib and seaborn in Python. All predictive modelling was conducted using Python v3.7. Data cleaning and formatting was carried out using either CRAN packages plyr, stringr and tidyr in R or pandas and numpy in Python. The gradient boosting algorithm was implemented using sklearn. Feature correlation was calculated using Pearson’s r to ensure that the model did not contain sets of highly correlated variables which can make predictions unstable and dilute feature importance effects. Feature pairs which were correlated with r&gt;=0.95 were determined, and only the most predictive feature of each pair was included in the gradient boosting model.</p>
