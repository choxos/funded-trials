                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p id="P3">Children orphaned by AIDS are more likely to have psychological and emotional problems compared to their counterparts. Poverty resulting from orphanhood is linked to the negative psychological outcomes experienced by AIDS-orphaned adolescents. No studies have investigated the impact of an economic empowerment intervention on child psychological and emotional problems and prosocial behavior. Therefore, we aimed to examine the impact of a family economic empowerment intervention on psychological difficulties and prosocial behavior among AIDS-orphaned adolescents.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p id="P4">We analyzed data from a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in 10 primary schools in southern Uganda. Schools were randomized to either bolstered usual care (n = 5 schools; 167 participants) or a family-economic empowerment intervention (Suubi-Maka; n = 5 schools; 179 individuals). We used <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test and multi-level mixed effects models to examine the impact of Suubi-Maka on psychological and behavioral outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="P5">No differences were observed between intervention and control groups in almost all the outcomes at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Simple main effects comparisons of 12 months versus baseline within each condition indicate modest to significant declines in emotional symptoms, hyperactivity, peer relationships (Δs = −1.00 to −2.11, all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001), and total difficulties (Δs = −4.85 to −4.89, both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001) across both groups.</p>

          <body>
            <p id="P7">Worldwide, 13.8 million children aged 0–17 years have lost one or both parents to the AIDS epidemic, with approximately 75% of these orphans residing in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Uganda is one of the countries worst affected by the epidemic, with one of the largest number of orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS, estimated at 880,000 in 2019 [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although AIDS-related deaths have declined significantly in recent years as a result of the wide availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], trends of AIDS-related deaths are not declining fast enough with 7.7 million people projected to die from AIDS-related causes between 2021 and 2030 [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This means AIDS-related orphanhood will remain a significant public health problem for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p id="P8">The loss of a parent due to any cause is a traumatic event with serious negative psychological impacts on the child that may carry over into adulthood [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, those orphaned by AIDS may be at a particularly high risk of adverse health outcomes. For instance, studies have documented that compared to both non-orphaned children and children orphaned by other causes, those orphaned by AIDS tend to have more severe psychological, emotional, and behavioral difficulties [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Specifically, previous studies have found that orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS, in general, have lower wellbeing scores [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and are more likely to have anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, delinquency, peer relationship difficulties, conduct and anger problems, and concentration difficulties compared to other children [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P9">Several factors may contribute to these psychological and emotional problems. For instance, children orphaned by HIV oftentimes take care of their parents during sickness [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], hence experiencing the trauma of HIV and AIDS even before the death of their parents [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In some cases, many orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS find themselves neglected, abused, or even exploited [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, children of HIV-positive parents or those orphaned by AIDS experience stigma by association, which can have lasting negative psychological consequences [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P10">Importantly, poverty that results from losing one or both parents is believed to be the mechanism that mediates AIDS-related orphanhood and negative psychological outcomes [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Following the death of their parent/parents, these children are cared for by relatives, often elderly grandparents who themselves may be widows living in poverty and in many cases they end up withdrawing from school due to lack of school fees [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, surveys across sub-Saharan Africa have found that caretakers of orphans often face major financial difficulties and can seldom cover educational expenses [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consequently, orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS often find themselves engaging in income-generating activities at a very young age to support themselves and or younger siblings [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Some may find themselves on the streets and engaging in activities that put them at a heightened risk of HIV infection (e.g., drug use or commercial sex work) [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P11">In this regard, interventions aimed at alleviating psychological and emotional problems among children orphaned by AIDS have to account for their economic situations. Asset theory, which posits that asset ownership has a positive effect on the psychological wellbeing of individuals by providing hope for a brighter future [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and empirical evidence from studies we have conducted in Uganda, suggest economic empowerment interventions can reduce poverty and improve the psychological wellbeing of AIDS-affected adolescents [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These interventions, therefore, hold great promise in ultimately addressing the mental health problems faced by orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS. Moreover, these interventions can simultaneously reduce the likelihood of risky sexual behavior, thereby preventing a vicious cycle of AIDS-related deaths [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The Suubi-Maka study was designed precisely to address this problem. Specifically, it promotes family-level income-generating projects (micro-enterprises) to enhance economic stability, reduce poverty, and enhance protective family processes for youth orphaned by AIDS.</p>
            <p id="P12">While numerous studies have compared emotional and behavioral outcomes between children orphaned by AIDS, those orphaned by other causes, and nonorphans at a cross-sectional level, no randomized controlled trials have assessed the impact of economic empowerment interventions on these outcomes longitudinally. In this study, we aimed to examine the short-term (12 months) and long-term (24 months) effect of the Suubi-Maka intervention on child psychological and emotional outcomes measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Specifically, we considered the effect of the intervention on: (1) conduct problems; (2) emotional symptoms; (3) peer relationships; (4) hyperactivity/inattention; (5) prosocial behavior; and (6) total difficulties score. We hypothesized that children enrolled in the intervention arm would have improved psychological and emotional outcomes compared to children in the bolstered usual care arm by the end of the intervention at 12 and 24 months. The use of SDQ longitudinally across different age groups is supported by previous studies that have found invariance in the SDQ scores across 7–16 years of age, which includes the age range of participants in our study [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="P13">We analyzed data from the Suubi-Maka intervention funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), award Number R34MH 081763–02 (PI, Fred Ssewamala). Suubi-Maka is a Luganda phrase meaning <italic toggle="yes">hope for families</italic>. This was a cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to develop and examine the impact of a family-based economic empowerment intervention on children’s educational opportunities, psychosocial development, sexual risk-taking, and mental health. The study was conducted from 2008 to 2012.</p>
              <sec id="S6">
                <title>The study intervention: Suubi-Maka</title>
                <p id="P14">The Suubi-Maka intervention has been previously described in great detail [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, the Suubi-Maka intervention was a cluster-randomized control trial consisting of bolstered usual care and the Suubi-Maka conditions. Bolstered usual care condition consisted of counseling and mentorship, school lunches, and school supplies such as textbooks, notebooks, and school uniforms. The Suubi-Maka treatment condition, above and beyond the bolstered usual care, consisted of a family-level economic strengthening intervention [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The intervention has three key components: (1) it promotes family-level income-generating projects (micro-enterprises) believed to enhance economic stability, reduce poverty, and enhance protective family processes for youth orphaned by AIDS; (2) it promotes monetary savings for educational opportunities for AIDS-orphaned children; and (3) it provides an adult mentor to children. Participants in the Suubi-Maka treatment condition were given a chance to open a matched child savings account in their name at a recognized and registered local financial institution and the intervention program then matched up to an equivalent of $10 per month per family during the intervention period. Family members, relatives, or friends were also encouraged to contribute toward the child savings account.</p>

                <p id="P15">Participants enrolled in the study were children 12–16 years of age orphaned by AIDS, in the last two years of their primary school studies, and attending school in 10 different public primary schools participating in the government-supported Universal Primary Education (UPE) program in Rakai and Masaka Districts in southern Uganda. This is a community heavily affected by HIV/AIDS [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. AIDS-orphan is defined as a child who has lost either one parent (single orphan) or both parents (double orphan) to the AIDS epidemic.</p>
                <p id="P16">Children participated in the study along with their primary caregivers. Participants were cluster-randomized to either a bolstered usual care (i.e., control; n = 5 schools,167 children) or the treatment arm (n = 5 schools, 179 children). To avoid potential contamination resulting from sharing of information by students, randomization was conducted at the school level so that all students within a particular school received the same intervention.</p>

                <p id="P17">This study used data collected during all three waves (wave 1 = baseline; wave 2 = 12 months; and wave 3 = 24 months) of the 4-year study (2008–2012). All data were collected using instruments that were translated into the widely spoken language in the area (Luganda) and back translated to English to ensure accuracy. In-person interviews that lasted 90 minutes were administered to each child and their primary caregiver separately by trained local research assistants either in English or Luganda.</p>

                <title>Ethical considerations</title>
                <p id="P18">All participants in the study provided informed consent before being enrolled in the study and were each informed that participation in the study was voluntary. Specifically, both children and their caregivers provided a written informed consent and assent. If one of them refused to provide consent or assent, then the participant was not enrolled in the study. The study received approval from both Columbia University Institutional Review Board (IRB–AAAD 2525) and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS 1540) and the study protocol was registered in the Clinical Trials Database (ID# <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01180114" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01180114</ext-link>).</p>

                  <title>Dependent variables.</title>
                  <p id="P19">For our outcomes of interest, we used data provided by the parents/caregivers using the SDQ [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The SDQ is a screening tool used to measure child emotional and behavioral difficulties that has been validated internationally and used in previous studies in this setting [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This instrument consists of 25 items measured on a five-point Likert scale (1 = Never, 5 = Always). These items are divided into five subscales: four measuring child difficulties (i.e., conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relationships, and hyperactivity/inattention) and one measuring child strength (prosocial behavior). To generate scores for each subscale, we added scores for each item within the subscale. A total difficulties score was generated by adding the four difficulties subscales. In this case, the minimum possible score for an individual would be 5 and the maximum possible score would be 25. A decline in average scores in each of the difficulties subscales and the total difficulties score constitutes improvement in these outcomes. On the other hand, an increase in the average scores of prosocial behavior is indicative of the positive effect of the intervention.</p>

                  <p id="P20">The primary independent variable was enrollment into the Suubi-Maka intervention arm. We included the three time points (baseline, 12 months, and 24 months) as a three-level categorical variable.</p>

                  <title>Analytic approach.</title>
                  <p id="P21">We first conducted descriptive analysis to examine the sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample. We generated mean scores and proportions for the overall study sample. Then, we compared the different study characteristics between the treatment and control groups using independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We then compared the strengths and difficulties scores between the intervention and control groups for the five subscales and the total difficulties score of the strengths and difficulties scale at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months using <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test.</p>
                  <p id="P22">We also conducted within condition comparison of average score change for each subscale from baseline to wave 2 and wave 3. Specifically, we used multilevel mixed effects models to examine the short-term (12 months) and long-term (24 months) effects of Suubi-Maka intervention on psychological strengths and difficulties outcomes for the study participants. We ran six different regression models to examine the time by intervention interaction impact on the child’s strengths and difficulties scores. In these models, we included the study group assignment variable, that is, whether they were in the treatment or control group, a three-level time point variable (baseline, 12 months, and 24 months of follow-up), and their interaction terms. The multilevel model was essential to account for data clustering because individuals are nested within each school and observations are nested within each individual. Furthermore, a mixed effects model allows us to estimate changes in repeated measures of missing data, assuming data are missing at random. To account for clustering, random intercepts for school ID and unstructured residual variances and covariances for person ID were included [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The models were fit with robust standard errors (Hubert-White “sandwich” variance estimator) and were clustered by school ID for the composite scores of each outcome [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We used simple main effect comparison of time within each of the groups and groups within each of the levels of time to decompose and interpret a significant interaction of group-by-time. The significance of the group by time interaction indicates whether the change overtime meaningfully differs between groups. We report unstandardized regression coefficients (b) and 95% confidence intervals. All analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="P23">At enrollment, children participating in the study were on average 13 years old across the two study arms and there were more girls in the study overall (65%) compared to boys, with the majority of the caregivers also being female (79%) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In general, the study arms were balanced by sex, duration of stay with the current caregiver, household size, and physical health. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups by orphanhood status. Specifically, the proportion of double orphans was slightly higher among the control group. No differences were observed between the two groups; however, slight but notable differences were observed in the peer relationship scores between the treatment and control groups both at baseline and in wave 2. Although both groups recorded declines in peer relationship scores at wave 2, greater decline was observed among the control group than the intervention group, albeit this group started from a lower baseline score. These scores increased at wave 3, with the treatment group recording a larger increase, but the difference in these results did not reach statistical significance.</p>
              <p id="P24">Results of comparisons between the treatment and control groups on strengths and difficulties scores for the different subscales and the total difficulties scores are presented in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. No differences were observed between the intervention and control groups in almost all the primary outcomes at baseline, 12 months, or 24 months. However, slight but notable differences were observed in the peer relationship scores between the treatment and control groups both at baseline and in wave 2, with the control group having slightly lower scores than the intervention group at both baseline and at 12 months. No differences were observed at 24 months in this subscale.</p>
              <p id="P25">Simple main effect results are presented in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Simple main effects comparisons of 12 months versus baseline and 24 months versus baseline within each condition indicate modest to significant declines in emotional symptoms (Δs = −2.10 to −2.11, both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001), hyperactivity (Δs = −1.00 to −1.16, both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001), peer relationships (Δs = −1.24 to −1.34, both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001), and total difficulties (Δs = −4.85 to −4.89, both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001) across both groups.

Of note, only the Suubi-Maka intervention group recorded a significant decline in emotional symptoms (Δs = −0.99, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001) and total difficulties score (Δs = −1.77, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .014) at 24 months postintervention. <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents coefficients and relevant standard errors and 95% confidence intervals from the linear mixed models.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P26">In this study, we sought to examine the short-term and long-term impact of a family economic strengthening intervention, Suubi-Maka, on child emotional and behavioral outcomes using the SDQ. Specifically, based on the asset theory [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we tested the hypothesis that child conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relationships, hyperactivity, prosocial behavior, and total difficulties scores would be significantly improved among students receiving the Suubi-Maka intervention compared to those in the bolstered usual care control group.</p>
              <p id="P27">Our hypothesis that outcomes for the intervention group would be significantly better than the control group was not supported by the results. A possible explanation for the lack of support for our hypothesis in our results may be because participants in the control group received bolstered usual care, which included counseling and mentorship, school lunches, and school supplies such as textbooks, notebooks, and school uniforms. For example, all participants in the study received one mentorship meeting per month over 12 months [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As all the participants in this study are orphans from very poor communities, any assistance would be expected to have a meaningful impact. It is, therefore, possible that these participants may have derived sufficient benefits from the bolstered usual care that equally improved their emotional and behavioral outcomes as those receiving the economic empowerment intervention. Several previous interventions including psychological/behavioral, cognitive, and community-based interventions that have similar components to those received by the bolstered usual care control group, such as counseling and school supplies, have been found to have a beneficial impact on cognitive, psychosocial, and risk-taking behavior outcomes [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, the fact that the control group showed improvements should not be surprising. Moreover, based on data from the Suubi and Bridges studies, Ssewamala et al. found that mentorship plays a positive role among orphans and children made vulnerable by AIDS [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which supports the idea that children in the bolstered usual care group may have benefited from the mentorship program they received. In addition, as we have reported in previous studies, although families in the intervention group reported increased savings, we found that only 66% in the treatment group had opened a Child Savings Account (CSA) and deposited money, 7.8% opened CSA but never deposited any money, another 7.8% opened but never activated the CSA, while 18% did not open any account at all [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; therefore, all participants may not have derived the intended benefits from the intervention.</p>
              <p id="P28">That said, our results found modest to significant short-term (12 months) improvements in child emotional symptoms, hyperactivity, peer relationships, and overall difficulties scores across the two groups. More important, although both groups recorded modest declines in conduct problems at 24 months, only the Suubi-Maka intervention group had significant declines in emotional and total difficulties scores. This suggests that there may have been some residual impact on emotional symptoms and overall difficulties among those who received the intervention above and beyond the bolstered usual care that includes counseling, mentorship, and other support. On this specific score, that is, just looking at the within-group improvements in outcomes, our results are consistent with previous findings from this trial and other studies that a family-level economic strengthening program may be an important component of a comprehensive approach for addressing emotional and behavioral difficulties of orphans and other vulnerable children affected by AIDS [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P29">Our study findings should be interpreted in the context of some limitations. First, these results are based on self-report, which is prone to information bias. This may be particularly true as this information is based on reports from caregivers. Second, many studies investigating the impact of interventions have a very broad definition for psychological outcomes measured and often use different measures for assessing these outcomes, which preclude useful direct comparisons. This, however, is a limitation of research broadly and not specific to our study. Third, this study was conducted in a rural area among school-going orphans being cared for by adults. Therefore, these results may not be generalizable to orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS in urban centers, many of whom often do not have adults caring for them. Finally, this intervention had three components that were delivered in tandem. We have not teased out the participation level in each of the three components and it is not possible to discern which component(s) play(s) the most crucial role in improving participants’ psychological and emotional health. This is particularly crucial in light of our finding that participants in the intervention group who received the family-level economic strengthening component, above and beyond the bolstered usual care, did not appear to have benefited substantially from this additional component with regard to many of the outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that this particular intervention was found to improve mental health functioning [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], among the intervention group compared to the bolstered usual care control group; thus, our findings warrant further investigation in the context of the larger study.</p>

                <title>Implications</title>
                <p id="P30">Poverty that results from losing one or both parents—leading to a lack of even basic needs such as school supplies—is believed to be the mechanism that mediates AIDS-related orphanhood and negative psychological outcomes [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results suggest that programs that support the provision of even the most basic needs, particularly education materials such as notebooks and uniforms have the potential to improve the emotional and behavioral outcomes of orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS. Therefore, although our hypothesis was not confirmed, our findings have important public health implications, especially in the context of resource-limited settings. Specifically, in resource-limited settings where economic empowerment interventions above and beyond the usual care program may not always be feasible or sustainable, it is important to note that even those who received only the bolstered usual care showed improvements. Accordingly, in the context of low-resource settings that bear 81% of the burden of global mental health crisis with only 10% of mental health needs being met [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], these findings point to the crucial role of interventions that provide necessities such as school supplies can play in bridging the gap of the unmet mental health needs in these settings. In addition, while several cross-sectional studies have been conducted comparing emotional and behavioral outcomes between children orphaned by AIDS, those orphaned by other causes, and nonorphans using the SDQ [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that longitudinally explored the effects of an economic empowerment intervention on childhood strengths and difficulties. Therefore, our findings add important value to the scientific literature and may guide future research. In addition, the lack of significant findings between the two groups also points to the need to explore contextualized psychosocial interventions that address the behavioral needs of orphaned children in low-resource settings.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p id="P31">Our analysis found no meaningful difference between the intervention and control groups in child psychological difficulties and prosocial behavior postintervention. However, our analysis points to an improvement in these outcomes across both control and treatment groups immediately following the intervention and there appear to be more long-term improvements within the treatment group from baseline. These findings warrant further investigation in future studies to explore the relative effects of each of the three components of the Suubi-Maka intervention (e.g., family-level income-generating activities; monetary savings for educational opportunities; and mentorship and counseling program) on the mental health of orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS.</p>
