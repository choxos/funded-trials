                  <p>Preliminary data suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment produces
substantial and rapid antidepressant effects in patients with major
depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about long-term outcomes.</p>

12 months in participants with moderate to severe MDD who received
psilocybin.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>This randomized, waiting-list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged
21–75 with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID-Hamilton Depression
Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) ⩾ 17). Participants were randomized to an immediate
or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received two doses of
psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty-four participants completed
both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their
second dose.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>All 24 participants attended all follow-up visits through the 12-month
timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID-HAMD scores were observed
at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (Cohen <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 2.3, 2.0,
2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (⩾50% reduction in GRID-HAMD
score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at
12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to
psilocybin in the long-term follow-up period, and no participants reported
psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of
personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after
sessions predicted increased well-being at 12 months, but did not predict
improvement in depression.</p>

            <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects over 260 million people worldwide and is a
leading cause of disability and healthcare expenditures (<xref rid="bibr17-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2018</xref>). First-line treatments,
including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, may take weeks or months to produce
clinically meaningful symptom reduction, and patients can have difficulty with treatment
adherence (<xref rid="bibr8-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Cuijpers et al.,
2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Kolovos et al.,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Lam, 2012</xref>).
At least 30% of patients ultimately meet criteria for treatment-resistant depressive
illness after failing to respond to multiple attempts at treatment (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff, 2007</xref>). MDD also has
a highly recurrent course, with 40–60% of those diagnosed with a single episode
eventually relapsing, and rate of relapse increasing with each subsequent episode (<xref rid="bibr30-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Richards, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et al., 2000</xref>). Novel
interventions are needed that can act rapidly and produce sustained remission.</p>
            <p>Several preliminary studies suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment may have
substantial antidepressant effects in patients with MDD, with treatment response

an initial report of primary outcomes following two doses of psilocybin using a

patients also appear to have a favorable response rate (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2018</xref>). A more recent
study used a double-blind double dummy design to compare high-dose psilocybin plus
6 weeks of placebo with very low dose psilocybin plus 6 weeks of escitalopram (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2021</xref>).
The authors failed to show a significant difference between the two groups at 6 weeks in
their designated primary outcome measure (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms). The
majority of results for secondary outcome measures including other depression severity
scores favored the high-dose psilocybin group, though analyses were not corrected for
multiple comparisons.</p>
            <p>Although psilocybin treatment of MDD appears promising, little is known about long-term
efficacy and safety. The three studies conducted to date demonstrated efficacy at their

previously (<xref rid="bibr10-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al.,
2021</xref>). All procedures involving subjects were approved by The Johns
Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. Participants were 21–75 years of age, medically
stable, and met criteria for a moderate to severe episode of MDD as defined by a
score of ⩾17 on the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) assessed
by blinded clinician raters. Individuals with personal or first- or
second-degree relative history of psychotic or bipolar I or II disorder were
excluded. To avoid interactions with psychoactive drugs including those used to
treat depression, participants were required to refrain from using such
medications for at least five half-lives before screening and for at least 1
month following the second psilocybin session. Following medical and
psychological screening and baseline assessments, participants were randomized
to an immediate or delayed treatment condition. Participants in the immediate
treatment group began the intervention after screening, while those in the
delayed treatment group began the intervention after an 8-week delay
interval.</p>
                <p>After participants entered the intervention period, they were provided with 6–8 h
of preparatory meetings with two facilitators. At least one facilitator in each
dyad had a master’s or doctoral level of clinical training in mental health
(e.g. master of social work, PhD in clinical psychology, MD specializing in
psychiatry). Following preparation, participants received two doses of
psilocybin at 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg spaced approximately 2 weeks apart.
Psilocybin was administered in a comfortable room under the supervision of both
facilitators following established safety guidelines (<xref rid="bibr19-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). A nondirective
psychotherapeutic approach was taken on session days. Participants returned for
follow-up at 1 day and 1 week following each drug administration session, and
then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the second session, during which
depression severity was assessed with participant- and clinician-rated measures.
Each follow-up visit included a 1–2 h meeting with at least one of the therapist
facilitators. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was completed at baseline
and 1 week after the second psilocybin session (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Doss et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The present study suggests that two doses of psilocybin provided in the context of
supportive therapy for MDD produced large and stable antidepressant effects
throughout a 12-month follow-up period. More specifically, depression, as measured
by blinded clinician-rated assessments (GRID-HAMD), decreased substantially after
treatment and remained low at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The effect size
at 12 months was very large (Cohen <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 2.4). Likewise, high and
stable rates of response and remission occurred throughout the follow-up period (75%
response and 58% remission at 12 months). Two patient-rated measures of depression
(QIDS and BDI-II) showed similar large magnitude and stable antidepressant effects
on mean scores and on response and remission rates. These findings suggesting
enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin 1 year after treatment significantly
extend the previous results in this and two other trials that showed antidepressant
effects through 4 weeks (<xref rid="bibr10-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Davis
et al., 2021</xref>), 6 weeks (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2021</xref>), and 6 months
(<xref rid="bibr6-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al.,
2018</xref>). Notably, the remission rate and magnitude of the effect in the
current study at both 6 and 12 months were substantially greater than those in a
previous study at 6 months (QIDS, remission rate 67% and 67% vs 32%, Cohen
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> 2.2 and 2.3 vs 1.6, respectively) (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2018</xref>). Whether this
difference reflects population differences in severity of illness or procedural
differences is unknown. Future research is needed to explore the possibility that
efficacy of psilocybin treatment in MDD may be substantially longer than the
12 months observed in the present study, as has been suggested in a study that
documented decreases in depressive symptoms up to 4.5 years following psilocybin
treatment in patients with cancer-related distress (<xref rid="bibr1-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Agin-Liebes et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>Of note, eight patients (33%) reported beginning a new course of treatment with a
daily antidepressant drug at some point during the 12-month follow-up period, which
is similar to the 32% of patients in a previous trial that did so by 6 months (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al.,
2018</xref>). Although patients who used antidepressants during the follow-up period
had higher GRID-HAMD scores at baseline, at 12 months they did not significantly
differ from those who did not initiate medications. Determining the extent of the
contribution of psilocybin vs other medications to clinical improvement in those who
resumed antidepressant use is not possible. However, participant ratings of
persisting well-being attributed to the psilocybin sessions were not significantly
different from those who did not use antidepressant medications, suggesting that
psilocybin treatment resulted in some independent benefit.</p>
              <p>Although relapse and remission rates at 12 months were favorable, the ability to
accurately compare the long-term efficacy of psilocybin-assisted treatment to that
of standard antidepressant treatment is limited. The majority of recent studies of
long-term antidepressant efficacy drop non-responders from follow-up and focus on
rate of relapse among those who respond to a particular drug, which is often a
minority of the intention-to-treat sample (<xref rid="bibr25-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">McGrath et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi et al., 2006</xref>). In
our sample, of the 17 participants who met criteria for treatment response at
1-month follow-up, 12 (71%) continued to meet criteria for treatment response at all
subsequent timepoints. An additional 3 participants who responded at 1 month also
met criteria for treatment response at 12 months, but had one or more interim
assessments during which their GRID-HAMD score was elevated out of the range for
treatment response. The 71% continuous treatment response at 12 months is somewhat
higher than the 54% rate reported in a study of fluoxetine responders who were
maintained on fluoxetine, and much higher than those switched to placebo (28%)
(<xref rid="bibr25-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">McGrath et al.,
2006</xref>).</p>
              <p>The present study provides new information about qualitative features of the acute
psilocybin experience that predict subsequent enduring effects. Patient ratings of
personal meaning, spiritual significance, and MEQ30 scores after psilocybin sessions
significantly correlated with a measure of overall well-being at most follow-up
timepoints. However, except for ratings of personal meaning and spiritual
significance at the first long-term follow-up assessment at 4 weeks, none of patient
ratings of psilocybin experience at the time of the session were predictive of
improvements in depression. Notably, two previous studies in individuals with
cancer-related depression and anxiety (<xref rid="bibr14-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Ross et al., 2016</xref>) showed
positive associations of MEQ30 session experiences with improvements in depression
symptoms at 5 or 6 weeks. Considering that the direction of correlation at 4 weeks
was in the predicted direction (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.38,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .066), it is possible that the present study was
underpowered to detect such an effect with MEQ30 or other measures of psilocybin
experience. Alternatively, this difference may reflect a lack of such relationship
in a sample of individuals with MDD as opposed to depressive symptoms secondary to a
cancer diagnosis.</p>
              <p>There were no serious adverse events, depression symptoms were not significantly
exacerbated in any participant, and there was no reported use of psilocybin or other
psychedelic drugs during the follow-up period. This latter observation contrasts
with a previous study in which 5 of 19 participants reported use of psilocybin
outside of the research setting by the end of the 6-month follow-up period (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al.,
2018</xref>). Reasons for this difference are unknown, but the observation indicates
the importance of assessing use of psychedelics outside of a clinical trial.
Although the safety results presented herein are favorable, larger phase 3 and 4
studies will be needed to more fully assess safety.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Strengths of this study of psilocybin-facilitated treatment of depression include
a primary outcome measure that was assessed by blinded clinician raters, the
longest post-treatment follow-up interval to date, and excellent participant
retention. Although no participants reported extraneous psilocybin use, 33%
reported using antidepressants during the follow-up period, which precludes
determination of the effects of psilocybin alone in those patients. Although the
randomized waiting list-control design of the study allowed for comparison of
short-term treatment effects to the control group, as described previously
(<xref rid="bibr10-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al.,
2021</xref>), the design did not allow for a comparison group at long-term
follow-up. A recent study suggests that expectancy effects and psychotherapy may
account for some of the clinical benefit of psychedelic-assisted therapy (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al.,
2021</xref>). In that study, which utilized a double-blind, double dummy
design, both the high-dose and very low-dose psilocybin groups showed
significant immediate decreases in depression, suggesting that the preparation
and drug administration day procedures may reduce depressive symptoms even in
the absence of high-dose psilocybin. Studies of other types of interventions for
patients with MDD have demonstrated that placebo effects may last for weeks or
months beyond intervention, and a lack of a comparator group makes it difficult
to account for such effects in our study (<xref rid="bibr20-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2008</xref>). Other limitations
include the small sample size, the predominately Caucasian, non-Hispanic study
sample, and exclusion of those judged to be at elevated risk of suicide.</p>

                <title>Clinical implications</title>
                <p>As novel antidepressants, classic psychedelics are commonly compared to ketamine
and its analogues. Despite distinct mechanisms of pharmacologic action, both
have rapid antidepressant effects and both have garnered concern about their
potential for non-medical use (<xref rid="bibr34-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Schak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Shalit et al., 2019</xref>).
Ketamine has nontrivial abuse potential and there may be overlap between
mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects and abuse potential, which may
be exacerbated by the requirement for repeated administration to maintain
therapeutic efficacy (<xref rid="bibr21-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Kokane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Although evidence
to date suggests that psilocybin has relatively low abuse potential (<xref rid="bibr18-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>),
there remains concern for its potential to cause harm or encourage substance
misuse in vulnerable populations (<xref rid="bibr29-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Reiff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Schatzberg, 2020</xref>). The
present study highlights a key potential advantage of psilocybin treatment over
ketamine in that antidepressant effects after just two administrations of
psilocybin paired with psychological support appear to be sustained through
12 months, which is well beyond the duration of effects reported with ketamine
(<xref rid="bibr26-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">McIntyre et al.,
2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-02698811211073759" ref-type="bibr">Salloum et
al., 2020</xref>). It will be important for future research to determine the
risks and benefits of additional psilocybin administration for those who failed
to respond or experienced early relapse.</p>

              <p>The results of this long-term follow-up of participants who were not blinded to the
drug condition suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment for MDD produces large and
stable antidepressant effects throughout at least 12 months after treatment. These
data document larger effects of longer duration than previous studies of psilocybin
in depressed patients. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo
