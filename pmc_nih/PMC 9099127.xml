                <p>The <sup>13</sup>C‐pantoprazole breath test (PAN‐BT) is a safe, noninvasive, in vivo CYP2C19 phenotyping probe for adults. Our objective was to evaluate PAN‐BT performance in children, with a focus on discriminating individuals who, according to guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacology Implementation Consortium (CPIC), would benefit from starting dose escalation versus reduction for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Children (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 65, 6–17 years) genotyped for <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> variants *2, *3, *4, and *17 received a single oral dose of <sup>13</sup>C‐pantoprazole. Plasma concentrations of pantoprazole and its metabolites, and changes in exhaled <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> (termed delta‐over‐baseline or DOB), were measured 10 times over 8 h using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and spectrophotometry, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were generated and DOB features derived using feature engineering for the first 180 min postadministration. DOB features, age, sex, and obesity status were used to run bootstrap analysis at each timepoint (T<sub>i</sub>) independently. For each iteration, stratified samples were drawn based on genotype prevalence in the original cohort. A random forest was trained, and predictive performance of PAN‐BT was evaluated. Strong discriminating ability for CYP2C19 intermediate versus normal/rapid metabolizer phenotype was noted at DOB<sub>T30 min</sub> (mean sensitivity: 0.522, specificity: 0.784), with consistent model outperformance over a random or a stratified classifier approach at each timepoint (<italic toggle="yes">p </italic>&lt; 0.001). With additional refinement and investigation, the test could become a useful and convenient dosing tool in clinic to help identify children who would benefit most from PPI dose escalation versus dose reduction, in accordance with CPIC guidelines.</p>

                <p>Can the <sup>13</sup>C‐pantoprazole breath test (PAN‐BT) be utilized as a noninvasive CYP2C19 phenotyping probe for children, and can the test discriminate the CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizer (IM) phenotype (i.e., children who would benefit from PPI starting dose reduction) from the normal and rapid metabolizer (NM and RM) phenotype (i.e., children who would benefit from PPI starting dose escalation)?
<list list-type="simple" id="cts13232-list-0003"><list-item><p><bold>WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?</bold></p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>The PAN‐BT can discriminate CYP2C19 IMs from NMs and RMs in as little as 30 min (mean sensitivity 0.522, specificity 0.784), and is feasible in children as young as 6 years of age. Based on recently demonstrated receptiveness to drug dose individualization for PPIs in pediatrics, additional studies are warranted in pediatric populations.

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects approximately one in five people in North America, with an increasing prevalence noted over the past 25 years.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The efficacy of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in treating GERD and other gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> gastritis and peptic ulcer disease) is well‐established for both adult and pediatric patients. However, only recently have clinical guidelines been developed to help optimize and individualize PPI treatment based on an individual’s genetic variation in <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic>, the major drug metabolizing pathway responsible for the biotransformation of most PPIs to inactive metabolites.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Based on newly published recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacology Implementation Consortium (CPIC), a large majority of patients (those with 2 functional copies of the <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> allele, including normal function and gain‐of‐function alleles) would benefit from increasing the standard PPI starting dose by 50%–100% for efficacious treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders. The guidelines also recommend consideration of dose reduction for patients with one or two decreased or no function alleles (e.g., patients with a <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19*1/*2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">*2/*9</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">*3/*4</italic> genotype) if efficacy is achieved and chronic PPI therapy is anticipated.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Although <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype is undoubtedly an important determinant of CYP2C19 activity (i.e., phenotype), it is not the only determinant. CYP2C19 phenotype is also influenced by age.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Furthermore, CYP2C19 genotype‐phenotype discordance (sometimes referred to as phenoconversion) has been described as a consequence of diet, environment, liver disease, metabolic derangement, and concomitant medication use.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Highly relevant for individuals on chronic PPI therapy, CYP2C19 phenoconversion is also common with chronic omeprazole/esomeprazole treatment in as little as 4 weeks of therapy, due to auto‐inhibition of CYP2C19 by these two PPI substrates.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Thus, a CYP2C19 phenotyping, rather than a genotyping test, is perhaps of highest utility for patient care and clinical practice.</p>
              <p>The <sup>13</sup>C‐pantoprazole breath test (PAN‐BT) was previously demonstrated to be a safe, effective, noninvasive, in vivo CYP2C19 phenotyping test in adults.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> For this test, the pantoprazole molecule is labeled with a stable, nonradioactive isotope of carbon (<sup>13</sup>C) at the methyl position and administered as a single oral dose. The labeled methyl group is cleaved by CYP2C19, liberating <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>, which enters the body’s carbon pool, gets converted to CO<sub>2</sub>, and is subsequently eliminated in exhaled air. The enrichment of <sup>13</sup>C in exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> over time is directly related to CYP2C19 activity and can be measured using infrared spectrophotometry, which compares the baseline <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>/<sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> ratio in an exhaled breath sample to changes in this ratio over time after <sup>13</sup>C‐pantoprazole administration.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Given that the noninvasive nature of this breath test is appealing for pediatric use, we evaluated PAN‐BT performance in children. Specifically, we examined the ability of PAN‐BT to discriminate CYP2C19 phenotype (based on genotype) for children, and assessed the test’s ability to capture interindividual variability in CYP2C19 activity independent of <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype.</p>

                <title>Study cohort and data collection</title>
                <p>The data utilized for this study were collected as part of a prospective, single‐center, pharmacokinetic (PK) study of pantoprazole (PAN) performed at the Children’s Mercy Hospital (CMH) in Kansas City, MO (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01887743). The study was approved by the CMH Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. In this secondary analysis of previously published PAN PK data,<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> we present new plasma metabolite and breath test data to help inform the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of PAN in plasma and CYP2C19 phenotyping using PAN‐BT. The metabolites and breath test data presented herein have not been previously published.</p>
                <p>After an overnight fast, children (6–17 years of age) with or without GERD and no other significant comorbidities, abstaining from drugs known to induce/inhibit CYP2C19, and not receiving concomitant therapy with PPIs, were enrolled during a 22‐month period. Participants received a single oral dose of <sup>13</sup>C‐PAN‐sodium in bicarbonate solution (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories), 1.2 mg/kg lean body weight (LBW), up to 100 mg maximum total dose. LBW was calculated using a validated equation.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection, as previously described for PPIs,<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> concentrations of PAN and its CYP2C19‐ and CYP3A4‐mediated metabolites were quantified in plasma samples collected from an indwelling venous catheter (i.v.), prior to PAN administration and at 10 timepoints over 8 h after drug administration. The lower limit of detection for PAN, PAN‐Sulfone, and PAN‐N‐oxide was 0.025 μM; for 4‐desmethyl‐PAN and PAN‐sulfide 0.027 μM; for 4‐desmethyl‐PAN‐sulfide‐sulfate 0.023 μM; and for 4‐desmethyl‐PAN‐sulfate and 4‐desmethyl‐PAN‐sulfone‐sulfate 0.022 μM. All analyses were performed in duplicate. PK profiles were generated using standard noncompartmental analysis (Kinetica version 5).</p>
                <p>In addition to plasma samples, breath samples were collected using standard techniques previously described by our group<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> at predose and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min postdose to quantify concentrations of <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> and <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> in the air exhaled, using infrared spectrophotometry (POCone Spectrophotometer; Otsuka America Pharmaceutical).

                <title>Association of CYP2C19 activity with genotype‐based phenotype groups</title>
                <p>In line with recent CPIC guidelines, the first section of this paper focuses on the comparison of CYP2C19 activity (measured as plasma PK and breath DOB) across established CYP2C19 phenotype groups based on <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype (i.e., CYP2C19 poor metabolizer [PM], intermediate metabolizer [IM], normal metabolizer [NM], rapid metabolizer [RM], and ultrarapid metabolizer [UM]). As expected, only a small number of children (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2) in our cohort were homozygous for <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> variant alleles; therefore, the one PM and one UM identified were excluded from statistical analyses. All subsequent analyses focus specifically on the cohort of IM and NM/RM children, as they represent the majority of the population. Based on the actionable dosing recommendations by CPIC to increase PPI starting dose by 50%–100% for both CYP2C19 NMs and RMs, these two phenotype groups were combined into a single study group (NM/RM).</p>
                <p>Four distinct measures of CYP2C19 activity in plasma were compared for NM/RM versus IM. These included PAN total area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC<sub>tot</sub>; μM per mg/kg), PAN apparent clearance (CL/F; L/h/kg total body weight), and the ratios of parent drug concentrations (PAN) to CYP2CY19‐ and CYP3A4‐mediated metabolite concentrations. For each measure, a series of summary statistics were computed, and nonparametric Mann‐Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> tests were performed to assess for differences between genotype‐based phenotypes and activity levels.</p>

                <p>Next, we undertook analyses to contextualize the relationship between data obtained from the PAN‐BT and CYP2C19 genotype‐based phenotype groups. First, we replicated work performed in adults by Thacker et al., which compared DOB values between genotype‐based phenotypes at various timepoints.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Taking this comparison one step further, we explored nuance of interindividual variability within each phenotype group. To quantitatively assess differences across the distributions, we performed a linear mixed model analysis, modeling DOB as a function of phenotype and time from baseline (20 min, 30 min, etc.). The model specification included a random patient intercept to account for clustering of repeated measures within each individual. T<sub>0</sub> was excluded from this analysis, as DOB values at T<sub>0</sub> were all 0 and did not add meaningful information. Given the small sample size for UM (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) and PM (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1), comparisons were made exclusively between IM (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13) and NM/RM (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 46). To aid in interpretation, visualizations via paired boxplots were created for each included genotype‐based phenotype group at each sampled timepoint.</p>

                <p>The final analysis of this paper explores bypassing the CYP2C19 phenotype assignments based on genotype, and instead assesses the potential of the PAN‐BT to reflect plasma PAN PK and to predict CYP2C19 activity.</p>
                <p>We began by constructing an augmented feature set designed to capture attributes of a patient’s PAN‐BT DOB curve. In addition to raw DOB value at each timepoint, three additional features (i.e., explanatory variables) were derived utilizing data up to and including the respective timepoint; these included area under the DOB curve, a line of best fit, and time to maximum concentration of the DOB.

                <p>Utilizing the computed breath feature set, combined with demographic attributes shown to influence CYP2C19 phenotype (age, sex, and weight status),<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> we built a 500‐tree Extremely randomized Extra‐Tree Forest to predict outlier status of each child.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Similar to random forests, Extra‐Trees are an ensemble of single decision trees created using subsets of available features to improve generalizability. However, rather than using an optimal split criterion to grow the tree, each split is selected randomly, which has been shown to improve generalizability to unseen data when highly informative features (e.g., AUC) would dominate the split‐order in any tree for which they were selected.</p>
                <p>To estimate the expected performance of such a model, we utilized a robust bootstrap approach. Under the bootstrap paradigm, a sample of children was drawn with replacement until the size of the original dataset was reached, and stratified to preserve the prevalence of genotype‐based phenotype categories of NM/RM, IM, and other (i.e., UM and PM) observed in the original cohort (i.e., bootstrap sample). By sampling with replacement, each bootstrap sample leaves out, on average, 37.8% of patients from the full cohort. These excluded cases (known as out‐of‐bag [OOB] samples) can then be used as test data on which to evaluate the performance of a model trained on the resampled data. The process was repeated for 10,000 iterations, and in the rare occurrence that no children in a bootstrap sample were labeled as outliers, a replacement bootstrap sample was drawn.</p>
                <p>At each iteration, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall) were computed for the OOB predictions. F1 results were reported as averages for inlier and outlier classes weighted by the class size. The performance of two baseline classifiers was also computed at each iteration: one which predicts the activity group (inlier/outlier) at random for each child, and one that predicts accordingly with the observed population inlier/outlier distribution from the training cohort. All statistical analyses were completed using Python 3.7, Pandas 1.1.1, SkLearn 0.23, Numpy 1.19, and Scipy1.5.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>

Only those children who provided both evaluable DOB and plasma samples were included in this analysis (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 61). Of the four children excluded, two were excluded due to poor breathing techniques, one due to collection of less than 60% of the postdose breath samples, and one due to premature loss of i.v. for plasma collection.

To account for contribution of metabolites formed as a consequence of both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity (i.e., 4‐desmethyl‐PAN‐sulfone‐sulfate and 4‐desmethyl‐PAN‐sulfide‐sulfate), these metabolite concentrations were alternatively counted toward total CYP2C19 activity (Figure <xref rid="cts13232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) or total CYP3A4 activity (Figure <xref rid="cts13232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Similar to previous findings in adults, our data demonstrate that PAN‐BT can be used in children to discriminate individuals with two functional <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> alleles (i.e., NM/RM genotype‐based phenotype) from individuals with one functional allele (i.e., IM genotype‐based phenotype) in a timespan as short as 1 h (e.g., mean sensitivity 0.522 and specificity 0.784 at 30 min). This finding is clinically important because new <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype‐based PPI dosing guidelines from the CPIC advocate for 50%–100% escalation of the standard PPI starting dose for CYP2C19 NM/RMs for certain conditions (e.g., erosive esophagitis), and consideration of 50% PPI dose reduction for IMs. As recently demonstrated in a multicenter, pragmatic, pediatric trial of genotype‐guided PPI dose selection, both patients and prescribers are ready to embrace such precision dosing for PPIs, and willing to wait up to 2 weeks for genotyping results prior to starting therapy.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> PAN‐BT could offer a convenient, noninvasive, in‐office precision dosing tool alternative, with more quickly and readily available results. DOB is the direct output of spectrophotometry equipment that is already readily available at many hospitals and clinics for other routine clinical testing (e.g., urea breath test for <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> and lactulose breath test for small bowel bacterial overgrowth). Administering an oral dose of <sup>13</sup>C‐PAN to children about to be prescribed a PPI for clinical indications, collecting a sample of exhaled air predose and postdose (at the end of a clinical visit, for example), and running the breath sample through a spectrophotometer on site should therefore, theoretically, pose few logistical barriers for implementation. However, we fully acknowledge that additional research is necessary before steps can be taken to implement the test for clinical purposes. Although formal statistical analysis to assess PAN‐BT’s capacity to discriminate UM and PM CYP2C19 phenotypes could not be performed in our study due to the small sample size (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2), visual inspection of DOB curves in Figure <xref rid="cts13232-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> suggests that this may be possible within a timeframe as short as 30 min.</p>
              <p>One added advantage of PAN‐BT over genotyping is the test’s ability to capture real‐time, CYP2C19 activity in vivo, which, in addition to <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype, is influenced by factors such as age, diet, concomitant medication use, etc.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Thus, the test is ideally suited to account for the relevant, real‐world sources of interindividual variability in CYP2C19 activity not captured by genotype alone. Indeed, measures of CYP2C19 activity in plasma (Figure <xref rid="cts13232-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and breath samples (Figure <xref rid="cts13232-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) in our study showed a substantial degree of overlap across the conventional phenotype groups based on <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype (i.e., RM/NM/IM). For this reason, in addition to evaluating the accuracy of genotype‐based phenotype, we elected to apply PAN‐BT to predict individuals whose plasma PAN AUC<sub>tot</sub> would fall outside of the typical therapeutic range associated with a standard 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole (Figure <xref rid="cts13232-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Given the large number of bootstrap iterations performed, this model‐based approach using PAN‐BT is expected to outperform a random selection based on the expected outlier rates seen in the general population (i.e., what is currently practiced at the bedside). Presumably, it is these outlier patients whose systemic drug exposures fall above or below the therapeutic range from a standard PPI dose, who would benefit most from PPI dose adjustment, independent of their <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genetic makeup.</p>
              <p>Evidence is mounting that systemic PPI drug concentrations outside the therapeutic range are not as benign as once thought. Subtherapeutic exposures can result in therapeutic failure to eradicate <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pylori</italic> infection or heal erosions from acid damage, for example.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Conversely, supratherapeutic exposures, especially over a prolonged period of time, can lead to increased risk of adverse events, such as kidney disease,<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> osteopenia and mineral deficiencies,<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and enteral and respiratory infections, particularly in children.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts13232-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In a pilot, genotype‐guided, pragmatic trial, Cicali and colleagues recently demonstrated comparable PPI efficacy and a trend toward fewer respiratory adverse events in children (<italic toggle="yes">p </italic>= 0.07) over a 12‐week treatment course for GERD, when PPI dose selection was informed by <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype compared to a conventional “one‐dose‐fits‐all” dosing approach.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> A phenotype‐based dosing approach using PAN‐BT can be expected to offer comparable benefit, with the added advantage of accounting for genotype‐phenotype discordance secondary to disease, dietary components or concomitant medications competing for CYP2C19‐mediated metabolism, and/or auto‐inhibition of CYP2C19 from chronic PPI therapy. Thus, further research to establish PAN‐BT DOB reference ranges to inform drug dose selection across the PPI drug class are warranted. This is especially true for pediatrics, where patients and prescribers are ready for a shift in the traditional PPI dosing paradigm toward individualized precision dosing, as illustrated in the pragmatic trial by Cicali et al.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, our study represents the first published pediatric experience with the PAN‐BT; however, as with any study, it has limitations. Although our preliminary results are strong, the generalizability of the predictive values and association magnitudes is limited by overall sample size. Confirmatory studies aimed at evaluating performance with improved precision will require larger diverse patient cohorts. This diversity will be essential to expand phenotype comparison from the UM (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) and PM (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) assignments based on <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19</italic> genotype. Given that our study population is primarily (&gt;85%) White and African American, the observed prevalence of these phenotypes is in line with the expected population prevalence (~ 2%) based on race/ethnicity.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p>Additional limitations may include our decision to combine children with the <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19 *1*1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">*1*17</italic> genotypes into a single study group. However, this decision was made deliberately because the actionable CPIC recommendation to increase the PPI starting dose by 50%–100% is the same for <italic toggle="yes">CYP2C19 *1*1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">*1*17</italic> individuals.<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Last, some children in our study had trouble mastering the breathing technique for PAN‐BT, which likely contributed to the irregularity of the DOB curves, necessitating additional processing of the DOB data directly outputted by the spectrophotometer. More broadly, prospective assessment of the test’s utility in guiding dosing decisions across the PPI drug class are needed before the test could be implemented as a precision dosing tool in the clinic. However, collection of such data is promising as, with proper coaching, 97% of children were ultimately successful in providing adequate DOB data.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Our study supports the assertion that the PAN‐BT could provide a clinically useful, noninvasive method for assessing CYP2C19 activity (i.e., phenotype) in children. Our results confirm the feasibility of test administration to children as young as 6 years of age with some coaching, and demonstrate comparable test performance to adult studies for distinguishing the CYP2C19 NM/RM genotype‐based phenotype from IM. If administered in the clinic, this test could potentially identify children who would benefit from PPI dose escalation versus dose reduction in as little as 1 h. In our opinion, a phenotype‐based PPI dosing strategy using the PAN‐BT could offer added benefit over a genotype‐based strategy, as it would account for CYP2C19 genotype‐phenotype discordance from diet, disease, concomitant medication use, and/or auto‐inhibition of CYP2C19 by chronic PPI therapy. Based on the willingness of pediatric patients, parents, and providers to participate in a recent, pragmatic, clinical trial of PPI drug dose individualization,<xref rid="cts13232-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> the timing may be ideal for further investigation of the utility of the PAN‐BT in pediatrics.</p>
