                <p id="Par1">Affinity-optimized T cell receptors can enhance the potency of adoptive T cell therapy. Afamitresgene autoleucel (afami-cel) is a human leukocyte antigen-restricted autologous T cell therapy targeting melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4), a cancer/testis antigen expressed at varying levels in multiple solid tumors. We conducted a multicenter, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic solid tumors expressing MAGE-A4, including synovial sarcoma (SS), ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03132922">NCT03132922</ext-link>). The primary endpoint was safety, and the secondary efficacy endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response. All patients (<italic>N</italic> = 38, nine tumor types) experienced Grade ≥3 hematologic toxicities; 55% of patients (90% Grade ≤2) experienced cytokine release syndrome. ORR (all partial response) was 24% (9/38), 7/16 (44%) for SS and 2/22 (9%) for all other cancers. Median duration of response was 25.6 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.286, not reached) and 28.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.286, not reached) overall and for SS, respectively. Exploratory analyses showed that afami-cel infiltrates tumors, has an interferon-γ-driven mechanism of action and triggers adaptive immune responses. In addition, afami-cel has an acceptable benefit–risk profile, with early and durable responses, especially in patients with metastatic SS. Although the small trial size limits conclusions that can be drawn, the results warrant further testing in larger studies.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4) is a member of the MAGE protein family of cancer/testis antigens, with expression in healthy tissue restricted to immune-privileged sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. MAGE-A4 is expressed in solid cancers, including synovial sarcoma (SS), myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and ovarian, urothelial, melanoma and gastroesophageal cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. MAGE-A4 is intracellularly processed, resulting in peptide fragments that are co-presented with human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on the cell surface, forming epitopes that are weakly recognized by low-affinity natural T cell receptors (TCRs). Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have exhibited good clinical activity in patients with some MAGE-A4<sup>+</sup> solid tumors, such as melanoma, other tumors, such as SS, may not respond as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Afamitresgene autoleucel (afami-cel) is an autologous, specific peptide enhanced affinity receptor, T cell therapy transduced via a lentiviral vector to express a high-affinity and specific TCR targeted against a MAGE-A4<sub>230−239</sub> peptide, GVYDGREHTV, presented by HLA-A*02 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). This TCR has been shown to respond potently toward MAGE-A4 peptides presented on multiple common HLA-A2 alleles. Preclinical assessment demonstrated that afami-cel induces potent cytotoxic effects and effector cytokine release against multiple HLA-A*02/MAGE-A4 cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, supporting the first-in-human phase 1 trial of afami-cel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03132922">NCT03132922</ext-link>).</p>

A total of 854 HLA-A*02-eligible patients proceeded to tumor MAGE-A4 testing: 225 were MAGE-A4<sup>+</sup>. This phase 1 trial used a 3 + 3 design, involving afami-cel dose escalation across dose Groups 1–3 and an expansion group. Dose ranges (total transduced cell number) were 0.08 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 0.12 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells (Group 1), 0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells (Group 2), 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 6.0 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells (Group 3) and 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 10 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells (expansion group). Group 1 received cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy on days −7, −6 and −5 and fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) on days −7, −6 and −5.

                <p id="Par6">Eligibility criteria included age ≥18 years to ≤75 years; histologically confirmed cancer diagnosis; positivity for at least one HLA-A*02 inclusion allele; MAGE-A4 RNA or protein expression in one or more tumor samples; and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 before LD chemotherapy (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> for full inclusion criteria). The sample size was not pre-specified and was based on clinical judgment. Up to 30 patients (including patients accrued during the dose-escalation phase) were treated in the dose-expansion phase, and up to an additional ten patients were treated in a radiation sub-study. The study was not statistically powered to evaluate safety or efficacy, and data are descriptive, with no formal hypothesis testing planned. The primary endpoints were adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs; laboratory assessments, including chemistry, hematology and coagulation; incidence of DLTs; determination of optimally tolerated dose range; and persistence of MAGE-A4<sup>c1032T</sup> and replication-competent lentivirus over time. Secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) confirmed by RECIST version 1.1; best overall response (BOR); time to response (TTR); duration of response (DoR); duration of stable disease (SD); progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS); and presence of any of the following long-term follow-up (LTFU) AEs: new malignancies; new incidence or exacerbation of a pre-existing neurologic disorder and/or prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder; new incidence of a hematologic disorder; opportunistic and/or serious infections; unanticipated illness and/or hospitalization deemed related to gene-modified cell therapy; and/or persistence of MAGE-A4<sup>c1032T</sup> and replication-competent lentivirus over time. The exploratory endpoints included correlation of persistence, phenotype and functionality of transduced (afami-cel) and non-transduced T cells in the peripheral blood and/or tumor in response to treatment and safety; determination of target antigen expression, genes related to antigen processing/presentation and cell surface co-stimulatory ligands; and evaluation of serum cytokines (IL-6). The following exploratory endpoints were not analyzed: evaluation of anti-tumor antibodies or candidate biomarkers from plasma-derived exosomes and cell-free DNA. Owing to the preliminary nature of the data collected before the data cutoff, limited correlative analyses were reported relating to treatment response and safety. Two patients received a second infusion; they were non-responders. Therefore, ORR was not evaluated for the second infusion.</p>

                <p id="Par16">In the 16 heavily pre-treated metastatic SS patients, ORR was 44% (95% CI: 19.8, 70.1) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, inset, and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), and DCR was 94% (seven PR and eight SD). The change in SLD of the target lesions over time for patients with SS is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> (inset). Median TTR was 6.4 weeks (95% CI: 6.1, 18.1), and median DoR was 28.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.3, not reached). All seven responding patients had high tumor MAGE-A4 H-scores &gt;214 and were treated with afami-cel doses &gt;9.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>, except one patient receiving 4.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells. Median PFS was 20.4 weeks (95% CI: 10.0, 52.1) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, inset), and median OS was 58.1 weeks (95% CI: 36.3, not reached) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, inset), with 81%, 44% and 13% alive at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months, respectively. Three patients were progression free for &gt;12 months.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Because disease-specific mortality in SS is mediated by progression of pulmonary and pleural metastases, radiologically confirmed durable regression of intrathoracic lesions after afami-cel could suggest clinical benefit. For example, pre-infusion and post-infusion cross-sectional thoracic contrast computed tomography scans in two patients with SS (each with MAGE-A4 H-scores &gt;200, large baseline tumor burdens and treated with high afami-cel doses) confirmed the in vivo potency and anti-tumor activity of afami-cel (Patients A and B; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Both patients had PRs with TTR at week 6 and SLD reductions of −45% (at 12 weeks) and −81% (at 6 weeks), respectively, principally in pleural metastasis target lesions (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In Patient A, afami-cel was associated with reductions in metastatic disease in hemithorax, including regression of a large left lung pleural metastasis that crossed the midline at baseline and re-expansion of the right lung, as shown on a computed tomography scan at week 12 after afami-cel (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), associated with patient-reported improvement in exertional dyspnea. In Patient B, afami-cel was associated with overall reduction in left lung pleural metastases, including complete resolution of one pleural metastasis (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par18">Patients A and B were administered a second T cell infusion (manufactured from surplus cell material collected at the initial leukapheresis) after disease progression from their first afami-cel infusions. Neither of the second infusions led to a response. Baseline tumor biopsy before the second infusion in Patient A showed markedly lower MAGE-A4 expression compared with a tumor biopsy before the first infusion (H-score, 37 versus 214, respectively). For Patient B, MAGE-A4 expression was high in biopsies taken before the first and second infusions (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par31">In this phase 1 trial, we evaluated the safety, clinical activity and translational effects of afami-cel in HLA-A*02<sup>+</sup> patients with MAGE-A4-expressing solid tumors. Prolonged cytopenia, CRS and neurotoxicity were three TEAEs of special interest. The prolonged cytopenia-related fatality in a patient with SS caused by aplastic anemia might have been caused by the higher LD dose of 3,600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of cyclophosphamide. Because this patient also had two sequential high-grade CRS events, it cannot be excluded that there was a contributory systemic inflammatory component to this Grade 5 event. Reassuringly, there was no evidence of an off-tumor, on-target effect observed in the bone marrow because MAGE-A4 expression was absent. However, although 45% of patients had at least one prolonged Grade ≥3 cytopenia, the incidence of clinical sequelae, including systemic infections, was low. Overall, the lower-dose cyclophosphamide LD regimen was associated with a favorable hematological toxicity profile and a similar serum IL-15 profile compared to patients treated with the higher-dose cyclophosphamide LD regimen. Given the overall favorable hematological safety profile of fludarabine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 4 days and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 3 days LD chemotherapy and its ability to support afami-cel anti-tumor activity across different indications, with no discernable difference in serum IL-15 levels compared to the higher cyclophosphamide dose schedule, the lower LD chemotherapy regimen was selected for the registration-directed phase 2 SPEARHEAD-1 trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04044768">NCT04044768</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par32">Afami-cel-related CRS occurred in 55% of all patients and was typically low-grade, early-onset, post-infusion and reversible in all cases with the administration of anti-IL-6(R) monoclonal antibody treatment when indicated. Consistent with the known monocyte–macrophage-centric pathophysiology of CRS, elevations in serum cytokines (including IFNγ, IL-6 and GMCSF) were associated with increasing CRS grades. The overall incidence and severity of ICANS/encephalopathy was low, with no reported cases in patients with SS. Although additional neurological AEs were reported across tumor types, there was no consistent pattern to suggest a definite causal relationship with afami-cel. The safety findings reported here are consistent with those observed in patients with cancer undergoing LD chemotherapy and cellular therapy, including treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T cells or NY-ESO-1 T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Patients treated in the trial had nine different cancers with heterogenous MAGE-A4 expression, and most patients with therapeutic responses had high H-scores. The ORR of 24% in the overall population was primarily due to clinical activity observed in SS. Responses were limited in non-sarcoma cancers, perhaps due to small numbers of patients with specific cancer types or lower MAGE-A4 expression relative to SS. Although the number of patients with SS was small, the emergent ORR of 44%, median PFS of 20.4 weeks and median OS of 58.1 weeks are better than the historical low ORRs reported for current standard-of-care therapies, including pazopanib and trabectedin, used in the post-first-line metastatic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. SS is sensitive to alkylators, and the use of cyclophosphamide in the LD regimen is a confounder in the interpretation of the response rate in SS.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Preliminary evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships associated with afami-cel dose escalation used peak cell persistence and peak serum IFNγ levels as prototypical pharmacokineticand pharmacodynamic markers, respectively. When considering the subset of patients with ovarian cancer across all dosing groups, increases in afami-cel doses were associated with progressively increasing peak cell persistence and peak IFNγ levels (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Although cyclophosphamide-containing LD chemotherapy, or persisting therapeutic effects of bridging therapy, may have contributed to disease control in ovarian cancer and SS, the independent therapeutic activity of afami-cel in responding patients is corroborated by cell pharmacokinetic and serum pharmacodynamic findings. The durable reduction in SLD for several months in some patients with SS after one afami-cel infusion suggests that the anti-tumor effect of afami-cel lasts longer than would be expected after one cycle of alkylating-agent-containing LD chemotherapy. Although some patients with PD had rapidly decreasing levels of afami-cel persistence, some maintained high levels of persistence, suggesting that tumor-intrinsic factors, possibly immuno-editing mechanisms (for example, loss of MAGE-A4 or HLA expression), or potential immunosuppressive factors (such as arginase-1), might contribute to the development of afami-cel resistance even if afami-cel cytolytic activity can be maintained in vivo.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The serum cytokine response profile indicated an IFNγ-driven mechanism of action as well as emerging biomarkers of anti-tumor response. Tumor analyses supported the co-localization of afami-cel with cancer cells and resident immune cells in tumors, with evidence of activated and proliferative intra-tumoral T cell states and adaptive immune responses. Because the ongoing phase 2 SPEARHEAD-1 trial will have dosed ~100 patients with SS and MRCLS with afami-cel at completion, confirmation of these preliminary translational analyses may be possible in future pooled analyses. This will include a deeper evaluation of the potentially complex inter-relationship between immunological components of the tumor microenvironment and dynamic temporal changes in afami-cel phenotype and function after infusion.</p>
              <p id="Par36">In summary, our findings demonstrate that afami-cel was well tolerated and suggest that it could be a promising therapy for patients with metastatic SS who have received prior ifosfamide treatment. Limitations to the interpretation of the response rate in SS include the small sample size and confounding effect of LD. Nevertheless, the encouraging results warrant further study, and additional data in metastatic SS will be evaluated in the phase 2 SPEARHEAD-1 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

HLA typing was performed using the 510(k)-cleared SeCore high-resolution sequence-based typing system for Class I loci (A, B and C) and uTYPE software (One Lambda Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific). Central laboratory testing was performed using blood samples at the Histocompatibility/Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the American Red Cross in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is accredited by the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">For MAGE-A4 antigen expression, centralized testing by IHC was performed at HistoGeneX using an analytically validated and clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA)-certified clinical trial assay. Positivity was determined by a pathologist based on the percentage of positive cells and intensity of expression, as determined by a percent score (P-score) (range, 0–100%) for IHC staining. P-score was defined as stained cell percentage at 1+ intensity + stained cell percentage at 2+ intensity + stained cell percentage at 3+ intensity. During the conduct of patient pre-screening in the expansion group, the study protocol was amended for SS and MRCLS to use a higher cutoff of ≥30% of cells that were of 2+ and/or 3+ intensity; a subsequent amendment was made to use this higher cutoff for all other tumor types in the expansion group. For translational data analyses, MAGE-A4 expression was presented as an H-score, which was defined as: (% stained cells at 0) × 0 + (% stained cells at 1+) × 1 + (% stained cells at 2+) × 2 + (% stained cells at 3+) × 3.

The p1.5 process used the COBE 2991 Cell Processor cell washer (Terumo BCT) and Xuri Cell Expansion System W25 bioreactor (Cytivia). During the trial, process improvements were made to the volume of material processed, with the process being updated to p1.5.1. Further improvements were made during the trial, with the COBE 2991 Cell Processor being replaced by the Sepax C-Pro Cell Processing System (Cytivia) for the p1.6.1 manufacturing process. Along with changes to the cell manufacturing process over the course of the trial, there were also multiple sources of lentiviral vector. The initial source of vector was manufactured by City of Hope and used an adherent-based manufacturing process. The lentiviral vector sourced later in the trial was manufactured by Lentigen and used a suspension-based manufacturing process. The median vector copy number in the product was 4.5 per transduced cell (range, 2.2–8.5 per transduced cell); the median transduction efficiency for the product was 53.3% (range, 25.5–80%); and the median number of cells produced during the manufacturing process was 20.7 × 10<sup>9</sup> total nucleated cells (range, 5.0 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 42.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>). The final cell product release was contingent on several different specifications, including CD3<sup>+</sup> ≥80% of cells, vector copy number &lt;12.0 and cell viability ≥70%; the final afami-cel product was cryopreserved in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and thawed before intravenous administration.</p>

Images were annotated and analyzed using High Plex FL version 3.2.1 algorithm (Indica Labs), resulting in co-localization output for key immunophenotypes, such as CD4 T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>), cytotoxic T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>), regulatory T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) and malignant cells (PanCK/Sox10<sup>+</sup>) as well as activated (granzyme B<sup>+</sup>), proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) and PD-L1<sup>+</sup> combinations of these phenotypes. Spatial analysis plots were generated, using HALO Spatial Analysis module, by selected combinations of these immunophenotypes. The generated spatial plots represent spatial organization and distribution of malignant cells to cytotoxic and regulatory T cells in a selected region of interest. Semi-quantitative analysis of cell numbers (per square millimeter of tumor tissue area), for each of immunophenotype, was performed by exporting the summary results from HALO and importing these data into RStudio (and R version 4.2.1) to generate the relevant heat maps and line plots.</p>

                  <p id="Par66">The primary objective was evaluation of safety and tolerability with endpoints including TEAEs, serious AEs, DLTs and detection of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL). Secondary endpoints included ORR confirmed by RECIST version 1.1, BOR, TTR, DoR, duration of SD, PFS and OS. Exploratory objectives included evaluation of cell persistence and cytokines. Exploratory endpoints included correlation of persistence, phenotype and functionality of transduced (afami-cel) and non-transduced T cells in the peripheral blood and/or tumor in response to treatment and safety; determination of target antigen expression, genes related to antigen processing/presentation and cell surface co-stimulatory ligands; and evaluation of serum cytokines (that is, IL-6). The following exploratory endpoints were not analyzed: evaluation of anti-tumor antibodies or candidate biomarkers from plasma-derived exosomes and cell-free DNA. Owing to the preliminary nature of the data collected before the data cutoff, limited correlative analyses were reported in relation to response to treatment and safety. Two patients received a second infusion; they were non-responders. Therefore, ORR was not evaluated for the second infusion.</p>
