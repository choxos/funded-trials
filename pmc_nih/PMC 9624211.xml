                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Limited data are available to establish evidence-based management protocols for vestibulodynia (VBD), a chronic vulvar pain condition that affects approximately 14 million women in the U.S. For the purposes of the study, our group subdivided VBD subtypes that may benefit from different types of treatment: 1) VBD peripheral (VBD-p), characterized by pain localized to the vulvar vestibule and 2) VBD central (VBD-c), characterized by VBD alongside one or more other chronic overlapping pain conditions (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular disorder, and fibromyalgia syndrome) that affect remote body regions. Here, we describe the rationale and design of an NIH-funded multicenter clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of topical and/or systemic medication for alleviating pain and normalizing pain- relevant biomarkers among women with VBD-p and VBD-c.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four parallel arms: peripheral treatment with 5% lidocaine + 0.5â€‰mg/ml 0.02% oestradiol compound cream + oral placebo pill, 2) central treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline + placebo cream, 3) combined peripheral cream and central pill treatments, or 4) placebo cream and placebo pill. The treatment phase will last 16â€‰weeks, with outcome measures and biomarkers assessed at 4 time points (0, 8, 16, and 24â€‰weeks). First, we will compare the efficacy of treatments in alleviating pain using standardized tampon insertion with a numeric rating scale and self-reported pain on the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Next, we will compare the efficacy of treatments in improving perceived physical, mental, and sexual health using standardized questionnaires. Finally, we will measure cytokines and microRNAs in local vaginal and circulating blood samples using multiplex assays and RNA sequencing, and determine the ability of these biomarkers to predict treatment response.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of peripherally and centrally acting medications currently used in clinical practice for treating unique VBD subtypes based on distinct clinical and biological signatures.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Vestibulodynia (VBD) is the most common cause of sexual pain, affecting 16% of reproductive aged women in the United States [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pain is chronic, lasting over three months, and compromises psychological functioning, interpersonal relations, and daily activity [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As further evidence of its public health significance, VBD and related vulvar pain conditions cost the US economy over $70 billion annually [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite its high prevalence and significant economic burden, VBD remains ineffectively treated due to its unclear aetiology and heterogeneous clinical presentation. Some women present with localized provoked pain restricted to the vaginal vestibule and others present with VBD and chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; 35%) [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] temporomandibular disorder (TMD; 78%) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS; 17%) [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the absence of data to guide treatment approaches for VBD patients with diverse symptomology, many different therapies are used on a trial-and-error basis which can delay effective care [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>In 2015 International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease, the International Society for the Study of Womenâ€™s Sexual Health, and the International Pelvic Pain Society developed a consensus statement for descriptors of women with vulvodynia to classify the distribution, onset and timing of pain. As the neuropathophysiology of vulvodynia is complex and characterized by both peripheral and central sensory abnormalities, we opted to divide these women into two groups based on presence of COPCs for study purposes [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The VBD peripheral (VBD-p) subtype is characterized by localized pain specific to the vaginal vestibule, and the VBD central (VBD-c) subtype is characterized by pain at vestibular and remote body regions [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Women with VBD-p frequently exhibit normal psychological profiles; balance in circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; and dysregulation in microRNAs that regulate the expression of genes in oestrogen pathways [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, women with VBD-c report decreased functional status and increased somatic awareness; lack compensatory increases in anti-inflammatory cytokines; and have dysregulation in microRNAs that regulate the expression of genes relevant to muscle, nerve, and immune cell function [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These data suggest that VBD-p and VBD-c have unique aetiologies (localized pain with peripheral neurosensory disruption versus widespread pain with a central sensory contribution) and may, therefore, respond differently to peripheral and centrally-targeted treatments.</p>
              <p>Local anaesthetics and oestrogen are among the most commonly prescribed peripheral treatments [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Topical 5% lidocaine for 7â€‰weeks has been shown to decrease dyspareunia in women with VBD [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], likely due to its ability to block the activity of sodium channels on peripheral nociceptors and prevent the transmission of pain to the CNS [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Topical oestrogen for 3â€‰months has been shown to reduce peripheral pain and inflammation [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as well as improve sexual function for premenopausal women with vulvar pain [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Oestrogen plays a critical role in trophic support and neuroplasticity of vaginal tissues, with deficient oestrogen levels resulting in atrophy and increased innervation of pain-sensing nerve fibres [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Further evidence that women with VBD may be deficient in oestrogen come from the Wesselmann study demonstrating that tampon-induced vaginal pain is highest in the premenstrual phase, corresponding with systemic low oestrogen levels [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and our own work, where we demonstrated that women with VBD-p have increased expression of microRNAs that negatively regulate transcripts vital for oestrogen signalling [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lidocaine and oestrogen are often compounded into a combined cream that can produce a synergistic analgesic effect [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Yet, data from well-powered RCTs in support of these treatments are lacking.</p>
              <p>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the most commonly prescribed centrally-targeted treatment for the management of vulvar pain [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and have been shown to improve sexual function [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An open trial of nortriptyline for 2â€‰months found that 6/7 women had a complete or partial reduction in chronic pelvic pain [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a case study, nortriptyline completely alleviated vaginal pain in a woman for whom topical lidocaine, oestrogen, and other peripheral treatments failed [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While the TCA Amitriptyline has been prescribed for vulvar pain, clinical studies demonstrating its efficacy are limited and upwards of 30% of women may discontinue its use due to sedation and other side effects [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The anti-epileptic Gabapentin has also been commonly prescribed for vaginal pain, however recent results from a randomized controlled trial found that gabapentin was ineffective in reducing pain among women with VBD [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nortriptyline has been well studied for the treatment of other neuropathic pain disorders and evidence-based guidelines support its use as a first-line medication [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nortriptyline produces analgesia via multiple molecular mechanisms in the CNS, including (1) inhibiting reuptake of norepinephrine to promote descending inhibition [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], (2) blocking sodium channels to inhibit the activity of nociceptive neurons [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and (3) inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from glia so as to reduce neuroinflammation [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, as concluded in recent evidence-based literature reviews, interpretation of treatment success remains difficult due to the limitations of published studies, including poor patient selection, lack of adequate controls, and limited follow-up data [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, there is a critical need for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of these peripheral and centrally-targeted treatments, especially among women with different VBD subtypes.</p>
              <p>Thus, we are conducting new multidisciplinary studies that plan to identify effective strategies for the management of VBD. We will also continue to characterize VBD subtypes with data obtained from this proposed multi-site RCT. We will compare the efficacy of peripheral, central, and combined treatments in alleviating objectively-measured pain and improving patient reported outcomes for women with VBD. In addition, we will evaluate cytokine and microRNA biomarkers that help determine underlying pathophysiology and predict treatment response. To evaluate these measures, we will apply a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled factorial study design to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of: (1) peripheral treatment with lidocaine/oestradiol compound cream, (2) centrally-targeted treatment with the oral tricyclic nortriptyline, or (3) combined peripheral and central treatment in women with newly diagnosed VBD. We hypothesize that women with VBD-p will exhibit increased levels of inflammatory mediators in the vaginal vestibule and preferentially respond to peripheral lidocaine/oestradiol treatment, while women with VBD-c will exhibit increased levels of inflammatory mediators in blood and preferentially respond to centrally-targeted or combined treatment. With this study we hope to advance our knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying VBD-p and VBD-c, determine the efficacy of peripheral, central, and combined therapies in alleviating pain in women with VBD-p and VBD-c, and identify biomarkers that predict treatment response.</p>

                <p>Vestibulodynia UPDATe is a multi-centre, two-by-two factorial designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial registered at clinical trials.gov (NCT03844412) designed to determine the efficacy of two treatments, alone or in combination, compared to matching placebo. Women will be recruited from two study sites and complete a 16-week treatment phase, with outcome measures and biomarkers assessed at four time points (0, 8, 16, and 24â€‰weeks). The primary endpoints include change in pain, self-reported health, and cytokine/microRNA measures at 16â€‰weeks, with secondary endpoints of change in these measures at 8â€‰weeks and 24â€‰weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) peripheral treatment in the form of lidocaine/oestradiol compound creamâ€‰+â€‰oral placebo pill, 2) centrally-targeted treatment in the form of placebo creamâ€‰+â€‰oral nortriptyline pill, 3) combined treatment in the form of lidocaine/oestradiol compound creamâ€‰+â€‰oral nortriptyline pill; or 4) placebo cream and placebo pill. A total of 400 women (200 per site) with VBD diagnosis confirmed by one of the study clinicians will be recruited from 4 November 2019 to 1 December 2023 from the University of North Carolina (UNC) and the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) under reliance of the single institutional review board (IRB) protocol at Duke University. Eligible women will participant in the study for 24â€‰weeks with a total of four study visits.</p>

                <p>The study population is comprised of premenopausal and perimenopausal women with VBD of any ethnicity or race. Based on historical patterns of recruitment, we expect to enroll 10% Hispanic/Latino and 90% non-Hispanic/Latino women. Of the non-Hispanic/Latino women, we expect the racial distribution will be 70% White, 10% Black, 5% Asian and 5% other groups. This distribution is similar to that among people reporting VBD in other U.S. demographic populations in other clinical trials [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

                <p>Primary recruitment will occur in the clinic setting in both subspecialty pelvic pain clinics and other specialty gynaecologic clinics. Additional recruitment strategies will include flyer distribution, social media posts, and mass email blasts to UNC and UCLA students and employees every three months. Study information will be placed online on a study-specific website (sites.duke.edu/updatestudy), social media sites (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter), relevant University (e.g. Duke List) and Association (e.g. National Vulvodynia Association) sites, and clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, we will use study sitesâ€™ data warehouses to identify potential participants with VBD-associated ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes.</p>
                <p>Screening will be conducted by telephone call, by email, or in-person at a clinic visit (please see the <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2132531" ext-link-type="uri">Appendix</ext-link> for the phone/email screener). The purpose of the study, study interventions and evaluations, and the potential risks and benefits of participation, will be explained to eligible participants. If a potential participant meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria during the in-person screening verification at the beginning of Visit 1, she will be provided the site-specific Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form to review (please see the <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2132531" ext-link-type="uri">Appendix</ext-link> for UNC and UCLA consent forms). If she then agrees to participate, she will sign the consent form and complete a pregnancy test and tampon test. The urine pregnancy test will be completed according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The tampon test and Q-tip test will be completed as described in the Outcome Measures section below. In addition, she will be asked to rate her pain with sexual contact involving penetration into the vagina and pain with touch to the vaginal opening on a 0-10 numeric rating scale.</p>
                <p>Participants may be enrolled if they (1) sign the informed consent, AND â€˜(2) meetÂ all inclusion/exclusion criteria, AND (3) have a negative pregnancy test result, AND rate pain as â‰¥3/10 with the tampon test, with sexual contact involving penetration into the vagina, and/or with touch to the vaginal opening.</p>

                <p>Participants will be randomly assigned a combination of either (1) peripheral treatment in the form of 5% lidocaine/0.5â€‰mg/ml 0.02% oestradiol compound creamâ€‰+â€‰placebo pill, (2) centrally-targeted treatment in the form of placebo creamâ€‰+â€‰nortriptyline oral pill (up to 50â€‰mg or highest tolerated dose), (3) combined treatment in the form of 5% lidocaine/0.5â€‰mg/ml 0.02% oestradiol compound creamâ€‰+â€‰nortriptyline; or (4) placebo creamâ€‰+â€‰placebo pill. Participants will be prompted weekly by email to enter their use of medications in a REDCap calendar.</p>
                <p>Lidocaine/oestradiol cream will be used to target peripheral nerves and tissues affected in VBD; and the comparison treatment will be an identical-appearing placebo Moisturelâ„¢ cream. The cream has a dose-controlled pump action that delivers a predetermined dose of medication. Participants will be provided with a diagram and written instructions detailing how to apply the active or placebo cream to the vaginal vestibule daily for weeks 1â€“16. Treatment with lidocaine/oestradiol or placebo cream will be terminated at 16â€‰weeks.</p>
                <p>Nortriptyline is a centrally-acting tricyclic antidepressant that is FDA-approved for treatment of neuropathic pain. Dosing will begin with one 10â€‰mg pill nightly for week 1, then two 10â€‰mg pills nightly for week 2, three 10â€‰mg pills nightly for week 3, four 10â€‰mg pills nightly for week 4, and five for weeks 5â€“16. A slow titration period is provided to reduce side effects. In the event of side effects, participants will be advised to decrease dosage by one pill weekly until a tolerable dose is achieved. Treatment with oral nortriptyline or placebo pill will be tapered off over weeks 16â€“18, decreasing the dose by 10â€‰mg every four days. Participants will be provided with a list of drugs to avoid that have the potential to interact with nortriptyline.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Drug assignments will be determined by the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) using randomized blocks, and then stratified by enrollment site. The DCRI will create a SAS program to generate the random sequence that will be loaded in Dukeâ€™s Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).</p>
                <p>Participants and research personnel will be blinded to medication assignment. Blinding of the study, with respect to treatment groups will be preserved by the use of placebo cream and capsules that are identical in appearance to the active study drugs. Investigators may be asked at the end of the trial if they had obtained any information that may have led to the potential unblinding of treatment.</p>

                <p>Outcomes measures will be assessed during each of four study visits, including a baseline visit 1 pre-treatment, an 8-week visit 2 and 16-week visit 3 during treatment, and a 24-week visit 4 post-treatment. As illustrated in <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, study visits will consist of four elements: (1) standardized tampon test to measure provoked vulvovaginal pain, (2) validated questionnaires to measure perceived pain, health, mood, and sexual function, (3) quantitative sensory testing to measure pressure pain thresholds at local and remote body sites, and (4) biologic sample collection to measure local (vaginal) and systemic (blood) cytokines and miRNAs. Please refer to <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for a complete list of measures and events scheduled for each study visit in chronological order.</p>

                  <title>Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of peripheral, central, and combined treatments in alleviating pain among women with VBD-p and VBD-c</title>
                  <p>Primary outcome measures will be the net change in vaginal vestibule pain following treatment measured using the tampon test and the final score on the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). The tampon test has good reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness and is a recommended outcome measure for VBD clinical trials [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The tampon test alone may underestimate severity of pain among some women with vulvodynia [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], though it does allow for an assessment of daily life experience in women with vulvodynia. A cardboard applicator regular size TampaxÂ® tampon (Proctor &amp; Gamble) will be inserted by the participant without lubrication into her vagina and then she will be asked to verbally rate her pain on a scale of 0-10, with 0 meaning no pain and 10 meaning the worst possible pain. The SF-MPQ is comprised of two parts: Pain Rating Index (PRI) and the pain intensity visual analogue scale. The PRI measures sensory qualities of pain using 11 sensory and 4 affective qualities related to pain. Each qualitative pain descriptor is then rated on the 4-point pain intensity scale and added for the final score. SF-MPQ subscales have been successfully used to measure treatment responses in vulvodynia [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Secondary outcome measures include changes in pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) measured at the vaginal vestibule, levator ani muscles, and remote body sites. The vaginal vestibule PPTs will be determined using a cotton swab applied to 3 externally-accessed sites (2 and 10 oâ€™clock on the upper vestibule and 6 oâ€™clock on the lower vestibule). Levator muscle complex PPTs will be determined by applying the algometer internally to the right, midline, and left puborectalis levator muscles sites (5, 6, and 7 oâ€™clock). Remote Body PPTs will be determined by applying the Wagner FPXTM algometer to 3 â€˜neutralâ€™ non-pelvic body sites (deltoid, shin, and trapezius), right and left, and calculating a composite score.</p>

                    <title>Expected outcomes</title>
                    <p>(1) For women with VBD-p, peripheral lidocaine/oestradiol treatment will be more effective than placebo or nortriptyline in reducing numeric pain ratings on the tampon test, perceived pain on the SF-MPQ, and pelvic PPTs on the algometer test at week 8 and week 16. (2) For women with VBD-c, centrally-targeted nortriptyline treatment will be more effective than placebo or lidocaine/oestradiol in reducing numeric pain ratings on the tampon test, perceived pain on the SF-MPQ, and pelvic/remote bodily PPTs on the algometer test at week 16. (3) For women with VBD-c, combined peripheral and centrally-targeted treatments will be most effective in reducing pain on primary and secondary outcome measures at week 16. (4) The two VBD subtypes will exhibit differential responses to treatment withdrawal at week 16, such that at the week 24 visit women with VBD-c will exhibit increases in pain after treatment withdrawal compared to women with VBD-p.</p>

                  <p>Primary outcome measures include the net change in perceived sexual health measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Brief Profile Sexual Function and Satisfaction Female (PROMIS BPSFS-F) and perceived physical and mental health measured using the Short form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) at 16â€‰weeks. The PROMIS BPSFS-F (is a 15-item form developed by the NIH that measures 11 domains of biopsychosocial function and includes an assessment of sexual function measures related to intercourse [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These data are used to calculate four subdomain scores (global satisfaction with sex life, interest in sexual activity, lubrication, and vaginal discomfort) which are the primary endpoints. The PROMIS has been used to reliably assess sexual dysfunction associated with chronic pelvic pain [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The SF-12v2 assesses 8 domains: physical functioning, physical roles, bodily pain, global health, vitality, social functioning, emotional roles and mental health using an algorithm based on answers to 12 mental and physical health-related questions [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These data are used to calculate two summary component scores (a physical score and a mental health score) which are the endpoints. The SF12v2 has demonstrated good reliability and validity [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and used to assess physical and mental health in women with vestibulodynia [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Secondary outcome measures include net changes in perceived mood and health using 1) Symptom Check List 27 (SCL-27) 2) Pennebaker Index of Limbic Languidness (PILL), 3) Perceived stress scale (PSS), and 4) Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-Sleep) at 16â€‰weeks; as well as patient reported outcomes at 8 and 24â€‰weeks. The SCL-27 measures six dimensions of psychological symptoms (depressive, dysthymic, vegetative, agoraphobic, social phobia, and mistrust) which are the endpoints. It is well studied with high reliability and strong correlations to pain and has been validated in chronic pain patients [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The PILL is used to create a summary score of somatic symptoms (e.g. itchy eyes, dizziness). Symptom frequency is recorded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from â€˜neverâ€™ to â€˜more than once a weekâ€™ [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. PILL scores are highly correlated with pain severity in individuals with chronic pelvic pain and COPCs [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The PSS is a 10-item scale that measures the impact of personal stress on thoughts and feelings [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Participants will complete the PSS-10 on a Likert scale with categories ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very often) and total scores (reverse-scoring Items 4, 5, 7, and 8) are summed 10 items for a final score. PSS has good consistency and reliability with a Cronbachâ€™s alpha of 0.78. The MOS-Sleep is a 12-item scale that measures amount of sleep and ease/difficulty of initiating and maintaining sleep [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The MOS-Sleep has high internal reliability [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and has been successfully used to determine sleep outcomes for patients with FMS [<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Primary outcome measures include vaginal and systemic cytokine levels and vaginal and systemic microRNA levels at 16â€‰weeks. Cytokine expression levels will be measured in vaginal lavage samples and plasma isolated from whole blood. We will use a standard Human MesoScale Discovery multiplex kit to measure 36 inflammatory mediators (4 tier-1 and 32 tier-2). Tier-1 mediators include the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47â€“49</xref>], IL-8 [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and IL-17 [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These cytokines were selected based on previous associations with VBD case status and symptom severity. Tier-2 mediators include cytokines (e.g. interleukin 6; IL-6), chemokines (e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; MCP1), and growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF) that are involved in peripheral and central sensitization, inflammation, and chronic pain [<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. miRNA expression levels will be measured in vaginal swab samples and blood. RNA will be isolated and then shipped to University of Texas Health Genome Sequencing Facility for small RNA library preparation and sequencing.</p>
                  <p>Secondary outcome measures will be the collection and reporting of cytokine and microRNA levels at 8â€‰weeks and 24â€‰weeks. We will also identify cytokine and microRNA biomarkers at baseline that predict treatment response at 8, 16, and 24â€‰weeks. We hypothesize that these biomarkers may serve as intermediate phenotypes for treatment success in VBD patient subgroups.</p>

                  <title>VBD subtype designation</title>
                  <p>Women with VBD-c will be distinguished from those with VBD-p based on the presence of a COPC. The Institute of Medicineâ€™s 2011 report, Relieving Pain in America, identified 9 COPCs that predominantly affect women and frequently co-occur with VBD [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The presence of a COPC will be determined using the COPC survey. This is an easy-to-complete form including modules with check-box questions and a body mannequin to determine the presence of 9 COPCs: (1) FMS, (2) TMD, (3) back pain, (4) IBS, (5) chronic tension-type headache, (6) chronic migraine, and (7) chronic fatigue syndrome, (8) endometriosis, and (9) interstitial cystitis. Women with VBD and no COPCs will be designated as VBD-p, while women with VBD and â‰¥1 COPC will be designated as VBD-c. These criteria will be used as a primary method to distinguish between VBD-p and VBD-c in this study.</p>
                  <p>We, however, acknowledge that the criteria to distinguish VBD subtypes needs further exploration. In particular, it is possible that the optimal cut-off for VBD-c requires more than one COPC to be present. Therefore, as a secondary method to characterize VBD subtypes, we will calculate a continuous COPC â€˜centralnessâ€™ score defined as the number of COPCs present ranging from 0 to 9. This continuous COPC score will be used to identify the optimal cut-off value between VBD-p and VBD-c in terms of treatment response.</p>
                  <p>To further characterize the two VBD subtypes, we will also measure generalized pain at â€˜neutralâ€™ non-pelvic sites using a quantitative sensory testing approach designed by Dr. Gracely and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The neutral sites are remote from the pelvic region and not used for diagnosing other pain conditions, but reflect an individualâ€™s overall pressure pain sensitivity [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56â€“59</xref>]. An algometer will be applied to 3 neutral sites (deltoid muscle, trapezius, and shin), with continuously ascending pressure at a rate of 1â€‰kg/s to a maximum of 10â€‰kg. Participants will indicate when the evoked sensation first becomes painful. A composite pressure pain threshold (PPT) score will be compared between VBD-c and VBD-p subgroups using ANCOVA. We would expect women with VBD-p to have higher PPT scores (less pain) and women with VBD-c to have lower scores (more pain) at these sites.</p>

                  <title>Estimation of power and sample size</title>
                  <p>We are planning to enroll 400 women with VBD, with an estimated attrition rate of 20%. Of note, Salaffi and colleagues found that vulvar pain measured on a 0-10 NRS has standard deviation 2.0 and that 2 points on a 0â€“10 NRS correspond to a clinically meaningful difference in pain severity [<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Using these results and assuming the within-subject correlation of 0.5, at a significance level of 0.05, the proposed sample size will provide sufficient power of at least 0.80 to detect differences as small as 0.82 on a 0â€“10 scale for the overall treatment main effects (3 arms) vs. placebo. To test each individual treatment effect vs. placebo, at a significance level of 0.0167 (Bonferroni-corrected for 3 arms), the proposed sample size can detect differences as small as 0.98 on a 0-10 scale. At a significance level of 0.05, the proposed sample size can detect differences as small as 1.35 and 1.20 on a 0â€“10 scale for the interaction effect of treatment and each VBD-subtype, given possible splits of 40/60, 50/50, or 60/40.</p>
                  <p>To calculate power for research question IIIa, we used data from our previous study of biomarkers in VBD patients [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Conservatively assuming that VBD-c patients represent 60% (192/320) of the sample and VBD-p patients represent 40% (128/320) of the sample, and adjusting the significance threshold for 4 tier 1 cytokine tests, we will be able to detect mean differences of at least 0.4 SD with the power of 0.84 or greater using a t-test. For IL-8, 0.4 SD translates to approximately 2â€‰pg/mL, and for IL-1ra 0.4 SD translates to 240â€‰pg/mL of the minimal detectable difference. Of note, the mean differences between controls and VBD patients for IL-8 and IL-1ra in our previous study were 4â€‰pg/mL and 300â€‰pg/mL, respectively. Thus, we have sufficient power to detect plausible differences in cytokine levels between the VBD subgroups. A P value of less than 5% will be regarded as significant.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Vestibulodynia is a common vulvar pain disorder that affects millions of women each year and remains ineffectively treated [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While numerous studies highlight the heterogeneity of VBD, women are commonly grouped together for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of therapies that might preferentially only benefit a specific subset. Thus, we will conduct this multicenter RCT to determine the efficacy of peripheral, centrally-targeted, and combined treatments in alleviating pain among women with distinct VBD subtypes. Further, we will evaluate the validity of clinical and biological factors in predicting treatment responses. We hope these findings will inform more streamlined approaches to the treatment of VBD.</p>
              <p>This will be the first multi-centre RCT to compare the efficacy of separate or combined treatments for VBD. The two-by-two factorial study design offers advantages over standard RCTs, including the ability to compare multiple interventions with good statistical power and to detect interactions among interventions [<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Inclusion of placebo controls for the topical lidocaineâ€‰+â€‰oestradiol compound cream, nortriptyline pills, and combined treatments will add rigour to interpretation of findings and allow us to evaluate potential placebo effects. Finally, leveraging resources at multiple sites should lend to faster recruitment rates, a more heterogeneous patient population, and more generalizable results.</p>
              <p>This trial has utilized state-of-the-art technology for the development of electronic systems for data management. Use of eCRFs that capture participant responses as well as clinical and biological data will avoid transcription error and thus improve accuracy by using field constraints to limit entry errors. In comparison to paper forms, such electronic systems will be more secure, efficient, and permit real-time data verification, monitoring, and scoring [<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
              <p>In addition to the rigorous study design, this trial uses an innovative approach to identify biological mediators in both local vaginal and circulating blood samples collected at multiple time points (prior to, during, and following treatment). Biomarkers are objective indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or response to treatments. Biomarkers are routinely used for the diagnosis, treatment, and risk management for many prevalent health conditions. Tests using miRNA biomarkers are now commercially available for diagnosis of cancers [<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Work by our lab and others has identified local and circulating cytokines and miRNAs associated with VBD subtypes, pain, and perceived health [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Through this clinical trial, we hope to identify unique cytokine and miRNA biomarkers in vaginal versus systemic blood tissues that predict responses to different treatments among women with VBD-p versus VBD-c subtypes. In addition, we will create a biorepository of additional blood, plasma, and vaginal lavage samples for future analyses.</p>
              <p>Despite these strengths, we also anticipate some limitations related to enrollment, retention, and adherence to medication protocols. With any large RCT, recruitment can be a challenge. It is estimated that nearly 20% of trials close without meeting accrual goals [<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In anticipation of this challenge, we estimated an attrition rate of 20% in our power analysis. Another challenge is adherence to medication protocols. Some women may not take the study cream or pill consistently. Also, some women may not be able to tolerate the side-effects of the topical cream or oral pill. Further there may be entry errors on the participant medication diary. We will verify actual medication usage by performing pill counts and weighing the cream.</p>
              <p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen this number rise with important social distancing practices in place. In fact, both UCLA and UNC sites were required to pause recruitment and enrollment for a 4-month period from March - June 2020. During this time, we were able to successfully implement televisits for participants already enrolled. These visits included a virtual review of surveys, collection of dependent variables using shipped materials (e.g. standardized tampons for the tampon test), and distribution of study medication kits by mail.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, we may find that there is no significant treatment effect of either the cream or pill for one or both VBD subtypes. Such negative findings are equally valuable, however, as they would inform pain management strategies that do not waste patientâ€™s time with ineffective treatments. Finally, it is important to note that while the 3-month duration of pain is used for VBD classification purposes, it is not recommended to delay treatment in women not enrolling in this study who present to healthcare providers with less than 3â€‰months of symptoms.</p>
