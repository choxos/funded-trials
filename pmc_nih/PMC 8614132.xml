                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions such as gout, a debilitating form of arthritis that requires daily medication to prevent flares, is a costly problem. Existing interventions to improve medication adherence have only been moderately effective. Habit formation theory is a promising strategy to improve adherence. The cue-reward-repetition principle posits that habits are formed by repeatedly completing an activity after the same cue and having the action rewarded every time. Over time, cues become increasingly important whereas rewards become less salient because the action becomes automatic. Leveraging the cue-reward-repetition principle could improve adherence to daily gout medications.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial tests an adaptive intervention that leverages the repetition cue-reward principle. The trial will began recruitment in August 2021 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Eligible patients are adults with gout who have been prescribed a daily oral medication for gout and whose most recent uric acid is above 6 mg/dL. Participants will be randomised to one of three arms and given electronic pill bottles. In the two intervention arms, participants will select a daily activity to link to their medication-taking (cue) and a charity to which money will be donated every time they take their medication (reward). Participants in Arm 1 will receive reminder texts about their cue and their charity reward amount will be US$0.50 per day of medication taken. Arm 2 will be adaptive; participants will receive a US$0.25 per adherent-day and no reminder texts. If their adherence is &lt;75% 6 weeks postrandomisation, their reward will increase to US$0.50 per adherent-day and they will receive reminder texts. The primary outcome is adherence to gout medications over 18 weeks.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Non-adherence to evidence-based prescription medications results in preventable morbidity and mortality for middle-aged and older adults.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> Studies have consistently shown that among patients with chronic illnesses, 50% of medications are not taken as prescribed.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5</xref> For patients who have gout, the most common chronic inflammatory arthritis in the USA,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> poor adherence to urate lowering therapy (ULT) is a key reason why patients fail to reach treatment goals and have debilitating arthritis flares.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Barriers to adherence are numerous, and include cost, unwanted side effects, and forgetfulness among many others.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Interventions to improve adherence have focused on increasing knowledge about the importance of medications<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> or motivation to take medications.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Unfortunately, even the most successful of these approaches have been only modestly effective and positive results are generally only seen over the short term.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref></p>
              <p>One promising strategy to increase medication adherence in significant and sustainable ways is approaching medication-taking as a daily habit.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Taking a medication every day is similar to other repetitive behaviours that must be performed consistently, such as brushing one’s teeth every morning or washing one’s hands after using the bathroom. In these cases, people who consistently act in healthy ways do so out of habit.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> The repetition-cue-reward model proposes that habit formation has three central components: behavioural repetition, associated context cues, and rewards.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Under this model, habits are formed by completing an activity in contiguity with a particular cue, and having the action rewarded. When this sequence is repeated, cues become increasingly important, whereas rewards become increasingly less salient because a level of automaticity has been reached. Once habits are formed, they guide actual behaviour rather than intention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> For example, eating habits are stronger determinants of food choices than eating intentions or susceptibility to eating temptations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>Accordingly, principles of habit formation have the potential to improve medication adherence by transforming the act of medication-taking into an automatic action. Therefore, we propose a randomised controlled trial that aims to identify whether an intervention targeting habit formation using the cue-reward repetition model has the potential to improve adherence to chronic, daily ULT in patients with gout.</p>

                <p>We will enrol patients who are currently receiving gout care at a rheumatology or primary care practice affiliated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a large academic medical centre in Boston, Massachusetts, USA caring for over 4000 patients with gout every year. Potentially eligible participants are individuals who are at least 18 years old with gout, who receive a stable dose of oral ULT, and whose most recent uric acid level within the last 6 months is &gt;6 mg/dL (target therapeutic level while on ULT is &lt;6). Eligible patients must also have a smartphone with a data plan or WiFi at home and be willing to use electronic pill bottles for their gout medications for the duration of the study. These criteria were chosen because the use of electronic pill bottles requires smartphone connectivity to record adherence. Finally, because the intervention is currently only available in the English language, participants will be required to have a basic working knowledge of English. Patients will be excluded if they are currently pregnant.</p>

                <p>Due to social distancing restrictions put in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will screen and recruit participants remotely (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). We will identify eligible participants using electronic health record (EHR) data. For patients identified through the EHR, we will first contact the patients’ rheumatologist or primary care physician for their approval to approach the patient. If the provider does not opt out an identified patient, the patient will be sent a letter with information about the study inviting them to participate. One week later, patients will be contacted by phone to ask about their interest in the study and to confirm eligibility. If patients agree to participate, they will provide electronic written informed consent for all study procedures, including the use of text messages, and complete baseline questionnaires using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> a secure web-based data collection tool.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> This paperless consent process was approved by our Institutional Review Board. At the end of the enrolment visit, they will be randomised to one of three arms. All participants will then be mailed up to two electronic pill bottles manufactured by Pillsy along with written instructions for setup. Participants in the intervention arm will also be given a guide to assist them in selecting a cue (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Participants in the first intervention arm will choose a lifestyle ‘cue’ and receive a reward over a 12-week period. The cue will be selected by each participant through a goal-setting exercise during which they will identify the activity they want to link to their medication-taking (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>). For example, a participant who takes their medication in the morning may elect to link tooth brushing with medication-taking. Participants will select their cue assited by study staff during the device set up call. If adherence falls below 75%, for the prior 4 days, participants will receive a text message reminding them of the cue they decided to link to their medication-taking (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>).</p>

                  <p>The ‘reward’ will consist of a charitable donation every time the participant takes their medication. Participants will choose a charity during the enrolment visit, in specific a local animal shelter, a local food bank, or UNICEF. To clearly link the reward to the act of medication-taking, a sticker with the charity logo will be placed under the patient’s pill bottle cap prior to mailing it to the participant so that they are reminded of the donation every time they take their medication (see <xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 3</xref>). Every day that the participant takes their medication as prescribed, US$0.50 will be donated to their charity of choice. Participants will receive texts every 4 days summarising how much money was donated on their behalf and the potential impact of their donation (see <xref rid="SP4" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 4</xref>). For example, participants who chose the local food bank as their charity could receive a text message that states ‘By taking your medication, you helped people struggling with hunger. Thanks to you, the Greater Boston Area Food Bank has been able to prepare eight free meals.’</p>

                  <p>To determine the amount of the reward and whether a text reminder about the cue needs to be sent, adherence from the prior 4 days will be calculated by dividing the number of times a patient opened the pill bottle by the number of doses expected to be taken over 4 days. For patients on more than one medication, the values for each medication are averaged. Adherence values will range from 0% to 100%. To avoid erroneously classifying repeated bottle openings over a short period of time as multiple unique medication-taking events, we only count a maximum of 1 opening event per 3-hour period; opening events more than 3 hours apart are classified as separate doses.</p>

Data from the bottles are transferred via Bluetooth to a mobile application on the participant’s cell phone. Data from this mobile application are accessible to the research team in near real-time through a cloud-based portal. The set up required for these devices is minimal. Several studies have shown that electronic pill bottles represent a more reliable and accurate method of adherence measurement than self-report.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Despite this, monitoring does have theoretical potential to influence adherence itself. To minimise this bias, any added functionality that these devices offer (e.g., alerts when doses are due) will be disabled.

We will use the uric acid level value available in the EHR closest to each participant’s end of follow-up date to calculate change in uric acid level.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>A habit is an action that is triggered automatically in response to a contextual cue. For example, getting into a car can be the contextual cue for the action of putting on a seatbelt. Once habits are formed, conscious attention to the action diminishes as automaticity takes over. Habit formation theory is a promising strategy to improve medication adherence, as medication-taking is a daily repetitive behaviour that could be associated to contextual cues through the cue-reward-repetition model. We propose this trial to test the impact of a habit formation intervention on adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients who suffer from gout. ULT are chronic daily medications that do not provide immediate symptom relief but rather reduce the likelihood of debilitating flares of inflammatory arthritis caused by gout, if taken consistently, as prescribed.</p>
              <p>Habit formation theory has already had practical implications for health promotion. For example, a randomised controlled trial of a low-intensity habit formation intervention for weight control led to increased weight loss maintained over time.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We hypothesise that creating a system of cues and rewards for patients can increase automaticity of medication-taking and improve adherence to oral medications intended for daily use. We anticipate that this study will also help reduce gout flares.</p>
              <p>There are a few limitations to this study. First, we will enrol patients who have access to a cell phone. While cell phone usage is almost ubiquitous in the USA,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> there are still individuals without one who would not be able to participate, which may limit the generalisability of the study. Second, while we will measure adherence outcomes after the intervention has been removed for 6 weeks, we will be measuring short-term outcomes and are therefore unable to understand the long-term effects of our intervention. Finally, the use of electronic pill bottles and frequent text messages may result in a Hawthorne effect, although we expect the effect to decrease over time and be non-differential across groups. Similarly, while patients in the control group may already have a cue in place that triggers medication-taking, we expect that most patients enrolled will be non-adherent as we are requiring an elevated uric acid, which may suggest suboptimal ULT use. Randomisation will also limit any bias.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this trial will evaluate the impact of an individually-tailored habit formation intervention to improve adherence to daily medications for patients who suffer from gout. If the intervention is effective, this strategy could be tested in and scaled to other diseases, clinical environments, and health behaviours.</p>

              <p>This protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. No data monitoring committee was deemed necessary by the human subjects’ oversight boards. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Data analysts at the end of the study will be blinded to arm assignment; however, patients are not blinded due to the nature of the interventions. The findings from this work will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and publicly accessible.</p>
