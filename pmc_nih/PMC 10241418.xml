                  <p>The proportion of participants experiencing at least one AE post-PCV was 78.8% in the V114 group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 203) and 69.6% in the PCV13 group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 204); respective proportions post-PPSV23 were 75.4% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 203) and 77.2% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 202). There were no vaccine-related serious AEs. IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) were generally comparable between V114 and PCV13 for shared serotypes at Day 30, and were higher for V114 compared with PCV13 for the additional V114 serotypes 22F and 33F. Approximately 30 days after PPSV23, IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were generally comparable between the V114 and PCV13 groups for all 15 serotypes in V114.</p>

              <p>Children with HIV (CWH) are at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), with an incidence &gt;40-fold higher than children without HIV [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with reduced risk; however, the incidence remains several-fold higher than in children without HIV [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in infants has reduced the overall burden of IPD caused by vaccine serotypes, incidence due to non-vaccine serotypes has increased, and a residual burden remains from certain vaccine serotypes, including serotype 3 [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, CWH remain at increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to IPD compared with children without HIV in the PCV era [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>In CWH 6–18 years of age in the United States, guidelines recommend one dose of 13-valent PCV (PCV13), followed by one dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) ≥8 weeks later, with re-immunization with PPSV23 approximately 5 years after the first PPSV23 dose [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A sequential strategy with PCV13 followed by PPSV23 is also recommended in other countries [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The initial conjugated vaccine stimulates a T-cell-dependent immune response [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and establishment of immune memory [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and the PPSV23 vaccine allows for broader serotype coverage.</p>
              <p>V114 (VAXNEUVANCE, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey, USA) is a 15-valent PCV containing serotypes 22F and 33F in addition to the 13 serotypes in PCV13 [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since the introduction of PCVs, serotypes 22F and 33F have emerged as globally important pneumococcal serotypes that contribute to the residual IPD burden in children. Both serotypes have high invasive disease potential [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and serotype 33F is associated with multidrug resistance [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In children under 5 years of age, serotypes 22F and 33F cause 3% and 4%, respectively, of IPD cases globally and 8–13% and 9–10% of IPD cases, respectively, in the United States [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>V114 is approved for the prevention of IPD in adults at least 18 years of age and children in the United States, Canada, and Europe [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and was previously studied in adults with HIV [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We report results from a phase 3 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114, followed by PPSV23 8 weeks later, in CWH.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, descriptive study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114, followed by PPSV23 approximately 8 weeks later, in CWH 6–17 years of age (Protocol V114-030; NCT03921424; EudraCT 2019-000341-12). The study was conducted from November 2019 to May 2021 in South Africa, Thailand, and Ukraine (Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content).</p>
                <p>Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a single dose of PPSV23 at Week 8. Randomization was stratified by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count (≥200 to &lt;500, and ≥500 cells/μl).</p>
                <p>The study used central randomization implemented using an interactive response technology system. Vaccines were prepared and/or dispensed by unblinded study personnel who were not involved in any subsequent participant safety or immunogenicity assessments. V114 and PCV13 were administered in a blinded fashion and PPSV23 was administered open-label. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and was approved by Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees of participating sites. An external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) conducted periodic reviews of safety and tolerability data. A Scientific Advisory Committee composed of sponsor and non-sponsor scientists contributed to the development of the protocol, formulation of the statistical analysis plan, data analysis, interpretation of the data, and authoring of this manuscript.</p>

                <title>Vaccines and administration</title>
                <p>V114 is a 15-valent PCV containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9 V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F, 22F, and 33F, all conjugated to CRM<sub>197</sub> carrier protein and adjuvanted with 125 μg aluminum phosphate. PCV13 (Prevnar 13; Wyeth LLC, marketed by Pfizer, New York, New York, USA) is a 13-valent PCV containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, all conjugated to CRM<sub>197</sub> carrier protein and adjuvanted with 125 μg aluminum phosphate. PPSV23 (PNEUMOVAX23; Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey, USA) is an unadjuvanted 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Each dose contains 25 μg of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F.</p>
                <p>V114 and PCV13 were supplied as sterile suspensions and PPSV23 was supplied as a sterile solution. All vaccines were supplied in prefilled syringes and stored at 2–8°C. They were all administered intramuscularly as 0.5 ml doses.</p>

                <title>Safety assessments</title>
                <p>Participants or their legally acceptable representatives recorded post-vaccination complaints using electronic vaccination report cards, which were subsequently assessed by study investigators to determine whether they met protocol-defined adverse event (AE) criteria. Participants were prompted to record specific injection-site complaints (injection-site tenderness/pain, injection-site swelling, injection-site hard lump/induration, and injection-site redness/erythema), and specific systemic complaints (muscle pain/myalgia, joint pain/arthralgia, headache, tiredness/fatigue, and hives or welts/urticaria), occurring from Days 1–14 after vaccination. All injection-site AEs were considered related to study vaccines. For systemic AEs, relatedness to study vaccine was assessed by the investigator.</p>
                <p>Body temperature was measured on Days 1–7 post-vaccination (and on Days 8–14 if fever was suspected). Participants were also followed for non-solicited AEs from Days 1–14 post-vaccination. Serious AEs (SAEs), regardless of whether they were considered related to the vaccine by investigators, were collected from time of signed consent through to end of study (approximately 6 months after first vaccination).</p>
                <p>All solicited and non-solicited AEs were assessed by investigators for intensity. For injection-site erythema, injection-site induration, and injection-site swelling, intensity was assigned according to size: mild events were those measuring &gt;0 to ≤1 in. (∼2.5 cm), moderate events were &gt;1 to ≤3 in. (∼7.5 cm), and severe events were &gt;3 in.</p>

                <p>Serum samples were drawn pre-vaccination with PCV on Day 1, at 30 days post-vaccination with PCV (Day 30), and at 30 days post-vaccination with PPSV23 (Week 12). Functional antibodies were measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) using a validated microcolony multiplexed opsonophagocytic assay [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Serotype-specific pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were evaluated using a validated electrochemiluminescence assay [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

                  <p>The study aimed to randomize 400 participants overall (200 per vaccination group). It was assumed that at least 160 participants (based on an 80% evaluability rate) per vaccination group would be sufficient to provide a meaningful and descriptive assessment of the safety and immunogenicity profiles of V114 in this important population.</p>

                  <title>Safety endpoints and statistical methods</title>
                  <p>Safety endpoints were summarized via descriptive statistics, and no formal statistical comparisons were planned between vaccination groups. The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of V114 with respect to the proportion of participants with AEs. The secondary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PPSV23 administered 8 weeks after V114 with respect to the proportion of participants with AEs. Safety endpoints included proportions of participants with solicited injection-site and systemic AEs from Days 1–14 following each vaccination, and vaccine-related SAEs through to study completion.</p>
                  <p>Point estimates and within-group 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for each vaccination group for the proportion of participants with solicited injection-site and solicited systemic AEs, and broad AE categories consisting of the proportion with any AE, any vaccine-related AE, any SAE, any vaccine-related SAE, discontinuation due to an AE, and death, using the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], without multiplicity adjustments. Subgroup analyses of post-PCV safety endpoints by age (6–9 years, 10–14 years, and 15–17 years of age), sex (male and female), race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Multiple, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and White), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino and not Hispanic or Latino), CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count at screening (≥200 to &lt;500 cells/μl and ≥500 cells/μl), prior PCV status (prior PCV and PCV-naive), and prior PPSV23 status (prior PPSV23 and PPSV23-naive), were performed for those subgroups with sample size ≥5% of the number of randomized participants in each vaccination group.</p>

                  <title>Immunogenicity endpoints and statistical methods</title>
                  <p>Immunogenicity endpoints were summarized via descriptive statistics and no formal statistical comparisons were planned between vaccination groups. The primary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for all 15 serotypes included in V114 at 30 days post-vaccination with V114 or PCV13 (Day 30) by vaccination group. Secondary immunogenicity endpoints were to evaluate serotype-specific OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 30 days post-vaccination with V114 or PCV13 and serotype-specific IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at 30 days post-PPSV23 (Week 12) by vaccination group. Exploratory objectives included evaluation of serotype-specific geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) from Day 1 to Day 30 (pre-vaccination and post-vaccination with PCV) for both OPA and IgG responses by vaccination group. A post hoc analysis was performed to summarize the proportion of participants with an at least four-fold rise in serotype-specific IgG concentrations and OPA titers from Day 1 to Day 30 by vaccination group.</p>
                  <p>Point estimates of serotype-specific IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at Day 30 and Week 12 (and corresponding 95% CIs) were provided for each vaccination group. Point estimates were calculated by exponentiating the estimates of the mean of the natural log values. Within-group CIs were derived by exponentiating the CIs of the mean of the natural log values based on the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distribution. Point estimates of serotype-specific GMFRs and associated 95% CIs were calculated based on the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distribution of natural log-transformed fold rise. Evaluation of the proportions of participants with an at least four-fold rise in serotype-specific IgG concentrations and OPA titers included point estimates and within-group 95% CIs (based on the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) for each vaccination group. Subgroup analyses (point estimates and within-group 95% CIs) of serotype-specific IgG GMCs at Day 30 used the same subgroup categories and sample size rule described above for safety subgroup analyses. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA), of the SAS System for Unix.</p>

                <p>Following PCV vaccination, 78.8% of participants in the V114 group and 69.6% in the PCV13 group experienced at least one AE, and 78.3% and 67.2%, respectively, experienced at least one vaccine-related AE (Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content).</p>
                <p>In both groups, the most commonly reported AEs were those solicited in the trial, including injection-site pain, injection-site swelling, and myalgia. The proportions of participants with solicited injection-site and systemic AEs were generally comparable between groups following vaccination with V114 or PCV13. The majority of solicited injection-site and systemic AEs reported after PCV vaccination had a maximum intensity of mild (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and a maximum duration of ≤3 days (Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content).</p>

The height of the stacked bar represents the total percentage of participants reporting the AE.

                <p>One participant in each group experienced an SAE (abnormal uterine bleeding in a recipient of V114 and retinal detachment in a recipient of PCV13), but neither event was considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccines. The majority (&gt;94%) of participants in both groups had a maximum body temperature of &lt;38.0°C (100.4 °F) (data not shown). One participant discontinued study intervention (did not receive PPSV23) due to vaccine-related AEs of injection-site erythema, injection-site induration, and injection-site swelling following PCV13 administration.</p>

The most commonly reported AEs after PPSV23 vaccination in both groups were injection-site pain, injection-site swelling, and myalgia. The proportions of participants with solicited injection-site and systemic AEs were generally comparable between groups following vaccination with PPSV23, with the exception of injection-site swelling, which was reported by a larger proportion of participants in the V114 group (47.3%) than the PCV13 group (34.7%). The majority of solicited injection-site and systemic AEs after PPSV23 vaccination had a maximum intensity of mild or moderate (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and a maximum duration of at most 3 days (data not shown). Two participants in each group experienced SAEs after PPSV23 vaccination (gastrointestinal inflammation and Hodgkin's disease in the V114 group and infectious diarrhea and suicidal ideation in the PCV13 group), none of which were considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccination.

              <p>In CWH 6–17 years of age, V114 was generally well tolerated and induced immune responses for all 15 serotypes in the vaccine, as assessed by serotype-specific IgG and OPA antibody responses at 30 days post-vaccination. Immune responses were comparable between V114 and PCV13 recipients for the 13 shared serotypes and higher with V114 for serotypes 22F and 33F. Sequential administration of PPSV23 administered 8 weeks after V114 or PCV13 was well tolerated and immune responses were comparable between groups for the 15 serotypes in V114. These findings show that V114 has the potential to protect against disease caused by the 13 serotypes in PCV13 and against the two additional serotypes in V114. As part of a sequential regimen that includes PPSV23, V114 provides earlier coverage against serotypes 22F and 33F than PCV13. Whilst it may be predicted that the quality of the immune response to 22F and 33F after PPSV23 differs between the two arms, with the establishment of immune memory in the V114 arm [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], this study was not designed to demonstrate these differences. The benefit of V114 may be further realized in the many parts of the world where PPSV23 is not routinely given to CWH, who are at increased risk of IPD [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Following vaccination with V114, the proportion of participants who reported at least one AE was generally comparable with the PCV13 group. The most common AEs following receipt of V114 were injection-site pain, injection-site swelling, and myalgia; there were no V114-related SAEs. These safety and tolerability profiles of V114 in CWH are generally consistent with those observed in other populations of similar age, either as a catch-up regimen in healthy children [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], or as a single dose in children with sickle cell disease [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Antibody responses post-PPSV23 were comparable in both vaccination groups for all 15 serotypes in V114 and generally similar to those observed at 30 days post-PCV vaccination for the serotypes in the respective PCVs. Consistent with prior studies of sequential V114 and PPSV23 vaccination, the similarity of responses between groups for serotypes 22F and 33F post-PPSV23 is likely due to the fact that, prior to PPSV23 administration, participants who received V114 already had higher levels of antibodies to these serotypes than those who received PCV13 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Prior studies of individuals with HIV show that PPSV23 can elicit a similar antibody response to PCVs in persons naive to PPSV23 serotypes [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further studies would be required to determine whether longer intervals between V114 and PPSV23 could lead to higher immune responses to serotypes 22F and 33F post-PPSV23. The optimal interval must balance the potential for higher immune responses to shared serotypes with earlier provision of broader serotype coverage.</p>
              <p>Participants with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count ≥200 to &lt;500 cells/μl at screening in both vaccination groups had generally lower serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days post-PCV compared with those with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count ≥500 cells/μl and compared with the overall study population. The number of participants in the lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell stratum in our study was small; however, findings are consistent with trends observed in adults with HIV [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similar correlations have also been observed among CWH in some studies evaluating other vaccines [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count has been shown to be a predictor of immunologic memory in children after vaccination with a sequential PCV and PPSV23 series [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>There are some limitations to this study. Approximately 7% of participants had previously received a PCV. The effect of this prior vaccine exposure on our findings cannot be fully determined; however, given that the overall proportion of participants with a prior PCV was small, it is unlikely to have had a substantial impact. Underestimation of the frequency of previous PCV receipt is possible; however, prior receipt was determined by participant medical records and known country practices, and any inaccuracies are expected to be small. Immunogenicity of the PCV and PPSV23 sequential series was not evaluated beyond 12 weeks post-PCV and 30 days post-PPSV23 vaccination; thus, additional studies would be needed to fully understand the long-term persistence of antibody responses. Immune responses to serotypes unique to PPSV23 were not measured. Only participants with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of ≥200 cells/μl at screening were included, and results may not be extrapolatable to CWH with lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts. Lower immunogenicity to vaccines has been observed in persons with detectable viral loads compared with those with undetectable viral loads [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This study was not stratified according to baseline viral load; however, the study was randomized and the majority of participants were on antiretrovirals, with CD4<sup>+</sup> counts ≥500 cells/μl and undetectable HIV viral loads at baseline. Thus, any effect that viral load may have had on the study outcomes would be expected to be minor. This study is limited in scope to safety and immunogenicity; as immune correlates of protection are not well established in this population, real-world evidence is required to demonstrate vaccine effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>In CWH 6–17 years of age, V114 is generally well tolerated and induces immune responses for all 15 pneumococcal serotypes, as assessed by IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at 30 days post-vaccination. PPSV23 is well tolerated when given approximately 8 weeks after V114. These results support the use of V114 in CWH for prevention of pneumococcal disease.</p>
