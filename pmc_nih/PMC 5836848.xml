              <abstract>
                <p>High‚Äêresolution measurement of medication adherence is essential to personalized drug therapy. A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‚Äêcleared device, using an edible ingestion sensor (IS), external wearable patch, and paired mobile device can detect and record ingestion events. Oral medications must be combined with an IS to generate precise ‚Äúdigitized‚Äêmedication‚Äù ingestion records. We developed a Good Manufacturing Practice protocol to repackage oral medications with the IS within certified Capsugel capsules, termed co‚Äêencapsulation (CoE). A randomized bioequivalence study of CoE‚ÄêIS‚ÄêRifamate (Isoniazid/Rifampin 150/300 mg) vs. native‚ÄêRifamate was conducted in 12 patients with active <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and demonstrated bioequivalence using the population method ratio test (95% confidence interval). Subsequently, CoE‚ÄêIS‚Äêmedications across all biopharmaceutical classes underwent <italic>in vitro</italic> dissolution testing utilizing USP and FDA guidelines. CoE‚ÄêIS medications tested met USP dissolution specifications and were equivalent to their native formulations. CoE combines oral medications with the IS without altering the quality of the native formulation, generating ‚Äúdigitized‚Äù medications for remote capture of dosing histories.</p>

              <p>A major obstacle in precision medication management has been the difficulty in accurately generating precise, detailed dosing histories based on medication ingestion. The current standard approach in clinical use, primarily for patients with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), is directly observed therapy (DOT), where a healthcare worker watches a patient swallow each dose of medication. DOT is expensive, difficult to carry out, and thus rarely correctly implemented. Even this method does not guarantee actual ingestion has taken place, as patients may hide pills in their mouth.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Alternative approaches, including patient questionnaires, pill counts, and prescription refill rates used as methods for assessing adherence have been shown to be biased, and furthermore lack details of the dosing history.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Electronic monitoring methods, such as the medication event monitoring system (MEMS) that relies on the opening of a cap with a microswitch and memory chip on a medication container as a proxy measure of ingestion, emerged in the 1980s.

              <p>A novel sensor platform to monitor actual medication ingestion (Proteus Digital Health, Redwood City, CA) presents the opportunity to capture medication ingestion and analyze and support medication adherence in a manner conducive to personalized medicine. We term the system a Digital Health Feedback System or DHFS. The DHFS allows for the date‚Äê and time‚Äêstamping of actual ingestions of oral medications rather than surrogate measures of ingestion. This system consists of an ingestion sensor, ‚àº1 mm<sup>3</sup> (1 √ó 1 √ó 0.45 mm microchip), coated with very thin layers of commonly ingested excipients (i.e., minerals and metals) (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref rid="cpt760-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
<bold>a</bold>), a small adhesive‚Äêbacked detector patch worn on the torso, and a paired mobile device. When ingested with a medication, the sensor readily separates from the carrier, is energized, and communicates with the detector patch.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> The detector patch interprets the information as unique to the ingested sensor. The detector patch worn also records physiological metrics including heart rate, step activity, and sleep/rest. Data from the patch are transmitted wirelessly, via bluetooth technology, to a paired device, such as a mobile phone, tablet, or a personal computer. Subsequently, all of the data on the paired device are uploaded to a secured, centralized data storage location<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> (<bold>Figure</bold>

              <p>The DHFS appears reliable, and highly accurate, with a positive detection accuracy of sensor‚Äêdetected ingestions of ‚àº99% (99.1%; 321/324 ingested under direct observation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 97.3‚Äì99.7).<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> From a total of almost 30,000 sensor ingestions, no serious adverse events were observed in clinical studies.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Early versions of the patch were associated with self‚Äêlimited, localized skin rashes in ‚àº10% of users.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> The Proteus Digital Health Feedback Device (DHFD) was issued CE Mark approval in 2010 to market its ingestible sensor and personal physiologic monitor system in the European Union and was approved for marketing as a medical device by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in 2012.</p>
              <p>Early studies using the DHFS were performed using the ingestion sensor (IS) embedded in a small white excipient tablet (<bold>Figures</bold>
<xref rid="cpt760-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>

To allow the DHFS to be utilized to its full potential in clinical research and practice, a simple, reliable method of combining the IS with oral medications that does not alter the product quality of the oral medication is needed. Over‚Äêencapsulation (in which an active drug is placed inside an opaque capsule shell, often involving the addition of a backfilled excipient) has been a widely used, highly effective technique for blinding solid oral dosage forms in comparative clinical trials since the 1960s.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for over‚Äêencapsulation requires provision of data to show that product quality has not been altered, stability data to justify an expiration date for use, along with careful consideration of the nature of the capsule shell and the presence or absence of backfill.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>

              </fig>
              <p>An adaptation of over‚Äêencapsulation is co‚Äêencapsulation (CoE). CoE, as presented here, describes a technique in which an FDA‚Äêapproved medication is combined with the FDA‚Äêapproved IS tablet within a certified locked gelatin, or HPMC capsule, with or without micro‚Äêcellulose backfill (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref rid="cpt760-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This process is identical to over‚Äêencapsulation, with the exception of the presence of the IS tablet. By means of this process a target medication becomes ‚Äúdigitized‚Äù for use with the DHFS so that its ingestion can be detected by the patch and then uploaded to a paired device for remote detection.</p>
              <p>Similar to GMP for over‚Äêencapsulation, CoE formulations require provision of data to show that product quality has not been altered, with careful consideration of the nature of the capsule shell and the presence or absence of backfill. In terms of the product quality, bioequivalence is a highly rigorous test to evaluate whether CoE of the drug with the IS within a certified capsule significantly alters the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the drug. Alternatively, dissolution testing can be used as a proxy to assess the effect of the capsule and the IS on the availability of the active drug for absorption in the GI tract. Dissolution testing is frequently used by the pharmaceutical industry to confirm the adequacy of an over‚Äêencapsulated formulation prior to double‚Äêblinded clinical trials.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Dissolution is the process whereby a solid enters into solution. In pharmaceutics it is defined as the amount of drug substance that enters solution per unit time under standardized conditions.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> Since drug absorption and pharmacological activity depend on the availability of drug substance in a dissolved state, suitable dissolution characteristics are important for a satisfactory medicine formulation, and dissolution kinetics are important in determining the overall bioavailability of the drug.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>
<italic>In vitro</italic> dissolution kinetics have been incorporated into the USP since 1970 and British Pharmacopeia since 1973. The availability of drug substance in the dissolved state provides a quality control test for CoE digitized medications that, although not identical in rigor to bioequivalence, is less costly and time‚Äêconsuming compared to a full bioequivalence study.</p>
              <p>Here we present a protocol following GMP for repackaging oral medications of interest in certified gelatin or HPMC capsules in combination with the IS. We then present data evaluating the bioequivalence of CoE formulations of antituberculous medications with native drug formulations in active TB patients. This is followed by dissolution analyses performed following FDA guidelines evaluating the quality of the CoE formulations of the IS with multiple oral medications used in clinical areas in which medication adherence is of considerable importance, including tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The DHFS is a medical device initially approved by the FDA CDRH in 2012, with a subsequent 2015 clearance for ‚Äútracking and trending of (medication) intake times.‚Äù For precise, unambiguous data on ingestion and the opportunity to specifically identify the ingestion of a complex regimen the IS must be combined with the drug(s) of interest. Ideally, the IS would be directly incorporated into solid dosage forms, including immediate‚Äêrelease or extended‚Äêrelease formulations, as is currently under study with certain dosage forms (NCT02219009). In the meantime, there are simple and reliable methods to combine the IS with oral medications of interest. This article describes an established GMP protocol for repackaging oral solid dose formulations in combination with the IS into certified gelatin or HPMC capsules in a process termed CoE (<bold>Table</bold>
<xref rid="cpt760-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>, <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref rid="cpt760-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). CoE is identical to over‚Äêencapsulation strategies used in placebo‚Äêcontrolled double‚Äêblinded studies, except for the addition of the IS tablet.</p>
              <p>The initial PK studies performed evaluated the BE of INH and Rifampin in CoE IS‚ÄêRifamate compared to native Rifamate in a rigorously designed randomized, crossover study. The CoE IS and native formulations demonstrated FDA‚Äêacceptable evidence of BE. We performed a BE study, as this was the first use of the CoE IS‚ÄêINH/Rifampin formulations in active TB patients with a serious infectious disease and provided lead‚Äêin data for an ongoing clinical trial. In the context of the treatment of TB, the DHFS is referred to as Wirelessly Observed Therapy (WOT) and digitized Rifamate is currently being used in a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing WOT to DOT during the continuation phase of TB treatment (NCT01960257).<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Given the conclusive result of the BE study on Rifamate, only dissolution studies were performed on an equivalent combination formulation of INH and Rifampin used widely outside the US, Rifinah 150/300 mg (Sanofi‚ÄêAventis), and these exceeded USP specifications. From these data we conclude that the CoE IS‚ÄêRifamate and IS‚ÄêRifinah are equivalent to their native formulations and can be used clinically in patients with active tuberculosis.</p>
              <p>Rigorous BE studies are expensive, time‚Äêconsuming, and we currently consider such studies unnecessary if comparative dissolution data are equivalent between the CoE IS‚Äêenabled and native formulations of a drug. <italic>In vitro</italic> dissolution testing nevertheless requires expert protocol planning and evaluation for drugs of different biopharmaceutical classes, hence we have included descriptions of the design specifications of the CoE formulations and their testing conditions (<bold>Supplementary Tables</bold>). Dissolution data assesses the effect of the capsule on the availability of the drug for absorption in the GI tract and, if adequate, attest that the quality of CoE drug product has not been altered. In this research, dissolution studies were performed with drugs falling in all Biopharmaceutical Classification System classes and all used certified, hard gelatin capsules, with or without microcrystalline cellulose backfill. As CoE of drug tablets with the IS and excipient backfill does not represent a significant manufacturing or process change to the commercially approved drug, the similarity value, f<sub>2</sub>, was calculated from dissolution profiles for information only. The dissolution profile is dominated in the early stage by disintegration; subsequently, dissolution of the active component is the primary driver. The presence of a capsule shell can create a lag in initiation of the disintegration process, accounting for early differences observed in comparability curves between some native and CoE formulations. All of the CoE drug dissolution profiles studied met either USP specifications, or met both USP specifications and f<sub>2</sub> comparability testing equivalence to the native commercial drug tablet, following unit sample specifications in USP monograph &lt;711&gt; (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>).<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>
</p>
              <p>Over‚Äêencapsulation of drugs in placebo/double blind studies is routine. Our work is consistent with the existing literature and provides strong evidence that the process of CoE and the presence of the IS within this formulation is of little or no consequence to plasma drug concentrations or to the dissolution of native drug. The digitized CoE formulations developed and evaluated as described in this article are currently being used in clinical research and practice.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>
</p>
              <p>The DHFS can accurately monitor the pattern of individual patients dosing histories, including precise ingestion timing, and can, by the design of the IS, detect multiple digitized medications simultaneously. As this technology comes into greater use it is likely the DHFS will have the most impact in areas where precise data on oral medication dose taking and timing is critical for determining the true dose‚Äìresponse relationship. In clinical trials lack of knowledge about dose‚Äêtaking and timing may lead to an incorrect conclusion on lack of effectiveness or estimates of toxicity for a candidate drug or the development of inappropriate dosing regimens. In clinical practice, lack of information or biased estimates of dose‚Äêtaking and timing can lead to inappropriate drug dose increases, which may lead to increased risk of toxicity or the abandonment of that drug or even its entire class of drugs. Precision data on dose‚Äêtaking and timing is particularly critical to the effective use of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window such as hypoglycemic and antiepileptic medications<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> and is essential to understanding the PK and dynamics that lead to the development of resistance against antibacterial and antiviral agents.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>In addition to allowing precision remote capture of oral medication adherence, the DHFS has the capacity to help support individual patient medication adherence by providing near‚Äêreal‚Äêtime reminders for missed doses, as well as allowing individualized caregiver contact to maintain adherence.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="cpt760-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> The data generated by the device may also deepen our understanding of factors influencing medication‚Äêtaking and timing in individual patients. Early exploration of multimodal data visualizations combining detailed medication ingestion and dense physiological data, such as sleep/rest and activity cycles, indicate that the DHFS can provide insights on daily behavioral patterns in relation to medication‚Äêtaking patterns.<xref rid="cpt760-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>This research provides a practical model for digitization of oral medications using CoE that can be used with the DHFS to generate complete and accurate dosing histories. Evaluation of antiretroviral CoE formulations is currently under way, in addition to other oral drug classes. Desirable developments of this system include incorporating the IS directly into a target medication during the manufacturing process itself. Formulations of medications, either CoE with the IS or having the IS incorporated inside the medication, are ushering in a new era in precision medication dosing, adherence monitoring, and adherence support.</p>
