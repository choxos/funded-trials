                  <p>A randomized controlled trial was carried out among women in two tertiary health institutions in Lagos, Nigeria, between July 2020 and March 2021. Participants were randomly assigned to either a text message (mHealth) intervention or usual care arm. The main study outcome was the uptake of Pap smear testing within 6 months of enrollment in the study. We tested the associations between two groups of continuous variables using the unpooled independent-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (normal distribution) and that of two groups of categorical variables with the chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test. Using a multinomial logistic regression model, we adjusted for relevant sociodemographic and clinical predictors of uptake of Pap smear screening. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

                <p>The study investigators identified eligible women from the GOP clinics of the two study sites on each day of the study period after which a 20-30-minute educational health talk on cervical cancer and its prevention was given to all the women in the clinics by the midwives with the assistance of the clinics' health care teams as part of their usual standard of care (usual care). Eligible women were then invited by the investigators to provide consent for participation in the study upon explanation of the purpose and nature of the study. Once consent was obtained, a structured questionnaire was administered by the investigators to obtain baseline information on the relevant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We used an individual's monthly income and educational status as independent determinants of socioeconomic status according to Yoon et al.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Low-income earners received 30,000 naira (₦) or less per month—the minimum wage in Nigeria; the middle-income class earned ₦150,000 or less per month—about the salary level of a newly employed Nigerian graduate, whereas the upper-income class earned more than ₦150,000 per month ($1 US dollar was equivalent to ₦364 as at February 2020).

On completion of the 6-month follow-up, data were collected from each woman on their GOP clinic attendance and Pap test screening uptake at any time during the follow-up period.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this randomized controlled trial, the introduction of mobile health (mHealth) technologies intervention using short-text message services (SMS) had a significant impact on the uptake of Pap smear screening among women in Lagos. We also recorded that factors such as a woman's level of income, her prior awareness of Pap smear for cervical cancer screening, and attendance for care at the GOP clinic during the period of follow-up were significant independent predictors of Pap smear screening uptake.</p>
              <p>The mean age of the participants in this study (37.4 ± 10.2 years) is almost similar to the mean ages of 35.9 ± 9.5<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and 35.7 ± 9.74 years<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> recorded in our previous studies that assessed women's knowledge of cervical cancer and its prevention, thus attesting to the usual age distribution of apparently healthy women who readily participate in similar clinical research in Lagos. We recorded an overall uptake rate of 43.5% for Pap smear testing in this study and this is far higher than the 22.9% rate of previous screening reported in a study conducted in a similar setting in Lagos<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and the 27.0% reported by the participants in this study. This indicates the overall impact of the mobile SMS intervention as evidenced by the significant difference observed in the screening uptake during follow-up among women in the mHealth arm compared with those in the usual care arm.</p>
              <p>Having some levels of formal education was not significantly associated with increased uptake of Pap smear among the participants in this study and other previous studies in Africa,<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> whereas it was reported as a significant predictor of uptake of cervical cancer screening in another study.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This thus suggests that the determinants of health care practices of individuals are usually multifactorial, and education, despite being a vital tool in health promotion, may not be the sole determinant. However, having a high- to middle-income status is a significant independent predictor of Pap test uptake in this study, and this is not surprising as women of higher economic status are more empowered to take independent health care decisions and are thus better able to access health care services irrespective of any other factors. The uptake of Pap smear screening among women with previous screening awareness in this study corroborates the finding from our previous study<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> that suggests that Pap smear screening awareness is likened to having a good knowledge of the impact of invasive cervical cancer on morbidity and mortality. Because of the constraints of available time, individuals tend to use the opportunity of attending health care facilities during the period of infirmities to simultaneously seek necessary health care prevention services. This is now considered as a pivotal aspect of health care provision as most health institutions including ours have now integrated health promotion and prevention services to almost all aspects of health care service delivery in most outpatient clinics. This, therefore, is corroborated by the finding of significant uptake of Pap smear screening among women who attend the GOP clinics for evaluation and treatment of other ailments during the period of their follow-up in the current study.</p>
              <p>The major limitation of this study was the inability to assess the participant's adherence to the use of text message services despite having mobile phones. Furthermore, the extreme difficulty in ensuring with absolute certainty that participants, especially those in the mHealth arm, who attended the GOP clinics during the period of their follow-up did not unknowingly reveal their study group with resultant undue influence on their screening uptake. We also acknowledge that giving phone credit to participants as incentives may be creating bias. However, this was a one-off payment intended to encourage participants' engagement with the study and to facilitate their retention for the follow-up. Following the positive findings from the study, we will need to consider sustainable and feasible ways of supporting engagement with the intervention when delivered as part of routine care.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies intervention via SMS was significantly associated with the uptake of Pap smear screening among women in Lagos. A woman's level of income, her prior awareness of Pap smear screening, and attendance for care at the GOP clinic during the period of follow-up were significant independent predictors of Pap smear screening uptake. As the effects of mHealth intervention campaigns are often short-lived, only involve one-way communication, and do not benefit those in most need, our subsequent implementation research agenda will attempt to explore the role of mHealth and its effect in the context of routine care, alongside exploring approaches to increasing the flow of information and value of content for patients. In the meantime, we recommend that regular health education of women about cervical cancer and its screening strategies, together with the upscale use of mHealth services interventions by health care providers and policymakers, will go a long way to reduce the high incidence and overwhelming burden of cervical cancer in Nigeria and other low- and middle-income settings.</p>
