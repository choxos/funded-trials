                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>To report updated analyses of the phase III CheckMate 214 trial with extended minimum follow-up assessing long-term outcomes with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIVO+IPI) versus (vs) sunitinib (SUN) in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients with aRCC with a clear cell component were stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk and randomised to NIVO (3 mg/kg) plus IPI (1 mg/kg) every three weeks ×4 doses, followed by NIVO (3 mg/kg) every two weeks; or SUN (50 mg) once per day ×4 weeks (6-week cycle). Efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) per independent radiology review committee in patients with intermediate/poor-risk disease (I/P; primary), intent-to-treat patients (ITT; secondary) and in patients with favourable-risk disease (FAV; exploratory).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 1096 patients were randomised (ITT: NIVO+IPI, n=550, SUN, n=546; I/P: NIVO+IPI, n=425, SUN, n=422; FAV: NIVO+IPI, n=125, SUN, n=124). After 4 years minimum follow-up, OS (HR; 95% CI) remained superior with NIVO+IPI vs SUN in ITT (0.69; 0.59 to 0.81) and I/P patients (0.65; 0.54 to 0.78). Four-year PFS probabilities were 31.0% vs 17.3% (ITT) and 32.7% vs 12.3% (I/P), with NIVO+IPI vs SUN. ORR remained higher with NIVO+IPI vs SUN in ITT (39.1% vs 32.4%) and I/P (41.9% vs 26.8%) patients. In FAV patients, the HRs (95% CI) for OS and PFS were 0.93 (0.62 to 1.40) and 1.84 (1.29 to 2.62); ORR was lower with NIVO+IPI vs SUN. However, more patients in all risk groups achieved complete responses with NIVO+IPI: ITT (10.7% vs 2.6%), I/P (10.4% vs 1.4%) and FAV (12.0% vs 6.5%). Probability (95% CI) of response ≥4 years was higher with NIVO+IPI vs SUN (ITT, 59% (0.51 to 0.66) vs 30% (0.21 to 0.39); I/P, 59% (0.50 to 0.67) vs 24% (0.14 to 0.36); and FAV, 60% (0.41 to 0.75) vs 38% (0.22 to 0.54)) regardless of risk category. Safety remained favourable with NIVO+IPI vs SUN.</p>

              <p>Many patients experience lasting benefits from immuno-oncology–based therapy due to improved efficacy together with favourable safety and quality-of-life outcomes. This new potential for prolonged survival underscores the importance of long-term updates to assess the durability of clinical benefits with first-line therapies for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref></p>
              <p>Dual checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIVO+IPI) is currently approved for the first-line treatment of patients with aRCC and International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate/poor (I/P)-risk disease, on the basis of results from the randomised phase III CheckMate 214 trial (NCT02231749). In the primary analysis of the CheckMate 214 trial (minimum follow-up, 17.5 months) in patients with I/P risk, overall survival (OS) was significantly superior (HR, 0.63; p&lt;0.001) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was higher (42% versus (vs) 27%; p&lt;0.001 per independent radiology review committee (IRRC)) with NIVO+IPI over sunitinib (SUN).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Comparable OS benefits (HR 0.68; p&lt;0.001) and improved ORR (39% vs 32%) were also observed with NIVO+IPI in intent-to-treat (ITT) patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> NIVO+IPI continued to demonstrate improved efficacy outcomes over SUN in both ITT and I/P-risk patients, including OS benefits and durable responses with additional follow-up.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 4</xref> In IMDC favourable (FAV)-risk patients, ORR and progression-free survival (PFS) benefits were observed with SUN, yet the difference in OS outcomes between treatment arms was inconclusive.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 4</xref></p>
              <p>Here, we report extended 4-year minimum follow-up from the CheckMate 214 trial in ITT, I/P-risk and FAV-risk patients with aRCC. Survival outcomes, response per IRRC, durability of response and safety were assessed, providing the longest follow-up to date of an approved first-line checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy in aRCC.</p>

                <p>The CheckMate 214 study design and statistical analyses details have been published previously.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref> Briefly, adults with treatment-naïve aRCC with a clear cell component were randomised 1:1 to the NIVO+IPI or SUN arms and stratified by region and IMDC risk status (favourable, intermediate or poor).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Combination NIVO 3 mg/kg and IPI 1 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by NIVO 3 mg/kg monotherapy every 2 weeks. Patients were required to receive all four doses of NIVO+IPI before beginning NIVO monotherapy. SUN 50 mg was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off in each 6-week cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of two dose reductions were permitted for SUN in 12.5 mg increments per day (for daily dose ≥25 mg); no dose reductions were allowed in the NIVO+IPI arm. The trial was stopped when NIVO+IPI demonstrated OS superiority over SUN in the primary efficacy population (database lock, 7 August 2017). A subsequent protocol amendment on 13 November 2017 permitted modifications to the NIVO+IPI arm, including the following: patients could discontinue after 2 years of study treatment even in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; patients receiving NIVO maintenance therapy were permitted to switch to NIVO 240 mg every 2 weeks; and I/P-risk patients could cross over from SUN to NIVO+IPI.</p>

                <p>Primary endpoints included OS, PFS per IRRC and ORR per IRRC in the I/P-risk population. Secondary endpoints included OS, PFS and ORR in the ITT population, and the incidence rate of adverse events (AEs) among all treated patients.

A detailed characterisation of all responders, including durability of response, treatment-free interval and subsequent therapy outcomes, were conducted as post hoc analyses. Treatment-free interval was defined as the time between protocol therapy discontinuation until subsequent therapy initiation or last known date alive.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>

                <p>Consistent with previous reports,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref> similar overall rates of treatment-related AEs of any grade occurred in the NIVO+IPI and SUN arms with extended follow-up (514/547 (94.0%) vs 521/535 (97.4%) patients), and there were fewer grade 3 to 4 treatment-related AEs with NIVO+IPI vs SUN (47.9% vs 64.1%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table 3</xref>). Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation within 30 days of the last dose occurred in 124 (22.7%) patients in the NIVO+IPI arm and in 70 (13.1%) patients in the SUN arm. No additional treatment-related deaths were reported since the primary analysis. The overall incidence of treatment-related select AEs with NIVO+IPI was similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table 3</xref>).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref> In total, 159 (29.1%) of 547 patients treated with NIVO+IPI received corticosteroids (≥40 mg PDE) to manage any-grade treatment-related select AEs, 106 (19.4%) patients received ≥40 mg PDE continuously for ≥2 weeks and 54 (9.9%) received ≥40 mg PDE continuously for ≥30 days.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>With an extended minimum follow-up of 4 years, the longest in a phase III trial of a checkpoint inhibitor-based combination regimen for first-line treatment of patients with aRCC, NIVO+IPI continues to demonstrate superior long-term survival benefits in both ITT patients and in patients with I/P risk. The HR for OS with NIVO+IPI vs SUN has remained stable over time in ITT and I/P-risk patients, ranging from 0.68 and 0.63 at 17.5 months follow-up to 0.69 and 0.65 at 48 months follow-up, respectively. Moreover, after 4 years, ≥50% of patients in the ITT and I/P-risk populations were alive, with median OS not reached in ITT patients. ORR remained consistent and significantly in favour of NIVO+IPI over SUN. In addition, more responses were complete, more responses were ongoing and duration of response was longer with NIVO+IPI, with median duration of response not reached at 4 years minimum follow-up with the combination immunotherapy regimen in any IMDC risk group. Interestingly, of patients achieving partial or complete responses, a greater proportion of patients treated with NIVO+IPI discontinued therapy without progression and did not receive subsequent systemic therapy. Furthermore, no new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. The overall incidence of treatment-related events, those leading to discontinuation and select (potentially immune-mediated) AEs (including the proportion of patients who required prednisone or equivalent to manage these events) was similar to previous reports.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 4</xref></p>
              <p>In patients with FAV risk, an OS benefit for either treatment arm remains inconclusive with 4 years minimum follow-up. Median PFS was longer and ORR was higher with SUN, yet the complete response rate was double with NIVO+IPI with more ongoing responses, compared with SUN. Although no significant benefit with NIVO+IPI has emerged in this exploratory cohort, the difference in OS between arms continues to evolve with long-term follow-up. The HR for OS with NIVO+IPI vs SUN has decreased over time from 1.45 at 17.5 months minimum follow-up to 0.93 at 4 years minimum follow-up.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Additionally, a recent separate analysis suggests that while OS has appeared similar among FAV-risk patients between treatment arms, the way these patients experienced OS was notably different: SUN patients spent more time on protocol treatment with toxicity, whereas NIVO+IPI patients spent more time off treatment without toxicity.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>IMDC risk assessment was specifically derived from patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor -targeted therapies, but it is now routinely applied to all patients with aRCC including those treated with immuno-oncology–based therapy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 13</xref> Identifying patients who will survive longer or develop a long-term response with immuno-oncology–based regimens via additional markers of response is a clear unmet need.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> The ongoing demonstration of survival and response benefits with NIVO+IPI vs SUN through 4 years of follow-up in both the primary I/P-risk population and the secondary ITT population suggests that a range of patients with aRCC across the spectrum of IMDC risk may derive long-term clinical benefit with NIVO+IPI.</p>
              <p>Extended follow-up reported in this study provides further evidence for the clinically meaningful, durable benefits of first-line NIVO+IPI in patients with aRCC and continues to support NIVO+IPI as a first-line treatment option for patients with aRCC.</p>
