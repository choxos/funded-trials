              <abstract>
                <p>In this study, we summarized critical databases of drug combination toxicity and pharmacokinetics. We further conducted a feasibility and utility study that demonstrates how different data sources can contribute to and assist phase I trial designs. Single-drug and drug combination toxicity and pharmacokinetic data were primarily reviewed from several databases. We focused on the MTD, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), toxicity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of these data sources in improving trial designs, phase I studies reported in ClincalTrials.gov from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 were used as examples. We evaluated whether and how these studies could have been designed differently given toxicity and pharmacokinetic data. None of the existing pharmacokinetic and toxicity databases contain either MTD or DLT. Among 268 candidate trials, four drug combinations were studied in other phase I trials before 2018; 185 combinations had complete or partial information on drug interactions or overlapping toxicity, and 79 combinations did not have available information. Two drug combination trials were selected as case studies. The nivolumab-axitinib trial could have been designed as a dose deescalating study, and the vinorelbine-trastuzumab emtansine trial could have been designed with a lower dose of either drug. Public data sources contain significant knowledge of the drug combination phase I trial design. Some important data (MTD and DLT) are not available in existing databases but in the literature. Some phase I studies could have been designed more efficiently with additional preliminary data.</p>

                  <p>Prior preclinical and clinical knowledge is critical for designing effective and efficient cancer drug combinatory trials. We reported results on the feasibility and utility of different informatics resources for contributing to and assisting phase I trial designs based on our designed classification approach. We also found that public data sources contained significant knowledge for drug combination phase I trial design, but some critical data elements (MTD and DLT) were missing.</p>

              <p>Multidrug therapies targeting multiple disease mechanisms are more efficacious in most patients with cancer than single-drug therapies. In the meantime, more drug combinations have undergone clinical trials for cancer. ClinicalTrial.gov data have demonstrated that the number of cancer drug combination trials has increased from 445 in 2007 to 912 in 2019. However, many clinical trials have failed in this regard. A recent study of pharmaceutical drug development between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2015 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) reported failures of 7,346 phase I (58%), 4,396 phase II (35%), and 797 phase III (7%) cancer trials. These numbers highlight the failure of phase I trials as the biggest challenge in the development of cancer drugs for clinical use.</p>
              <p>A phase I trial is a dose-finding study that investigates the safety and tolerability of a drug or drug combination (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Its goal is to determine the MTD, optimal dose level, and schedule to recommend for evaluation in a phase II trial of an experimental drug or drug combination in a target patient population(s; ref. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). “3+3” design continues to be commonly used in phase I trials. Properly designed phase I trials should minimize patient exposure to severe or life-threatening adverse drug events (ADE) and treat more patients at the optimum dose that produces a therapeutic effect while ensuring safety. In the last few decades, the statistical community has extensively developed many innovative phase I trial designs to improve operating characteristics compared with the standard “3+3” design (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>). However, regardless of how powerful statistical designs can be, their success relies on accurate prior knowledge of single-drug or drug combination toxicities, the period of DLT evaluation, the rate of DLT at the MTD, and potential pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions (DDI).</p>
              <p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> delineates the various data sources that archive a large amount of information regarding the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of drugs. After reviewing these publicly available data sources (see <xref rid="SMD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S1</xref>), we found several primary challenges for prior evidence knowledge query and collection for drug combination phase I trials. First, structured pharmacokinetic and toxicity data were distributed in different databases and were not combined. Second, important data elements, such as MTDs and DLTs of single drugs and drug combinations, are not collected in any databases but in the scientific literature. Third and most importantly, we have limited knowledge on whether and how these data sources can properly assist us in designing drug combination phase I trials.</p>

                  <title>Candidate Phase I Trial Selection</title>
                  <p>We targeted phase I or IB cancer drug combination clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1 to December 31, 2018. Relevant data (e.g., clinical trial titles and interventions) were extracted and analyzed from the Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT), a publicly available relational database containing all information in ClinicalTrials.gov. In our analysis, we included trials with only a two-drug intervention owing to the lack of available DDI data sources for drug combinations that involved more than two drugs. We also limited that the two-drug intervention could involve either small-molecule cancer drugs or therapeutic proteins. These two-drug interventions were further reviewed manually to remove trials in which the inventions contained radiotherapy and cell-based therapy. This ensured that all trial candidates involved only individual small-molecule drugs or mAbs. Finally, DrugBank ID (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) was used to normalize all drug names. Recognizing that a number of investigational drugs had no generic or brand names, their reported drug names in ClinicalTrials.gov were retained for further identification.</p>

                  <p>Single-drug toxicity data and their corresponding frequencies were manually retrieved from the DailyMed website and SIDER (version 4.1, released on October 21, 2015, RRID:SCR_004321; ref. <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Then, toxicity data were mapped to proper MedDRA preferred terms (PT) to check the overlapping toxicities between the two drugs. In the current study, an identical PT shared by the two drugs was considered an overlapping toxicity.</p>
                  <p>The pharmacokinetic DDI evidence was reviewed and collected mainly from DrugBank (version 5.0.10, RRID:SCR_002700; ref. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and the published literature. We chose an old version of the DrugBank database to ensure that all pharmacokinetic DDI data had been published before phase I trial candidates began. The combination of a small-molecule drug and a mAb or two mAbs was considered as a nonpotential pharmacokinetic DDI pair based on the mechanism of pharmacokinetic DDI, because small-molecule drugs are typically metabolized through CYP450s and other phase II metabolic enzymes in the human liver, whereas mAbs are mostly degraded in targeted tissues other than the liver. Because all the evidence was derived from publicly available machine-readable data sources, we did not conduct a validation step in the current study.</p>

Toxicity data were extracted from drug labels. All extracted ADEs were mapped to proper MedDRA PT terms, and ADEs in the boxed warnings section and warns and precaution section of drug labels were defined as severe. Moreover, MTDs were retrieved from PubMed (RRID:SCR_004846) using the query terms: drug name AND (MTD OR P2RD). The availability of all data from public informatics sources was also assured before the first publication date of the candidate trials on ClinicalTrials.gov.</p>
                <p>Then, all these data were shared with a physician and a statistician, who designed at least one drug combination phase I clinical trial. The physician and statistician conducted their phase I trial design for the same cancer drug combination, taking the background information (both from the original protocol and public data sources) into consideration. Finally, their designs were compared with those published in ClinicalTrial.gov.</p>

                <p>We identified 423 phase I cancer drug combination trials in ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. These trials assessed 487 unique drugs in a total of 496 combinations. Some trials have investigated multiple drug combinations in different treatment arms. After intervention identification and drug name normalization, 268 unique two-drug combinations involving 252 unique drugs (including both small-molecule drugs and therapeutic proteins) were evaluated using publicly available data sources for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties. Among these 252 individual drugs, 112 were identified as small-molecule drugs by DrugBank or published literature, whereas 40 drugs were identified as therapeutic proteins. Prior to 2018, there were no available data sources to identify the remaining drugs.</p>
                <p>Among the 268 two-drug combinations, 77 consisted of two small-molecule drugs, and 53 combinations consisted of two therapeutic proteins. The remaining combines a small-molecule drug and therapeutic protein as an intervention. For pharmacokinetic DDI-positive evidence, we focused on two small-molecule drug combinations, based on the pharmacokinetic DDI annotation scheme. We identified nine combinations of pharmacokinetic DDI-positive evidence from DrugBank. In terms of toxicity evidence, 39 of the individual drugs had a toxicity profile in the SIDER database. In addition, we extracted the toxicity profiles of 32 individual drugs from their labels.</p>

                    <p>A phase IA trial of nivolumab and axitinib (NCT03172754) was conducted in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in 2017. The nivolumab and axitinib combination was tested at three dose levels: (2 mg twice daily + 480 mg every 4 weeks), (3 mg twice daily + 480 mg every 4 weeks), and (5 mg twice daily + 480 mg every 4 weeks).</p>

                    <p>The FDA first approved axitinib, a small molecule and tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in 2011 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions include diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, weight loss, vomiting, asthenia, and constipation. Nivolumab, a biologic antibody and PD-1 inhibitor, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of various types of cancer. The combination's pharmacokinetic and toxicity evidence and strength annotation was summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Our review indicated that the toxicity profile of nivolumab (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) attributed most nivolumab-induced ADEs to immune-related ADEs, while axitinib could probably induce cardiovascular and hemal events. These two drugs have only one severe overlapping ADE (embryo-fetal toxicity). A review of the literature indicated MTDs of 5 mg twice daily for axitinib and 480 mg for nivolumab (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). More details regarding this trial are provided in the <xref rid="SMD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S3</xref>.

                    <p>This phase I study could be redesigned as a phase IB study to start at a 5 mg maximum dose of axitinib with dose reduction to 3 and 2 mg if needed and maintenance of a 3 mg/kg dose of nivolumab based on guidelines. A dose of 5 mg for axitinib and 3 mg/kg for nivolumab could potentially achieve an optimum combination dose with therapeutic effects while ensuring patient safety. The period for evaluating DLT remained the same for the first cycle. However, the definition of DLT could be modified to include any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 4 hematologic toxicity that does not resolve within 48 hours, any grade 2 diarrhea or colitis that does not resolve within 48 hours with supportive care, any grade 3 colitis or diarrhea, or any grade 3 hypertension. This would allow for an expected DLT rate of 25% at the MTD, based on the high rate of hypertension with axitinib, which would not be expected to be exacerbated by nivolumab. With this additional preliminary information, adaptive statistical methods could be applied to redesign this phase I combination trial and minimize patient exposure to subtherapeutic dose levels.</p>

                    <p>Vinorelbine is a small molecule and antimitotic chemotherapy agent approved by the FDA in 1994 for non–small cell lung cancer, and T-DM1 is an antibody–drug conjugate and anti-HER2 therapy approved in 2013 for metastatic breast cancer. The most common ADEs observed with T-DM1 were nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopenia, increased transaminase levels, headache, and constipation. The most common severe ADEs are thrombocytopenia, increased transaminase levels, anemia, hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue. Moreover, the results of a phase I study of vinorelbine in patients with carcinomas, lymphomas, and chronic myeloid leukemia showed an MTD of 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly if it was administered as monotherapy (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and granulocytopenia was noted as a DLT. The results of another phase I study of vinorelbine in metastatic breast cancer showed an MTD of 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a subsequent phase II study determined it to be 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

According to ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02658084 was terminated because of low accrual and toxicity concerns, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, metabolism, and nutritional disorders, as well as some general disorders.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Multiple therapeutic designs targeting various cancer pathways or regulation networks have yielded more effective results with respect to anticancer effects than designs utilizing single-agent regimens. Thus, the number of preclinical and clinical studies on such drug combinations has increased to accelerate the translation of investigative drugs to the clinical setting. However, many studies have indicated the failure of many drug combinations for cancer therapies during phase I trials (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Incorporating all available knowledge regarding the properties of both single drugs and their combinations in the design of phase I trials might overcome this high failure rate. The use of prior lessons might facilitate the selection of appropriate doses and schedules to avoid severe or life-threatening ADEs, thereby maximizing patient safety and developmental efficiency.</p>
              <p>In this study, we reviewed several publicly available databases that provide extensive information regarding the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of individual drugs and drug combinations. The FM, DIDB, and UCSF-Transportal databases serve as repositories of quantitative data regarding metabolic enzymes and transportation that are critical in measuring pharmacokinetic DDIs, and DailyMed serves as a resource for critical drug toxicity data. Moreover, several drug combination databases have collected experimental and clinical evidence related to DDIs.</p>
              <p>However, some essential information, such as MTD and DLT, remains widely scattered in the published literature, and unstructured formatting limits accessibility and facilities for computerized integration and analysis. Storage of drug labels in their original format in the DailyMed database, for example, only allows the labels to be read. The most critical limitation of these valuable data sources is that they are not well integrated in either the user or data layer.</p>
              <p>In this study, we designed a classification approach that could assist in designing drug combination phase I clinical trial by synthesis of prior pharmacokinetic DDI and toxicity evidence. Our study also demonstrated the feasibility and utility of incorporating as much knowledge as possible from prior investigations to assist in the design of new phase I trials of drug combinations. Among the 423 such investigations for cancer therapies reported in ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1 to December 31, 2018, we identified 268 unique two-drug combinations, and more than 70% of these included at least partial prior knowledge of pharmacokinetics or toxicity. In addition, four combinations were evaluated under other conditions or patient populations. Our study also illustrated that careful review of all these data sources might have led to a better design of some earlier phase I studies.</p>
              <p>Examination of prior knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetic mechanisms of nivolumab and axitinib revealed that no pharmacokinetic DDI might be expected from their combined use. Furthermore, the toxicity profiles indicated no overlapping toxicities. Thus, the reviewing physician considered a phase IB study with alternative dose deescalation based on additional information as a preferable approach. In addition, the reviewing statistician felt that the use of adaptive statistical methods to accelerate the trial process would minimize patient exposure to subtherapeutic dose levels.</p>
              <p>Synthesis of prior knowledge regarding vinorelbine and T-DM1 revealed significant overlapping toxicities between them, suggesting that they should not be used in combination to treat patients, or that such use should be carefully evaluated in clinical trials.</p>
              <p>Our study has several limitations. We manually reviewed several data sources to integrate valuable information regarding the design of previous phase I trials of drug combinations. We collected information already processed, such as normalized drug names, and retrieved information from PubMed and other sources using keyword searches. More critical information is needed to assist in the trial design. For example, we extracted ADEs from drug labels and mapped them to MedDRA PTs, but some error might occur during the mapping procedure. Moreover, incorporating evidence regarding the severity of ADEs could provide more stratified and detailed information to help define accurate DLTs. Future work should include massive and automatic retrieval and collection of information using machine-learning technology to expand the current drug combination knowledge base. Such a deep integration of accumulated prior knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and pharmacology of single drugs and their combinations and a user-friendly design of that information base would promote the application of this knowledge to the better design of phase I trials to treat cancer.</p>
