              <abstract>
                <p>Hematogenous metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths, yet the mechanism remains unclear. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood may employ different pathways to cross blood endothelial barrier and establish a metastatic niche. Several studies provide evidence that prostate cancer (PCa) cell tethering and rolling on microvascular endothelium via E-selectin/E-selectin ligand interactions under shear flow theoretically promote extravasation and contribute to the development of metastases. However, it is unknown if CTCs from PCa patients interact with E-selectin expressed on endothelium, initiating a route for tumor metastases. Here we report that CTCs derived from PCa patients showed interactions with E-selectin and E-selectin expressing endothelial cells. To examine E-selectin-mediated interactions of PCa cell lines and CTCs derived from metastatic PCa patients, we used fluorescently-labeled anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody J591-488 which is internalized following cell-surface binding. We employed a microscale flow device consisting of E-selectin-coated microtubes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on parallel-plate flow chamber simulating vascular endothelium. We observed that J591-488 did not significantly alter the rolling behavior in PCa cells at shear stresses below 3 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>. CTCs obtained from 31 PCa patient samples showed that CTCs tether and stably interact with E-selectin and E-selectin expressing HUVECs at physiological shear stress. Interestingly, samples collected during disease progression demonstrated significantly more CTC/E-selectin interactions than samples during times of therapeutic response (<italic>p</italic>=0.016). Analysis of the expression of sialyl Lewis X (sLe<sup>x</sup>) in patient samples showed that a small subset comprising 1.9-18.8% of CTCs possess high sLe<sup>x</sup> expression. Furthermore, E-selectin-mediated interactions between prostate CTCs and HUVECs were diminished in the presence of anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody. CTC-Endothelial interactions provide a novel insight into potential adhesive mechanisms of prostate CTCs as a means to initiate metastasis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The development of metastases is hypothesized to initiate via similar mechanisms as used by leukocytes for adhesion and transmigration through blood endothelium [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The leukocyte recruitment cascade to endothelium during inflammation involves sequential steps including tethering, rolling, adhesion, and finally transmigration. The initial step of tethering and rolling occurs through dynamic and transient interactions between selectins expressed by endothelial cells (ECs) and their respective ligands present on leukocytes during blood flow causing continuous breaking and formation of receptor-ligand bonds. This cycle leads to the characteristic rolling behavior of leukocytes [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In humans, E-selectin has been shown to be primarily responsible for selectin-mediated rolling and tethering [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Numerous studies using tumor cell lines and mouse models suggest that endothelial (E)-selectin is also involved in tumor cell adhesion, migration and the development of metastases [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> mouse models have shown that E-selectin promotes metastases [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and redirects metastases to the liver [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cimetidine, which inhibits the induction of E-selectin expression, significantly decreased liver metastasis of HT-29 colon cancer cells in an athymic mouse model without affecting the primary tumor [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, E- and P-selectin deficient mice injected with HT-29 tumor cells showed a significant decrease in the number of lung metastasis compared with wild type mice [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>The link between E-selectin and metastasis led to many studies characterizing selectin ligands on tumor cell surfaces. Selectin ligands are specific glycoproteins, which become functional after post-translational modification by glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. The presence of sialyl-Lewis X (sLe<sup>x</sup>) and sialyl-Lewis a (sLe<sup>a</sup>), carbohydrate epitopes of selectin ligands [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is frequently associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Studies also suggest that the tropism of PCa cells to bone is attributed to the interactions between E-selectin expressed on bone marrow endothelial cells (ECs) and E-selectin ligands present on PCa cells [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p>
              <p>The evidence implicating the role of E-selectin and its ligands in tumor metastasis are derived from studies using tumor cell lines but have never been confirmed in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from patients. We report here using <italic>ex vivo</italic> conditions that CTCs isolated from men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) demonstrate physical interactions, predominantly tethering and firm adhesion, with E-selectin-coated surfaces and E-selectin expressing ECs during physiological blood flow. Additionally, CTC/E-selectin interactions showed a significant correlation with the clinical response of the patients to therapy. These interactions were diminished in the presence of anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, we found variable expression of sLe<sup>x</sup> on CTCs, suggesting that likely not all CTCs contribute to metastases. </p>

All incubations were performed at room temperature. Control tubes were either not incubated with E-selectin or incubated with 10 µg/ml human recombinant IgG L-selectin (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Coated microtubes were mounted on an inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. A syringe pump (KDS 230, IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) was used to control the shear stress of the cell suspension. A known concentration of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> unlabeled or J591-488 labeled MDA cells diluted in buffer I was perfused over the surface at a shear stress of 0.5 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> for 3 min following which cells were perfused at shear stresses ranging from 0.5-8 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>.

HUVECs (a gift of Dr. Shahin Rafii) were cultured in M199 media, 1 M Hepes, 20% FBS, 5 mg/ml heparin, 100 µg/ml endothelial cell growth factor, and L-glutamine. E4ORF1-transduced HUVECs were prepared and maintained as previously described [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MDA cells or CTCs derived from four CRPC patients were perfused over confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) grown in a 35 x 10 mm tissue culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). HUVECs were first stimulated with 50 ng/ml IL-1β (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 4 h. IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs treated with 30 µg/ml neutralizing anti-E-selectin (68-5H11, BD Pharmingen, CA) for 1 h at 37°C incubator, unstimulated HUVECs, and human anti-mouse ICAM-1 antibody (Clone BBIG-I1, # BBA3 R and D systems) were used as controls. MDA cells or CTCs were resuspended in buffer I and perfused into the parallel-plate flow chamber over HUVECs. MDA cell rolling was assessed at different shear stresses ranging from 0.5-4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> performing three independent experiments. For rolling measurements in CTCs derived from PCa patients, cells enriched by anti-CD45 immunomagnetic depletion and labeled with anti-PSMA J591-488, were perfused over HUVECs at 0.6 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> shear stress. As indicated in the results, a subset of rolling assay experiments were also performed using Bioflux Microfluidics technologies (Fluxion Biosciences, San Francisco, CA).</p>

                <p>To study CTCs isolated from patients with CRPC, we took advantage of the fact that &gt;90% of PCa cells express PSMA on their cell surface [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and used mAbJ591-488, which recognizes an external domain of PSMA and is rapidly internalized following binding to cell-surface PSMA, to identify PCa CTCs [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].. MDA cells expressing PSMA and PC-3 cells (PSMA negative control) were added separately to normal healthy blood, and the mixture was incubated with mAbJ591-488. After incubation, the PBMC layer containing cancer cells were collected. As expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), MDA cells expressing PSMA internalized mAbJ591-488 and were easily visible under fluorescent microscopy, while mAbJ591-488 did not bind to PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Blood spiking experiments with MDA and PC3 were carried out six times using different healthy donor blood. No PSMA expression was detected in surrounding leukocytes that were identified by immunostaining with anti-CD45 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

                <title>E-selectin-dependent adhesion of unlabeled and anti-PSMA J591-488 labeled prostate tumor cells</title>
                <p>During an inflammatory response, leukocytes adhere to the vascular endothelium by interactions between the adhesion molecules present on the luminal side of the vascular endothelium and complementary ligands present on leukocytes. These interactions result in the transient, dynamic adhesion (rolling) of cells to the vascular wall [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Rolling is observed due to continuous breaking and formation of receptor-ligand bonds at the rear end of the cell and the front edge of the cell, respectively. To investigate whether E-selectin-dependent interactions occur in prostate CTCs, we first used MDA, PC3, LNCaP, and C4-2 PCa cell lines to assess their rolling behavior in the presence of E-selectin-coated microtube surfaces. Out of the four PCa cell lines studied, we only detected robust rolling behavior in MDA cells (data not shown), consistent with prior studies [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p>
                <p>Monoclonal antibody J591 is internalized following cell-surface binding suggesting that PCa CTCs can be labeled <italic>ex vivo</italic> and studied for CTC-endothelial interactions. However, to rule out the possibility that J591-488 binding and internalization alters rolling behavior, we labeled MDA cells with J591-488 and compared the rolling behavior with unlabeled MDA cells at shear stresses ranging from 0.5-8 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>. The mean rolling velocity of unlabeled and J591-488-labeled MDA cells at 0.5 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> was 5.27 <underline>+</underline> 1.28 μm/sec and 5.23 <underline>+</underline> 1.85 μm/sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g002">Figure 2</xref>, p=0.88, NS). We did observe a small but statistically significant difference in the mean rolling velocities of unlabeled versus J591-488 labeled MDA cells at 3 (7.04 <underline>+</underline> 1.15 vs 6.33 <underline>+</underline> 1.22 µm/sec, <italic>p&lt;0.005</italic>) and 8 (17.81 <underline>+</underline> 3.51 vs 14.38 <underline>+</underline> 1.83 µm/sec, <italic>p&lt;0.0005</italic>) dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> shear stress. Therefore, based on our results and previous studies, we conducted experiments at 0.6 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, a widely applied physiologic shear stress to measure rolling behavior [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Also, it has been shown that tumor cells roll and tether at lower shear stresses (</p>
                <p>&lt; 3 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) [26]. These data suggest that CTCs can be labeled with J591-488 and that fluorescent labeling of CTCs does not affect rolling behavior at lower shear stresses. Of note, we did not detect any rolling behavior either in the absence of E-selectin at any shear stress examined or in the presence of human recombinant L-selectin protein (data not shown), suggesting that E-selectin is required for the rolling behavior.

Figure shows no significant difference in the rolling velocity between unlabeled and anti-PSMA J591-488 labeled MDA cells at shear stress ranging from 0.5-1 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>. The mean rolling velocities at 0.5 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> were 5.27<underline>+</underline> 1.38 and 5.23 <underline>+</underline> 1.85 µm/sec in unlabeled and J591-488 labeled MDA cells, respectively. At higher shear stresses, a significant difference was observed between the two categories of MDA cells. Histogram shows the results from three separate experiments combined together. UnL= unlabeled MDA cells, Lab= J591-488 labeled MDA cells. Data is represented as Mean <underline>+</underline> SD.</p>

                <title>E-selectin-mediated interactions in CTCs derived from prostate cancer patients</title>
                <p>We next determined whether CTCs derived from PCa patients would interact with E-selectin similar to MDA PCa cells. PBMCs from ~6 ml (5.4-7.5) of whole blood were obtained from 17 individual patients (27 blood samples) with metastatic PCa, and incubated with mAb J591-488. Following labeling, 21 samples underwent anti-CD45 depletion; while in 6 samples, no anti-CD45 depletion was performed. We first ran six patient samples without anti-CD45 depletion. Subsequently, to avoid contaminating leukocytes that could potentially decrease the chance of CTCs interacting with the surface, we employed anti-CD45 depletion to enrich for the CTC population. The recovery rate of this technique was 60-70% using PSMA expressing PCa cells (data not shown). Each patient sample was perfused over E-selectin-coated microtube surfaces at 0.6 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> generating a wall shear rate of 60<sup>-s</sup>, which is within the range of physiological wall shear rate in postcapillary venules [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. PCa CTCs labeled with mAb J591-488 were identified in 23 samples, and the median number of CTCs detected using offline video analysis was nine (range 0-270) (<xref rid="pone-0085143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nine of 23 (39.1%) and 10/23 (43.5%) of patient samples showed rolling/tethering and stable adhesion, respectively. The E-selectin mediated interactions observed in prostate CTCs comprised mostly tethering and stable adhesion with very few CTCs showing rolling behavior. When we assessed clinical state at the time of sample collection and processing, we noted that CTCs from samples of patients experiencing a clinical response were significantly less likely to have E-selectin-mediated interactions compared to CTCs from clinically progressing patients (<xref rid="pone-0085143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 0.0% vs. 61.9%, respectively, <italic>p</italic>=0.016). Anti-CD45 depletion did not have an effect on E-selectin-dependent interactions in CTCs (<xref rid="pone-0085143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, sample 1, 13, 17, 21, 22, 25); although, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some CTCs were lost during anti-CD45 depletion process. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085143.s006">Video S3</xref> shows a video from one patient sample demonstrating the interaction of CTCs with E-selectin. These results provide direct physical evidence that prostate CTCs expressing PSMA interact with E-selectin and suggest that prostate CTCs possess E-selectin ligand(s) (ESLs) on their cell surfaces. </p>

                <title>Expression of cell surface markers for CTC-Endothelial interactions</title>
                <p>E-selectin expressed on activated ECs interacts with a variety of ESL present on circulating leukocytes and tumor cells. These ESLs express a unique carbohydrate motif, sLe<sup>x</sup> which appears to be required for ESL binding [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At the same time, chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 mediate the adherence of prostate cancer cells to ECs, facilitating tumor invasiveness and metastatic progression. Xing et al. showed that stable downregulation of CXCR4 inhibits CXCL12-stimulated PCa adhesion to ECs [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In light of these studies, we decided to examine for the presence of both CXCR4 and sLe<sup>x</sup> in prostate CTCs. After anti-CD45 depletion, PBMCs were immunostained for PSMA (to positively identify a prostate CTC), EpCAM (to confirm epithelial origin), CXCR4 and sLe<sup>x</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The conditions and imaging parameters for four color immunofluorescence were rigorously established using cell lines including MDA, PC3, KG1, as well as PBMCs obtained from healthy donor blood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085143.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085143.s002">S2</xref>). These imaging parameters were then applied to patient derived CTCs. Immunostaining was performed on three of the patients with a relatively high CTC number as determined by CELLSEARCH<sup>®</sup> CTC System (&gt;50 CTCs/2.7 ml blood). Interestingly, 100% of the total CTCs (470/470) in these three patients expressed CXCR4; while KG1 cells (negative control) did not show any surface CXCR4 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085143.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, sLe<sup>x</sup> antigen showed a wide range of expression levels in CTCs quantified by sLe<sup>x</sup> MFI and compared to either leucocytes (highly positive), MDA cells (moderately positive), and PC3 cells (negative). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g004">Figure 4</xref>, 89/203 (43.8%; patient 1), 95/155 (61.3%; patient 2), and 84/112 (75%; patient 3) cells were moderately positive for sLe<sup>x</sup> (MFI 20-100) while 5.4%, 1.9%, and 18.8%, cells, respectively, demonstrated high sLe<sup>x</sup> expression (MFI &gt;100). </p>

                <title>Cytokine-mediated upregulation of E-selectin in HUVECs</title>
                <p>To validate that E-selectin-mediated interactions occur physiologically, we used HUVECs as a biological model to demonstrate E-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions in tumor cells [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Upon cytokine stimulation with IL-1β or TNF-α, <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis of E-selectin occurs in HUVECs; whereas, unstimulated ECs express low levels of E-selectin [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Since conventional primary HUVECs have substantial technical constraints (e.g., early senescence in culture), we investigated the use of ECs expressing the adenoviral E4ORF1 gene to facilitate the study of CTC-E-selectin interactions [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of note, E4ORF1-expressing HUVECs were previously shown to exhibit enhanced survival without causing cellular transformation, while the angiogenic function and growth factors-responsiveness were preserved [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We first compared the upregulation of E-selectin expression in primary and E4ORF1 HUVECs. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting both confirmed expression of E-selectin by HUVECs following a 4 h incubation with 50 ng/ml IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g005">Figure 5 A and B</xref>). By western blotting, in the presence of IL-1β, two protein bands were detected between 100-130 KDa in both the HUVECs, with the higher molecular weight depicts the posttranslational modification, especially glycosylation [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, in unstimulated primary and E4ORF1 HUVECs, a minimal amount of E-selectin protein was detected by western blotting, whereas none was detectable by immunofluorescence (data not shown). We next performed a functional assay measuring the rolling behavior of MDA cells on both primary and E4ORF1 HUVECs using a parallel-plate flow chamber. Laminar flow chamber devices such as parallel-plate flow chamber are ideal to study cell-cell adhesive interactions [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The mean rolling velocity of MDA cells at 1 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> shear stress was 6.35 <underline>+</underline> 3.43 (primary HUVECS) and 5.94 <underline>+</underline> 3.92 µm/sec (E4ORF1 HUVECs), <italic>p</italic>=0.74, NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, E4ORF1 HUVECs (referred to hereafter simply as HUVECs) were used for further analyses based on their comparable E-selectin expression, similar capacity to support rolling, and convenience.</p>

                <title>E-selectin mediated-interactions between prostate cancer cells and ECs</title>
                <p>To confirm that E-selectin mediates interactions between PCa cells and HUVECs, we measured the rolling behavior of MDA cells in the presence of neutralizing anti-E-selectin antibody. We performed these experiments using Bioflux Microfluidics technology by Fluxion Biosciences. Similar to the parallel-plate flow chamber, the Bioflux microfluidics system is a perfusion device providing a controlled laminar flow chamber to study cell-cell interactions [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The Bioflux system was selected at this point because of its reduced sample volume requirement and easier setup procedure compared with the parallel-plate flow chamber, allowing more flexibility while working with rare cells such as CTCs. MDA cells were perfused over HUVECs and the rolling velocity of MDA cells on HUVECs was determined under 3 conditions: a) unstimulated HUVECs, b) IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs, and c) IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs plus anti-E-selectin neutralizing Ab. The mean rolling velocity of MDA cells at 0.5 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> was 3.72 <underline>+</underline> 2.1µm/sec on IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs and 27.1 <underline>+</underline> 3.64 µm/sec on IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs plus anti-E-selectin neutralizing Ab, <italic>p&lt;0.0005</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This increase in the rolling velocity in the presence of E-selectin blocking antibody is consistent with the interpretation that the number of E-selectin binding sites has been significantly decreased and are unavailable for binding. Prior studies show a direct correspondence between rolling velocity and the surface density of available selectin binding sites [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Notably, a significant difference was observed in the rolling behavior between IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs and IL-1β stimulated HUVECs plus E-selectin neutralizing Ab (<italic>p&lt;0.005</italic>) at all shear stresses ranging from 0.5-4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, there was a drastic decrease in the number of rolling cells in both of these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085143-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Cells on unstimulated HUVECs (control) did not exhibit any rolling behavior at shear stresses ranging from 1-4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>; while at 0.5 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> shear stress, only 10 MDA cells were found rolling with a significantly higher rolling velocity than IL-1β stimulated HUVECs (<italic>p &lt;0.0005</italic>). To exclude Fc-mediated interactions, IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs were incubated with anti-ICAM-1 antibody and the mean rolling velocities were found to be similar to IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs (p=0.27, NS, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085143.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). The binding of anti-ICAM-1 antibody to HUVECs was confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085143.s003">Figure S3B and C</xref>). Overall, these results strongly suggest that the expression of E-selectin in IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs is the primary determinant of rolling behavior in PCa cells.</p>

                <title>E-selectin-mediated interactions of prostate cancer CTCs with ECs</title>
                <p>We next validated the role of E-selectin in CTC-endothelial interactions by perfusing prostate CTCs derived from patients over IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs incubated with anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody. For these experiments, we first tested the Bioflux Microfluidics system. In our hands, the Bioflux microfluidic system was suboptimal for study of CTC-Endothelial interactions, as it introduced cell aggregation in the chamber, likely because of the presence of contaminating RBCs in PBMC preparations, which disturbed the laminar flow and made it difficult to assess (data not shown). Therefore, we used the parallel-plate flow chamber for further studies on CTCs. After anti-CD45 depletion and anti-PSMA J591-488 labeling, PBMCs were split into two equal fractions. One-half of each patient sample was perfused over IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs and the other half was perfused over IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs incubated with anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody, at 0.6 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> shear stress. CTCs were detectable in 3 of 4 metastatic PCa patients analyzed. CTC-HUVEC interactions were predominant in IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs (median 5; range, 4-10); while in IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs in the presence of anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody showed fewer CTC-HUVEC interactions or none at all (median 1; range, 0-3) (<xref rid="pone-0085143-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). After perfusion over HUVECs, we examined the flow-through of the patient samples collected in a dish to ensure the presence of CTCs. We observed the presence of CTCs (J591-488 labeled) in the flow-through of both IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs and IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs plus neutralizing anti-E-selectin antibody. Collectively, these results provide evidence that CTCs from PCa patients are capable of interacting with ECs specifically via E-selectin. </p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Studies examining the role of E-selectin in tumor metastasis typically use cultured human tumor cells [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and suggest that E-selectin is critical to the metastatic process[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patient derived tumor cells circulating in peripheral blood provide a unique reagent to study and validate this hypothesis. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that CTCs derived from PCa patients’ peripheral blood can be studied <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and found physical interactions between CTCs and E-selectin under physiological shear flow. These results support the concept that prostate CTCs represent a dynamic tumor-derived population that allows real time tracking of their interactions with E-selectin expressing ECs.</p>
              <p>A major limitation in studying human CTC-endothelial physical interactions has been the challenge of identifying and detecting low number of CTCs among millions of circulating blood cells. PSMA is expressed on virtually all prostate cancers, with the highest levels in metastatic lesions [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], thereby, presenting an attractive cell surface antigen to identify and label prostate CTCs. Anti-PSMA J591 antibody allowed the identification of prostate CTCs due to rapid internalization of anti-PSMA J591-488 antibody complex into the targeted cell following Ag-Ab binding [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of note, others, including us, have used anti-PSMA J591 antibody to identify and characterize CTCs from human subjects [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. </p>
              <p>By using MDA PCa cells, a cell line shown to interact with E-selectin, [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we determined the effect of mAb J591-488 on rolling behavior. Under physiological flow conditions, both unlabeled and J591-488-labeled MDA cells showed comparable rolling, tethering and stable adhesion on both E-selectin-coated surface and E-selectin-expressing HUVECs. We then found that CTCs from PCa patients similarly demonstrated rolling/tethering and stable adhesions on E-selectin-coated surfaces. Selectins primarily promote transient adhesive interactions of tethering and rolling, and integrins tend to mediate firm adhesion, however, surprisingly CTC/E-selectin interactions were mainly of tethering and firm adhesive behavior rather than rolling adhesions under shear flow. This was observed both in patient samples perfused on E-selectin coated microtubes and on stimulated HUVECs. However, the CTC/E-selectin interactions observed over HUVECs included very small numbers of patient samples. In line with our observation, it has been reported that besides rolling behavior, different tumor types can firmly adhere on E-selectin independent of integrins [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, Kitayama et al suggested that the firm arrest of tumor cells on E-selectin surfaces might be attributed to the distribution of selectin ligands on the cell surface [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This suggests that E-selectin can mediate both initial docking of CTCs, observed as rolling and tethering, and a further locking step, as observed by firm adhesion. Several studies provide evidence that the interaction between tumor cells and ECs expressing E-selectin is clinically significant because of its association with metastasis. Colon cancer cell clones showed a direct correlation between ability to bind to E-selectin expressing ECs and metastatic potential [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while a subpopulation of colon cancer cells initiated the process of diapedesis after adhering to activated HUVECs expressing E-selectin [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Given the importance of E-selectin-mediated interactions in tumor cells, where tumor cell/E-selectin interactions culminate in tumor cell transmigration, it can be postulated that PCa CTC/E-selectin adhesion may be the trigger required for the initiation of CTC transmigration and formation of a secondary metastatic niche. Notably, in our study, not all CTCs from the same patient exhibited interactions with E-selectin, suggesting a heterogeneous population of prostate CTCs having different phenotypic and functional characteristics. </p>
              <p>In the present report, it was also found that the clinical response of CRPC patients significantly correlates with CTC/E-selectin interactions, with no samples demonstrating interactions during period of clinical response, but many instances of interactions during periods of tumor progression. Interestingly, 4 paired samples that were collected on the same patients at times of tumor progression vs response demonstrated CTC/E-selectin interactions during progression that disappeared with successful systemic therapy resulting in clinical response. However, no conclusion can be drawn regarding E-selectin-mediated interactions and metastasis based upon these data alone. Prospective studies with a larger cohort of patients are required. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with our concept that CTC/E-selectin-mediated interactions can parallel the clinical response in CRPC patients.</p>
              <p>The tethering and adhesion of CTCs with E-selectin suggests that prostate CTCs possess functional ESL(s) on their cell surface. E-selectin ligand activity on PCa cells is attributed to the expression of both sLe<sup>x</sup> bearing glycoprotein and glycosphingolipids. Sialyl Lewis X is a terminal component of glycans attached to many proteins and lipids, and detected by HECA-452 antibody. Several studies showed that the presence of sLe<sup>x</sup> epitope correlates with E-selectin ligand activity [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], however, it was subsequently established that sLe<sup>x</sup> is necessary but not sufficient for ESL activity [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on the sLe<sup>x</sup>-reactive glycoproteins, various E-selectin ligand candidates have been identified. These include, but not all, the HECA-452 antigen bearing PSGL-1 (CLA), a glycoform of CD44 (HCELL), ESL-1, CD24, death receptor 3, L-selectin, and β2 integrins [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. PSGL-1/CLA has been shown to bind all the three selectins and have been observed as the major E-selectin glycoprotein ligand present on prostate tumor cells [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Detection of sLe<sup>x</sup> has shown a direct association between its presence and grade of prostate cancers [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Poorly differentiated prostate tumor cells exhibit a stronger sLe<sup>x</sup> staining than normal prostate epithelial cells [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on immunocytochemical staining of an enriched population of CTCs, we found that a small percentage of CTCs in different patients expressed a considerably higher amount of sLe<sup>x</sup>, equivalent to sLe<sup>x</sup> staining of PBMCs obtained from healthy donor blood. Similarly, immunohistochemical analysis of prostate tissue microarrays showed heterogeneous sLe<sup>x</sup> staining with 38% of high-grade prostate tumors exhibiting high staining intensity, and only 15% of low-grade prostate tumors showing high sLe<sup>x</sup> immunostaining [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Given the importance of sLe<sup>x</sup> antigen to ESL activity, CTCs expressing high sLe<sup>x</sup> may represent an aggressive subpopulation of CTCs that can potentially extravasate and metastasize to bone and other organs. Besides sLe<sup>x</sup>, there is a compelling evidence that chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, also mediate metastasis [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In contrast to the heterogeneous expression of sLe<sup>x</sup>, we found that 100% of CTCs expressed CXCR4. Of note, a recent study evaluating the expression of CXCR4 on CTCs obtained from solid tumor patients showed that 82% of the patients expressed CXCR4; however, no correlation was found between the presence of CXCR4 and liver and lung metastasis [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. </p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study confirms the presence of E-selectin-mediated interactions in PCa CTCs under physiologic shear stress conditions, providing a route to initiate the process of transendothelial migration and metastasis. Moreover, the significant correlation between the clinical response and CTC/E-selectin interactions are supportive of our pre-clinical hypothesis and justify additional prospective investigation. Although our study did not identify the precise ESL(s) present on CTCs that are necessary for E-selectin interactions, both the presence of sLe<sup>x</sup> antigens and physical interaction of CTCs with E-selectin strongly indicate the presence of ESLs on prostate CTCs. Additional studies elucidating the expression of ESL(s) on PCa CTCs interacting with E-selectin compared with non-interacting PCa CTCs may help broaden our understanding of the metastatic heterogeneity and potentially provide a target to block metastatic spread. </p>
