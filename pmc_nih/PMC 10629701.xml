                <p>The latent viral reservoir (LVR) remains a major barrier to HIV-1 curative strategies. It is unknown whether receiving a liver transplant from a donor with HIV might lead to an increase in the LVR because the liver is a large lymphoid organ. We found no differences in intact provirus, defective provirus, or the ratio of intact to defective provirus between recipients with ART-suppressed HIV who received a liver from a donor with (n = 19) or without HIV (n = 10). All measures remained stable from baseline by 1 year posttransplant. These data demonstrate that the LVR is stable after liver transplantation in people with HIV.</p>

            <p>The latent viral reservoir (LVR) remains one of the major barriers in curative strategies for people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) [<xref rid="jiad241-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The LVR is established early in infection, augmented throughout periods of active viral replication, and persists primarily in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, even in the presence of suppressive antiretroviral therapies [<xref rid="jiad241-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several strategies aimed at eliminating the LVR or inducing durable immunologic control of HIV have been evaluated in clinical trials, and while a small number of PWH have achieved durable antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free remission [<xref rid="jiad241-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="jiad241-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], no broadly applicable and effective therapeutic approach targeting the LVR has been identified.</p>
            <p>Previous studies have monitored the LVR over time in kidney transplant recipients with HIV who received organs from donors with and without HIV [<xref rid="jiad241-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In these kidney recipients, despite a dramatic initial reduction in the LVR size among those receiving lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy, the reservoir reconstituted within 1 year, and there were no differences in the LVR size among those receiving lymphocyte nondepleting immunosuppression induction therapy or by allograft donor HIV status [<xref rid="jiad241-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="jiad241-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, one as yet unanswered question is whether the size of the LVR changes with liver transplantation from a donor with or without HIV into PWH. The liver is a secondary lymphoid organ that contains a substantial number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and also contains the largest population of tissue-resident macrophages in the body [<xref rid="jiad241-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Accordingly, the liver may be a tissue reservoir of HIV, because HIV DNA and RNA have been found in human hepatocytes [<xref rid="jiad241-B8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>] and liver macrophages, even in the presence of suppressive ART [<xref rid="jiad241-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jiad241-B10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>]. Consequently, the LVR could decrease among individuals who receive an HIV-negative allograft and increase among individuals who receive an HIV-positive allograft. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the LVR using the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) longitudinally in liver transplant recipients with ART-suppressed HIV participating in the HOPE in Action multicenter trial who received lymphocyte nondepleting therapies and allografts from donors with or without HIV.</p>

                <title>Study Populations and Procedures</title>
                <p>Liver transplant recipients with HIV who received an organ from a deceased donor with or without HIV were longitudinally followed in the HOPE in Action multicenter, national clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02602262 and NCT03734393) [<xref rid="jiad241-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Participant and donor inclusion criteria have been previously described [<xref rid="jiad241-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recipient CD4 cell count, viral load, and ART regimens at the time of transplantation were obtained by extraction from clinical records. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from recipients and processed as previously described [<xref rid="jiad241-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, PBMCs were collected at the time of transplant, prior to immunosuppression induction therapy (week 0), and at subsequent time points following transplant (approximately at 13, 26, and 52 weeks posttransplant, if applicable). All liver transplant recipients were given lymphocyte nondepleting immunosuppressive therapies. Participants had to have a minimum of 1 follow-up time point after transplant to be included in this study.</p>

                <title>Laboratory Testing</title>
                <p>IPDA was performed as previously described (Accelevir Diagnostics) [<xref rid="jiad241-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs via immunomagnetic selection, and genomic DNA was isolated. IPDA is a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay that targets 2 regions (the packaging signal and envelope) in the HIV genome that are either frequently deleted or hypermutated in defective proviruses [<xref rid="jiad241-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Droplets positive for both fluorescence signals are scored as intact, while 1 fluorescence signal can either indicate (1) a hypermutation and/or 3′ deletion, or (2) a 5′ defective provirus. Double-negative droplets contain either no provirus or defects in both amplicon regions [<xref rid="jiad241-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Of the 87 samples, 82 amplified and the 5 samples that failed to amplify were thus excluded from the analysis.</p>
                <p>Donor viral load was evaluated using the Abbot Realtime viral load assay. The limit of detection was 40 copies per mL. Donor CD4 cell counts were measured using the T-cell subset assay (Becton Dickinson).</p>

The primary outcomes evaluated included intact provirus, defective provirus, ratio of intact/defective provirus frequencies, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts per μL of blood stratified by donor allograft HIV status. The intact provirus and defective provirus frequencies were analyzed both by frequency per million CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and frequency per mL of blood, as previously described [<xref rid="jiad241-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. All values were log<sub>10</sub> transformed, except the ratio of intact/defective provirus frequencies, to approximate normal distributions. The biomarkers were plotted over time with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) and <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-based approximation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were performed in R 4.1 (R-Core Team) and Stata/MP, version 15.1 (StataCorp).</p>

                <p>There were 29 liver transplant recipients with a median age of 58 years old (interquartile range [IQR] = 57–64), and the majority were male (83%, n = 24) and white (59%, n = 17) (<xref rid="jiad241-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most recipients were on integrase inhibitor (INSTI)-containing ART (83%, n = 24), less than one-quarter were on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-containing ART (17%, n = 5), and only 1 (3%) was on protease inhibitor-based ART. Five received a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant. No recipients received lymphocyte-depleting induction immunosuppression.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The persistence of the LVR remains the largest barrier in HIV curative strategies. Because of its size and function as a secondary lymphoid organ and its potential to harbor a significant number of HIV-infected cells, we examined whether transplantation of a liver from a donor with HIV or without HIV affects the size of the LVR in the recipient. Our study was designed to answer this question, because we could compare the size of the LVR longitudinally after liver transplantation from donors with or without HIV. Here, liver transplant recipients with HIV had a slight decline in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts, but the ratio of intact to defective provirus did not change dramatically. No differences were observed in recipients who received a liver from a donor with or without HIV. By 1 year posttransplant, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts, intact provirus, and defective provirus were all comparable to baseline levels. This study demonstrates that the LVR is stable after transplantation of large lymphoid organs, such as the liver, in people with ART-suppressed HIV.</p>
              <p>Studies have shown that kidney transplant patients who received lymphocyte nondepleting therapies had a slight reduction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts, and intact and defective provirus initially, but levels returned to baseline [<xref rid="jiad241-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Liver transplant recipients in this study receiving lymphocyte nondepleting therapies show similar results. The ratio of intact to defective provirus did not change over time, suggesting that latently infected cells are able to be maintained even in larger lymphoid organ transplantations. However, liver macrophages have been shown to have higher infective levels than hepatocytes, and future studies should evaluate whether the LVR changes in these cellular reservoirs [<xref rid="jiad241-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jiad241-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>There are a few limitations to this study. All participants were on suppressive ART and therefore the findings cannot be generalized to transplant recipients who interrupt HIV treatment. Moreover, this study only assessed proviruses within CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are in circulation. Therefore, it is possible that if other cells populations were included in the analysis (eg, liver-resident CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), changes in the size of the LVR posttransplant may have been observed. When using the IPDA, not all samples had amplification, and thus some had to be excluded (n = 5). Participants receiving liver transplants were only given lymphocyte nondepleting therapies, and results could not be compared to those who received lymphocyte depleting therapies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found that PWH who received a large lymphoid organ transplantation, such as a liver, have similar intact and proviral trajectories compared to patients who received kidney transplants. Moreover, the ratio of intact/defective provirus did not change overtime in liver patients who received lymphocyte nondepleting therapies and no differences were observed among recipients of livers from donors with or without HIV. It is reassuring that the LVR does not seem to increase with this novel transplantation practice.</p>
