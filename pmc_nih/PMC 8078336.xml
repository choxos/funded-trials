                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 inhibitor, demonstrated promising single-agent activity in untreated patients with various cancer types. The phase II KEYNOTE-427 study evaluated efficacy and safety of single-agent pembrolizumab in treatment-naive patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC; cohort A) and advanced non-ccRCC (cohort B). Results of cohort A are reported.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>In this open-label, single-arm phase II study, patients with advanced ccRCC received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for ≤ 24 months. The primary end point was objective response rate by RECIST, version 1.1.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>In the total population (N = 110), median time from enrollment to data cutoff was 35.9 (range, 29.5-40.3) months. Objective response rate was 36.4% with four (3.6%) complete responses and 36 (32.7%) partial responses; disease control rate was 58.2% (95% CI, 48.4 to 67.5). Most patients (68.2%) had a decrease in target lesions, including 30.9% with a reduction ≥ 60%. Median duration of response was 18.9 (range, 2.3-37.6+) months; 64.1% of responders had a response ≥ 12 months (Kaplan-Meier). Median progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 11.0). Median overall survival was not reached; 12-month and 24-month overall survival rates were 88.2% and 70.8%, respectively. Durable responses were observed across all International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium categories. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 30.0% of patients, of which colitis and diarrhea were most frequent.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Single-agent pembrolizumab showed promising antitumor activity as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced ccRCC, with durable responses across International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium categories. Safety and tolerability profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy was comparable to what has been previously described in other tumor types.</p>

              <p>Recent efforts in immunotherapeutic approaches for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have focused on immune checkpoint inhibition, specifically with agents that block the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab was approved in 2015 for use in patients whose disease progressed following prior antiangiogenic regimens, including first-line vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), because of its overall survival (OS) benefit relative to everolimus.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Subsequent clinical trials evaluated anti-PD-1–based and anti-PD-L1–based combination therapies for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, and results of those studies led to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 inhibitor (CheckMate 214); pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, plus axitinib, a TKI (KEYNOTE-426); and avelumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, plus axitinib (JAVELIN Renal 101) in that patient population.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor–based combination therapy is changing the front-line RCC treatment landscape, little is known about the efficacy of single-agent PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in this setting. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with recurrent or advanced or metastatic ccRCC who received no prior systemic anticancer therapy.</p>

                <p>KEYNOTE-427 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02853344">NCT02853344</ext-link>) was a single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter (61 sites), global (10 countries) phase II trial. The study was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Protocol was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee for each participating institution. All patients provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>Pembrolizumab was administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Study treatment was continued until confirmed progressive disease (PD); unacceptable toxicity or intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of treatment; 35 doses of pembrolizumab had been received; or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. Following identification of radiologic PD by the investigator, clinically stable patients were permitted to remain on study treatment while waiting for investigator-determined PD confirmation (irRECIST) by means of follow-up imaging at ≥ 4 weeks after first PD observation.</p>

                <title>Patient Characteristics</title>
                <p>Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with locally advanced or metastatic, histologically confirmed ccRCC were included in the study. Patients were required to have measurable disease per RECIST, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1); a Karnofsky performance status score ≥ 70; and adequate organ function. Patients were not permitted to have previously received systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic RCC. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for RCC was acceptable if completed &gt; 12 months before allocation. Patients were required to provide tissue samples for biomarker analysis.</p>
                <p>Use of systemic steroid therapy exceeding 10 mg daily dose of prednisone or equivalent or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days before allocation was not permitted. Patients with active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis, current pneumonitis or history of noninfectious pneumonitis, active infection requiring systemic therapy, active hepatitis C, or history of hepatitis B or HIV infection were excluded from participation in the study.</p>

                <title>Study Assessments</title>
                <p>The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR), as assessed per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary end points were duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review, OS, and safety and tolerability. Exploratory end points included ORR, DOR, and DCR in relation to (1) PD-L1 status, (2) International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) RCC risk status,<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and (3) presence of any sarcomatoid differentiation.</p>
                <p>Imaging assessments included computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and were performed at baseline, at week 12, then every 6 weeks until week 54, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients with initial evidence of PD by RECIST v1.1 continued study treatment (if clinically stable) at the discretion of the investigator until repeat imaging (irRECIST) ≥ 4 weeks later was obtained by the investigator. Study treatment could be continued beyond confirmed disease progression provided patients were deriving a clinical benefit, as assessed by investigator, and upon consultation with the sponsor. Baseline bone scans were performed at screening; at weeks 18, 30, 42, and 54, and then every 24 weeks thereafter. A bone scan was required for confirmation of a complete response (CR). PD-L1 expression was assessed using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) assay, and “PD-L1-positive” was defined as a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 1. CPS was calculated as the ratio of numbers of tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages expressing PD-L1 to the total number of viable tumor cells in the biopsy specimen × 100. Sarcomatoid differentiation was evaluated by local pathologist and captured in the electronic database. Adverse events (AEs) were graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and monitored throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab (≤ 90 days for serious AEs and &gt; 90 days for serious treatment-related AEs).</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>ORR was calculated as the proportion of patients in the analysis population (all patients as treated) who had a CR or partial response (PR). The 95% CI for ORR was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method based on binomial distribution. Final response assessments were determined by a central adjudication process that took all imaging results into consideration. The Kaplan-Meier method for censored data was used to estimate OS, PFS, and DOR from the date of the first exposure to pembrolizumab to the database cutoff date. Efficacy and safety were assessed in all treated patients. Because no statistical comparisons were made, no statistical adjustments were performed. Database cutoff was February 24, 2020.</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, KEYNOTE-427 is the first study to date to evaluate the clinical utility of a single-agent PD-1 inhibitor in a large cohort of previously untreated patients with advanced ccRCC. In this single-arm phase II trial, pembrolizumab monotherapy showed promising antitumor activity in the overall population (ORR, 36.4%; CR, 3.6%; PR, 32.7%) and across key subgroups that included all IMDC risk groups, and in patients with tumors with high and low PD-L1 status, and patients with tumors with sarcomatoid differentiation. Fifteen of 40 responding patients experienced ongoing responses at data cutoff. The median DOR was 18.9 months and 64.0% of responders maintained their response for at least 12 months, and the 24-month OS rate was 70.8%. Taken together, these results show that pembrolizumab monotherapy has durable antitumor activity in untreated patients with advanced ccRCC.</p>
              <p>The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the current study is comparable to the previously observed safety profiles of pembrolizumab in other tumor types.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Commonly reported grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs associated with pembrolizumab monotherapy were colitis (6.4%) and diarrhea (3.6%), and 17 (15.5%) patients discontinued treatment because of treatment-related AEs. One patient died of treatment-related pneumonitis. Immune-mediated AEs, including hypothyroidism, colitis, rash, and pneumonitis, have been reported to occur with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Guidelines for managing immune-related AEs recommend corticosteroid treatment for grade 2-4 events, holding immunotherapy until grade 2/3 events return to grade 1, and discontinuing immunotherapy for grade 4 events.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the current study, 28 of 54 immune-related AE episodes required concomitant corticosteroid use with a high starting dose (≥ 40 mg/d prednisone or equivalent) being chosen to manage 24 of the events.</p>
              <p>Although the measurement of PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment by immunohistochemistry has been shown to be predictive of response to anti-PD-1 agents in some cancer types (eg, non–small-cell lung cancer), there is currently no definitive predictive biomarker in RCC.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Results of the current study showed that a higher percentage of patients with tumors of CPS ≥ 1 than CPS &lt; 1 experienced CRs and PRs, which resulted in a higher ORR in patients with tumor CPS ≥ 1 (44.2 <italic>v</italic> 29.3%); however, a sizable proportion of patients with tumor CPS &lt; 1 still experienced tumor response. A high percentage of patients with sarcomatoid RCC had an objective response (ORR, 63.6%), but the sample size was small. Recent correlative studies associated with randomized trials have suggested that tumor histology (eg, sarcomatoid) and DNA and RNA analyses of the tumor microenvironment may sharpen our ability to predict response to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapy.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Future analysis of KEYNOTE-427 will evaluate biomarkers associated with response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Given that, the data from this study and others suggest that the development of a predictive model that examines both tumor and immune infiltrate may be possible to help guide clinical decision making in patients with advanced RCC.</p>
              <p>Other primary tumor sites, such as lung cancer, have observed greater activity with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in the first-line relative to the second-line setting.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This difference between first-line and second-line checkpoint inhibitor activity was likely observed with our study when compared with studies of other PD-1 inhibitors in RCC in the second-line setting.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These differences may be the result of treatment settings, as patients treated after VEGFR TKIs may have relatively few immune responsive tumors (eg, those with sarcomatoid histology), or of the distinct levels of activity of the agents tested. Additionally, there appeared to be differences in efficacy between our study and recent studies of PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in the first-line setting in ccRCC<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; this may suggest that blocking the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 may have a therapeutic benefit over blocking only the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 in RCC. Given these observations, the role of PD-1 versus PD-L1 blockade, as well as the differences in the first-line versus the second-line activity, merits further evaluation in ccRCC.</p>
              <p>In recent years, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 blocking agents have been evaluated in various combination regimens as first-line treatment for patients with RCC. Results of three pivotal studies showed improved efficacy of the combinations over the single-agent VEGF-TKI (eg, sunitinib) comparators, which led to the FDA approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, and avelumab plus axitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A lower percentage of patients who received pembrolizumab monotherapy in our study experienced treatment-related AEs and discontinued because of treatment-related AEs than was seen with the current FDA-approved combinations.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although the single-arm nature of this study limits conclusions, the safety data of the current analysis suggest that pembrolizumab monotherapy may be better tolerated than the approved PD-1–based and PD-L1–based combination therapies.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy may therefore be a potential treatment option for those patients who are not able to tolerate an immunotherapy-based combination. The efficacy and safety outcomes of the current analysis provide some insight into the potential contribution of the PD-1 pathway blockade component of various combination regimens. Firm conclusions on how much of the efficacy and safety observed with the combination therapies is attributable to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibition will require properly designed randomized trials.</p>
              <p>Despite the limitations inherent in a single-arm design, the results of this study show that pembrolizumab monotherapy has promising antitumor activity and acceptable safety as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced ccRCC, including patients across all IMDC risk groups and patients with PD-L1–positive and PD-L1–negative tumors. Results presented herein help to place the results of current—and possibly future—pembrolizumab combination therapies for patients with advanced RCC in context. These results also provide support for the exploration of single-agent PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting (KEYNOTE-564, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03142334">NCT03142334</ext-link>) and for further exploration of pembrolizumab monotherapy and novel pembrolizumab-based combination regimens in patients in the advanced disease setting.</p>
