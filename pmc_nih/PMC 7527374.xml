                  <title>Aims/hypothesis</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The glucosuria induced by sodiumâglucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition stimulates endogenous (hepatic) glucose production (EGP), blunting the decline in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. We hypothesised that, in response to glucosuria, a renal signal is generated and stimulates EGP. To examine the effect of acute administration of SGLT2 inhibitors on EGP, we studied non-diabetic individuals who had undergone renal transplant with and without removal of native kidneys.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This was a parallel, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study, designed to evaluate the effect of a single dose of dapagliflozin or placebo on EGP determined by stable-tracer technique. We recruited non-diabetic individuals who were 30â65Â years old, with a BMI of 25â35Â kg/m<sup>2</sup> and stable body weight (Â±2Â kg) over the preceding 3Â months, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;42Â mmol/mol (6.0%). Participants had undergone renal transplant with and without removal of native kidneys and were on a stable dose of immunosuppressive medications. Participants received a single dose of dapagliflozin 10Â mg or placebo on two separate days, at a 5- to 14-day interval, according to randomisation performed by our hospital pharmacy, which provided dapagliflozin and matching placebo, packaged in bulk bottles that were sequentially numbered. Both participants and investigators were blinded to group assignment.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Twenty non-diabetic renal transplant patients (ten with residual native kidneys, ten with bilateral nephrectomy) participated in the study. Dapagliflozin induced greater glucosuria in individuals with residual native kidneys vs nephrectomised individuals (8.6âÂ±â1.1 vs 5.5âÂ±â0.5Â g/6Â h; <italic>p</italic>â=â0.02; data not shown). During the 6Â h study period, plasma glucose decreased only slightly and similarly in both groups, with no difference compared with placebo (data not shown). Following administration of placebo, there was a progressive time-related decline in EGP that was similar in both nephrectomised individuals and individuals with residual native kidneys. Following dapagliflozin administration, EGP declined in both groups, but the differences between the decrement in EGP with dapagliflozin and placebo in the group with bilateral nephrectomy (Îâ=â1.11âÂ±â0.72Â Î¼molÂ min<sup>â1</sup>Â kg<sup>â1</sup>) was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.03) than in the residual native kidney group (Îâ=â2.56âÂ±â0.33Â Î¼mol min<sup>â1</sup>Â kg<sup>â1</sup>). In the population treated with dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion was correlated with EGP (<italic>r</italic>â=â0.34, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). Plasma insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, prehepatic insulin:glucagon ratio, lactate, alanine and pyruvate concentrations were similar following placebo and dapagliflozin treatment. Î²-Hydroxybutyrate increased with dapagliflozin treatment in the residual native kidney group, while a small increase was observed only at 360Â min in the nephrectomy group. Plasma adrenaline (epinephrine) did not change after dapagliflozin and placebo treatment in either group. Following dapagliflozin administration, plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine) increased slightly in the residual native kidney group and decreased in the nephrectomy group.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions/interpretation</title>
                  <p id="Par4">In nephrectomised individuals, the hepatic compensatory response to acute SGLT2 inhibitor-induced glucosuria was attenuated, as compared with individuals with residual native kidneys, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated stimulation of hepatic glucose production via efferent renal nerves occurs in an attempt to compensate for the urinary glucose loss (i.e. a renalâhepatic axis).</p>

              <p id="Par13">Sodiumâglucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce plasma glucose concentration by blocking renal glucoseâsodium cotransport and inducing glucosuria. The expected reduction in plasma glucose concentration is partially offset by a concomitant increase in endogenous glucose production (EGP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. When non-diabetic individuals are given the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion increases promptly, yet the fasting plasma glucose concentration remains unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These results suggest that the induction of glucosuria generates a signal that increases EGP to precisely match the amount of glucose appearing in the urine. The increase in plasma glucagon concentration and concomitant reduction in plasma insulin concentration cannot explain this âparadoxicalâ and rapid increase in EGP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Because changes in plasma glucagon and insulin concentrations cannot explain the increase in EGP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], we hypothesised that a renal neuronal signal is generated in response to glucosuria and leads to the stimulation of hepatic glucose production. Consistent with this hypothesis, renal sympathetic denervation for the treatment of resistant hypertension has been shown to improve glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Kidney transplantation offers another model of kidney denervation. We have recently assessed the effect of administration of 10Â mg dapagliflozin or placebo after an overnight fasting in 14 individuals (six with type 2 diabetes and eight without diabetes) who received a renal transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In both diabetic and non-diabetic transplanted individuals, SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated stimulation of EGP was still fully apparent. The degree of renal denervation in these individuals is, however, difficult to evaluate due to the persistence of the native kidney and its related innervation. The objectives of the current study were to examine whether a neuronal loop may exist between the kidney and the liver, accounting for sustained hepatic glucose production after administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Non-diabetic renal transplant recipients with eGFR &gt;60Â mlÂ min<sup>â1</sup> [1.73Â m]<sup>â2</sup> (using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] formula) were recruited from the Nephrology Unit of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine at the University of Pisa, Italy. All participants underwent renal transplantation because of autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease. Inclusion criteria were: age 30â65Â years; BMI 25â35Â kg/m<sup>2</sup> with stable body weight (Â±2Â kg) over the preceding 3Â months; and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;42Â mmol/mol (6.0%). Ten renal transplant patients with both residual native kidneys (<italic>n</italic>â=â10) and ten renal transplant patients who underwent bilateral nephrectomy prior to transplantation comprised the study population. Participants were on a stable dose of combinations of the following immunosuppressive medications: mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus; prednisone &lt;7.5Â mg/day; or ciclosporin. Individuals on &gt;7.5Â mg/day prednisone, Î²-blockers or any other medication known to affect sympathetic/parasympathetic activity or glucose metabolism were excluded. Participants with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIâIV heart failure or BP &gt;140/90Â mmHg were excluded.</p>
                <p id="Par15">The Institutional Review Board of the University of Pisa and the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) approved the study in accordance with principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent before participating in the study.

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par16">This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin on glucose metabolism in two groups of renal transplant participants: ten individuals with residual native kidneys and ten individuals who had undergone pre-transplant bilateral nephrectomy. At baseline, all participants had their medical history taken and underwent physical examination and routine laboratory tests to exclude major organ system disease other than polycystic kidney disease. Participants underwent two identical study procedures at a 5- to 14-day interval, with the administration of 10Â mg dapagliflozin or placebo in randomised double-blind fashion. Dapagliflozin and matching placebo were packaged in bulk bottles and delivered to the hospital pharmacy, which managed the code list and supplied the study drug to the investigators on the study day using a binary randomisation code provided by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">www.random.org</ext-link> (accessed 1 October 2016). All procedures were performed after a 10Â h overnight fast, at the Diabetes Section of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa. On admission, after voiding, a vein on the dorsum of the hand was cannulated retrogradely and the hand was placed in a heated box (60Â°C) for arterialised blood sampling. A second catheter was placed in the contralateral antecubital vein and a primed (22Â Î¼mol/kg), constant (0.22Â Î¼molÂ min<sup>â1</sup>Â kg<sup>â1</sup>) infusion of [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose was initiated at â120Â min and maintained until the end of study (360Â min). During the last 30Â min of the equilibration period (from â30Â min to 0Â min) indirect calorimetry was performed using a ventilated hood system (Vmax 22Â N; Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, CA, USA). Arterialised blood samples were obtained at â120, â30, â20, â10 and 0Â min for the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), lactate, alanine, Î²-hydroxybutyrate (Î²OHB), pyruvate concentrations and [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose enrichment.</p>
                <p id="Par17">After the 2Â h (â120 to 0Â min) equilibration period and baseline blood and urine collection for measurement of glucose and nitrogen excretion, participants received dapagliflozin (10Â mg) or placebo orally (at 0Â min). Arterialised blood samples were drawn every 20Â min for plasma glucose measurement and [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose enrichment and every 60Â min for measurement of insulin, C-peptide and glucagon. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured at 240, 340 and 360Â min. Lactate, alanine, Î²OHB and pyruvate concentrations were measured at 180, 240 and 360Â min. Indirect calorimetry was performed during the last 30Â min of the study (330â360Â min) and urine was collected from 0Â min to â360Â min for measurement of glucose and nitrogen excretion. Participants remained fasted until the conclusion of the experimental procedure during which they were allowed to have no more than 1Â l of water. Participants were instructed not to change their dietary habits and energy expenditure during the entire study participation.</p>

                <p id="Par19">Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Analox GM9 Analyzer; Analox Instruments, London, UK). Plasma insulin, C-peptide (Pantec, Turin, Italy) and glucagon (DIAsource ImmunoAssays, Belgium) concentrations were measured by RIA. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured by ELISA (DIASource ImmunoAssays). Plasma lactate, alanine, Î²OHB and pyruvate were measured by in-house automated spectrophotometric enzymatic methods on a Beckman UniCel DXC600 Synchron Analyser (Fullerton, CA, USA). Intra-assay and between-assay coefficients of variation were &lt;1% and &lt;5%, respectively, for all hormone and substrate measurements. Urinary nitrogen excretion was determined by chemiluminescence (Antek MultiTek Analyzer PAC, TX, USA). [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose and [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose (glucose-13C6), used as internal standards, were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA, USA). Plasma isotope enrichment was measured on an AB Sciex API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Concord, ON, Canada), equipped with ESI Turbo-V source and coupled with Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC system (Santa Clara, CA, USA) working under gradient conditions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par32">In a recent study we showed that, in kidney transplanted individuals with and without type 2 diabetes, administration of a single dose of dapagliflozin was associated with a compensatory increase in EGP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is indicative of a minor role for kidney innervation in modulating the liver adaptative response. In that study, all transplanted individuals had their native kidneys in place. In the present study we went further in testing the hypothesis of a kidneyâliver neuronal loop by comparing transplanted individuals with and without residual native kidneys. We found that, in the post-transplant group with both residual native kidneys, the stimulation of EGP by dapagliflozin-induced glucosuria was apparent, as evidenced by the failure of EGP to decline significantly when compared with the decline observed with the placebo (between-group differences in EGPâ=â1.45âÂ±â0.39Â Î¼molÂ min<sup>â1</sup>Â kg<sup>â1</sup>; Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous data from individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], as well as from transplant recipients who retained their native kidneys, and with clinical observations made in normal-glucose-tolerant individuals with familial renal glucosuria in whom normal fasting plasma glucose levels were maintained despite markedly elevated rates of urinary glucose excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">Following dapagliflozin administration, EGP declined in both the nephrectomy and residual kidney groups, but the decrement in EGP was greater in the bilateral nephrectomy group. The difference between the decline in EGP following dapagliflozin vs placebo treatment (1.11âÂ±â0.72Â Î¼molÂ min<sup>â1</sup>Â kg<sup>â1</sup>) was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.03) than that observed in renal transplant patients with both residual native kidneys. A number of mechanisms could explain these observations: (1) activation of the renal nerves transmit a signal to the liver to increase hepatic glucose production and complete renal denervation (i.e. transplanted kidney and removal of both native kidneys) results in loss of the neural signal; (2) the native but not the transplanted kidney releases a metabolite(s) and/or hormone(s) into the circulation that travels to the liver and stimulates the hepatic glucose production; (3) the renal nerves exert a local effect on the kidney to stimulate renal glucose production; or (4) some combination of these, or yet to be defined mechanisms.</p>
              <p id="Par34">To gain insight into the neuroendocrine response to SGLT2 inhibition, we measured the plasma concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline, being aware that the majority of released noradrenaline is taken up again by the nerve terminals and accurate assessment of noradrenaline turnover requires tracers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Baseline plasma adrenaline levels were not significantly different in the two groups and did not change following dapagliflozin or placebo. Plasma noradrenaline concentration was similar at baseline in both groups and increased slightly in the residual native kidneys group after dapagliflozin while it decreased in the nephrectomy group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). A dedicated study using <sup>3</sup>H-labelled noradrenaline would be required to examine whether the central nervous system plays any role in the dapagliflozin-induced stimulation of EGP.</p>
              <p id="Par35">A greater increase in urinary glucose excretion following dapagliflozin administration was observed in the group with residual native kidneys compared with the bilateral nephrectomy group. This difference cannot be explained by the differences in GFR, since this was similar in both groups. It is possible that in individuals with residual native kidneys, tubular reabsorption of glucose was impaired even though the residual native kidneys contributed significantly to the GFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Further, kidney innervation may play an important role in the expression and/or function of SGLT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">In the present study we observed a significant correlation between the amount of glucose lost in the urine and the stimulation of EGP following dapagliflozin administration in renal transplant patients with or without residual native kidneys. This novel physiological response is essential in order to prevent hypoglycaemia and maintain the fasting plasma glucose concentration constant at the basal level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), although it remains to be determined whether glucose handling in the kidney is the trigger for such a signal. Osmotic diuresis caused by SGLT2 inhibition can account for a rapid plasma volume contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A 5% reduction in plasma volume can then activate the sympathetic nervous system which, in turn, could activate liver gluconeogenesis. Irrespective of the triggering signal, the rapidity of the response also suggests the presence of a neural signal. Since neither the plasma glucagon or insulin/C-peptide concentrations nor the glucagon:insulin ratio changed after administration of dapagliflozin in either group of transplanted individuals, it is unlikely that these hormones are involved in the SGLT2 inhibitor-induced stimulation of EGP. Following the initial report of Bonner et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] claiming a direct stimulatory effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the alpha cell, recent studies in a more physiological setting showed that increased plasma glucagon during SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is unlikely to result from direct inhibition of SGLT2 in alpha cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Despite the fact that co-administration of a glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) prevents SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated increases in plasma glucagon and decreases in plasma insulin, EGP increases persisted, making it unlikely that EGP increases are the consequence of increased glucagon:insulin ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">Following dapagliflozin administration, plasma Î²OHB levels increased progressively and significantly, more pronouncedly in individuals with residual native kidneys (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The increase in plasma Î²OHB concentration cannot be explained by changes in plasma insulin or glucagon concentrations or by altered plasma NEFA levels. Surprisingly, the change in Î²OHB levels occurred in the absence of changes in the rate of substrate oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Whether the higher levels of noradrenaline in nephrectomised individuals contributed to the increase in Î²OHB concentrations remains to be determined.</p>
              <p id="Par38">We and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] have reported previously that the decline in plasma glucose concentration following dapagliflozin treatment is associated with a shift of energy metabolism from glucose to fat oxidation in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In the present study we did not observe any change in substrate oxidation rates, consistent with findings from our previous studies in non-diabetic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is not surprising because in individuals with normal glucose tolerance, dapagliflozin-induced glucosuria is not associated with any change in circulating substrate (glucose, NEFA) or hormone (insulin, glucagon) concentrations.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Potential limitations of the present study include its short duration, making extrapolation of results to chronic dapagliflozin administration tenuous. The number of participants is relatively small but the study population was carefully selected to include only individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease to ensure a homogeneous group of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further, it is difficult to find large numbers of participants who undergo bilateral nephrectomy prior to kidney transplantation. In addition, the chronic use of prednisone should be considered as this may have had an effect in sustaining basal EGP, though a similar stable dose was used in all study participants.</p>
              <p id="Par40">In summary, by studying nephrectomised transplant recipients we have identified a unique opportunity to uncover a fundamental aspect of physiology that regulates the renalâhepatic axis.</p>
              <p id="Par41">The present results implicate the existence of a novel neuronal axis linking the kidney and the liver that modulates EGP in response to the glucosuria induced by SGLT2 inhibition. We hypothesise that SGLT2 inhibition activates efferent renal nerves, generating a signal that augments endogenous (hepatic) glucose production, where the stimulus is elaborated to elicit a sympathetic stimulation to sustain glucose production to compensate for the urinary glucose loss and, thus, prevent hypoglycaemia. In keeping with our hypothesis, persistence of native kidneys (i.e. preserved kidney innervation) was associated with a full compensatory EGP activation, while kidney denervation (i.e. individuals with kidney transplantation with no residual native kidneys) was associated with a blunted compensatory EGP increase.</p>
