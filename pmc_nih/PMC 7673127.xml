                <p id="Par1">In this multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II investigator-sponsored neoadjuvant trial with funding provided by Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline (TRIO-US B07, Clinical Trials NCT00769470), participants with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (<italic>N</italic> = 128) were recruited from 13 United States oncology centers throughout the Translational Research in Oncology network. Participants were randomized to receive trastuzumab (T; <italic>N</italic> = 34), lapatinib (L; <italic>N</italic> = 36), or both (TL; <italic>N</italic> = 58) as HER2-targeted therapy, with each participant given one cycle of this designated anti-HER2 therapy alone followed by six cycles of standard combination chemotherapy with the same anti-HER2 therapy. The primary objective was to estimate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of surgery in each of the three arms. In the intent-to-treat population, we observed similar pCR rates between T (47%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 30–65%) and TL (52%, 95% CI 38–65%), and a lower pCR rate with L (25%, 95% CI 13–43%). In the T arm, 100% of participants completed all protocol-specified treatment prior to surgery, as compared to 69% in the L arm and 74% in the TL arm. Tumor or tumor bed tissue was collected whenever possible pre-treatment (<italic>N</italic> = 110), after one cycle of HER2-targeted therapy alone (<italic>N</italic> = 89), and at time of surgery (<italic>N</italic> = 59). Higher-level amplification of HER2 and hormone receptor (HR)-negative status were associated with a higher pCR rate. Large shifts in the tumor, immune, and stromal gene expression occurred after one cycle of HER2-targeted therapy. In contrast to pCR rates, the L-containing arms exhibited greater proliferation reduction than T at this timepoint. Immune expression signatures increased in all arms after one cycle of HER2-targeted therapy, decreasing again by the time of surgery. Our results inform approaches to early assessment of sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy and shed light on the role of the immune microenvironment in response to HER2-targeted agents.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Although trastuzumab substantially improves disease-free survival for patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, approximately one-quarter of trastuzumab-treated patients with early-stage disease experience recurrence during the first decade, signifying that treatment resistance remains a challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy appears to be a surrogate marker for disease-related outcomes including event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) in HER2+ or triple-negative subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, the neoadjuvant setting is increasingly utilized for the clinical investigation of promising new therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. When added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab has been shown to improve pCR rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and EFS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Synergistic interactions between trastuzumab and the oral HER1/HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib have been observed in HER2-overexpressing cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and in HER2+ tumor xenograft models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Clinically, dual HER2 inhibition using lapatinib and trastuzumab led to significant improvement in OS compared to lapatinib alone in the metastatic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Several neoadjuvant trials have compared regimens containing dual HER2-blockade utilizing trastuzumab and lapatinib to regimens with only trastuzumab or lapatinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. While all studies showed numerically higher pCR rates using dual HER2-blockade compared to trastuzumab, only two<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> reached a statistically significant difference. These trials differed based on chemotherapy backbone, treatment order, duration of HER2-directed therapy, and definition of pCR, which could partially explain these conflicting results.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A major goal of the translational science from these and other trials of HER2-targeted therapy has been to identify tumors that are highly sensitive to treatment, such that therapy can be potentially de-escalated, as well as those with primary resistance, where new strategies may be needed. Multiple putative biomarkers of HER2-targeted therapy response have emerged from these efforts, but there is no validated biomarker that predicts pCR with adequate accuracy to allow patient stratification. Lower estrogen receptor (ER) expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and higher HER2 amplification or expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> are associated with a higher pCR rate. Using PAM50 expression-based intrinsic subtyping, tumors that classify as the HER2-enriched intrinsic subtype display a higher rate of pCR after regimens containing HER2-targeted therapy than HER2+ tumors that classify as other intrinsic subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Tumors with evidence of immune activation (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> or higher expression of immune gene signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>) also have higher rates of pCR. These varying response signatures interrelate with each other, and while using multiple signatures together increases the ability to predict pCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, how each may independently contribute to HER2-targeted therapy sensitivity or resistance is uncertain. It is also unknown how the tumor may change across HER2-targeted therapies: one study of the combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib suggested that a change in intrinsic subtype to normal-like after a short course of HER2-targeted therapy might predict pCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and that, with the combination of HER2-targeted therapy and endocrine therapy, HR+ /HER2+ tumors frequently converted to the luminal A subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, to date, very few studies have assessed change in tumor cell gene expression and microenvironmental composition throughout a period of HER2-targeted therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Here we report the results of phase II randomized neoadjuvant trial aimed at evaluating the pCR rates associated with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy. In this study, tumor (or tumor bed) samples were collected prior to treatment, after one cycle of run-in HER2-targeted therapy (without chemotherapy), and at surgery after completion of HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy added. The histopathologic and expression data from these samples allow assessment of how biomarkers correlate with one another and validation of how they perform as predictors of pCR. Importantly, the on-treatment biopsies were also used to assess how these biomarkers, signaling pathways, and microenvironmental composition change throughout HER2-targeted therapy.</p>

The trial enrolled participants at 13 centers in the United States, with the first participant enrolled 12/22/2008 and the final enrolled 12/20/2012; enrollment ended after four years with 130 of 140 planned participants. The first 20 participants were allocated to trastuzumab and lapatinib (TL) and the next 110 participants were randomized to one of three arms, each with one run-in cycle of HER2-targeted therapy alone followed by six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin combined with the same HER2-targeted therapy to which they were randomized: trastuzumab (T), lapatinib (L), or trastuzumab and lapatinib (TL) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two participants withdrew from the study prior to starting any treatment and were excluded from efficacy and safety analyses. Of 128 participants, 25 came off their assigned study treatment prior to surgery, but still completed surgery (10 in L, 15 in TL). One participant (L) did not complete surgery. All 128 participants were included in the intent to treat (ITT) analyses. Baseline characteristics (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were well balanced between the three treatment arms. The median patient age was 48 (range 27–78). Hormone receptors were negative (HR−) in 56 participants (44%) and were ER and/or progesterone receptor-positive (HR+) in 72 (56%).

                <p id="Par7">Pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as an absence of viable invasive tumor cells in the breast and examined axillary lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgery, was the primary endpoint of the study. The overall pCR rate for the ITT population was 43% (95% confidence interval (CI) 34–52%), including 47% (95% CI 30–65%) in T, 25% (95% CI 13–43%) in L, and 52% (95% CI 38–65%) in TL (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Distribution of treatment arms, HR status, and pCR outcomes were similar between the expression-evaluable cohorts and the overall cohort (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par11">We began by examining the associations between pre-treatment clinical and expression-based subtypes and pCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). HR-status was associated with a higher pCR rate (odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% CI 1.0–5.0)), as was strong (3+) HER2 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (OR 11.9 (95% CI 2.1–304)) and higher HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio (the ratio of HER2 copy number to centromere 17 copy number) (<italic>ß</italic> = 0.13 (95% CI 0.01–0.26)). The association between HER2 FISH ratio and pCR was driven by a high pCR rate in tumors with very high HER2 FISH ratios: the pCR rate among the 8.6% of tumors with FISH ratio ≥ 12 was 85.7%, while among tumors with FISH ratio &lt; 12 it was 39.2% with no association between FISH ratio and pCR in that group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.41).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the cohort prior to treatment.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Selected clinical and expression characteristics and tumor subtypes across the cohort.

                <p id="Par12">Despite HER2 amplification based on FISH as determined locally per ASCO-CAP 2007 guidelines, expression profiling revealed that 19 tumors (17.3%) had low baseline expression of HER2 and other genes in the amplicon (log10 ratio &lt; −0.10) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Seventeen of these tumors with adequate remaining tissue were retested centrally by FISH, with 70.6% confirmed to be HER2 amplified and 29.4% found to be HER2 non-amplified. Of the low-HER2 expressing tumors, 84.2% (16/19) were HR+ and only 21.1% (4/19) had a pCR, suggesting that low HER2 expression in spite of HER2 amplification may correlate with lack of response.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Using the expression of genes beyond the hormone receptors and HER2 itself, breast cancer can be subcategorized into five intrinsic subtypes (including HER2-enriched) or into eleven integrative subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (including IC5, representing the majority of HER2+ tumors). Intrinsic subtype has previously been shown to correlate with response to HER2-targeted therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this cohort, 56% of tumors were the HER2-enriched intrinsic subtype and 78% of tumors were IC5. For both subtyping approaches, the HER2 subtype trended toward a higher pCR rate than the non-HER2 subtypes: 50.0% vs 33.3% (OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.98–4.41)) for HER2-enriched vs other intrinsic subtypes; 47.7% vs 25.0% (OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.0–8.1)) for IC5 vs other integrative subtypes. The greater proportion of tumors classifying as IC5 versus HER2-enriched was driven by 23% of IC5 tumors classifying as the normal-like intrinsic subtype, which may encompass tumors with high non-tumor cell contamination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that integrative cluster assignment may be less sensitive to differences in tumor cellularity than intrinsic subtype assignment. Indeed, tumor cellularity, defined as the proportion of evaluated cells representing invasive tumor cells, was found to be higher in HER2-enriched tumors than in normal-like tumors (17.7% vs 6.4%, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 5.5e-6), while no such difference was observed between IC5 and other integrative clusters (15.5% vs 13.0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.39) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par14">Because HER2-enriched and IC5 tumors tended to be HR- (48.4% of HER2-enriched vs 33.3% of other, <italic>χ</italic>2 <italic>p</italic> = 0.16; 48.4% of IC5 vs 16.7% of other, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0096) and to have higher HER2 FISH ratios (mean HER2 FISH ratio 7.4 in HER2-enriched vs 5.8 in other, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.050; 7.5 in IC5 vs 4.2 in other, <italic>p</italic> = 1.7e-5), it is plausible that these clinically assessed variables dictate in part the association between tumor subtype and pCR. Our base multivariate model of pCR included nodal status, receipt of trastuzumab (Arms 1 and 3 vs Arm 2), HR-status, and HER2 FISH ratio (tumor size and patient age did not correlate with pCR in univariate models). Indeed, when intrinsic subtype or integrative subtype were added to this model, they were not significant while the original four variables remained so (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par15">To assess variability between pre-treatment tumor gene expression profiles, we calculated single sample gene enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> for 10 curated gene sets: tumor signaling gene sets (ESR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, ERBB2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>), an immune gene set designed to capture immune infiltration in tumors (ESTIMATE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, immune gene sets identified as relevant to HER2-targeted therapy response (GeparSixto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, Teff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and N9831<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>), a stromal gene set designed to capture stromal infiltration in tumors (ESTIMATE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and two stromal gene sets (Desmedt and Farmer) identified as relevant to breast tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). We similarly calculated ssGSEA scores for 38 of the Hallmark molecular signatures related to tumor processes and microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The Hallmark signatures captured similar processes to the curated signatures, with several processes likely reflecting the change in microenvironmental composition: for example, the Hallmark epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature correlated with the breast cancer stromal signatures (<italic>r</italic> = 0.86–0.91) and the Hallmark KRAS signaling signature correlated with the immune signature (ESTIMATE) (<italic>r</italic> = 0.76), suggesting each of these captured a relative change in the number of stromal or immune cells rather than differences between the tumor cells.</p>
                <p id="Par16">As expected, the highly correlated estrogen signatures were associated with pCR, the strongest being the Hallmark estrogen response early signature (univariate logistic regression <italic>p</italic> = 0.0017), including within HR+ tumors separately (<italic>N</italic> = 64, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012). The ERBB2 pathway (<italic>p</italic> = 0.38) and proliferation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.86) signatures did not associate with pCR. Stromal signatures have been linked to therapeutic response in breast cancer, including HER2+ disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, but in our cohort, there was no correlation between the stromal signatures and pCR. These results did not change when subsetted by treatment arm or by hormone receptor status. The breast cancer stromal signatures correlated well with each other (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.85) and less well with the general stromal signature (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56–0.76).</p>
                <p id="Par17">Immune gene sets were tightly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.81–0.90 for the ESTIMATE, GeparSixto, and Teff). One immune signature (N9831) was more distinct from the other three (<italic>r</italic> = 0.53–0.80), and also anti-correlated with proliferation (<italic>r</italic> = −0.46), suggesting it may combine information about tumor proliferation and immune infiltration. A higher percentage of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are dispersed in the stroma between the carcinoma cells and have been shown to predict therapeutic response in HER2+ breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, was associated with a higher expression-based immune score (GeparSixto immune score 0.21 for &gt;10% sTILs vs −0.054 for ≤5% sTILs, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 1.2e-5) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Tumors with &gt;10% stromal TILs trended toward higher pCR rate (OR 2.3 (95% CI 0.9–6.3)), and similarly, tumors with higher immune scores trended toward higher pCR rate: the most associated was GeparSixto (<italic>ß</italic> = 1.5 (95% CI −0.3–3.2)) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The trend toward higher immune infiltration predicting greater pCR was driven by the trastuzumab-containing arms, potentially consistent with a greater role of the immune system in response to the antibody trastuzumab than the small molecule inhibitor lapatinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (<italic>ß</italic> = 3.2 for TCH, <italic>ß</italic> = −0.5 for TCL, and <italic>ß</italic> = 1.9 for TCHL; interaction <italic>p</italic> = 0.20) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref><bold>)</bold>. Importantly, immune gene signatures correlated strongly with HR-status, itself associated with pCR: using GeparSixto, the mean immune score was 0.17 in HR-negative versus 0.02 in HR-positive (two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 5.5e-4). Interestingly, while we observed a trend toward increased immune infiltration correlating with pCR in the HR+ subgroup (<italic>ß</italic> = 2.1 (95% CI −0.4–4.8)) (not in the HR- subgroup), we also found that the ESR1 pathway score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> negatively correlated with immune infiltration among HR + tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Since decreased HR signaling and increased immune infiltration correlate strongly with each other, even within HR+ tumors, either or both may contribute to increased response to HER2-targeted therapies.</p>
                <p id="Par18">We next examined the prevalence of immune cell subtypes before treatment using CIBERSORT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and immunoStates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which each use bulk gene expression data to deconvolve immune subpopulations. To limit multiple hypothesis testing, we examined the ten cell types with the largest mean prevalence across both deconvolution methods (plasma cells, B cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, NK cells, M0 macrophages, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells). While per histopathology, most of the inflammatory infiltrate was assessed to be lymphocytic (mean 91.8%), the predominant population(s) per CIBERSORT was macrophages (mean 48.8%) and per immunoStates were CD4+ T cells (mean 24.9%) and mast cells (mean 22.4%) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A, B</xref>). Using CIBERSORT, CD8+ T-cell fraction was higher in HR- tumors (two-sided FDR-adjusted <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.045), and no cell subtype correlated with pCR (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C, D</xref>). Using immunoStates, M1 macrophage fraction was higher in HR− tumors (adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.048) and NK cell fraction higher in HR+ tumors (adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.0048), and similarly no cell type correlated with pCR (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4E, F</xref>). Across both immune deconvolution methods, with higher immune content, CD8+ T-cell (CIBERSORT: <italic>r</italic> = 0.43, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 3.2e-5, immunoStates: <italic>r</italic> = 0.27, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.042) and M1 macrophage (CIBERSORT: <italic>r</italic> = 0.27, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.47, immunoStates: <italic>r</italic> = 0.53, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 2.39e-8) fractions were higher. These immune cell subtypes and total immune content correlated in the same direction when stratifying by HR-status (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These results suggest that CD8+ T-cells and M1 (anti-tumor) macrophages may either infiltrate or be excluded from tumors separately from other immune cell subsets, and that similar temporal patterns of immune cell infiltration occur in HR– and HR+ tumors.</p>

While the lack of cellularity was unlikely to reflect an absence of tumor tissue after a single cycle of HER2-targeted therapy, interestingly, an on-treatment biopsy without carcinoma was modestly predictive of pCR (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.0–6.5)), suggesting biologically relevant patchiness of tumor occurring very early in treatment, though this variable was not significant when added to our base multivariate model of pCR (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), as absence of tumor was more common in the combination arm (χ2 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0079).</p>

Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, of 47 signatures (Teff-high excluded as only 3 genes), 20 signatures increased at FDR &lt; 0.1, including stromal and immune signatures, and 15 decreased, including proliferation, ESR1 signaling, and ERBB2 signaling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>); these results were similar when analyzing only the subset of tumors with known tumor present (correlation coefficient of the normalized enrichment scores <italic>r</italic> = 0.98) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We then used ssGSEA scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> for each of these signatures to quantify the degree of change in each signature across treatment per tumor. Many of the changed signatures correlated strongly with each other (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), but three categories of change appeared to be largely distinct: a decrease in proliferation, an increase in immune component (<italic>r</italic> = −0.19 between PAM50 proliferation and immune ESTIMATE scores, <italic>p</italic> = 0.069), and an increase in stromal component (<italic>r</italic> = −0.15 between Farmer stromal and PAM50 proliferation scores, <italic>p</italic> = 0.17; <italic>r</italic> = 0.39 between Farmer stromal and immune ESTIMATE scores, <italic>p</italic> = 1.2e-4). While the various immune signatures correlated tightly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), we used the immune ESTIMATE gene set going forward, as it was designed to capture overall immune infiltration in tumors in an unbiased way, unlike the GeparSixto and Teff-high gene sets, which were designed to predict response.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Both ERBB2 signaling and ESR1 signaling were anti-correlated with immune infiltration and stromal infiltration, making it difficult to disentangle whether their observed decreases were solely a result of a reduction in tumor content relative to other cell types (with less ERBB2 and ESR1 signaling), or whether the tumor cells independently experienced a reduction in the activation of these pathways in response to treatment. We constructed a linear model that predicted ERBB2 (or ESR1) signaling from immune ESTIMATE and Farmer stromal scores, finding that observed ERBB2 signaling correlated with predicted ERBB2 signaling (<italic>r</italic> = 0.48) less than observed ESR1 signaling correlated with predicted ESR1 signaling (0.69) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Using IHC to assess change in ER protein expression on therapy (<italic>N</italic> = 73), we did not observe a reduction in the histochemical score (H-score) on treatment (rather, there was a trend toward increased ER expression: 60.2 pre-treatment vs 69.5 on-treatment, two-sided paired <italic>t-</italic>test <italic>p</italic> = 0.066), and on-treatment H-score correlated closely with pre-treatment H-score (<italic>r</italic> = 0.83) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The IHC results suggest that indeed the apparent reduction in ESR1 signaling observed globally was a result of change in microenvironmental composition rather than changes in the tumor cells themselves. In contrast, in a parallel study, in situ proteomic analysis performed on this cohort indicated that ERBB2 protein levels in tumor cells did decrease after 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>; thus, while increased immune and stromal components of the total sample likely contributed to the reduction in ERBB2 signaling seen in global gene expression, the tumor cells themselves also exhibited reduced ERBB2 expression.</p>
                <p id="Par24">None of the four major categories of change (proliferation, immune, stroma, and ERBB2 signaling) correlated with pCR (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), and in contrast to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> as well as protein data from this cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, on-treatment immune infiltration, whether assessed using immune score or stromal TILs, was no more predictive than pre-treatment immune infiltration (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). There were also no differences in the changes in signatures by HR status (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). However, two signatures were significantly different by arm (FDR &lt; 0.1, adjusting for 12 hypotheses): the stromal signature increased more with L than with T (FDR-adjusted two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.078), with TL intermediate, and the proliferation signature decreased more with TL than with T (FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.078), with L intermediate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). To confirm that these changes occurred in the tumor cells, we examined Ki67 IHC, recapitulating that the greatest proliferation reduction was seen with TL, followed by L, followed by T: the geometric mean of Ki67 percentage changed across treatment from 29.8% to 11.4% with TL (<italic>N</italic> = 25; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016), from 23.8% to 17.3% with L (<italic>N</italic> = 21; <italic>p</italic> = 0.13), and from 25.9% to 23.1% with T (<italic>N</italic> = 21; two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test of the log2 Ki67 values <italic>p</italic> = 0.17) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par25">Importantly, while proliferation and stromal signatures varied by treatment arm, immune signatures did not (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>); given the lack of a control arm undergoing repeated biopsy without intervening treatment, it is impossible to be certain whether the immune changes observed were related to HER2-targeted therapy or repeated biopsy. Indeed, we note that hemoglobin subunits (HBA1, HBA2, and HBB) were among the top 1 percent of genes to increase from pre- to on-treatment, likely reflecting the impact of the biopsy. While the increase in hemoglobin subunit expression did not correlate with the increase in immune expression (<italic>r</italic> = 0.06 between HBA1 expression and the immune ESTIMATE score), it remains possible that the immune changes observed were not related to the therapy itself.</p>

                <p id="Par26">A total of 59 tumor or tumor bed samples were collected at surgery after completion of combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, and as with the samples after 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy, the gene expression of each was compared against its matched pre-treatment tissue. Of these 59 surgical samples, 25 tumors had undergone pCR with no tumor remaining. For a subset (<italic>N</italic> = 39), histopathology from the region of the surgical resection used for gene expression analysis was re-assessed centrally, and here 73% of even the non-pCR cases showed no evidence of tumor in the analyzed sample. Thus, it was not possible to assess tumor changes after combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, and we focused our analyses on characterizing the immune and stromal changes observed in the tumor bed.</p>

Overall, the correlation between the GSEA normalized enrichment scores after HER2-targeted therapy and after combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy was <italic>r</italic> = 0.68. The major differences were in stromal and immune signatures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

                <p id="Par28">The immune signatures followed a similar pattern to the breast cancer-specific stromal signatures, increasing after HER2-targeted therapy alone, but decreasing after chemotherapy in combination with HER2-targeted therapy. Importantly, this result differed from in situ proteomic analysis on this cohort performed in a parallel study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, where immune cells increased at surgery compared to pre-treatment. This discrepancy is likely explained by the very low, often zero, tumor cellularity in the surgical samples on which bulk expression was assessed, as contrasted with the tumor enrichment strategy used for in situ proteomic analysis of a separate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded core: it is plausible that the larger tumor bed tissue is largely an immune desert, while localized immune cell infiltration continues to occur proximal to tumor cell islands. Indeed, the histopathologic data supports this hypothesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Stromal TILs, which by definition are tumor-adjacent, increased modestly after 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy (from 9.9% to 12.7%, two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.034), and, in the 14 tumors with non-zero cellularity samples both pre-treatment and at time of surgery, were stable after combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy (8.5% vs 9.5%, two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.70), consistent with continued immune infiltration occurring where the tumor was present. When we assessed for inflammatory cellularity across the entire slide, including samples with no tumor present, trends were consistent with the expression data: increased inflammatory cellularity on-treatment (from 6.1% to 8.0%, two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.16) and reduced inflammatory cellularity at surgery (from 5.9% to 3.5%, two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.16).</p>
                <p id="Par29">We used CIBERSORT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> to deconvolve the components of the immune infiltrate across HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). CIBERSORT absolute scores increased from pre-treatment (mean 0.55) to on-treatment (0.60; two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and returned to baseline at surgery (mean 0.54; <italic>p</italic> = 0.53 vs pre-treatment). After 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy, the three most significant changes compared to pre-treatment were a reduction in plasma cells (14.8% to 9.7%, two-sided paired <italic>t-</italic>test FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 6.6e-8), a reduction in M1 macrophages (10.2% to 7.7%, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 1.3e-5), and an increase in CD8 + T-cells (5.2% to 8.3%, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-2.5e-4). At time of surgery after combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, the two most significant changes compared to pre-treatment were a reduction in M1 macrophages (11.0% to 5.2%, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 5.0e-11) and an increase in NK cells (4.6% to 7.4%, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 9.4e-8).

              <p id="Par30">In this clinical trial, lapatinib plus trastuzumab did not improve pCR rate compared to trastuzumab alone when added to chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, while the omission of trastuzumab yielded lower pCR rates (TCL 25% compared to TCH 47% and TCHL 52%). Other trials have also shown that the anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab is superior to that of lapatinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The benefit of combining trastuzumab and lapatinib is less clear. While NeoALTTO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> showed a significantly improved pCR rate with 12 weeks of paclitaxel plus lapatinib and trastuzumab compared to one HER2-targeted agent plus paclitaxel, NSABP B-41<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and CALGB 40601<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> did not show such an improvement with dual-HER2 targeted therapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. Some of this discrepancy may be explained by the shorter course of chemotherapy with NeoALTTO compared to the other studies. However, each of these studies did show a numeric increase in pCR rate with lapatinib and trastuzumab compared to single-agent HER2-targeted therapy, while in this study, the rates were very similar when comparing TCH (47%) and TCHL (52%). Notably, in TRIO B07, a higher percentage of participants enrolled in TCH (100%) were able to complete all protocol-specified therapy prior to surgery compared to participants in the lapatinib-containing arms (69% in TCL and 74% in TCHL). In addition, the average relative dose intensity of therapy delivered to participants on TCH was higher (98%) compared to those treated on the lapatinib-containing arms (85% TCL and 86% TCHL). The dose reductions in the lapatinib-containing arms were necessitated by lapatinib-related toxicities and may have contributed to the decreased anti-tumor activity measured at the time of surgery.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In TRIO B07, whenever possible, both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were collected at three timepoints: pre-treatment, after 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy alone, and at surgery after completion of combination chemotherapy with HER2-targeted therapy. These serial specimens from the same patient permitted evaluation of multiple potential biomarkers of tumor sensitivity and resistance, as well as how these biomarkers relate to one another and how they change throughout therapy. As in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we find that tumors classified as the HER2-enriched intrinsic subtype have a trend toward higher pCR rate compared to other intrinsic subtypes. In this study, we also assessed integrative subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and similarly find a higher rate of pCR in IC5 as compared to the other integrative subtypes. The association of these breast cancer subtypes with response appears to be mediated, at least in part, by higher HER2 amplification and decreased HR expression in the HER2-enriched and IC5 subgroups, consistent with another report that intrinsic subtype was no longer associated with pCR when ESR1 and ERBB2 expression were included in a multivariate analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Among HER2+ tumors, HER2 amplification levels may not help predict which tumors will benefit from trastuzumab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, but it is plausible that it may help identify tumors that are very trastuzumab-sensitive, thus informing de-escalation approaches. Measures of pre-treatment immune infiltration, closely tied to HR signaling, may add some value to HR status and degree of HER2 amplification in predicting pCR, especially in HR+ tumors and especially with trastuzumab treatment (rather than lapatinib).</p>
              <p id="Par32">We identified numerous expression changes across HER2-targeted therapy including decreased proliferation, increased immune cell infiltration, increased stromal signatures, and decreased ERBB2 signaling. We similarly observed a high rate of change of intrinsic subtype across therapy, generally to normal-like, while integrative subtype was more stable. Interestingly, proliferation was the least reduced with trastuzumab alone and the most with dual HER2-directed therapy. The observation that lapatinib may be more effective than trastuzumab at suppressing proliferation has important implications for window of opportunity studies, where tumor proliferation is examined after short-term therapy to assess efficacy. Window of opportunity studies have largely been used to assess endocrine therapy, but are increasingly being applied to other targeted therapies as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that, when comparing two therapies, it is possible that the one that is more effective in terms of pCR and survival (here, trastuzumab) may actually induce an equivalent or lesser reduction in proliferation. Indeed, it is plausible that the greater proliferation reduction with lapatinib renders the cells less sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy, reducing pCR rates. It is also plausible that lapatinib induces more immediate changes in the tumor cells, but trastuzumab renders them more immunogenic. Notably, we observed a greater increase in stromal signal with lapatinib compared to trastuzumab, potentially consistent with lapatinib’s unique interactions with the stromal compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, but immune signatures increased similarly across all arms. Because this study did not include a control arm where participants underwent on-treatment biopsy without intervening therapy, we cannot rule out that the observed on-treatment immune infiltration related to repeated biopsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> rather than HER2-targeted therapy itself. However, we note that differences in the degree of immune infiltration observed were associated with pCR in the parallel in situ proteomic study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, suggesting that on-treatment immune infiltration was of biological significance.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The increase in immune signatures, especially in CD8-positive T-cells, that we observed after 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy was eliminated by time of surgery, likely because the sample at surgery was largely devoid of tumor, as this result contrasts to what was observed with tumor enrichment and in situ proteomic profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy was also associated with a relative increase in NK cells, similar to what was observed in the proteomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, and a relative decrease in M1-like (anti-tumor) macrophages. Whether the loss of the M1 macrophage signature was related to the tumor cells themselves, where parainflammation may resemble macrophage infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, or to a shift in macrophage phenotype toward a pro-tumor state as suggested with chemotherapy in HR+ /HER2− breast cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, remains to be determined. These immune cell subset changes across therapy may have implications for optimal timing of immune interventions, with manipulations that affect CD8-positive T-cell activity perhaps most useful with HER2-targeted therapy prior to chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Of the many expression changes we observed in tumors after 14–21 days of HER2-targeted therapy, none predicted pCR, in contrast to in situ proteomic profiling on this same cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Notably, many of the on-treatment tumor specimens had no or very low tumor cellularity, reflecting real-world biopsy conditions but potentially obscuring important biological differences. Additionally, intra-tumor heterogeneity in response and poor correlation of RNA signatures with tumor phenotype could contribute to bulk RNA profiling of a single biopsy being a suboptimal approach to quantitatively compare changes across therapy. Thus, while our work identifies the changes across treatment that occur with HER2-targeted therapy with and without chemotherapy, additional approaches are needed to discern relevant biological variability in these changes that may predict therapeutic sensitivity or resistance. The uniform collection of tissue in this trial – both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded – allows these questions to be explored further using a variety of novel technologies. Future studies would also benefit from longitudinal sampling, including on-treatment biopsies, as well as uniform tissue collection and storage such that iterative learning is possible from the initial characterization.</p>

                <p id="Par38">TRIO B07 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, three-arm phase II study conducted by the Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO) study group. Participants were stratified based on baseline tumor size (≤3 cm and &gt;3 cm) and hormone receptor status (HR+ vs HR−). A random permuted block design was utilized for randomization, with the block size varied between 3 and 6 at random. The study statistician generated the random allocation sequence. TRIO Liaison Coordinators enrolled the participants and assigned them to the intervention arms. The study included three treatment groups (Arms 1–3). All participants received docetaxel plus carboplatin (TC) every 3 weeks. In addition, participants in Arm 1 received trastuzumab (TCH), Arm 2 received lapatinib (TCL), and Arm 3 received both trastuzumab and lapatinib (TCHL). Eligible participants were treated initially with a run-in cycle of HER2-targeted therapy without chemotherapy (lapatinib at a dose of 1000 mg per day orally for 21 days and/or trastuzumab 8 mg/kg IV once) followed by six cycles of the assigned HER2-targeted treatment plus docetaxel and carboplatin given every three weeks. The six cycles of chemotherapy consisted of concomitant docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV) and carboplatin (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL/min) plus trastuzumab (6 mg/kg IV) or lapatinib (1000 mg/day orally days 1–21) or both trastuzumab and lapatinib at the respective doses. Participants were required to receive primary prophylactic white cell growth factors after each chemotherapy cycle. Treatment was discontinued upon completion of all prescribed protocol therapy, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity necessitating the discontinuation of study drug, or withdrawal of participant consent. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study from day 1 through the end of study treatment visit, 28 days after surgery or from the time of study discontinuation. Toxicity was graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. No more than seven cycles of trastuzumab and/or lapatinib (run-in and six cycles with chemotherapy) and no more than six cycles of TC chemotherapy were to be given prior to surgery. After the sixth cycle of chemotherapy, participants deemed to be surgical candidates proceeded with standard of care breast surgery and axillary lymph node sampling. We note that in an open-label clinical trial, there is the potential for selection bias as participants may elect drop out if randomized to an arm they perceive to be associated with less benefit. This could cause imbalance in measured/unmeasured baseline characteristics of patients in the treatment arms. Another potential source of bias is early discontinuation in an arm due to toxicity of the regimen. This could affect the pCR rate as well as correlative biomarker analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par39">To test the safety of TCHL, the first 20 participants enrolled were assigned to Arm 3. A safety analysis of the combination therapy was performed after these first 20 participants prior to opening up the expansion. The remaining participants were randomized evenly (1:1:1) to the three arms. The first 6 participants took part in a dose escalation evaluation of carboplatin (first 3 participants treated at an AUC of 5 mg/mL/min, next 3 treated at AUC 6 mg/mL/min) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), trastuzumab (6 mg/kg), and lapatinib (1000 mg/day). Docetaxel and carboplatin were infused as per institutional practice with standard steroid and anti-emetic prophylaxis. Treatment could be delayed up to 21 days for toxicity. When a cycle was held for toxicity, all drugs were held to maintain concurrent dosing. Dose delays and reductions were permitted for carboplatin (to AUC 5) and docetaxel (to 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for toxicity including hematologic, hepatic, nervous system, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Dose reductions were not permitted for trastuzumab; however, dose delays were permitted. Dose delays and reductions (to 750 mg/day) were permitted for lapatinib-related diarrhea and moderate to severe cutaneous reactions.</p>
                <p id="Par40">All participants had an evaluation of cardiac function including measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by either multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram at baseline, after cycle 3 of chemotherapy, <underline>&lt;</underline>28 days of surgery, and as needed. Treatment with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib was to be permanently stopped and the participant taken off study in cases of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) or a significant drop in LVEF (&gt;10 points below baseline LVEF and below institutional lower limit of normal) confirmed by a second LVEF assessment within approximately three weeks.</p>
                <p id="Par41">End of study visit occurred 28 days after surgery or from the time of study withdrawal/discontinuation for any reason. After coming off study, all participants were allowed to receive therapy according to standard of care (radiation, endocrine therapy, maintenance trastuzumab) at the discretion of their treating physician. Clinical tumor assessments by physical examination were performed at baseline, before each cycle of therapy, and at the completion of all prescribed protocol therapy. Radiologic assessments to exclude macrometastases were performed if clinically indicated.</p>

                <title>Endpoints and statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par42">The primary objective was to investigate the clinical efficacy of each arm by estimating the total pCR rate defined as the absence of viable invasive tumor cells in both the breast and axillary lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgery (ypT0/is ypN0). The tumor pCR rate was determined for both the intent to treat (ITT) population (including all participants who received a dose of study drug, regardless of whether they completed all protocol-specified therapy) and for the evaluable participant population (including only those participants who completed the protocol-specified pre-surgical therapy and underwent definitive breast surgery). Pathology reports from definitive surgery were centrally reviewed for all participants enrolled on study who received at least one dose of study drug regardless of whether the participant completed protocol-specified therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Based on the literature, the pCR rate was estimated to be 40% for single biological agent treatment (trastuzumab) combined with multi-agent chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. A sample size of 56 participants was required to detect an absolute 20% difference in the pCR rate between the experimental treatment (with hypothesized 60% pCR rate) and the historical-control pCR rate (of approximately 40%) with a nominal one-sided 0.05 significance and 90% power using the exact binomial method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Rates of pCR were reported with 95% confidence intervals using the prop.test function in R.</p>
                <p id="Par44">As a secondary efficacy analysis, the pCR rates were to be compared between the arms using Chi-square tests in a pairwise setting with a two-sided type I error rate of 20%. With 60 participants in the combination arm and 40 participants in the single biological arm, this test would have 75% power for testing a difference in the pCR rates of 40% vs. 60% between the two arms (TCH or TCL vs TCHL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Another exploratory pairwise comparison of combined groups TCH and TCL vs TCHL would be performed in a similar fashion.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability including rate of CHF or a significant drop in LVEF (&gt;10% points from baseline and below the institutional lower limits of normal) for each of the three treatment arms. The safety analysis was conducted on all participants who received all or any portion of one infusion of any study drug. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the number and types of adverse events. Adverse events were compared using chi-squared (<italic>χ</italic>²) tests.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Because the first 20 women were enrolled to Arm 3 rather than being randomized, exploratory analyses of pathologic complete response (pCR) rates were also run excluding these 20. For these analyses, the overall pCR rate was again 43% (46/108), and for Arm 3 it was 55% (21/38) versus 52% when the first 20 were included. Rerunning the comparisons again revealed that pCR was significantly lower in Arm 2 compared to Arm 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and no significant differences were found between Arms 1 and 2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07) or between Arms 1 and 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.47).</p>
                <p id="Par47">When running the prespecified analyses for the evaluable participant population, the pCR for Arms 1, 2, and 3 were 47% (16/34), 28% (7/25), and 49% (21/43), respectively. For this set of analyses, none of the pair-wise comparisons using Chi-square were significant. Using logistic regression adjusting for the stratifying factors of HR status and tumor size (≤3 cm versus &gt;3 cm), however, yielded a significant result when comparing Arm 2 to Arm 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04), but not for Arm 1 to Arm 2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10) or Arm 1 to Arm 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.88).</p>

                <p id="Par48">Tumor tissue was obtained by core biopsy prior to the administration of the run-in cycle of lapatinib and/or trastuzumab (pre-treatment samples) and 14–21 days after the start of the run-in cycle (on-treatment samples). A minimum of 4 core biopsies, using a 14-gauge needle, were taken at each timepoint, three of which were immediately snap-frozen and the fourth was formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), quantified by the Nanodrop One Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and quality (RNA Integrity Number, RIN value ≥ 5) was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA samples were labeled with cyanine 5-CTP or cyanine 3-CTP (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) using the Quick AMP Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies). Labeled RNA was purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Frequency of incorporation and total concentration of labeled RNA were determined using the Nanodrop One Spectrophotometer. In each case, 825 ng of a cyanine 5-CTP and a cyanine 3-CTP labeled RNA were applied to each slide. Slides were incubated for 16–17 hr at 65 °C. The slides were washed using wash buffer provided from Agilent then covered by ozone barrier as described in Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol. Slides were read using the Agilent Scanner (G2565CA), and the data were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (versions 10.7 and 11.0). Gene expression microarray experiments were performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome 44 K 2-color chip by comparing each baseline sample to a reference mix composed of 19 breast tumors samples which include HR-positive, HER2-amplified, and triple-negative samples (pre-treatment), by comparing each baseline sample to its matched sample taken after 2–3 weeks of treatment with HER2-targeted therapy (on-treatment), and by comparing each baseline sample to its matched sample taken at time of definitive surgery (post-treatment).</p>

For Ki67 percentage, the proportion positive reflects the percentage of tumor cells qualitatively scored with intensities as strong (3+), moderate (2+), and weak (1+). For ER, the histochemical score (H-score) represents the sum of 3 x the percentage of strongly staining (3+) nuclei, 2 x the percentage of moderately staining (2+) nuclei, and the percentage of weakly staining (1+) nuclei.</p>
