                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>This study will test the effectiveness of FIT Families (FIT), a multicomponent family-based behavioural intervention, against a credible attention control condition, Home-Based Family Support (HBFS). This protocol paper describes the design of a randomised clinical trial testing the efficacy of the FIT intervention. The protocol will assess the efficacy of FIT to improve health status in African American adolescents with obesity (AAAO) and their primary caregivers on primary (percent body fat) and secondary (physical activity, metabolic control, weight loss) outcomes and its cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>180 youth/caregiver dyads are randomised into FIT or HBFS, stratified by age, gender and baseline per cent overweight. The proposed study follows a two condition (FIT, HBFS) by four assessment time points. Tests will be conducted to identify potential relationship of baseline demographic and clinical variables to our dependent variables and see whether they are balanced between groups. It is hypothesised that youth/caregiver dyads randomised to FIT will show significantly greater reductions in percent body fat over a 12-month follow-up period compared with AAAO receiving HBFS. Preliminary findings are expected by November 2023.</p>

              <p>Obesity in the USA has reached alarming prevalence rates generally, and particularly among ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), non-Hispanic African American (AA) adults (49.9%) have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of obesity, followed by Hispanic adults (45.6%), non-Hispanic White adults (41.4%) and non-Hispanic Asian adults (16.1%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Similarly, although the prevalence of adolescent obesity has increased broadly, ethnic minority adolescents, especially AAs, are disproportionately likely to be obese (24.88%) relative to their non-Hispanic White adolescent counterparts (16.66%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> South Carolina (SC), the site of the described study, has the 9th highest obesity rate among US children at 20.0%<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> and the 11th highest obesity rate among US adults at 36.2%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Obese AAs living in the South are at high risk of deleterious and costly outcomes related to cardiometabolic complications such as hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and some forms of cancer.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref></p>
              <p>This project focuses on AA families for several reasons. First, extensive evidence supports the critical role families play in the etiology, maintenance and treatment of childhood obesity.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â13</xref> African American adolescents with obesity (AAAO) are likely to have caregivers who are also overweight and suffer from obesity-related diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome), which increases their chances of becoming obese as adults.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14â21</xref> Parents have a powerful influence on their childâs behaviour, not only through their control of food in the home, but also through the impact of modelling appropriate choices regarding physical activity (PA) and diet. Parental involvement is associated with the effectiveness of weight loss interventions for obese children. Second, developing effective interventions targeting AAs has proven difficult as few studies target AAs, and almost every major randomised clinical trial targeting AAs has achieved little to no weight loss.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22â24</xref> Furthermore, intervention studies targeting AAs have reported attrition rates ranging from 27% to 55%.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 25</xref> Contributing to these unfavourable findings include practical barriers such as travel distance and scheduling,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> but also a lack of motivation to adhere to evidence-based weight management skills.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Thus, it is not surprising that clinical practice guidelines highlight the importance of parent involvement in youth obesity treatment.</p>
              <p>The need to involve parents in obesity treatment, and motivational factors among AAAO and their caregivers that interfere with adherence to evidence-based weight loss guidelines<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> influenced our decision to incorporate motivational interviewing (MI)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> into the design of FIT Families (FIT), a multicomponent family-based behavioural intervention that was culturally tailored to meet the unique needs of AAAO and their caregivers. FIT Families grew out of a programmatic effort that used the ORBIT model<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> of behavioural intervention development and an NHLBI centre grant (U01HL097899; Naar/Jen, MPIs). ORBIT phases I and II for FIT were completed in the aforementioned centre grant based on the science of intrinsic (MI) and extrinsic (contingency management; CM) motivation and cognitive behavioural skills training (CBST) that were culturally tailored using communication science methodologies.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32â36</xref> FIT components were pilot tested in a multiple baseline design<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and optimised based on findings from a âproof-of-conceptâ study<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and a sequential multiple assignment randomised trial (SMART<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) in a large Mid-Western city. This SMART design tested several behavioural strategies (ie, home-based delivery, CM, MI, CBST<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) that used evidence-based skill acquisition procedures (i.e., modelling, guided practice and performance feedback) during twice weekly treatment sessions.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38â40</xref></p>
              <p>Although FIT was shown to be acceptable to AAAO and their caregivers, and MI, CM and CBST components showed some efficacy,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> there was sufficient variability in outcomes associated with its components that highlighted several areas where the intervention could be further optimised for use in the proposed study, including (1) Adolescents who reported higher skill utilisation reduced their percent overweight by almost fivefold that of adolescents reporting lower skill utilisation (5.77% vs 1.22%, respectively); (2) Qualitative interviews<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41â43</xref> revealed that caregiver active involvement with adolescents in cognitive skills building differentiated the top 10% from the bottom 10% of weight loss<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>; (3) CM for adolescent weight loss was only effective above CBST if caregivers attended sessions, and (4) CM increased parental session attendance, but significant weight loss was only achieved among adolescents with more PA and higher executive functioning.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 44</xref> Reinforcing caregivers for attendance resulted in higher attendance, but not other caregiver behaviours known to influence adolescent weight loss (e.g., self-monitoring (SM) of food and exercise, environmental control). (5) Qualitative analysis revealed that families specifically requested more supervised PA and suggested ways to refine FIT by focusing on the skills most critical to weight loss, and (6) community health worker (CHW) use of MI-based open-ended questioning was associated with greater use of change talk and commitment language<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 45</xref> among both youth and caregivers. This finding is important because these MI components have been shown to be precursors to actual behaviour change.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 45</xref> Also, CHW reflections of change talk and commitment language predicted more of the same during sessions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In summary, given the 5% reduction we achieved in percent overweight in our previous developmental SMART,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> communication science studies of sessions elucidated the most relevant MI strategies for AAAO and their caregivers, allowing us to tailor MI for the next trial, presented here. This trial has one primary aim and two secondary aims:</p>

                  <p>The primary aim of the study is to test the efficacy of FIT Families to improve weight status in AAAO. Primary hypothesis: AAAO and their caregivers randomised to FIT Families will show significantly greater reductions in % body fat over a 12-month follow-up period compared with AAAO receiving Home-Based Family Support (HBFS).</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Because of the intensity of the intervention and the high rates of obesity or overweight status in AA adults living in SC, we are focusing our relatively intensive intervention on AAAO with an overweight or obese caregiver. Because of the high rates of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in AA families, we redesigned the parent component beyond just session attendance by adding CM for caregiverâs modelling of health behaviours and monitoring their adolescentâs behaviours.</p>
                <p>The trial is registered with the US National Library of Medicine Clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04974554). This randomised clinical trial (HL155793; Clinical Trial of the Fit Families Multicomponent Obesity Intervention for African American Adolescents and Their Caregivers: Next Step from the ORBIT Initiative (NCT04974554); Cunningham/Naar, MPIs), submitted in response to PAR-19-328,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> employs reproducible and rigorous methods testing the effectiveness of FIT compared with HBFS, a credible attention control condition. The study follows a two-condition (FIT, HBFS)Ãfour assessments (baseline (T1), 3-month mid-treatment [T2], 6-month end of treatment (T3) and 12-month follow-up (T4)), with random assignment of 180 caregivers/youths to one of the two treatment conditions. Repeated measures of caregiver and youth percent body fat (primary outcome) and PA (secondary outcome) are collected at baseline and each of the three postrandomisation time points (T2âT4).</p>

                <title>Participants and recruitment</title>
                <p>We plan to recruit 180 AAAO and their primary caregiver who also meet criteria for overweight or obese (maAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disordery include biological parent, grandparent, extended family member, etc). We define adolescent obesity as a body mass index (BMI)â¥95th percentile for age and gender (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/overweight-and-obesity/childhood-obesity" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/overweight-and-obesity/childhood-obesity</ext-link>). Primary caregiver overweight is defined as a BMI 25.0â29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obesity defined as a BMIâ¥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/prctgd_c.pdf%23page=15" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/prctgd_c.pdf%23page=15</ext-link>). Human subjects research will be conducted at the Medical University of SC and the homes of participating families. Adolescents with obesity were chosen as the target population because adolescents are at greater risk for obesity than any other paediatric age group. Families from AA backgrounds were selected given the persistence of obesity disparities among youth and adults from minority backgrounds. Finally, we chose to include only adolescents with a primary caregiver because, with a majority of caregivers also struggling with weight, parental involvement also has added cost-effective benefits by influencing caregiver health, and, potentially that of other family members.</p>
                <p>In addition to meeting criteria for being obese, to be eligible, adolescent participants must be between 12 and 17 years of age, self-identify as AA, have a primary caregiver who is either overweight or obese and willing to participate in treatment, and reside primarily with a primary caregiver within 50 miles of the Medical University of SC. Exclusion criteria for youth include obesity secondary to medication use for another medical condition (eg, steroids, antipsychotics) or secondary to a chronic condition (eg, Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and Cushingâs syndrome). Exclusion criteria that apply to both adolescents and caregivers include pregnancy, thought disorder (eg, schizophrenia or other psychosis), suicidal, homicidal or serious cognitive impairment (eg, inability to complete questionnaires). To increase external validity of study findings, caregivers and adolescents are included regardless of co-morbid mental health problems (i.e., Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, depression and anxiety disorder), with the exception of thought disorder (i.e., schizophrenia, autism), suicidality or intellectual disability. Youth and caregivers with mild intellectual disability may be included if they are capable of reading and understanding study measures; youth/caregivers with more serious cognitive impairments are excluded. Youth and caregivers will also be excluded if they are pregnant or have a medical condition where weight loss is contraindicated. Participants will be required to speak and understand spoken English. Literacy is not a requirement as questionnaires can be read to families.</p>
                <p>Participants are recruited from South Carolina Pediatric Practice Research Network (SCPPRN) practices. SCPPRN research staff will use IRB-approved recruitment procedures that have been used successfully in previous SCPPRN studies.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> Participants for SCPPRN collaborative studies are recruited primarily through paediatric practices that are part of this research network that have agreed to participate in recruitment. Previous SCPPRN collaborative studies have relied on two IRB provided recruitment strategies-retrospective recruitment and traditional as described below.</p>
                <p>When using the retrospective recruitment method, each practice generates a list of patients who have been seen over the previous 12 months at the participating clinic and meet study eligibility criteria. Clinic staff at each participating practice search the clinicâs electronic medical records and/or billing software to develop a list of AA patients who are 12â17 years old with BMIs&gt;or equal to the 95th% and seen consecutively, over the previous 12 months by clinicians in the practice. Each practice provides SCPPRN research staff with patientâvisit data. The list unduplicated by patient and then sorted from the most recent clinic visits to the oldest visit. Prior to active recruitment, an optâout letter is sent to the family of potentially eligible participants describing the FIT Families study and explains that participation is optional and will not affect their care at the clinic. This letter provides an optâout option from the clinic and signed by each potential participantâs primary care provider. Any opt-out letters received will result in removal of the childâs name from the recruitment list/database. Two weeks after the opt-out letters are sent, SCPPRN staff begins contacting potential participants using procedures previously approved by Medical University of South Carolina (MUSCâs) IRB. Using a phone script developed by the research team, SCPPRN staff then contact families by phone to provide more information about the study and participant requirements and to complete the initial eligibility screening. If the adolescent and caregiver meet eligibility requirements and caregiver is interested, SCPPRN staff will explain the study, conduct an online consent appointment or schedule a time for a research assistant (RA) to conduct a home visit to review the informed consent and assent with HIPPA document.</p>
                <p>Each participating practice will also use traditional IRB-approved recruitment methods that have been used in a number of SCPPRN-associated randomised clinical trials.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> These include advertisements and flyers where patients can self-refer to the study and/or to the study team. In addition, practices may directly refer their patients to the study. Researchers provide SCPPRN staff a menu of options from which participating practices can choose from including IRB-approved recruitment flyers that can be placed in prominent locations within each practice or provided to patients at checkâin; project newsletters; email blasts to practice patients; and other means that families can contact study research staff directly. Participants may also be directly referred from their paediatrician. For potential participants who contact the clinic for FIT Families, clinic staff will provide: basic study information, project flyers, brochures or newsletters; and provide contact information for the potential participant to contact research staff.</p>
                <p>Regardless of which method is used to recruit the participants, caregiver consent and youth assent forms emphasise that the family is entitled to receive services from their respective clinic regardless of their participation in the research. The RA then schedules a 1.5-hour interview at a time convenient to the family to complete research instruments.</p>

                    <p>Optional supervised PA (FLEX): FLEX combines MI, which increases motivation, with personal fitness training. Each optional home-based session includes: (1) five minutes of warm-up; (2) 20 min of high intensity interval training that targets cardiovascular fitness with intensity being based on baseline fitness levels; (3) 20 min of resistance band and body weight resistance training; (4) 5 min of cooling down with yoga stretches, and (5) 10 min of MI-based goal setting to determine an additional PA for participants to complete on their own. Participants are guided via an MI approach to add to supervised PA with their own independent PA. The goal here is to have participants increase adherence to PA guidelines and to create PA routines and habits. Participants are given a set of resistance bands to use for their workouts after 2 weeks of the FIT programme. The CHW screens participants for any abnormal physical symptoms and ensures participantsâ heart rates are within normal range prior to each weekly workout. CHWs are trained by an expert in home-based supervised PA programmes with minority youth (certified personal trainer and a member of the MI network of trainers). As part of their initial training, each CHW receives feedback from the Flex expert as they practice implementing FLEX. As part of their ongoing training and supervision, to ensure Flex fidelity, quarterly each FIT CHW submits a randomly selected FLEX session video to the Flex expert for review and corrective feedback.</p>

                      <p>Starting the second week, adolescents can earn prize spins for engaging in PA. Each week, CHW and adolescent will set a new personalised step goal using the adolescentâs FitBit. Each week, the step goal will increase by 10%, so that the adolescent increases the duration of his or her PA. CHW will meet with adolescent weekly for 24 weeks to review FitBit goals and to provide prize spins. Adolescents will receive 1 prize spin for each day FitBit step goal is achieved. Thus, if the adolescent achieves FitBit goal for all 7âdays, she/he would receive 7 spins. The adolescent can also get bonus spins for weeks that she/he completes step goals on at least 6 out of 7âdays. Bonus spins will begin with 3 for week 1, and will increase by 3 with each week in a row the bonus target is met up to a maximum of 15 bonus spins during any week. If the adolescent does not meet FitBit step goal, no prize spins will be earned for that day and the bonus spins available at the next weekly session will be re-set to 3. Resets will not happen if there is a valid reason for not completing the behavioural activity (e.g., illness, FitBit malfunction). Adolescents can earn up to 530 prize spins for completing all FitBit step goals across treatment weeks.</p>

                  <p>Control participants will receive HBFS, which meets the requirements for a comparison treatment for testing behavioural interventions, and has been used in other health behaviour change studies (e.g., asthma).<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> HBFS employs a client-centred, non-directive manualised counselling<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> approach to providing information and emotional support for both adolescents and caregivers regarding choices about nutrition and PA to promote weight loss. The HBFS intervention emphasises use of open-ended questions, empathic and reflective listening, and general affirmations to facilitate healthier choices about nutrition and PA that stem from within the individual. Weekly sessions are 45âmin in duration with adolescent-caregiver in the home, with a second phone check-in per week during the first 3âmonths to match for treatment condition dose. HBFS sessions involve: (a) basic education in nutrition and/or PA recommendations for adolescent and adult obesity (sessions 1â4); (b) brief review of effort/progress with healthy nutrition and PA (sessions 2âfinal); (c) discussion of barriers or challenges with steps towards healthier nutrition and PA (sessions 2âfinal), and (d) an invitation for adolescent and caregiver to consider solutions to those barriers/challenges (sessions 2âfinal). Session 1 involves orienting adolescent and caregiver to the HBFS intervention and discussion of their thoughts about current weight, previous attempts at weight loss, and other domains associated with adolescentâs psychosocial well-being (e.g., peers, family, school, hobbies/interests). Subsequent sessions involve psychoeducation about nutrition including discussion of portion size, food groups and tips for improving nutrition and creating healthy meals (session 2), discussion of calories and practice with reading food nutrition facts labels (session 3) and psychoeducation about PA and discussion of recommended guidelines on the amount, variety and intensity of PA for adolescents and adults (session 4). Review and discussion of effort/progress with healthy nutrition and PA continue throughout the remaining sessions with opportunity to revisit basic nutrition and PA material from initial sessions as well as discussion of other health-related concerns or non-weight-related difficulties (e.g., general family, school/work, peer adjustment) identified by the adolescent and/or caregiver. At the conclusion of HBFS sessions, the adolescent and caregiver are invited to consider how they might use the information on healthy nutrition/PA discussed in session to assist them in managing a healthier weight during the upcoming week.</p>

                    <p>Bachelors-level CHWs conduct sessions after completing a 2-day training (17 hours) conducted by a doctoral-level clinician with expertise in client-centred counselling. Training includes a review of client-centred counselling skills such as open-ended questions, reflective listening and general affirmations, session-by-session review of HBFS protocol and role-play of HBFS sessions. However, there is no training on MI-specific strategies such as eliciting and reinforcing change talk, selective reflection, supporting autonomy and managing counter change talk and discord. All sessions are audiorecorded. The HBFS clinical supervisor, a doctoral-level clinician with expertise in client-centred counselling, reviews one randomly selected session once per month for each CHW. On a quarterly basis, one randomly selected session is coded for each CHW according to the MI-CRS and CBST checklists from intervention condition to ensure the unique components of FIT are not present. Feedback on selected HBFS sessions as well as progress and challenges with scheduling and general HBFS protocol implementation are reviewed with CHWs during weekly (60âmin) group supervision sessions.</p>

                  <p>All data collection and treatment sessions will take place at a time and location convenient to the family, usually the familyâs home. Data collection is conducted on laptop computers using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62 63</xref> REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of clinical trial data, which will be used for data capture and management. Direct data entry increases the efficiency of data management by reducing data entry burden and decreases missing data and data entry errors associated with paper and pencil assessments. Data collected by means other than questionnaires (ie, height and weight measurements, SM logbook data, and metabolic syndrome symptom data which include laboratory results and blood pressure measurements) are collected using case report forms (CRFs). A second data capture system has been established for RAs to enter CRFs. Detailed data entry guidelines and data dictionaries have been developed for each study measure/variable to support data collection and RA entry (where applicable) processes. Accelerometer data are captured using the manufacturerâs cloud-based software (Fitabase). Fitabase washes the data using Fitbitâs proprietary machine learning algorithms and results in the number of accelerometer-recorded steps taken each day. All electronic data will be identified using research identification numbers only. RAs will download data from the electronic data capture systems every 2âweeks to a spreadsheet programme (i.e., Excel or SPSS) and save it to a secure MUSC server. MUSC RAs will conduct a preliminary review of all data to ensure that data are deidentified prior to sharing data files with non-MUSC investigators. Data quality will be examined before statistical analysis can be conducted, including examination of missing data, assessment of distributional assumptions and identification of outliers. The psychometric properties of the instruments will be examined. Missing data will be estimated using multiple regression or full-information maximum likelihood procedures where appropriate. If necessary, transformations to normality will be applied.</p>

                <p>The data analysis will have two parts. In the first part, we will do exploratory data analysis<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> using descriptive statistics to ensure underlying distributions for the second part are satisfied. We will examine the distribution of each variable. We will then check for out-of-range values, outliers, and abnormal values using graphical methods (e.g., boxplots and histograms) and descriptive summaries to ensure that all values are within expected ranges. Transformations will be used when distributional assumptions are not fulfilled for inferential tests. Tests will be conducted to identify the potential relationship between baseline demographic and clinical variables (eg, attention and executive functioning (Flanker task), working memory (List Sorting test), delayed discounting (Delayed Reward Discounting Task), impulsivity (Dimensional Change Card Sort), cognitive functioning (NEURO-QOL), psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory and PROMIS) and anxiety (PROMIS)) to our dependent variables and to see whether they are balanced between groups. If a baseline variable is not balanced between groups (i.e., is a potential confounder) and is correlated with the dependent variable (r&gt;0.30), we will include this variable as a covariate in subsequent analyses. Inclusion of potential confounding variable(s) will enable us to control for them and prevent spurious effects (if any). Since we propose to test more than one primary hypothesis, the Hochberg step-down multiplicity adjustment will be used with a two-tailed family-wise alpha level of 0.05.<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> All other tests described below will each have a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05. Outcome analyses will be based on the principle of intention to treat.<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></p>
                <p>Our analysis of the primary outcome is based on a mixed-effect model. This will be specified using Singer and Willettâs<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> model building approach to mixed-effects regression models (MRMs) for repeated measure data. The research design leads to two levels of data, with four repeated measurements of adolescent percent overweight (level 1, subject) nested within the subject (level 2, within-subject). The MRMs will address variability in the number and spacing of measurements across participants, continuous and discrete outcome distributions, and curvilinear patterns of change. First, a fully unconditional model will estimate the proportion of outcome variance attributable to time (i.e., within-subject) and attributable to the subject (i.e., between-youth/caregiver). Second, and informed by the spaghetti plots, growth terms will be added to model the pattern of change over time. These terms will be computed using actual assessment dates, tailoring them to the observed spacing of measurements. Third, a dichotomous, uncentred indicator will be added (intervention vs control group), along with a cross-level interaction term between this indicator and the growth terms. This group effect will be treated as fixed effect and subjectsâ specific effect within a group will be treated as random effect. The resulting formulation will test for differences in baseline status and the rate of change over time (slopes) between intervention and control groups (this test will be obtained as a primary test for planned comparison). Prior to estimating the final model, systematic differences across treatment providers will be evaluated, and ultimately controlled, using fixed effects. With four repeated measurements, it is possible to specify fixed and random effects for a linear (i.e., straight-line) pattern of change over time, along with a fixed effect for a quadratic pattern of change. This combination allows the initial rate of change to vary randomly from subject to subject, with the acceleration of change over time (i.e., the speeding up or slowing down of the trajectory) being the same across subjects. Based on the model building results, an alternative formulation would be to include indicators to differentiate the three assessment occasions. This would compare the intervention and control conditions on their mean BMI at each occasion and in the amount of change occurring from occasion to occasion. Since more than one primary hypothesis is proposed (aims 1 and 2), the Hochberg step-down multiplicity adjustment<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> will be used for the coprimary hypotheses with a two-tailed family-wise alpha level of 0.05 across the two hypotheses. The decision rule for each primary hypothesis calls for the rejection of H<sub>0</sub> if the groupÃtime interaction is statistically significant using the Hochberg adjustment. The models will be performed by using SAS (V.9.4) and SPSS V.24 (IBM). Significance tests for variance components will be based on the likelihood ratio test, tests for fixed effects will be based on the Wald test (ie, Î²/SE), and 95% CIs will be computed to reflect the magnitude and precision of the estimated effects.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The sample size was determined based on statistical power analyses to detect clinically meaningful group differences for the primary hypotheses. This represents the differential course for the two intervention arms over time. Statistical power was estimated in a simulation study by using SAS V.9.3 PROC MIXED. The sample size for the study was based on the N needed to detect the two-way interaction (groupÃtime). As stated above, because two primary hypotheses have been proposed, the Hochberg alpha adjustment will be used in hypothesis testing. The smaller of those sequential alpha levels of 0.025 (=0.05/2) was used in our estimates of the multiplicity-adjusted sample size. Based on the results, the protocol proposes the recruitment of 170 participants (85/cell). Our simulation is based on the statistical power to detect standardised interaction effects of various magnitudes (0.40â0.50) for the proposed sample size and a two-tailed alpha level of 0.025. (The magnitude of interactions is expressed as standardised differences at 12 months post-treatment that would be seen with differential slopes.) The intraclass correlation coefficient varied (ICC: 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, based on pilot SMART data); and in an effort to account for attrition, the number of observations per participant was specified as 4. For each combination of simulation specifications, we generated 1000 data sets. We had observed â¤15% attrition in our pilot SMART study; however, the assessment schedule was less frequent in that study, which necessitates some adjustment in the final sample size per group. After accounting for about 10% for attrition, the proposed sample size of 90/group (N=180 total) provides the sufficient statistical power to detect differences in slopes that results in endpoint differences of â¥0.40 SD units with ICC=0.30âor 0.40 and â¥0.45âSD units with ICC=0.50âor 0.60. Based on our pilot data, these effects correspond to group differences that are feasible and clinically relevant.</p>

                <p>Consistent with the biphasic (R61/R33) milestones-driven mechanism (PAR-19-328<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and the ORBIT model, the R61 Phase of the âClinical Trial of the FIT Families Multicomponent Obesity Intervention for African American Adolescents and Their Caregivers: Next Step from the ORBIT Initiativeâ (R61 HL144895) was conducted to determine the feasibility and acceptability of study protocols with AAAO and their caregivers residing in SC to support transition to the R33 Phase,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> which was approved in March 2022 (R33 HL155793). During the R61 phase, we were able to adapt and pilot test project organisation and management plans, finalise research and intervention protocols, develop a manual of operations, and obtain IRB approval (Pro00106021) and establish an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. We recruited a small sample of youth/caregiver dyads (n=18) from the recruitment sites and pilot tested our recruitment procedures. Based on our experience during the R61 Phase, we requested and received approval for a Change in Scope during the R33 Phase, to change our primary outcome from reductions in âpercent overweightâ (ie, BMI) to reductions in âpercent body fatâ. The rationale for this change was threefold. First, with advances in research on body fat percentage in recent years, this measurement provides a better picture of an individualâs overall health and fitness, and risk of obesity-related diseases than BMI. Second, a major drawback of BMI is that it does not take into account how much weight is muscle and how much weight is fat, and as such, is considered a poor indicator for obesity, especially in adolescent athletes.<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Conversely, percent body fat can distinguish between trained athletes who are overweight versus overfat (e.g., football players seen during our R61 Phase). Finally, it is widely accepted by nutritionists, dieticians, and physicians that weight loss (i.e., change in BMI) can be misleading and potentially detrimental to health, due to doing so can result in substantive reductions in lean body mass as often occurs when individuals focus on weight loss.<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> As a result of this change in scope, we changed our stratification variables from gender, age and baseline percent overweight to gender, age and baseline percent body fat. We conducted a power analysis with our new outcome variable âpercent body fatâ. Originally, we proposed to power the study with a standardised effect size of 0.4 (âpercent overweightâ, i.e., BMI) and a sample size of N=180. With our new outcome variable, âpercent body fatâ, we propose to achieve the same standardised effect size (0.4) which clinically translates to a reduction in body fat by 3 units in 6 monthsâ time. All other statistical quantities (i.e., primary endpoint, 80% power, attrition rate) remain unchanged. From our prior experience with this population, this is a very achievable and feasible goal. Thus, we expect that this change in our primary outcome variable from BMI to percent body fat will have no significant effect on sample size and power calculation, and yet we will still be able to detect clinically meaningful group differences.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>AAAO are likely to have caregivers who are overweight, which increases their chances of becoming obese as adults.<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84â88</xref> In treatment studies of obese youth, parentsâ own weight problems are associated with less weight loss.<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84â88</xref> Moreover, parental involvement is associated with the effectiveness of weight loss interventions for children with obesity.<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> As a result, researchers<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89 90</xref> as well as practice guidelines highlight the importance of parent involvement in youth obesity treatment. This study is designed to test the efficacy of FIT Families, a promising multicomponent behavioural intervention designed to treat AAAO, by increasing caregiversâ participation through monitoring their childâs implementation of evidence-based cognitive behavioural skills and PA, and modelling the use of these same skills by SM their own diet and exercise, and increasing their own PA. Our primary hypothesis is that AAAO and their caregivers randomised to FIT Families will show significantly greater reductions in percent body fat over a 12-month follow-up period (18 months postrandomisation) compared with AAAO receiving HBFS. Furthermore, it is expected that FIT participants will show significantly greater reductions in percent overweight, and significantly greater improvements in physical activities, SM of diet and exercise, and metabolic syndrome symptoms than families randomised to the control condition.</p>
              <p>Health disparities in obesity among ethnic minority adolescents, especially AA, are a significant public health problem. Unfortunately, AAAO are likely to have caregivers who are also obese or overweight. This is not surprising as social determinants of health research suggest that home environments can substantially influence obesogenic lifestyles (e.g., high caloric intake, inadequate PA) often modelled by caregivers.<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91â94</xref> This protocol paper describes the design of a clinical trial testing the efficacy of the FIT Families intervention that was informed by the results from an NHLBI/NICHD centre grant (âFIT Families Project,â U01HL097889) that followed the NHLBI, ORBIT model<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> for developing behavioural interventions. Consistent with the Orbit Model of intervention development,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> the 5% reduction we achieved in percent overweight in our developmental SMART,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and the health benefits of this reduction in a population that has shown little response to weight-lost treatments, coupled with culturally tailoring and optimisation of FIT and each of its evidence-based behavioural components (home-based services, CM, MI, CBST, skill acquisition), is expected to provide even further benefit and warrants further testing in the current trial. Our FIT Families trial will provide innovative and significant data that will help elucidate the effectiveness of this intervention, which is designed to address weight issues in a youth and parent, concurrently. This approach is highly novel and will generate data that may inform the next generation of obesity interventions for young people and their families from health disparate populations. Thus, this project has high significance in terms of potential public health impact and reduction in obesity-related healthcare costs.</p>
