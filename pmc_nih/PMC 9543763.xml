                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Africa where annually, ~250,000 children with malaria experience a neurologic injury with subsequent neuro-disability. Evidence indicates that a higher temperature during the acute illness is a risk factor for post-infectious neurologic sequelae. As such, aggressive antipyretic therapy may be warranted among children with complicated malaria at substantial risk of brain injury. Previous clinical trials conducted primarily in children with uncomplicated malaria and using only a single antipyretic medication have shown limited benefits in terms of fever reduction; however, no studies to date have examined malaria fever management using dual therapies. In this clinical trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy, children hospitalized with central nervous system (CNS) malaria will be randomized to usual care (acetaminophen every 6 hours for a temperature ≥ 38.5°C) vs. prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours for 72 hours.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this double-blinded, placebo controlled, two-armed clinical trial, we will enroll 284 participants from three settings at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi; at the University Teaching Hospitals Children’s Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and at Chipata Central Hospital, Chipata, Zambia. Parents or guardians must provide written informed consent. Eligible participants are 2–11 years with evidence of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> malaria infection by peripheral blood smear or rapid diagnostic test with CNS symptoms associated with malaria. Eligible children will receive treatment allocation randomization either to standard of care for fever management or to prophylactic, scheduled treatment every 6 hours for 72 hours with dual antipyretic therapies using acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Assignment to treatment groups will be with 1:1 allocation using blocked randomization. The primary outcome will be maximum temperature in the 72 hours after enrolment. Secondary outcomes include parasite clearance as determined by quantitative Histidine Rich Protein II and seizures through 72 hours after enrolment.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>This clinical trial seeks to challenge the practice paradigm of limited fever treatment based upon hyperpyrexia by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic using two antipyretics and prophylactic administration and will elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite clearance and acute symptomatic seizures. If aggressive antipyretic therapy is shown to safely reduce the maximum temperature, a clinical trial evaluating the neuroprotective effects of temperature reduction in CNS malaria is warranted.</p>

Despite eradication measures, ~ 229 million malaria cases occurred in 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Neurologic sequelae occur in 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of survivors of CNS malaria, meaning parasitemia and neurologic symptoms including impaired consciousness and/or seizures [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Newer antimalarial medications rapidly clear peripheral parasitemia and improve survival, but mortality remains high at 12–25% with no associated decline in post-malaria neurologic injury [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Past studies have identified neurologic deficits at discharge in 9–18% of CNS malaria survivors with additional sequelae, such as epilepsy, becoming evident with longer term follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268414.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We conducted a prospective cohort study (BMPES) of children with the most severe form of CNS malaria—cerebral malaria (CM). CM is defined as unarousable coma (persisting for at least 30 minutes after any seizure), parasitemia and no other coma etiology [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When followed for an average of 77 weeks, 32% of BMPES children experienced neurologic sequelae including epilepsy (9%), behavioral problems (11%) and new neurodisabilities (23%) [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In <xref rid="pone.0268414.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> below, data from studies in other malaria-endemic African countries indicate that neurologic sequelae are not unique to children with CM. An estimated 80% of children with CM present with seizures and 60% will have additional seizures after admission [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

                  <p><underline>Fever as a risk factor for malaria-associated brain injury (<bold>scientific premise</bold>)</underline>. In BMPES, acute symptomatic seizures and a higher maximum temperature (Tmax) during the acute infection were associated with a greater risk of post-malaria neurologic sequelae. Children who developed epilepsy had a mean Tmax of 39.4°C vs. 38.5°C in those who did not develop epilepsy (absolute difference of 0.9°C; p = 0.01). In addition, a higher Tmax predicted subsequent behavioral disorders (39.2°C vs. 38.7°C; absolute difference 0.5°C; p = 0.04). These data are biologically consistent with the substantial body of evidence that fevers contribute to secondary neurologic injury in the setting of stroke, meningitis, anoxia, hypoxia, and trauma [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

                  <p><underline>Standard-of-care for malarial fevers</underline>. Despite substantial evidence for the deleterious effects of fever after brain injury, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Malaria Care Guidelines recommend fever treatment only for rectal T ≥ 38.5°C [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Since malaria-associated fevers escalate rapidly, treatment based upon this threshold means many children develop significant hyperpyrexia prior to initiating fever-reduction therapy. In the BMPES cohort, among 52 children who were afebrile at the time of admission the mean Tmax during hospitalization was 39.0°C and 13/52 (25%) had a post-admission fever of ≥39.0°C based upon Q2 hourly evaluations. In most malaria care settings, vital signs are only assessed every 6–12 hours, so adherence to WHO Guidelines inevitably results in children with CNS malaria developing and maintaining high fevers for some hours before antipyretics are initiated.</p>
                  <p>While the neurologist accustomed to aggressive fever management in the neurocritical care unit may find this approach to fever management in pediatric malaria baffling, WHO guidelines and clinical practice patterns are likely predicated upon two factors—first, the well-described dearth of neurologic expertise in malaria-endemic regions [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and secondly, some evidence suggesting that malarial fevers may be desirable. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> studies have shown that febrile temperatures inhibit parasite growth with the conclusion being that “long, high fevers during malaria may be beneficial for parasite clearance” [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and a 1997 clinical trial of antipyretics for malarial fevers found that <underline>peripheral</underline> parasite clearance time was delayed in children who received acetaminophen [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
                  <p><underline>New insights into parasite behavior and improved methods for measuring parasite burden</underline>. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, uninfected red blood cells (RBCs) stick to those infected with trophozoites and schizonts of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> forming rosettes which are thought to play an important role in sequestration and microvascular obstruction. <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>tudies have shown that rosette formation increases from 37.0 to 40.0°C [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This temperature-dependent, Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1) mediated effect doubles RBC cytoadherence and may explain the delayed peripheral parasite clearance time associated with antipyretic use [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Essentially, since lowering temperatures may attenuate cytoadherence, peripheral parasite counts may transiently increase as sequestered parasites are liberated into the bloodstream. This may be a desirable effect if by doing so antipyretics improve cerebral blood flow at the capillary-level and reduce sequestration. Parasitized erythrocytes have also been shown to lose their flexibility at temperatures over 37.0°C especially in the late trophozoite and schizont phase, which likely further exacerbates sequestration [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Histidine Rich Protein II (HRP2), a Plasmodium-specific protein in patient plasma, may facilitate quantification of whole-body parasite burden. Recent studies led by Dr. Seydel are supportive of the supposition that sequestered parasites, not those circulating in the peripheral blood, are the primary contributors to severe malaria. They found that mean plasma HRP2 concentrations early in the malaria infection predict progression to CM, even among children receiving treatment [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Higher plasma levels of HRP2 are also associated with CNS parasite sequestration based upon autopsy findings and bedside retinal assessments with quantitative HRP2 levels of ≥1700ng/ml providing 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity for identifying CNS parasite sequestration (area under the ROC curve 0.98) [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As such, HRP2 levels provide excellent proxy data for establishing CNS parasite sequestration even in conscious, acutely ill children in whom fundoscopy is problematic.</p>
                  <p><underline>Study rationale</underline>. Studies of other pediatric infections have shown that combination therapy with standard antipyretics can result in reduced fevers, but whether this is true for malaria-associated fevers is unclear. Although antipyretic use with a single agent in one malaria study was associated with prolonged peripheral parasitemia, fever clearance time was not significantly different (32 hours in the antipyretic treated group vs. 43 hours in routine care; p = 0.176) [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Limited fever reduction benefits from single antipyretic agents in malaria have been shown in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A randomized controlled trial of acetaminophen (without a loading dose) vs. ibuprofen found an ibuprofen advantage only at 4.5 hours post treatment [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A controlled trial of acetaminophen vs. placebo for uncomplicated malaria found no differences in mean temperature, but 6/171 children receiving placebo required admission for febrile seizures compared to 2/167 on acetaminophen [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Antipyretic efficacy has been shown in some studies—acetaminophen is more effective in malaria fever reduction than tepid sponging [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. No malaria studies to date have evaluated the impact of prophylactic treatment to prevent fevers or interventions using two antipyretics with different mechanisms of action.</p>
                  <p>Acetaminophen’s mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin production in the CNS with minimal anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that it inhibits the peroxidase functions of cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX)-1 and COX-2 with selectivity for the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In children with non-malarial fevers and a rectal temperature of &gt;39.0°C, 15 mg/kg of acetaminophen resulted in a decrease of 1.07–1.98°C [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which is greater than the temperature difference associated with better neurological outcomes in the BMPES study. The primary safety concern with acetaminophen use is the hepatotoxicity that can occur when the recommended dosage is exceeded. Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor, inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2. The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity of ibuprofen is achieved mainly through inhibition of COX-2, whereas inhibition of COX-1 impacts platelet aggregation and likely mediates gastrointestinal side effects [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. By 1991, some estimates indicated that over 250 million children had received ibuprofen with very few serious adverse events reported [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268414.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The most common ibuprofen side effects include gastritis, impaired platelet function and decreased urinary excretion of sodium. Among non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, ibuprofen is the least likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have shown both acetaminophen and ibuprofen to be safe in children when used individually [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268414.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and in combination [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Both agents have been shown to be generally safe and effective for fever reduction in children [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Studies in children with non-malarial fevers have found some additional fever-reduction benefit when the two drugs are used together [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A Malawi-based study of children with uncomplicated malaria comparing acetaminophen and ibuprofen found no difference in fever resolution time and no serious adverse effects from either treatment were identified [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are already approved for fever reduction in the dosage outlined for this planned intervention for use in children aged 2–11 years by the appropriate regulatory agencies (the Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board in Malawi and Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority) as well as the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
                  <p>The rationale for this clinical trial is based upon (1) unmet clinical need in terms of the imperative to decrease the neurologic injury and sequelae that occur in ~250,000 malaria survivors each year, (2) previous epidemiologic data indicating that higher Tmax is associated with neurologic sequelae in CNS malaria, (3) the very plausible biological mechanisms of malarial fever-related secondary brain injury detailed in <xref rid="pone.0268414.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, (4) <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> data on temperature dependent parasite behavior and whole body parasite burden suggesting that findings from previous research linking fever reduction to slowed parasite clearance may be erroneous.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Preliminary data</italic>. <underline>Capacity to conduct clinical trials and capture delayed outcomes</underline>. Our prior outcome studies of severe malaria [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268414.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]_ENREF_40 have provided us with the experience of (successfully) negotiating the regulatory requirements and compliance challenges of conducting an NIH-funded clinical trial in the African setting.</p>
                  <p><underline>Further insights into the role fever plays in the pathophysiology of neurologic injury in CNS malaria</underline>. Is fever independently associated with adverse neurologic outcomes? Children with CNS malaria are of an age to be susceptible to febrile seizures and acute malarial seizures are a well-established risk factor for neurologic sequelae in malaria survivors. To evaluate whether temperature independently affects neurologic outcomes in CNS malaria, we used the BMPES data to examine the relationship between Tmax and adverse neurologic outcomes in a regression model that adjusted for the presence/absence of seizures during the acute admission. After controlling for acute seizures, a higher Tmax remained associated with adverse neurologic sequelae during follow-up (p = 0.029).</p>
                  <p><sc>does the relationship between fever and adverse neurologic outcome hold true for children with cns malaria more broadly defined?</sc> The BMPES study, which identified a higher Tmax as being a risk factor for neurologic sequelae in CNS malaria, only included children with retinopathy positive CM [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although children with the more broadly defined CNS malaria experience similar rates of neurologic injury evident after recovery (detailed in <xref rid="pone.0268414.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> above), little is known or published about the impact of fever on outcomes in this broader population. To examine the effects of fever on a broader population of children with malaria, we compared Tmax in retinopathy negative children with and without neurologic sequelae who were enrolled during the BMPES study. The clinical characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], neurologic outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and MRI findings [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] of these retinopathy negative children have been previously described. Among 35 retinopathy negative children, the mean Tmax in children with neurologic sequelae was 39.2°C vs. 38.7°C in those without sequelae—a finding very consistent with the difference in mean Tmax found in the retinopathy positive BMPES cohort suggesting that fever likely plays a role in neurologic injury across the broader spectrum of CNS malaria.</p>
                  <p><underline>What is the pathophysiologic basis for fever-mediated secondary brain injury? How can we best capture this exposure?</underline> Based upon numerous epidemiological studies [21_ENREF_46_ENREF_46-34] data from malaria experiments conducted by White et al. led them to conclude that keeping the temperature at 37.0°C will delay cytoadherence by 3 hours and allow up to 25% of the ring parasites to be removed before sequestration. Fortunately, the 0.5°C difference in mean Tmax in children with vs. without sequelae in the BMPES study does offer some insights into what constitutes a clinically meaningful difference in Tmax. To further explore whether Tmax is the most sensitive measure for predicting fever-associated neurologic sequelae from malaria, we returned to the BMPES study data and examined the association between adverse neurologic outcome and area under the fever-time curve based upon Q2 hourly assessments using a fever threshold of 37.0°C and a threshold of 37.5°C. Unlike Tmax, these alternate measures of temperature exposure were not associated with adverse neurologic outcomes, so our primary outcome remains Tmax.</p>
                  <p>Histidine Rich Protein II (HRP2) studies. Our studies of HRP2 levels in Malawian children have supported the importance of quantifying the parasite burden through means other than a peripheral blood smear. HRP2 levels in the periphery are affected by multiple variables, including level of sequestration and rate of parasite clearance post-treatment. In a preliminary experiment (<xref rid="pone.0268414.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), we measured Q6 hour HRP2 levels post-treatment in 9 patients all undergoing treatment and found that marked differences occur despite identical treatment. We therefore will measure HRP2 levels every 6 hours in both arms of the trial with the hypothesis that in the aggressive antipyretic arm sequestration will be reversed and thus area under the concentration-time curve of HRP2 levels will decrease.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p>The primary analysis in this study will involve a comparison of the adjusted mean Tmax between the treatment groups. In the BMPES study, the difference in mean Tmax for children with vs. without behavioral disorders was 0.5°C, and it was 0.9°C between those with and without epilepsy [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggests that a good balance between sensitivity and specificity for Tmax in predicting epilepsy is achieved for a Tmax of 38.9°C and the mean Tmax for children who experienced epilepsy was 39.4°C suggesting that a reduction in temperature of 0.5°C is a clinically meaningful reduction. CM at the proposed study sites has a mortality rate of ~15% and most children who die will do so within 12–24 hours after admission and are unlikely to benefit from fever reduction measures. The effect of mortality on the sample size is manifested through attenuation of the group difference in mean Tmax of 0.5°C. Under the assumption that mortality is comparable in the two groups and that there is no treatment effect in those who die, the attenuated treatment effect will be (0.5 × 0.85) + (0.0 × 0.15) = 0.425°C. Assuming a standard deviation of the maximum temperature of 1.1°C as was present in the BMPES study population, a sample size of 142 children per group will provide 90% power to detect a group difference in mean Tmax of 0.425°C, using a two-sample t-test and a 5% significance level (two-tailed). The 0.5°C threshold (before attenuation) is based on our observational data that adverse neurologic outcomes in cerebral malaria occur at mean Tmax differences of 0.5°C [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
                  <p>For the outcome of acute symptomatic seizures, data collected during past malaria studies [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268414.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] suggest that the incidence of seizures after admission will be 40% in children with CM and 24% in CNS malaria. Assuming an overall seizure incidence after enrollment of 32% in the usual care group (68% with no seizures, 25% with a single brief seizure, and 7% with multiple or prolonged seizures), a sample size of 142 children per group will provide 80% power to detect a shift in the aggressive antipyretic treatment group to 82% with no seizures, 15% with a single brief seizure, and 5% with multiple or prolonged seizures, representing a common log-odds ratio of 0.7656. The method due to Whitehead [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] was used for this calculation.</p>
                  <p>Since we are preferentially recruiting to ensure that approximately 50% of children enrolled have CM and past experience indicates that 70% of CM admissions during the rainy season (i.e., malaria season) are retinopathy positive, we anticipate that there will be 100 children included in the secondary analysis of Tmax differences between treatment groups among children with CM and CNS parasite sequestration compared to all others. Assuming a standard deviation of Tmax of 1.1°C [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a sample size of 50 children per group will provide 80% power to detect a group difference in mean Tmax of 0.62°C (after attenuation due to mortality), using a two-sample t-test and a 5% significance level (two-tailed). Sample size considerations cannot be provided for Hypothesis 2 due to the absence of preliminary data on HRP2 levels, including the absence of any reasonable data on standard deviation for HRP2 levels or the percentage of mature parasites.</p>

In addition, sealed opaque envelopes with treatment allocation by study ID will be provided to the study sites in case there is the need to break the code for an individual patient. At the completion of the study, all envelopes will be returned to UR Biostatistics.</p>

[<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] Briefly, plasma will be obtained from the microhematocrit tubes used for PCV determination. After determination of PCV (if clinically needed), tubes will be scored at the RBC/plasma interface with a triangular file and broken. A narrow pipette tip will be inserted in the plasma containing portion and the plasma removed. Plasma will be transferred to a bar code-labeled microcentrifuge tube and stored at -20°C until analysis.</p>
                      <p>At the time of analysis, plasma diluted at a ratio of 1:500 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as well as a titration of a stock of recombinant HRP2, will be plated onto a plate precoated with anti-HRP2 antibody (Cellabs, Brookvale, Australia). The manufacturer’s protocol will then be followed, except for the modification of all incubations being carried out at 37°C in a humidified chamber. In brief, a 1-hour sample incubation step will be followed with extensive washing with PBS/0.1% Tween. One hundred microliters of the second conjugated antibody will be plated and allowed to incubate for 1 hour. The conjugate will subsequently be washed off and 100 μL of substrate added for 15 minutes, during which color change will be observed. This reaction will be stopped with 1N HCl and the plate analyzed at optical density (OD) 450. A standard curve will be generated from the recombinant protein and the readings from the diluted unknown samples will be compared to this curve to calculate HRP2 levels. If the initial dilution of the sample results in an OD reading that does not lie within the linear range of the recombinant protein, the sample will be rediluted at either 1:1000 or 1:100 to result in OD values within the dynamic range of the enzyme-linked immunoassay. Samples that remained off scale low, despite redilution, will be assigned a value equivalent to the lowest possible detection value of the ELISA.</p>

                  <p>The REDCap system is a secure, web-based application that is flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research. It provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data and real-time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of data entry. REDCap offers easy data manipulation with audit trails and functionality for reporting, monitoring and querying patient records, as well as an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). The Double Data entry feature allows a project administrator to designate two users per study to perform double data entry. Other users are then able to compare the data entry results, using the data comparison tool. This requires that the Double Data Entry feature be activated for the study.</p>
                  <p>Through the University of Rochester Medical Center’s Center for Health and Technology (CHeT), the Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Informatics Core will serve as a central facilitator for data processing and management. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough, study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by all members of the research team, with planning assistance from the CTSI Informatics Core. REDCap servers are housed in a local data center at the University of Rochester and all web-based information transmission is encrypted. REDCap was developed in a manner consistent with HIPAA security requirements and is recommended to University of Rochester researchers by the URMC Research Privacy Officer and Office for Human Subject Protection. Access to data in the REDCap application and database will be controlled by using user definitions and permissions. The PI will have access to all study data and will direct access for all users. Audit logs are created automatically within the REDCap application to capture the complete user history of database activity.</p>
                  <p>Data entry for the subject is expected to be complete within one week of randomization. Most data entry errors will be resolved by the Double Data Entry process operating on local machines at each site. Therefore, Data Management will be primarily responsible for ensuring CRFs are entered in a timely manner and are complete. Reports of delayed data entry and missing CRF elements will be generated weekly for the CHeT project manager to review with sites.</p>

The assumptions underlying all statistical models will be thoroughly checked using graphical and inferential methods and remedial measures will be taken (e.g., transformations, consideration of alternative models) if these assumptions are found to be seriously violated. A significance level of 5% will be used for hypothesis testing.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Analytic plan for hypothesis 1(i)</italic>. Children who receive aggressive antipyretic therapy will have lower mean Tmax during the 72-hour treatment period based upon continual temperature assessments. The analysis of the Tmax will involve fitting an analysis of covariance model with treatment group as the factor of interest, site and disease severity (CM vs CNS malaria) as stratification factors, and admission temperature as a covariate. The estimated treatment effect (difference in adjusted group means between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups) and its associated 95% confidence interval, as well as a t-test for significance of the treatment effect, will be derived from this model.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Analytic plan for hypothesis 1(ii)</italic>. Children who receive aggressive antipyretic therapy will be less affected by acute symptomatic seizures during the malaria infection based upon clinical assessments and daily routine EEGs for those with BCS≤4 and GCS≤10.</p>
                  <p>To compare seizure outcome between the treatment groups, outcome will be defined as a three-level ordinal variable: no seizures, a single brief (&lt;15 minute) seizure, and multiple or prolonged (&gt;15 minutes) seizures. The analysis of this outcome variable will involve fitting an ordinal logistic regression model (proportional odds model) [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] with treatment group as the factor of interest, site and disease severity as stratification factors, and history of prior seizures and pre-existing developmental delay as covariates. The estimated treatment group odds ratio, along with its associated 95% confidence interval and p-value, will be derived from this model. If the proportional odds assumption appears to be seriously violated, a multinomial logistic regression model will be used instead [<xref rid="pone.0268414.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Analytic plan for hypothesis 2</italic>. We hypothesize that fever treatment will reduce sequestration resulting in lower HRP2 levels based upon area under the curve (AUC) during the 72-hour treatment period and an associated transient paradoxical increase in peripheral parasitemia with a higher proportion of older parasites seen.</p>
                  <p>AUC has been selected as the outcome due to substantial between-subject heterogeneity of the level-time curves and because subjects will be at different time points in their illness in terms of treatment (some having received antimalarials as an outpatient prior to admission). As such, if a more rapid reduction in HRP2 occurs in general, it should be captured by this AUC. The analyses of the area under the HRP2 level-time curve (log-transformed) will involve fitting an analysis of covariance model with treatment group as the factor of interest, site and disease severity as stratification factors, and time since the initiation of antimalarial treatment and log-transformed HRP2 level at t = 0 as covariates. The estimated treatment effect (difference in adjusted group means between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups) and its associated 95% confidence interval, as well as a t-test for significance of the treatment effect, will be derived from this model. For subjects who do not complete the 72-hour follow-up period, the area under the HRP2 level-time curve (log-transformed) observed during the subject’s abbreviated follow-up will be multiplied by the inverse of the percentage of time that the subject was followed for the primary analysis. A secondary analysis of this outcome will be performed weighting each subject’s contribution by the time that they contribute HRP2 data.</p>
                  <p>We expect aggressive fever reduction to facilitate release of mature sequestered parasites (evident by the hemozoin they contain) from the CNS. In an exploratory analysis, the mean percentage of mature parasites across all positive blood smears for each child taken Q6 hourly will be compared in the ‘usual care’ vs. ‘aggressive antipyretic treatment’ groups using a t-test. In ‘usual care’, less than 5% of parasites typically have evidence of hemozoin deposition but the natural history of parasite hemozoin clearance is unknown.</p>

                  <p>To evaluate the effects in the study population most analogous to the BMPES population, a secondary analysis will include terms added to the above analysis of covariance model representing the main effect of subgroup (CM with CNS parasite sequestration vs. all others) and the interaction between treatment and subgroup. For purposes of this analysis, CM will be defined as having a BCS ≤2 or GCS ≤10 and CNS parasite sequestration will be defined as having an initial HRP2 ≥1700 ng/dl. This model will permit estimation of the treatment effects within each subgroup (with associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values) and a test for significance of the treatment effects between the subgroups. Exploratory analyses will be performed using the above methods for the log-transformed fever exposure outcomes. For subjects who do not complete the 72-hour follow-up period, the AUC falling above the fever cut-off during the subject’s abbreviated follow-up will be multiplied by the inverse of the percentage of time that the subject was followed for the primary analysis. Secondary analyses of these outcomes will be performed weighting each subject’s contribution by the time that they are followed, as described above for Tmax.</p>

The DSMB consists of four clinician scientists with expertise in severe malaria in children who have worked in other African countries, plus a US-based biostatistician who has held this role on numerous DSMBs for other clinical trials. SAEs are reported to the DSMB within 48 hours, all other AEs reported to the DSMB Q 6-monthly and an interim safety analysis will be completed annually. As noted above, interim analyses for efficacy will also be conducted at the completion of Years 2 and 3 using an upper boundary determined by an O’Brien-Fleming α-spending function to control the overall probability of a Type I error at 2.5% (since only an upper boundary will be considered for early stopping). Interim analyses will also be performed for excess mortality in the aggressive antipyretic treatment group at the end of each of the first three recruiting malaria seasons. A lower boundary will again be determined using an O’Brien-Fleming α-spending function to control the overall probability of a Type I error. The DSMB will also carefully consider other adverse events in terms of treatment group imbalances, with particular attention paid to vomiting, recurrent hypoglycemia, elevated creatinine or bilirubin, blood transfusion requirements, identification of occult blood, and clinically evident thrombocytopenia or bleeding. Continuous variables that will be monitored include hours with lactic acidosis, maximum lactate, bilirubin, and creatinine levels, and parasite clearance time. Fisher’s exact tests (or chi-square tests) will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect to dichotomous outcomes, and t-tests (or Wilcoxon rank sum tests) will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect to continuous outcomes. A log-rank test will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect to parasite clearance time. If potential safety concerns are identified, the DSMB may consider recommending modification (or halting) of the trial. The DSMB will provide an annual review of the interim analysis through a combination of virtual and face-to-face meetings and provide a written summary report within 1 week of the annual review meeting.</p>
                  <p>An initial meeting between the study leadership and the DSMB will take place prior to enrollment of the first study subject, to review study procedures and come to agreement on the DSMB Charter. The Charter will document the role and function of the DSMB including the frequency and format of DSMB meetings, the format of reports to be prepared for DSMB review, guidelines for interim analyses for safety and efficacy, extent of blinding of the DSMB, and rules for communication among the study leadership and the DSMB.</p>
                  <p>The Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology (DBCB) at the University of Rochester will prepare formal reports for each interim analysis for the DSMB. These reports will include appropriate introductory material (study synopsis, current status of the trial, etc.), information on recruitment and retention, subject characteristics, subject disposition, treatment discontinuations, adverse events (including serious adverse events), laboratory test results, and other safety data. This information will be provided by treatment group, where applicable.</p>
                  <p>Approximately one month before a scheduled DSMB meeting, the database will be transferred from CHeT to the DBCB using a long-established protocol, and a numbered version of the analytic database will be created by the DBCB. All DSMB reports will refer to the specific version number of the database that is used in their preparation, as well as the date on which the database was created. The designated DBCB programmer who generated the randomization plan for the trial will prepare the DSMB reports. The treatment groups in the report will be coded as “A” and “B”, which can be linked to the identities of the actual treatment groups if requested by the DSMB.</p>

                  <title>Adverse event reporting and harms</title>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Harms</italic>. CM is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The expected outcomes related to the disease itself include severe anemia requiring blood transfusions, hyperlactatemia, acidosis, prolonged coma, hypoglycemia, severe thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, extreme hyperpyrexia, seizures, and, neurologic sequelae including blindness, hemiparesis, hypotonia, and mutism. Death is also a common outcome, occurring in 16% of pediatric CM patients on the QECH Research Ward over the past 5 years. All study subjects will receive treatment and management for these conditions consistent with the WHO’s guidelines for the management of severe malaria.</p>
                  <p>Known potential harms from the Intervention are listed below</p>
                  <list list-type="alpha-lower">
                    <list-item>
                      <p>Aspiration: Study subjects will be closely monitored clinically for signs of aspiration including Q4-hourly assessments of oxygen saturation. The Q4-hourly assessments are intended to be done only if coma score is sub-normal, otherwise this metric need be done only per hospital ward protocol. If oxygen saturations are below 95%, the ward attending will be notified to make a physician-level assessment (auscultation, urgent PCV, etc.) and determine if aspiration is the potential underlying cause. If oxygen saturation declines and remains lower than the pre-aspiration baseline, the NGT will be placed to suction to remove any remaining gastric contents, the intervention will be discontinued and the NGT removed. Otherwise, the decision to discontinue the study drug intervention is at the discretion of the attending physician.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Complications of NGT placement and maintenance: If placement/maintenance of the NGT by experienced staff is difficult and results in nasal trauma and/or significant epistaxis and the study subject is comatose and/or unable to swallow, the intervention will be discontinued and the NGT removed. Necessary measures to ameliorate any bleeding will be taken.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                      <p>Vomiting: Although common in the early stages of malaria, once comatose study participants with CM do not usually vomit. If vomiting occurs in a comatose study participant, the NGT will be placed to suction to remove the remaining gastric contents, oxygen saturations will be assessed, and once gastric contents have been removed the NGT will be removed and the intervention will be discontinued.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is common on admission but generally resolves within 24 hours.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Hyperbilirubinemia: Liver dysfunction is common in CNS malaria. Children with a bilirubin on admission of above 3 or those with frank jaundice are excluded. The study intervention will be halted if after enrollment the bilirubin escalates &gt;5mg/dL or the child develops clinical jaundice.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Increased risk of bleeding: Thrombocytopenia is common during malaria infections. The use of ibuprofen may decrease platelet function and could therefore increase the risk of abnormal bleeding. Children with any history of thrombocytopenia prior to the acute malaria illness will be excluded. Structured clinical screening will also be conducted to assure anyone with evidence of abnormal bleeding is excluded from enrolment. During the study, children will be evaluated twice daily by an experienced clinician who will repeat the structured assessments to identify any clinical evidence of abnormal bleeding/poor clotting and the intervention will be halted in any child that develops signs/symptoms.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite substantial evidence that hyperthermia in the setting of acute CNS injury generally worsens neurologic damage as well as observational data in pediatric CNS malaria showing the same association, malaria care guidelines today recommend a single antipyretic agent and treatment initiation only after a significant fever (T ≥ 38.5°C) occurs. The clinical trial proposed here seeks to challenge this practice paradigm by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic use while also taking advantage of a relatively new method for quantifying total parasite burden (HRP2) to further characterize malaria severity and elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite sequestration and clearance. This study will also assess the efficacy of aggressive antipyretic use in deterring acute symptomatic seizures during the malaria infection. The trial is novel in the provision of prophylactic treatment, the proposed use of combining two agents, and the select patient population—namely children with CNS malaria rather than uncomplicated malaria as were included in prior antipyretic malaria trials.</p>
