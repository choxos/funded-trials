              <abstract>
                <p>The increasing availability of human cardiac tissues for study are critically important in increasing our understanding of the impact of gender, age, and other parameters, such as medications and cardiac disease, on arrhythmia susceptibility. In this study, we aimed to compare the mRNA expression of 89 ion channel subunits, calcium handling proteins, and transcription factors important in cardiac conduction and arrhythmogenesis in the left atria (LA) and ventricles (LV) of failing and nonfailing human hearts of both genders. Total RNA samples, prepared from failing male (n = 9) and female (n = 7), and from nonfailing male (n = 9) and female (n = 9) hearts, were probed using custom-designed Taqman gene arrays. Analyses were performed to explore the relationships between gender, failure state, and chamber expression. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed chamber specific expression patterns, but failed to identify disease- or gender-dependent clustering. Gender-specific analysis showed lower expression levels in transcripts encoding for K<sub>v</sub>4.3, KChIP2, K<sub>v</sub>1.5, and K<sub>ir</sub>3.1 in the failing female as compared with the male LA. Analysis of LV transcripts, however, did not reveal significant differences based on gender. Overall, our data highlight the differential expression and transcriptional remodeling of ion channel subunits in the human heart as a function of gender and cardiac disease. Furthermore, the availability of such data sets will allow for the development of disease-, gender-, and, most importantly, patient-specific cardiac models, with the ability to utilize such information as mRNA expression to predict cardiac phenotype.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Epidemiologically, there are well-established gender differences in the manifestations of cardiac arrhythmias. Men are more susceptible to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) <xref rid="pone.0054635-Kannel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Wolbrette1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, whereas women have higher incidence of long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and drug-induced Torsades de Pointes <xref rid="pone.0054635-Locati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-AbiGerges1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, men and women exhibit differences in basic electrophysiological parameters during normal sinus rhythm. Women, for example, tend to have increased resting heart rates <xref rid="pone.0054635-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and longer rate-corrected QT (QTc) intervals <xref rid="pone.0054635-Kligfield1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, whereas men have been reported to have longer P-waves suggesting differences in baseline atrial electrophysiological properties <xref rid="pone.0054635-Dhala1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, autonomic blockade does not mask the gender differences in resting heart rate, suggesting that intrinsic sinus node differences, as opposed to gender dependent autonomic tone, are responsible for this variability <xref rid="pone.0054635-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Much less is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms underlying observed gender differences in arrhythmia susceptibility and basic electrophysiological parameters in the human heart. Insight has been gained primarily from animal models, particularly studies in the rabbit, dog, and mouse <xref rid="pone.0054635-James1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The rabbit heart has been suggested to be a relevant model for the study of human arrhythmias <xref rid="pone.0054635-Panfilov1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and female rabbits also exhibit gender dependent differences in QTc intervals <xref rid="pone.0054635-Ebert1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> similar to that seen in humans <xref rid="pone.0054635-Kligfield1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although mice afford easy genetic manipulations, they manifest profound differences in cardiac electrophysiology compared to humans <xref rid="pone.0054635-Nerbonne1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-AhrensNicklas1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> which must be considered when extending conclusions to human physiology and pathophysiology <xref rid="pone.0054635-Glukhov1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Fedorov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since the expression profile of ion channels and transporters determine cardiac excitability and may also determine arrhythmia susceptibility, several recent studies have explored gene expression patterns in the human heart <xref rid="pone.0054635-Borlak1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Gaborit1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Nattel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Gaborit2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Gronich1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As the ever present limitation to detailed human studies is the availability of human tissues for analysis, we have developed the infrastructure necessary to collect and systematically investigate tissues from both failing and nonfailing human hearts suitable for detailed functional and molecular analyses. In addition to investigating the global patterns of mRNA expression relating to gender and heart failure in the human heart, we have also provided a comprehensive set of data which was used to computationally model patient-specific electrophysiology and explore population-dependent variability in action potential morphology by our colleagues Walmsley, et al.</p>
              <p>We focused on probing tissues of the left atria (LA) and ventricle (LV), as left-sided heart remodeling and dysfunction are the most common manifestations of heart failure <xref rid="pone.0054635-McKee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Specifically, we quantified the transcript expression levels of 89 target genes in the LA and LV of failing and nonfailing human hearts of both genders. In some analyses, tissues isolated from the epicardium and endocardium of the LV were examined separately as we have previously shown that heart failure results in a heterogeneous remodeling of repolarization across the ventricular wall and altered dispersion <xref rid="pone.0054635-Glukhov2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which may be pro-arrhythmic <xref rid="pone.0054635-Antzelevitch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

                <p>For this study a total of 34 explanted human hearts of both genders (n = 16 women, 52±10 years old; n = 18 men, 52±14 years old) were acquired from two sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Failing human hearts (n = 16; 9 men, 7 women) were obtained at the time of cardiac transplantation at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO) and nonfailing hearts (n = 18; 9 men, 9 women) were provided by Mid-America Transplant Services (St. Louis, MO) after they were deemed unsuitable for cardiac transplantation. Each heart was collected in the operating room after removal from the chest and immediately perfused with and stored in cardioplegic solution (4°C) for preservation during the 15–20 minute delivery from the operating room to the research laboratory. Upon arrival, tissue samples from the LA (n = 22) and LV (n = 22) free walls were immediately harvested and preserved. Epicardial and endocardial samples were also harvested from the LV free wall (n = 12). All tissue samples were preserved and stored in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at −80°C. Basic clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054635-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054635-t002">2</xref>.</p>

                <title>Ventricular Remodeling in Heart Failure and Differences in Transcript Expression</title>
                <p>Previous studies have revealed that during the heart failure remodeling process, the cardiac action potential is significantly prolonged and conduction is slowed due to pathological changes in the expression and function of ion channels <xref rid="pone.0054635-Janse1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Aiba1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, we observe trends for reduction in the expression of transcripts encoding ion channel subunits that are important in cardiac conduction and repolarization, as well as changes in key calcium handling proteins. Similar to previously reported findings, for example, we observe downregulation of the subunits encoding for I<sub>KATP</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0054635-Flagg1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and I<sub>to</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0054635-Kaab1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. I<sub>to,fast</sub> channels, in particular, encoded by the pore-forming subunit K<sub>v</sub>4.3 and the accessory protein KChIP2, is one of the most consistently altered ion channels during the heart failure remodeling process across species <xref rid="pone.0054635-Zicha1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Consistent with previous suggestions, reductions in I<sub>to,fast</sub> density in the failing heart are linked to protein-level downregulation of K<sub>v</sub>4.3 and transcript-level downregulation of KChIP2 <xref rid="pone.0054635-Soltysinska1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We find lower KChIP2 expression in LV samples from failing, compared with nonfailing hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast with the findings for KChIP2, we observe no significant changes in the expression of subunits encoding I<sub>K1</sub>, I<sub>Na</sub>, and I<sub>Ca,L</sub> channels. There is, however, a trend for lower expression of K<sub>v</sub>11.1/HERG, the subunit encoding the rapid component of delayed rectification, I<sub>Kr</sub>, as well as the calcium handling proteins, SERCA2a and NCX1, consistent with recent findings <xref rid="pone.0054635-Soltysinska1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In the present study, we explored the impact of gender on the transcript expression levels of the major cardiac ion channels, calcium handling proteins, and transcription factors in the failing and nonfailing human heart. We found gender-specific differences in relative expression levels of ion channel subunits, such as K<sub>v</sub>4.3, KChIP2, K<sub>v</sub>1.5, and K<sub>ir</sub>3.1 in the LA, but no significant gender-specific differences in relative expression levels of these subunits in the LV. Analyses of transmural heterogeneities in transcript expression levels in the LV, however, revealed a heterogeneity of expression across the LV wall in of the I<sub>to,slow</sub> pore-forming subunit, K<sub>v</sub>1.4, as well as with the I<sub>to,fast</sub> accessory subunit, KChIP2. In the nonfailing heart, K<sub>v</sub>1.4 exhibited higher expression in the epicardium of the nonfailing heart, whereas KChIP2 exhibited a stronger expression in the epicardium across gender and disease state.</p>
              <p>Until recently, there has been very limited data available regarding global gender dependent cardiac ion channel gene expression in the human heart. A 2010 study by Gaborit, et al <xref rid="pone.0054635-Nattel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> explored gender dependent differences in the nonfailing human ventricle (left and right ventricles) and, unlike in our investigation, found significantly lower expression levels in the female LV of key ion channels and accessory proteins important in cardiac repolarization. Their patient population consisted of 10 men and 10 women with average ages of 38±12 years and 43±13 years, respectively. Our patient population, on the other hand, consisted of both failing and nonfailing human hearts with significantly older average ages (failing females, 54±9 years; failing males, 56±9 years; nonfailing females, 51±11 years, failing males, 50±18 years). The variability of qPCR data has shown to be significantly increased in aged animals <xref rid="pone.0054635-Tellez1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and humans <xref rid="pone.0054635-Boheler1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, which in our case may mask any intrinsic gender dependent expression differences in the LV in our study.</p>
              <p>The use of an older patient population may, however, be more representative with respect to the gender dependent analysis of LA targets important in the generation and maintenance of AF, as AF is relatively uncommon before the age of 60 and 10% of the overall population develops AF by 80 years of age <xref rid="pone.0054635-Go1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In addition, 1 in 4 heart failure patients develop AF within five years of diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0054635-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, so it is likely that relevant atrial remodeling processes <xref rid="pone.0054635-Nattel2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> are well underway in our patient population. Interestingly, although overall men are more likely to develop heart failure <xref rid="pone.0054635-Bui1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, women diagnosed with heart failure are approximately 1.5 times more likely to develop AF than their male counterparts <xref rid="pone.0054635-Benjamin1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Additionally, the overall higher atrial expression levels of almost all transcripts analyzed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) in the failing male hearts, as compared to failing female hearts, may mask any intrinsic gender-based differences.</p>
              <p>Interpretation of these results, however, with respect to both the LA and LV must be considered in light of the available clinical information, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054635-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0054635-t002">2</xref>. As described in the Results section, we identified one patient (failing heart no. 7) with a history of AF. This patient exhibited high expression levels of K<sub>v</sub>4.3, KChIP2, K<sub>ir</sub>2.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, and K<sub>v</sub>1.5 when compared with all other failing LA specimens of both genders, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. This sample did, however display a relatively lower expression level of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 as compared with other specimens in the group, which is likely related to the patient’s four-month history of permanent AF prior to transplantation. It should also be noted that, prior to diagnosis of AF, this patient had been previously diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmias which concurrently played a role in the progression of heart failure and overall arrhythmia history. As previously reported, in human AF the primarily physiological remodeling results from changes in I<sub>Ca,L</sub> and significant reductions of current density have only been reported after 18 months of persistent AF <xref rid="pone.0054635-Brundel1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g007">Figure 7</xref>, we observed no remarkable expression patterns in key repolarization targets in the LV of failing hearts with and without a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which may in part be due to the individual etiologies of heart failure, which must be elucidated further in future studies.</p>
              <p>Prolongation of the cardiac action potential is a hallmark of heart failure <xref rid="pone.0054635-Tomaselli1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Furthermore, heterogeneous distribution of repolarization transmurally across the ventricular wall manifests as electrophysiological heterogeneities which may also be pro-arrhythmic <xref rid="pone.0054635-Antzelevitch2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In our recent study, we provide direct experimental evidence of transmural heterogeneites in action potential waveforms in the human LV wedge preparation <xref rid="pone.0054635-Glukhov2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the present study, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054635-g008">Figure 8</xref>, we explored the potential molecular mechanisms of this functional heterogeneity. The data reveal expression gradients in KChIP2 expression across the transmural wall consistent with differences in I<sub>to</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0054635-Antzelevitch2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We were unable, however, to pinpoint other channels potentially contributing to action potential heterogeneity as the transcripts encoding the other ion channels prominent in repolarization were found to be more homogenously expressed across the LV wall. In addition, we did not find connexin 43 transcript expression to be heterogeneously expressed, although previous reports have demonstrated significantly lower epicardial connexin 43 protein expression in both failing and nonfailing hearts in our previous study <xref rid="pone.0054635-Glukhov2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Patterns of molecular heterogeneity directly affecting action potential durations may either be due to the presence of smaller “islands” of differential gene expression and function <xref rid="pone.0054635-Glukhov2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Antzelevitch3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> not captured in this study or post-translational protein modifications <xref rid="pone.0054635-Roden1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> not assessed in our transcript level investigation.</p>
              <p>The wealth of information gathered from large-scale gene expression studies such as this and others <xref rid="pone.0054635-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054635-Gaborit2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, not only provides insight into the gender dependent, pathological, or regional changes in ion channel expression, but also provides solid physiological data that can be incorporated into computational models. Furthermore, access to detailed clinical information, such as that presented this study, will both assist in interpretation of the molecular mechanisms involved in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis, as well as contribute to the development of tools for patient-specific computational models of cardiac electrophysiology. Constructing models of comprehensive human electromechanical activity requires a thorough understanding of the distribution of ion channels, calcium handling proteins, and other transporters in various regions of the heart, as well as their intrinsic modifications due to disease and gender as we have investigated in this study. Our colleagues Walmsley, et al in their paper “mRNA expression levels in failing human hearts predict cellular electrophysiological remodeling using a population-based simulation study” in this issue of the journal, present a first step towards patient-specific modeling of the action potential and calcium transient based on the comprehensive set of molecular data presented here.</p>

                <title>Study Limitations</title>
                <p>The study of human hearts, while providing a unique opportunity to explore both the structural and functional mechanisms pertaining to arrhythmias, heart failure, and other pathological conditions, is limited by number of explanted hearts available. Nonfailing, donor hearts are especially precious and cannot be truly considered normal, control hearts due to that fact that they have been rejected for transplantation due to, in some cases, cardiac reasons. In addition, the underlying patient circumstances (i.e. medication, previous cardiac surgery, etc) cannot be controlled for. Thus, the hearts presented in this study represent the best available specimens.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Epidemiologically, it is clear there is a gender disparity in arrhythmia incidence. To attempt to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of these differences, we have explored the gender dependent expression of various ion channels, calcium handling proteins, and other transcription factors in the failing and nonfailing human heart in this study. While we observed significant gender dependent differences in atrial tissues, we did not however observe clear patterns of gender dependent expression in the ventricles. Our data do, however, emphasize the importance of addressing such confounding factors as gender, age, and disease progression when exploring ionic remodeling processes in the human heart and in constructing patient-specific models of cardiac electrophysiology.</p>
