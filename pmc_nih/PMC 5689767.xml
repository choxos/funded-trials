                <p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have potent immunomodulatory functions and are a promising therapy for immune‐mediated inflammatory disorders. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of fresh, autologous, adipose‐derived MSCs (ASCs) to treat feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a chronic oral mucosal inflammatory disease similar to human oral lichen planus. Here, we investigate the use of fresh allogeneic ASCs for treatment of FCGS in seven cats. Radiolabeled ASCs were also tracked systemically. Each cat received two intravenous injections of 20 million ASCs, 1 month apart. Oral inflammation, blood lymphocyte subsets, anti‐fetal bovine serum antibody levels, ASC crossmatching and serum proteins and cytokine concentrations were determined. Four of the 7 cats (57%) responded to treatment [complete clinical remission (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or substantial clinical improvement (<italic>n</italic> = 2)]. Three cats were nonresponders. Prior to therapy, most cats had increased circulating CD8+ T cells, decreased CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, and a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, however clinical resolution was not associated with normalization of these parameters. Nonresponders showed more severe systemic inflammation (neutrophilia, hyperglobulinemia and increased interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration) prior to ASC therapy. Clinical remission took up to 20 months and no clinical relapse has occurred. A higher fraction of radiolabeled ASCs were identified in the oral cavity of FCGS affected cats than the control cat. The administration of fresh, allogenic ASCs appeared to have lower clinical efficacy with a delayed response as compared to the fresh, autologous ASCs. In addition, the mechanism(s) of action for autologous and allogenic ASCs may differ in this model of oral inflammation. S<sc>tem</sc> C<sc>ells</sc> T<sc>ranslational</sc> M<sc>edicine</sc>

                <p>This study is the first to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of fresh, allogeneic adipose derived stem cells systemic therapy for a naturally occurring, inflammatory disease in cats. We demonstrate that this therapy resulted in delayed clinical and histological resolution and immune modulation as compared to autologous therapy. We also demonstrated that the mechanism(s) of action for autologous and allogenic adipose‐derived MSCs (ASCs) may differ in this model of oral inflammation.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Stem cell‐based therapy and research have made exceptional progress in the last decade. Apart from their capacity to regenerate damaged tissues, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess unique immunomodulatory capabilities and have improved the outcome of clinical diseases with aberrant immune responses <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. We recently published on the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) to treat naturally occurring feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS). FCGS is a large animal model of immune‐mediated oral mucosal inflammatory diseases of humans including oral lichen planus (OLP), recurrent aphthous stomatitis, pemphigus, and pemphigoid <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. In both human and cats, these diseases result in painful mucosal lesions that markedly reduce quality of life and often require long‐term immunosuppressive therapy with significant associated risks and side effects. While the pathogenesis of these oral mucosal inflammatory diseases is complex and heterogeneous, the histological process consistently involves tissue infiltration primarily by activated, effector T and B cells, with a skew toward a Th1 phenotype <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p>
              <p>Knowledge and clinical experience derived from veterinary medicine and specifically from naturally occurring diseases in client‐owned pets, such as FCGS, that mimic human diseases serve to inform the best practices for human clinical trials <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Naturally occurring diseases in dogs and cats that display the defining attributes of similar or identical diseases in humans hold promise for providing predictive and reliable proof of concept when evaluating new therapeutics <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. Importantly, naturally occurring diseases in companion animals reflect the complex genetic, environmental and physiologic variation present in outbred populations.</p>
              <p>FCGS is a painful and debilitating severe oral mucosal inflammatory disease of cats that is estimated to affect 0.7%–12% of the general cat population <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Clinical signs are moderate to severe oral pain and discomfort, including inappetence, reduced grooming, weight loss and ptyalism <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Approximately 70% of cats respond to the current standard of care for FCGS, which is full or near‐full mouth tooth extraction by either complete resolution (28.4%) or substantial improvement (39%) <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. The remaining ∼30% of cats do not respond to tooth extraction (refractory FGCS). These cats, like humans with oral inflammatory diseases including OLP, pemphigus, and pemphigoid, require life‐long therapy with antibiotics, corticosteroids, and pain medication As with the aforementioned human oral mucosal diseases, there is no cure and spontaneous disease resolution has not been reported in cats with FCGS <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Due to the debilitating nature of FCGS, severely affected cats that do not respond to treatment are often euthanized. The etiology of FCGS remains elusive but is thought to be due to the host immune system responding inappropriately to chronic oral antigenic stimulation secondary to underlying oral disease or clinical/subclinical viral infections <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>.</p>
              <p>MSCs are nonhematopoetic cells harvested from tissues such as adipose tissue, bone marrow, liver, placenta, and umbilical cord blood. These cells are plastic‐adherent, fibroblast‐like cells capable of high proliferation and tri‐lineage differentiation <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. MSCs can inhibit T‐cell proliferation, alter B‐cell function, downregulate MHC II on antigen presenting cells and inhibit dendritic cell maturation and differentiation <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. ASCs have been isolated and characterized in several species including humans <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>.</p>
              <p>Autologous ASCs have shown promise for cell‐based therapeutics in veterinary medicine <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. The benefits of autologous ASCs include that they are nonimmunogenic, safe in humans and animals, and have been used clinically for nearly a decade with no significant adverse reactions reported other than transient fever in humans, occasional transfusion reactions in cats and self‐resolving inflammatory flares in horses <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. The use of autologous ASCs have practical drawbacks including the time required for isolation and proliferation of sufficient cell number for treatment. In addition, a subset of cats are unable to receive autologous ASCs due to the deleterious effect of feline foamy virus on ASC expansion <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. Allogeneic ASCs have the practical advantage of increased availability, higher quality control and standardization between treatments, decreased cost and reduced anesthetic events for the recipients <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>. Systemic administration [i.e., intravenous (IV) injection] of allogeneic ASCs appears to be safe with no significant adverse events reported <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. Currently, allogeneic ASCs are used in several human clinical trials <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. However, unlike autologous ASCs, allogeneic ASCs may have low immunogenicity, and may provoke an innate immune response (instant blood‐mediated inflammatory reaction) and/or antibody development <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>. Treatment of FCGS with autologous ASCs resulted in cure or substantial clinical improvement in 71% of cats, suggesting that FCGS may be a promising disease target for allogeneic ASC therapy.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical, histopathological, and immunologic effects resulting from systemic administration of fresh, allogeneic ASCs in a cohort of cats with refractory FCGS. We also investigated the immediate fate of systemically administered ASCs via scintigraphic tracking. We hypothesized that systemic allogeneic ASC therapy would be safe and result in systemic immunomodulation, reduction of oral inflammatory lesions, and improvement of clinical signs. We also hypothesized that radiolabeled ASCs would accumulate in the oral cavity of cats affected with gingivostomatitis. We found that ASCs administered systemically resulted in complete clinical remission or substantial clinical improvement in 57% of the cats (four out of seven). This improvement correlated with reduction of inflammatory lesions.</p>

                <p>This study was conducted with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the Clinical Trials Review Board, University of California—Davis (UCD). All owners signed an informed consent. Seven client‐owned cats with refractory FCGS were recruited to the study. Inclusion criteria included cats affected by FCGS with no other primary co‐morbidities. These cats did not respond to full‐mouth tooth extraction performed at least 6 months prior to enrollment. If corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy had been prescribed, it was discontinued 2 weeks prior to and for the entire duration of the clinical trial. Full‐mouth dental radiographs were obtained to confirm the absence of retained root tips and to rule out any other underlying lesions. All cats were screened and tested negative for feline immune deficiency virus and feline leukemia virus infection.</p>

Cats that met the inclusion criteria had blood collected for a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, blood lymphocyte phenotyping, and serum cytokine analysis prior to treatment and at 3 and 6 months post treatment. In addition, the presence of anti‐bovine serum albumin (anti‐FBS) antibodies was evaluated prior to and at 6 months post ASC administration. Oral biopsies were collected prior to ASC administration (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and at 6 months post administration (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Clinical disease severity was evaluated using a stomatitis disease activity index (SDAI) scoring system <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>. The SDAI scoring was performed at the time of study enrollment and at 6 months (Supporting Information Figure) <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>. Briefly, the cats' owners completed a brief questionnaire and scored appetite, activity level, grooming behavior and perceived oral comfort on a scale of 0 to 3. Lesion severity was also scored by 2 veterinary dental specialists (BA, FV), experienced in FCGS evaluation, as 0 (no lesion), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe). The SDAI score for each cat was calculated at each time point (range = 0, no disease, to 20, severe disease). A final examination was performed at 6 months after the first ASC treatment. However, cats were followed up continually and data are presented from the final recheck as well. During the study period, the cats received only opioid analgesic management (i.e., buprenorphine or oxymorphone) without any immunosuppressive, antibiotic or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory medication.</p>

Briefly, ∼ 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> ASCs were labeled with 15 mCi (555MBq) of <sup>99m</sup>Tc ‐HMPAO. 20 million labeled ASCs were used for injection and 5 million ASCs were kept to measure viability, labeling efficiency and label persistence at 6 hours as previously described <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref>. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion test. Radiolabeled ASCs were injected via a cephalic vein catheter. The treatment was divided into four parts and was slowly injected every 5 minutes. A gamma camera (IS2 Medical Systems, Ottawa, Canada) equipped with a low energy all‐purpose collimator and peaked at 140 keV was used for the imaging. Right lateral, left lateral, and ventral images of the whole body of the cats were acquired, with a 1‐minute static acquisition, immediately after injection (T0), at 1 hour (T1), 6 hours (T6), and 24 hours (T24) after injection. Finally, the distribution of the radiolabeled ASCs was assessed subjectively through the whole body. The radioactive signal was quantified on the right lateral view as a ratio of the radioactivity in the region of the head and the radioactivity in the whole body of the patient. Regions of interest were drawn using the free hand region of interest tool (DICOM viewing software, OsiriX, Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). The head/whole body ratio was measured at all time points available. Due to lower signal to noise ratio, the measurements at 24 hours were corrected for background noise.</p>

                <p>Immediately after injection, most of the radioactive signal was localized within the lungs (Fig. <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B, arrow). A low level of radioactivity was present diffusely throughout the whole body including the area of the oral cavity (Fig. <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B, arrowhead). Subjectively, FCGS‐affected cats had a slightly higher uptake in the area of the oral cavity (Fig. <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B, arrowhead) when compared with the healthy SPF cat (Fig. <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). Moderate to marked radioactive uptake was also identified in the urinary tract. In all three FCGS cats, immediate, focal uptake was identified in the cephalic vein (Fig. <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B) whereas this was not present in the healthy control cat. The ratio head/whole body for all four cats is presented in Figure <xref rid="sct312177-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C. The ratio tends to decrease over time.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first study to investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of allogeneic ASCs for the treatment of a severe oral mucosal inflammatory disease in a naturally occurring animal model. We found that systemically administered, fresh, allogeneic ASCs were safe and could achieve cure, or a substantial reduction in the inflammation associated with FCGS, resulting in regeneration of the oral mucosa and improved clinical signs. However, although patient numbers are low, the efficacy of allogeneic ASCs may be lower as compared to autologous ASC therapy for the treatment of FCGS [57% (4/7) cats in current study, compared to 71% (5/7 cats) in the autologous study] <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. This potential reduction in efficacy for allogeneic ASCs was particularly noted in cats with the most severe inflammation, as measured by blood neutrophil number, serum globulin concentration and serum IFNγ concentration. The clinical response to allogeneic therapy (cure by ∼12–20 months) also appears to be delayed compared to autologous ASC treatment (cure in ∼3–9 months). A clinical response to autologous ASC therapy was also correlated with elevations in serum IL6 and increased percentages of blood CD8<sup>lo</sup> lymphocyte subsets whereas allogeneic ASC therapy was not associated with detectable alterations in these biomarkers.</p>
              <p>In this study, we demonstrated that the IV infusion of a relatively high dose (20 million cells/cat, equivalent to ∼5 million cells/kg) of allogeneic ASCs was safe and well tolerated in cats with severe oral inflammatory disease. Unlike the transfusion reactions noted in two cats that received autologous treatment in our previous study, we did not observe any transfusion reactions, changes in bloodwork or delayed adverse events associated with allogeneic ASC administration. These data are compatible with other studies that have safely infused allogenic ASCs in different disease settings in cats <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>.</p>
              <p>However, while no side effects ware noted in this cohort of cats, the efficacy of allogeneic ASCs for FCGS is less clear. This study recapitulated our autologous study in all measurable ways including study location and clinicians (UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, Regenerative Medicine Lab, Drs. Arzi and Verstraete), patient enrollment criteria, patient signalment (predominantly male cats, average age was 7.5–9 years, average duration of disease was 2.7–2.8 years), cell dose, and route (IV), number (2) and timing (4 weeks apart) of ASC administration. Similar to the three SPF donor ASC cell lines that we used in this study, all autologous ASCs had ASC identity, as defined by CD90 and CD105 expression, were potent, as defined by the ability to suppress activated T cell proliferation, were pure (as defined by the absence of leukocytes) and did not express MHC II. At presentation, the average neutrophil number (9,500 vs. 9,800) and globulin concentration (average 5.3 vs. 4.8) in enrolled cats for both studies were comparable. Thus, the reason for discrepancies between the results in the autologous ASC study and the current study using allogeneic ASC therapy remains elusive.</p>
              <p>We investigated the possibility that the development of antibodies against the ASCs may have resulted in a decreased life span and, hence, reduced efficacy, of allogeneic ASCs as compared to our previous autologous ASC study. We were able to detect specific antibody development in one out of the five cats tested. This alloantibody formation in cats parallels and confirms what has been noted in many species including horses, pigs, macaques, rats and humans <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>. Nonetheless, the significance of antibody development, in terms of clinical outcome, is hotly debated as many of these animals and humans show clinical improvement in spite of antibody development. Similarly, the cat in our study that developed a measurable anti‐ASC antibody reaction was one of the cats who responded favorably to treatment. However, antibody production is consistent with the memory functions of the cellular and humoral arms of the adaptive immune response <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> and it is possible that the innate immune system, which is responsible for the more immediate confrontation and removal of foreign antigens, may have been activated by the administration of the allogeneic ASCs <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref>, including T cell mediated rejection of the allogenic cells. The innate immune system has a key role in the initiation of the adaptive immune response to allogenic antigens and its activity is largely nonspecific <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>. We did not include any measures of innate immune cell response to the ASCs in our study (e.g., pro‐thrombotic ASC markers or activation of complement) <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>. It appears that the fate of allogenic ASCs in cats, as in other species, is not yet fully predictable and it may be that an undetermined number of ASCs are cleared or destroyed resulting in reduced/delayed efficacy and diminished immunomodulatory potential.</p>
              <p>In our current study, the pretreatment percentages of blood CD8+ T cells and the resultant decreased CD4/CD8 T cell ratio mirrored findings in our autologous study <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. However, unlike the results of the autologous clinical trial, at 6 months post allogenic ASC therapy, immune cell subsets (percent CD8+ T cells, CD4/CD8 ratio) did not notably change regardless of the clinical outcome. Furthermore, compared to the results of the autologous ASC study, the pro‐inflammatory serum cytokines TNFα and IFNγ did not show any consistent change after ASC administration. It is plausible that an innate immune reaction to the ASCs and/or alloantibody production may have reduced ASC survival time and impeded their immunomodulatory effect which in turn also reduced the success rate and prolonged the clinical response <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>. This is in agreement with previous studies that demonstrated that allogenic ASCs do not completely evade immune surveillance <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref>.</p>
              <p>We discovered two potential biomarkers of successful response to autologous ASC therapy in cats with FCGS in our last study: a decreased pretreatment percentage of CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, which increased with cure, and increased serum IL6 after ASC infusion. Receptor expression on CD8 cells may dictate whether a CD8 cell has a suppressive or cytotoxic phenotype with decreased CD8 receptor expression (limiting the ability of cells to be classically activated to a cytotoxic phenotype) associated with increased suppressive functions <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref>. We hypothesized that the induction of CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells and the concurrent increase in IL6 may be responsible for the generation of T regulatory cells and “reprogramming” of the immune response resulting in long‐term cure in these cats. As such, one objective of the current study was to determine if these changes would be robust and repeatable after allogenic ASC infusion. Although two of the four cats (50%) that responded to allogenic therapy did demonstrate increased CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, the change was neither predictable nor robust. There was also no accompanying increase in serum IL6, even in the face of disease cure. These findings suggest that there are multiple mechanisms of action for ASC therapy in cats in the context of inflammatory/immune‐mediated diseases. This is not that surprising given the heterogeneity of the disease and the cells. Further studies, both in vitro and in vivo, are needed to dissect out the interaction of ASCs with dendritic cells/macrophages, T cell subsets (e.g., Th17 cells), and B cells to begin to elucidate the mechanism(s) of action for these very potent cells.</p>
              <p>The challenge of understanding how stem cells function is coupled with the need to determine where these cells traffic after administration and how long they persist. The potential to utilize naturally occurring diseases in companion animals for cell tracking studies (with relevant, physiological inflammatory recruitment stimuli) is a strength of these animal models. We found that the IV administration of ASCs to cats with FCGS resulted in the immediate adherence of some cells to the vein close to the site of administration with most cells retained in the lungs and a small proportion of ASCs that trafficked to the inflamed oral cavity. Cell trapping in the lungs was expected and was similar to what has been reported in tracking studies performed in dogs and rodents <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>. It is likely that the trapping occurs at the pulmonary capillary level, due to the relative large size of the MSC compared with the capillary lumen diameter. Interestingly, the amount of radioactivity in the oral cavity of clinical patients was higher than in a healthy control cat. This was not surprising given the degree of oral inflammation and rapid cell adherence to the vasculature after administration. Results confirm that at least a subset of cells traffic early on to the site of inflammation. The presence of radioactivity in the urinary tract is probably due to dissociation of the radioactive label from the ASC. We have noted this suboptimal stability of the label in previous studies and it is a clear limitation of scintigraphic tracking using Tc‐HMPAO <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>. Overall the head/whole body ratios tended to decrease overtime with lowest values noted 6 hours after injection. The values seem to increase at 24 hours but this should be interpreted with caution due to the lower quality of the signal obtained at 24 hours secondary to the short half‐life (6 hours) of Technetium. Also, the presence of dissociated label increases over time and is likely to affect the later measurements. Previous studies have alluded to similar findings and that ASCs that are trapped in the microcapillary networks have a short life span and exert their action via a paracarine mechanism <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref>. Finally, given the delayed clinical response as compared to the administration of autologous ASCs, it possible that pulmonary trapping may occur to a greater extent for allogeneic cells as compared to autologous cells, thus decreasing relative transit to the oral mucosa. Altered cell tracking is one consideration for the delayed potency of allogeneic cells.</p>
              <p>Although autologous and allogeneic cell sources appear to be safe when administered systemically, direct comparison between the two sources are rare <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. However, in terms of clinical outcome, the response of allogeneic therapy for nonresponsive FCGS appears to be delayed as compared to autologous ASC treatment. No direct comparison to other studies is possible; however, other studies also demonstrated improved outcome when using an autologous cell source as compared to allogeneic <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">61</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref>. This delayed response has practical implications when performing a clinical trial in a debilitating and painful disease, such as FCGS, as cat‐owner satisfaction and compliance depend on response to therapy. The delayed response is likely to contribute to a withdrawal from a long term clinical trial.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The use of allogeneic ASCs provides an ideal clinical and commercially applicable solution to stem cell therapy as it can be sold “off‐the shelf,” is readily available, and minimizes the delay in therapy associated with culture time and characterization <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref>, <xref rid="sct312177-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref>. However, these pilot data suggest that the use of allogeneic cells for this oral inflammatory disease may be associated with inconsistencies in immunomodulation and delayed clinical response as compared to the administration of autologous ASCs. In addition, alterations in serum cytokines and CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells were not noted suggesting that the potency and mechanism(s) of action for autologous and allogenic ASCs differ in this model of oral inflammation.</p>
