                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Gene expression studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have demonstrated a type I interferon signature and increased expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. Studies of patients with Aicardi Gouti√®res syndrome, commonly cited as a single gene model for SLE, have suggested that accumulation of non-coding RNAs may drive some of the pathologic gene expression, however, no RNA sequencing studies of SLE patients have been performed. This study was designed to define altered expression of coding and non-coding RNAs and to detect globally altered RNA processing in SLE.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Purified monocytes from eight healthy age/gender matched controls and nine SLE patients (with low-moderate disease activity and lack of biologic drug use or immune suppressive treatment) were studied using RNA-seq. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate findings. Serum levels of endotoxin were measured by ELISA.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We found that SLE patients had diminished expression of most endogenous retroviruses and small nucleolar RNAs, but exhibited increased expression of pri-miRNAs. Splicing patterns and polyadenylation were significantly altered. In addition, SLE monocytes expressed novel transcripts, an effect that was replicated by LPS treatment of control monocytes. We further identified increased circulating endotoxin in SLE patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Monocytes from SLE patients exhibit globally dysregulated gene expression. The transcriptome is not simply altered by the transcriptional activation of a set of genes, but is qualitatively different in SLE. The identification of novel loci, inducible by LPS, suggests that chronic microbial translocation could contribute to the immunologic dysregulation in SLE, a new potential disease mechanism.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the quintessential systemic autoimmune disease. The etiopathogenesis is still not fully understood and there are over 20,000 published studies evaluating various aspects of cellular dysfunction in this disease. Over the past 10 years, insights have come from genome-wide association (GWA) studies as well as gene expression studies. In both cases, a type I interferon pathway was implicated <xref rid="pone.0093846-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Kirou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
              <p>One of the hallmarks of lupus is the presence of autoantibodies directed against nucleic acid targets and other nuclear antigens. The process of apoptosis exposes the immune system to nucleic acids and nuclear antigens, particularly when the apoptotic cells are not cleared appropriately and degrade into smaller components <xref rid="pone.0093846-CasciolaRosen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The apoptotic debris are believed to drive much of the type I interferon signature and the type I interferon itself can drive additional apoptosis. Nevertheless, much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of SLE, particularly at the level of nucleic acid accumulation and dysregulated gene expression. Dysregulated gene expression, with the accumulation of aberrant transcripts, could theoretically contribute to apoptosis or increased type I interferon expression and has been shown to mimic lupus <xref rid="pone.0093846-BeckEngeser1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Stetson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Morita1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Gall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Krieg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p>We utilized next generation sequencing of transcripts (RNA-seq) to characterize the SLE transcriptome in monocytes. Monocytes are a critical cell in SLE. They are implicated in renal damage, which is the major cause of morbidity in SLE, and in atherosclerosis, which is the major cause of mortality in SLE <xref rid="pone.0093846-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Schiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Yoshimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Rho1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Monocytes are, therefore, central to the disease process, but are also of interest because they respond to environmental stimuli, alter their function accordingly, and reflect that information back to other immunologically competent cells. They offer the additional advantage of representing a relatively homogeneous population <xref rid="pone.0093846-Rahimi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This is the first RNA-seq study of SLE and we found not only a transcriptome that exhibits quantitative alterations as defined by the level of gene expression, but also qualitative differences with widely altered splicing preferences and non-coding RNA transcription. Some novel transcripts expressed at higher abundance in SLE monocytes were inducible by LPS, known to activate type I interferons <xref rid="pone.0093846-Smeekens1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Richez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. LPS and microbial products have been demonstrated to accelerate renal disease and induce lupus-like processes in mice <xref rid="pone.0093846-Shui1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhai1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Izui1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Granholm1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This finding provides an additional perspective from which to understand SLE.</p>

                <p>Investigators at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine obtained written informed consent and HIPAA Authorization of study subjects for all SLE samples. The Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins reviewed and approved the study of SLE patients. The use of the anomyzed Red Cross samples was approved by the Red Cross Institutional Review Board. Control samples were obtained from The Center For Aids Research, which supplies blood samples on a fee for service basis. They have obtained consent for the use of the samples and their protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.</p>
                <p>Primary human monocytes were purified using elutriation and adherence from eight healthy controls and nine SLE patients with no other autoimmunity, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0093846-Garrett1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The purity of monocytes was more than 90% by flow cytometry for CD14 staining. All controls and patients were female and an average of approximately 40 years of age. All SLE patients' disease activity was mild-moderate and no one was on high-level immune suppression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s023">Table S1</xref>). All subjects were enrolled in an IRB-approved study and provided informed consent, except the red cross serum samples which were provided as anomyzed discarded samples.</p>

                <p>Total RNA was isolated from 2‚Äì3 million primary monocytes using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and DNA was removed by on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). This method recovers predominantly RNA species &gt;200 bases. 1 ¬µg of total RNA was used to prepare the library with the SOLiD‚Ñ¢ whole transcriptome analysis kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), providing strand-specific data. The procedure followed the instructions of the manufacturer. For miRNA validation, we used miRNeasy from Qiagen. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s024">Table S2</xref> provides RNA quality and cell count information. The OD 260/280 ratio ranged from 1.8‚Äì1.98. RIN scores were not consistently obtained prior to fragmentation but were &gt;7 for those where the RIN was defined. Post fragmentation, the RIN score averaged 2.3. The RNA quality and counts were not different between patients and controls.</p>

                <title>Endotoxin analyses</title>
                <p>MonoMac 6 cells and primary monocytes from healthy donors were stimulated with 100 U/ml Œ±2-interferon (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ), 10 ng/ml Œ≥‚Äìinterferon (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Œ±) (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) for 16 hours, or 1 ¬µg/ml of LPS for two hours. SB203580 was used as a p38- MAPK inhibitor by pretreating the cells for 30 minutes at a concentration of 10 ¬µM. SP600125 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as a JNK inhibitor at a concentration of 10 ¬µM and U0126 (Cell signaling, Danvers, MA) was used as an ERK inhibitor at a concentration of 10 ¬µM. Cells were harvested after stimulation and RNA was prepared as above. To measure circulating endotoxin, serum samples from 99 SLE patients and 112 Red Cross blood donors were analyzed using the Limulus assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The Wilcoxon method was used to compare the levels across groups.</p>

                <p>We used the Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline and further refinements <xref rid="pone.0093846-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> to assemble the monocyte transcriptome and detect novel loci and isoforms, followed by mapping short reads to a collection of reference RNA sequences, including isoforms of coding genes, small RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and repetitive elements. The number of reads mapped to each transcript was used for evaluating differential expression between control and SLE samples. Data has been submitted to GEO as GSE53419.</p>
                <p>The following steps were used in data analysis:</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Use TopHat to align 50 bp sequencing reads to reference genome hg19. TopHat also searched for reads partially mapped to distant locations to identify exon-exon junctions. As a result, TopHat mapped ‚àº22 million reads per sample on average and stored the aligned reads in BAM files. This step did not use any known gene annotation</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Use Cufflinks to assemble transcriptomes of individual samples while using RefSeq gene annotation as reference. On average, Cufflinks reported 65,008 genes and 83,430 transcripts in individual transcriptomes.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Use Cuffmerge to combine individual transcriptomes, also using RefSeq as reference. The merging improved the reliability of novel loci and isoforms by taking a consensus of individual transcriptomes. Cuffmerge reported 59,887 transcripts of 34,307 genes in a consensus transcriptome.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Use Cuffcompare to categorize transcripts by comparing the consensus transcriptome to RefSeq annotation. For example, a class ‚Äú‚Ää=‚Ää‚Äù transcript had the same exon-exon junctions as a known RefSeq transcripts and a class ‚Äúu‚Äù transcripts had no overlapping to any known genes. As a result, Cuffcompare identified 10,200 novel transcribed loci and 10,313 isoforms including novel exon-exon junctions of known genes.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Use the gene annotation tracks downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser to evaluate the novelty of the new loci and isoforms reported by Cuffcompare. The tracks were UCSC Genes, Ensembl Genes, GENCODE Genes V12, CCDS, H-Inv 7.0, sno/miRNA and lincRNA Transcripts, including evidence-based gene annotation, computationally generated gene prediction, and collections of non-coding RNAs. The comparison identified 2,280 and 4,000 high novelty loci and isoforms not included in any of the seven annotation tracks.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Repeat the TopHat-to-Cuffcompare steps without using a reference annotation for assembling and merging transcriptomes. Cuffcompare identified 774 transcripts having the exact same exon-exon junctions as known RefSeq transcripts. These true positives had higher read counts and consistency across samples. Surprisingly, they were also longer and included more exons on average, which presumably made them more difficult to be completely assembled. High read count and high consistency were then used as the criteria to filter the novel loci and isoforms identified by previous steps to obtain 3,725 and 1,327 high-confidence novel loci and isoforms respectively.</p>

                <title>Transcriptome characterization</title>
                <p>Monocyte transcriptomes from Nine female SLE patients and eight female healthy controls were studied using RNA-seq. Total RNA was purified from monocytes and used for library preparation. Our first goal in this study was to reconstruct the human monocyte transcriptome using the entire dataset. The Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline reported four major classes of transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), including 10,313 isoforms of known genes and 10,200 transcribed loci not included in the RefSeq annotation. The processed data are given in an excel spreadsheet in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s019">Data S1</xref>. The novel isoforms had a more complex structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). On the other hand, the novel loci were shorter on average than known genes and over 97% of them included only one exon.</p>
                <p>To further define the monocyte transcriptome, we counted the total number of reads solely aligned to each of the four major RNA classes: coding RNAs, long non coding (lncRNAs), small RNAs, and repetitive elements. Ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) were excluded from this summary. Close to 80% of the non-rRNA reads were mapped to coding RNAs while the other three classes evenly shared the remaining reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Small RNAs had the highest molar concentration after read counts were adjusted by the total length of the RNA classes, followed by repetitive elements, coding RNAs, and lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). These data were comparable to the distribution seen in other systems <xref rid="pone.0093846-Djebali1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The classifications of transcripts were refined. We identified 4,000 high-novelty isoforms that were not present in seven additional annotated databases and included at least one unknown exon-exon junction, as well as 2,271 high-novelty loci that had no overlap with either exons or introns of any previously reported transcripts. We then defined 1,327 high-confidence isoforms, having at least 10 uniquely mapped reads not mapped to any other genes or isoforms of the same gene in at least six samples, and 3,725 high-confidence novel loci having at least 10 uniquely mapped reads in at least six samples and more than 10√ó overall sequencing depth. After this refinement, 448 novel isoforms and 778 novel loci that had both high-novelty and high-confidence were identified. There was no association between high-novelty and high-confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We manually examined a subset of the 778 novel loci for protein coding potential and the possibility that they are orthologs of coding genes in other species using BLAST. Most did not exhibit similarity to any annotated genes and the majority had limited protein coding potential (&lt;100 contiguous amino acids). We selected 27 novel loci and validated transcription from all 27 using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s025">Table S3</xref>).</p>

                <title>Class-specific transcripts in SLE</title>
                <p>The major goal of this study was to identify a unique signature of the monocyte transcriptome in SLE as a strategy to improve our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms. We found that there were a large number of known protein coding genes expressed in normal monocytes, but silenced in SLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These genes were highly enriched with ones related to embryo development (p‚Ää=‚Ää6.0E-60), suggesting that SLE monocytes are more differentiated. Antisense transcripts were also more likely to be silenced in SLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, the numbers of novel loci and novel isoforms transcribed only in patients were 3.95 and 1.49 times higher, respectively, than the numbers of control-specific ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>

                <p>We evaluated the differential expression between the two groups of samples in six classes of genes/transcripts: known RefSeq protein coding genes, novel loci identified by Cufflinks, lncRNAs, small RNAs, repetitive elements, and the antisense transcripts of coding genes. These genes/transcripts were filtered by a statistical analysis, so all the remaining 33,760 (72% of 47,171 total reads) were mapped by at least three sequencing reads in at least three samples. We applied the negative binomial test implemented by the edgeR package of Bioconductor <xref rid="pone.0093846-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and identified 1,754 differentially expressed genes/transcripts with p values less than 0.01 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2. Classes of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s026">Table S4</xref>.</p>
                <p>The patient-control difference of total transcription varied dramatically between RNA classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Total transcription of both sense and antisense transcripts of known coding genes was reduced by approximately 15% in SLE (p‚Ää=‚Ää5.6E-61 and 7.4E-105 respectively). Total transcription of novel loci was strikingly increased by over 45% in SLE (p&lt;1.0E-300), as SLE patients produced many previously undiscovered transcripts that had low or no transcription in healthy monocytes. Although expression of small RNAs was downregulated by about 5%, expression of 91 pri-miRNAs was dramatically increased by 38% (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.01), whereas the three classes of small nucleolar RNAs were all downregulated in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The overall up-regulation of pri-miRNAs and down-regulation of coding genes jointly suggested a modified miRNA regulatory system in SLE. Subclasses of repetitive elements also had different directions of change in SLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). All endogenous retroviral (ERV) subclasses were consistently downregulated (p‚Ää=‚Ää4.7E-4 to 3.8E-29). Other retrotransposons such as LTR retrotransposons, SINE, and LINE (L1) elements were variably decreased in SLE patients, while expression of SINE1/7SL elements was increased.</p>

                <p>Functional analysis of the protein coding genes identified a large number of pre-defined gene sets whose members were enriched within differentially expressed genes (DEGs), partially listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s027">Table S5</xref>. Most noticeably, DEGs upregulated in SLE were enriched with genes related to immune response and cytokine activity, while the downregulated DEGs were enriched with genes related to cell adhesion and motion. According to Genetic Association Database (GAD), eleven upregulated DEGs were associated with SLE in previous studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s028">Table S6</xref>). In addition, the combined gene set of up- and downregulated DEGs was enriched with potential targets of transcription factors highly relevant to SLE, including AP1 (p‚Ää=‚Ää3.4E-09), E47 (p‚Ää=‚Ää1.1E-8), RFX1 (5.8E-7), IRF1 (p‚Ää=‚Ää1.4E-3), and IRF2 (p‚Ää=‚Ää1.3E-3). We selected six DEGs, five upregulated and one downregulated in SLE, to be validated in new samples using qRT-PCR. Five of the genes were significantly different between controls and patients (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.049 to 0.0001) and all six were changed in the same direction in both patient cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

Sixty-seven genes had longer 3‚Ä≤UTRs in patients compared to controls and 54 genes had shorter 3‚Ä≤UTRs in patients (defined by a ratio of &gt;2.0 and a p&lt;0.01). The longer 3‚Ä≤UTR gene set was characterized by pathways centered on NFŒ∫B, Akt, UBC and HNF4A. The shorter 3‚Ä≤UTR gene set was characterized by pathways centered on UBC, NFŒ∫B, and ERK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s005">Figure S5</xref>). As shorter 3‚Ä≤UTRs can escape regulation by miRNAs and the inflammatory pathways implicated by the pathway analysis are concordant with what is known about SLE, these gene sets are notable and may given insight into the SLE process <xref rid="pone.0093846-Mayr1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Tranter1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>

<xref rid="pone.0093846-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The gene-level read counts of sense and antisense transcripts were positively, but weakly, correlated (r‚Ää=‚Ää0.19, p&lt;0.01). Overall, examining patients and controls together, the total number of reads mapped to the antisense transcripts was about 1/30 of the total number of reads mapped to the sense transcripts. However, a small set of genes demonstrated much higher antisense transcription than sense transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s006">Figure S6</xref>), such as <italic>USP5</italic>, a ubiquitin peptidase, and <italic>CMTM5</italic>, a chemokine-like factor gene.</p>

                <title>LncRNA expression</title>
                <p>LncRNAs can regulate nearby coding genes as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. We summarized the correlation of transcription between pairs of lncRNAs and coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s007">Figure S7</xref>). When the lncRNAs were located within 100 kb upstream of coding genes, the pairs had a positive correlation on average, regardless of whether the lncRNAs were on the same strand as the coding genes or not. The correlation increased as the distance between lncRNAs and coding genes became closer. On the other hand, when the lncRNAs were located downstream of coding genes, there was no association between the two classes of transcripts if they were on the opposite strands, and a much stronger association if they were on the same strand. The latter might suggest the misclassification of extended 3‚Ä≤ UTR transcription of coding genes as lncRNAs. Although lncRNAs were less likely to change in SLE compared to other RNA classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s026">Table S4</xref>), the locations of some significantly changed lncRNAs suggested their involvement in SLE. For example, both <italic>HIVEP2</italic> itself and a lncRNA about 800 to 1,500 bases upstream of its transcription start site (TSS) were significantly upregulated in SLE, although their RNA abundance was over 50 times different. There were also two significantly upregulated lncRNAs located within 50 kb of each other on chromosome 6 and surrounded by a group of signficantly dysregulated coding genes including <italic>TAGAP</italic>, <italic>FNDC1</italic>, <italic>SOD2</italic>, <italic>WTAP</italic>, and <italic>ACAT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

Two pri-miRNAs, miR 193a and miR-212, were statistically significantly increased in SLE samples with concomitantly diminished target mRNA levels.

Another example was a cluster of 26 novel loci located within a 34 kb region on chromosome 8, most of which were significantly upregulated in SLE and none of which were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s018">Figure S18</xref>). We selected 22 novel transcripts upregulated in SLE to be validated in new samples using qRT-PCR.

                <p>The fact that these loci were preferentially or exclusively transcribed in SLE monocytes indicates they are very cell-specific. They were not present in seven annotated gene databases supporting SLE-specificity. To examine potential mechanisms driving expression, we initially treated MonoMac 6 cells with TNF-Œ±, Œ±2-interferon, Œ≥‚Äìinterferon, or LPS. Time course experiments identified the optimal stimulation time. Only LPS replicated the pattern of expression of novel loci seen in the SLE samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These findings were further validated using published datasets and examining concordance. In this analysis, genes over-expressed in SLE were equally likely to be represented in the a2-interferon- and LPS-induced genesets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093846.s020">Figure S20</xref>). We then confirmed the effect using monocytes from healthy adult donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To understand potential pathways regulating the LPS effect, we utilized p38 (SB203580), ERK (U0126) and JNK (SP600125) inhibitors. The major effect of LPS induction of the novel transcripts was p38 mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g004">Figures 4C and 4D</xref>, Figures S21 and S22).</p>

TNF-Œ± (10 ng/ml) led to upregulation of 16/25 (fold change&gt;1.5), Œ±IFN (100 U/ml) led to upregulation of 9/25 (fold change&gt;1.5), Œ≥IFN (10 ng/ml) led to upregulation of 5/25 (fold change&gt;1.5), and LPS led to upregulation of 22/25 (fold change&gt;1.5). Three experiments with duplciates or triplicates were averaged. The error bars indicate standard deviation. B) Human primary monocytes were stimulated as above and the abundance of the novel transcripts quantitated by qRT-PCR. TNF-Œ± led to upregulation of 9/25 (fold change&gt;1.5), Œ±IFN led to upregulation of 7/25 (fold change&gt;1.5), Œ≥IFN led to upregulation of 9/25 (fold change&gt;1.5), and LPS led to upregulation of 23/25 (fold change&gt;1.5). Pre-treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 led to markedly diminished induction of expression by LPS. Three experiments with duplciates or triplicates were averaged.

                <title>Circulating endotoxin</title>
                <p>Although endotoxin has been previously implicated in murine lupus models and LPS is known to activate interferon pathways via TLR4, there has been no direct measurement of endotoxin in SLE patients <xref rid="pone.0093846-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Richez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Shui1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhai1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Izui1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Granholm1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We compared, therefore, serum levels from 99 female SLE patients and those from 112 female healthy adult blood donors. This patient set comprised new samples. The SLE patients were 91% female, 46% black, 54% Caucasian, mean age 37.1 years, mean SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index) of 2.6 and mean physician global estimate of 0.45. The mean prednisone dose was 9 mg/day. The red cross blood donors were females who were self declared as healthy. SLE patients had significantly higher endotoxin levels compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093846-g005">Figure 5</xref>). When we examined clinical markers for associations with circulating endotoxin levels, we found no association with age, weight, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), specific organ damage, specific autoantibodies or complete blood count (CBC) parameters. Because LPS/endotoxin can induce type I interferon expression, we examined the concordance of coding genes expressed in SLE, after stimulation with LPS and after stimulation with Œ±-interferon using our prior results and published array results <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang5" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang6" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies a more comprehensive and accurate transcriptional analysis has become feasible. We report a whole transcriptome analysis of patients with SLE and compare gene expression with that of healthy controls. We detected many instances of SLE-specific alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and novel loci transcription. Splicing and polyadenylation in SLE both favored longer, more complex transcripts.</p>
              <p>One of our goals was to identify the transcript abundance of non-coding RNAs, which have been demonstrated in subjects with Aicardi Gouti√®res syndrome, an infantile-onset disorder with features of lupus, and in murine models, to drive a type I interferon signature <xref rid="pone.0093846-Goutieres1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Kuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Lebon1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In this study, we found instead decreased expression of many non-coding RNAs. We hypothesize that repression of endogenous retroviral sequences may be mediated by the type I interferon that is known to be overexpressed in SLE patients <xref rid="pone.0093846-Ghazizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. One class of non-coding RNA for which expression was clearly induced in SLE patients was that of the pri-miRNAs. These small non-coding RNAs are processed to repress translation and regulate multiple messenger RNAs. In our study, two specific pri-miRNAs were significantly upregulated in SLE monocytes compared to healthy controls. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that the targets of these two miRNAs exhibited decreased message levels. These observations suggest that the elevated pri-miRNA levels that we identified in SLE monocytes are functionally relevant.</p>
              <p>Among known protein-coding genes, there was evidence of global repression, and many genes downregulated in SLE monocytes were related to cell proliferation and cell adhesion. The genes upregulated in SLE monocytes reflected active inflammation. These observations are concordant with what has been seen using arrays and what is known about monocyte behavior in SLE <xref rid="pone.0093846-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Kirou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Papewalis1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Steinbach1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Banchereau1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Monocytes are known to have a shortened life span and to exhibit characteristics related to type I interferon exposure <xref rid="pone.0093846-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Shoshan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The overall repression of gene expression could be consistent with increased differentiation and our previous studies demonstrated altered surface expression of several proteins <xref rid="pone.0093846-Rahimi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The finding of SLE-specific isoforms and polyadenylation was particularly intriguing. The finding of disease-specific isoforms is not unique to this study, but it has not been reported this extensively outside of tumor-specific transcripts. Some studies have found functional effects of autoantibodies directed at nuclear constituents and altered expression of splicing factors and this study raises the question of the mechanism driving altered processing <xref rid="pone.0093846-Koscec1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Moulton1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Moulton2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Altered expression of splicing factors could also contribute to the pattern observed here <xref rid="pone.0093846-Moulton1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Moulton2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.</p>
              <p>This study raises many questions. We examined a cohort of patients with low disease activity to minimize the effect of medications. Whether patients with more severe disease could have a more disturbed transcriptome is not known. This is a relatively small cohort size, and additional studies will be required to replicate these findings. We did not perform extensive validation of the many classes of RNA found to have altered expression, instead capturing a snapshot of the SLE transcriptome in a single cell type and focusing on the breadth of the effect. We validated using new samples from controls and patients for the DEGs and found similar changes in nearly all DEGs, supporting that these effects are consistently seen in the disease. If similar disruptions are found in additional cell types, it would suggest a systematically altered transcriptome. Nevertheless, analyses of isoforms and un-annotated loci is a moving target and additional information is likely to be forthcoming, allowing improved understanding of the regulation of these processes. Monocytes represent a cell type that is uniquely plastic and it may be that effects are magnified in this cell type.</p>
              <p>IRF1, IRF2, and RFX1 were previously identified by us as potential regulators of genes with altered histone H4 acetylation <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These transcription factors, now identified as potential regulators of the SLE transcriptome, could integrate inflammatory and interferon signals. The MAP kinase and NFŒ∫B pathways were identified as potential regulating pathways in the polyadenylation pattern specific to the SLE samples. These pathways have long been implicated in SLE <xref rid="pone.0093846-Molad1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Rapoport1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Gorjestani1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Takase1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Enzler1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. To further implicate the MAP kinase pathway, we found that expression of many novel loci were inducible with LPS and that inducibility could be blocked with the P38 inhibitor, SB203580. The roles of the novel loci are not yet known and we acknowledge that these fall into a bioinformatic limbo. Nevertheless, endotoxin has been implicated in a variety of diseases and induces type I IFN <xref rid="pone.0093846-Feroze1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-delCampo1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Zhang7" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-DeBeaux1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Casey1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Our findings of significant overlap of the genes induced by LPS/endotoxin, SLE and Œ±-interferon along with increased endotoxin in peripheral blood supports a role for endotoxin in the pathologic gene expression pattern identified here. This is the first RNA-seq study of SLE monocytes and our analysis revealed a surprisingly distorted transcriptome. The strengths of the study include the comprehensive approach to the characterization of the transcriptional landscape, use of a purified cell type, validation of the findings using a new cohort, and a mechanistic insight into the expression of novel loci.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this study include a small sample size focused on mild to moderate disease activity. While the low disease activity enabled us to examine patient samples without the perturbation of high-level immune suppression, it may also have limited our findings. The platform used and the sample cell count may also have limited our findings. The libraries were 50 bp single reads and total RNA was used with post-run ribosomal RNA exclusion. Finally, technical aspects such as RNA quality may have limited our ability to identify disease-specific variation in signal. Nevertheless, in spite of these potential limitations, our analyses were robust and identified many changes specific to the SLE transcriptome.</p>
              <p>In summary, we found a broadly altered transcriptome. By using a single cell type, we minimized the effects of different cell populations and improved the specificity of our discoveries. The most significant finding of this study was identification of disease-specific novel loci expression, regulated by endotoxin. Circulating endotoxin has been negatively associated with prognosis in a number of diseases and is thought to drive a type of immune exhaustion <xref rid="pone.0093846-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093846-Nowroozalizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Whether endotoxin could be responsible for other features of the altered transcriptome or could represent a biomarker for disease severity remains to be determined. While additional studies will be required to determine which features contribute to the pathologic processes in this still enigmatic disease, the importance of this study lies in the identification of multiple features of altered transcription and processing in SLE, a heretofore unappreciated facet of the disease.</p>
