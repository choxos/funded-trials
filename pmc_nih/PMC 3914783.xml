              <abstract>
                <p>HIV-1 associated dementia remains a significant public health burden. Clinical and experimental research has shown that reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be a risk factor for neurological complications associated with HIV-1 infection. We are actively testing genetically modified macrophages for their possible use as the cell-based gene delivery vehicle for the central nervous system (CNS). It can be an advantage to use the natural homing/migratory properties of monocyte-derived macrophages to deliver potentially neuroprotective BDNF into the CNS, as a non-invasive manner. Lentiviral-mediated gene transfer of human (h)BDNF plasmid was constructed and characterized. Defective lentiviral stocks were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with lentiviral transfer plasmid together with packaging and envelope plasmids. High titer lentiviral vector stocks were harvested and used to transduce human neuronal cell lines, primary cultures of human peripheral mononocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) and murine myeloid monocyte-derived macrophages (mMDM). These transduced cells were tested for hBDNF expression, stability, and neuroprotective activity. The GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System was used to evaluate transduced cells for any adverse effects by assessing gene profiles of 24 reference genes. High titer vectors were prepared for efficient transduction of neuronal cell lines, hMDM, and mMDM. Stable secretion of high levels of hBDNF was detected in supernatants of transduced cells using western blot and ELISA. The conditioned media containing hBDNF were shown to be protective to neuronal and monocytic cell lines from TNF-α and HIV-1 Tat mediated cytotoxicity. Lentiviral vector-mediated gene transduction of hMDM and mMDM resulted in high-level, stable expression of the neuroprotective factorBDNF <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings form the basis for future research on the potential use of BDNF as a novel therapy for neuroAIDS.</p>

              <p>NeuroAIDS is one of the most devastating consequences of HIV-1 infection which incorporates both infectious and degenerative pathophysiologic pathways. Symptoms include behavioral abnormalities, motor dysfunction, and frank dementia <xref rid="pone.0082030-Antinori1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Clinical severity ranges from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) and mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) to its most severe form - HIV-associated dementia (HAD) <xref rid="pone.0082030-Ghafouri1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Neurologic disorders associated with HIV-1 infection occur in about 40% to 70% of HIV-infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0082030-Boisse1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Despite the improved life expectancy of HIV-1-infected patients due to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART there is an increased prevalence of neurocognitive impairment infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0082030-Dore1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082030-Schouten1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Part of this increase may be attributed to poor penetration of HAART drugs into the CNS to eradicate the virus <xref rid="pone.0082030-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and increased life expectancy of HIV-1-infected patients. Therefore, the development of HAD is a significant independent risk factor in AIDS-related mortality <xref rid="pone.0082030-Liner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The blood brain barrier (BBB) strictly limits the transport of soluble materials, pathogens and circulating cells into the brain and helps maintain the stability of the neuronal microenvironment within the CNS. Among the many FDA approved anti-HIV/AIDS drugs, Zidovudine is the only drug known to cross the BBB to some extent <xref rid="pone.0082030-Kaul1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, emergence of distinct drug resistant viral strains has been reported in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <xref rid="pone.0082030-Asahchop1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, development of adjunctive therapeutic interventions for neuroAIDS is needed.</p>

Clinically, it has been shown that expression of hBDNF is down-regulated in HIV-positive individuals when compared to HIV-negative individuals <xref rid="pone.0082030-Avdoshina1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Despite several reports describing the important role of hBDNF in reducing HIV-1 protein-mediated neurotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0082030-Mocchetti1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082030-Nosheny3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, inefficient delivery has hampered present attempts to develop hBDNF-based therapies. Moreover, the characteristics of HAD requires continuous and sustained, long-term replenishment of hBDNF in order to alleviate ongoing neuroinflammation.</p>
              <p>Neuroinflammation is a common feature observed throughout the progression of the disease from the latent, asymptomatic stage of AIDS to HAD <xref rid="pone.0082030-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Circulating monocytes and macrophages have the ability to traverse the intact BBB and undergo differentiation within brain parenchyma, giving rise to long-lived brain resident macrophages and microglia <xref rid="pone.0082030-Bart1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, neuroinvasion of monocytes has been shown to occur concurrently with the detection of virus in the CNS as well as CSF <xref rid="pone.0082030-Gras1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This is also accompanied by elicitation of chemokines such as MCP-1 by resident CNS cells including neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Chemokines also have the potential to recruit peripheral leukocytes across the BBB into the brain parenchyma <xref rid="pone.0082030-Boehme1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This property of monocytes can be exploited to deliver exogenous genes of interest into the brain for neurotherapy <xref rid="pone.0082030-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. For example, Dou <italic>et al.</italic> used macrophages as carriers to deliver nanoformulated antiretroviral drugs across the BBB into the various regions of the diseased brain <xref rid="pone.0082030-Dou2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Previous results from our laboratory showed that intravenously infused primary mouse monocytes were able to transmigrate across intact BBB into the brain, and that we could enhance this process significantly by transient disruption of the BBB <xref rid="pone.0082030-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, the development of a monocyte-/macrophage-based expression of hBDNF could be a harnessed as a possible gene therapy for neuroAIDS.</p>
              <p>HIV-based defective lentiviral vectors (LVs) were chosen to evaluate the efficacy of genetically modified MDMs to deliver hBDNF into the CNS due to their ability to transduce dividing and nondividing cells and previously reported marked superiority to other viral vector systems <xref rid="pone.0082030-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. LVs have the unique ability to deliver relatively large genes or multiple gene inserts, thereby providing controllable and cell-specific expression of the transgene <xref rid="pone.0082030-Lundberg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. An early phase clinical trial using LVs as a method for delivery of transgenesfor treatment of CNS disease is currently underway in France <xref rid="pone.0082030-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In this study, we constructed an HIV-1-based vector that constitutively expresses hBDNF under the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which stably transduced both human and murine monocyte-derived macrophages with high efficiency <italic>in vitro</italic>. The secreted hBDNF protein was shown to be protective for neuronal and macrophagic cell lines following exposure to the neurotoxin TNF-α. Potential adverse effects due to the introduction and expression of hBDNF on transduced cells were evaluated using a GeXP multiplexed analyzer by comparatively assessing the expression of 24 house- keeping genes. Our findings establish the groundwork for hBDNF as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for neuroAIDS through MDM-mediated delivery.</p>

                <p>Human microglial cell line CHME-5, neuroepithelioma cell line HTB-10 and neuroblastoma cell line HTB-11 were transduced with LVs expressing hBDNF under a CMV promoter, and linked to an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) via the IRES element. Transduction efficiencies were evaluated at day 3 post-transduction by counting the number of GFP-positive cells using a fluorescence microscope. The transduction efficiencies ranged from 98% to 100% among these three neuronal cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0082030-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This was confirmed by examining the transduced cells for the eGFP expression using an immunofluorescence assay with anti-GFP specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0082030-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

                <p>Expression and secretion of hBDNF from transduced cell lines were determined by western blot analysis. To assess hBDNF protein production extracellularly and intracellularly, culture supernatants and cell lysates from LV-hBDNF- and LV-eGFP-transduced cells (mock cells), and non-transduced cells were collected and extracted. As expected, there was no detection of hBDNF expression in the supernatant from non-transduced and mock cells, whereas hBDNF was detected in both the supernatants and cytosolic fraction of cell lysates from LV-hBDNF-transduced cells. The molecular weight of secreted and intracellular form of hBDNF was approximately 14 kD (data not shown).</p>
                <p>We also used a cellular model to test whether the transgene was able to drive the production of a functional hBDNF in cultured supernatants of transduced cells. Transduced cells were seeded at a density of 1.0×10<sup>6</sup> cell/T-25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 hours. The supernatants were collected and the hBDNF protein concentration was quantified by ELISA. ELISA quantification showed no evidence of hBDNF production in the conditioned media from non-transduced or LV-eGFP-transduced cells. For LV-hBDNF-transduced CHME-5 cells, the hBDNF concentration was determined to be 23.635±1.56 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells/24 h. The hBDNF level in the supernatant from LV-hBDNF-transduced HTB-10 was 47.28±2.26 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells/24 h. hBDNF levels in the supernatants from LV-hBDNF-transduced HTB-11 cells were the highest, at 58.64±1.34 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells/24 hours after just a single transduction event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0082030-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
                <p>To determine the stability of hBDNF expression and secretion, transduced cells were sub-cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> up to 20 times, and the concentrations of hBDNF in conditioned media was assessed by ELISA quantification at every 5<sup>th</sup> passage.

TNF-α is an important mediator of inflammation in HAD. Increased levels of TNF-α in the CNS of patients with HAD has largely been attributed to the exposure of brain macrophages and microglia to HIV-1 proteins including HIV-1 Tat <xref rid="pone.0082030-Nicolini1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Chronic HIV-1 infection can lead to neuroAIDS, a disease comprising both infectious and degenerative pathophysiologic pathways. The pathogenic mechanism of neuroAIDS remains poorly understood, although there is general agreement that the entry of HIV-1 into the CNS occurs shortly after viral infection via infected monocytes or macrophages <xref rid="pone.0082030-Alexaki1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0082030-Clay1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These infected peripheral monocytes penetrate into the CNS and pass the virus to microglia and the resident macrophages but not neurons <xref rid="pone.0082030-Gartner1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0082030-Koenig1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Infection of macrophages and microglia can lead to cell activation and production of neurotoxic cytokines including TNF-α and the viral proteins includinHIV-1 Tat <xref rid="pone.0082030-Kaul2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, which can directly or indirectly lead to neuronal damage and apoptosis. Thus, one of the effective therapeutic approaches to combat neuroAIDS is to use neuroprotective effectors to alleviate the neurotoxicity mediated from the viral proteins and cytokines.</p>
              <p>Human BDNF belongs to the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which includes nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and NT4/5. Several independent investigations have suggested that BDNF may help prevent neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0082030-Mocchetti1" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0082030-Bachis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082030-Nosheny5" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that viral proteins can affect the level of BDNF <xref rid="pone.0082030-Nosheny6" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0082030-Nosheny7" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and where serum concentrations of hBDNF in HIV-positive patients was lower than in HIV-negative individuals <xref rid="pone.0082030-Avdoshina1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A strong correlation was also noted between the severity of neurological symptoms in HIV-positive patients and declining levels of hBDNF <xref rid="pone.0082030-Meeker1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Therefore, hBDNF expressed from transduced cells may have a therapeutic role in reducing or neutralizing neurotoxic effect of both TNF-α and HIV-1 Tat. However, current attempts for neuroAIDS therapy have been largely constrained by two major factors: inability of drugs such as BDNF to cross the BBB to enter the brain parenchyma, and the lack of long-term sustainability of adequate amounts of therapeutic drugs in the brain. Invasive surgery has proven to be an approach to overcome the BBB restriction, but it is often accompanied with traumatic brain injuries and transient availability of uncontrolled amounts of therapeutic drugs <xref rid="pone.0082030-Shoichet1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Thus, invasive injection is not a useful therapeutic method since neuroAIDS is a chronic disease, which requires therapeutic treatment to be sustained for long-term in order to protect neurons from continuous onslaught by viral and cellular toxins.</p>
              <p>The goal of this study was to test and evaluate the possible use of genetically modified MDM as a noninvasive gene vehicle to deliver hBDNF in to the CNS to treat neuroAIDS. We successfully constructed LVs which hold the promise of transducing primary cultures of MDM prepared from both human whole blood and murine bone marrow <xref rid="pone.0082030-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0082030-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. LV-mediated effective introduction of hBDNF into primary cultures of MDM and subsequently stable expression will offer continuous and sustained levels of hBDNF for an extended period of time, an important prerequisite for treatment of a chronic neurodegenerative condition. In the current study, we demonstrated that hBDNF expressed from LV-transduced cells conferred significant neuroprotection (p&lt;0.01) against a pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in several human neuronal cell cultures including neuroblastoma HTB-10 and monocytic U937 cells. This protective effect of BDNF was also evidenced in bone marrow-derived SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to the neurotoxin HIV-1 Tat. These findings suggest that effective delivery of genetically modified primary MDM may lead to long-term constitutive expression of a moderate amount of hBDNF in the brain. This could be an effective therapeutic strategy against neuroAIDS.</p>
              <p>A monocyte-/macrophage-based gene delivery system represents a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate neuroinflammatory processeslinked to neuronal death. Immunocytes including mononuclear phagocytes (dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages), neutrophils, and lymphocytes are highly mobile and able to transmigrate across impermeable barriers to sites of infection, tissue injury, cancer, or inflammatory disease <xref rid="pone.0082030-Batrakova1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. There is of a growing interest in testing and establishing the use of mononuclear phagocytic lineage cells, including monocytes and macrophages, as “Trojan horses” for delivery of anti-inflammatory and anti-infective medications into the CNS <xref rid="pone.0082030-McMillan1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Biju <italic>et al.</italic> tested the use of genetically modified monocytes/macrophages to deliver GDNF as a therapy against Parkinson's disease in animal models, demonstrating the role of macrophages as a powerful tool for delivery and expression of therapeutic transgenes at the site(s) of neurodegeneration <xref rid="pone.0082030-Biju1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In recent clinical gene therapy trials, LV-based gene delivery approaches have successfully been used for genetic modification of hematopoietic stem cells with a corrective gene encoding ABCD1 gene to treat X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy <xref rid="pone.0082030-Cartier1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. These results have led toward the development of an MDM cell-based gene therapy approach with the potential for systematic and sustained expression of neuroprotective hBDNF.</p>
              <p>GeXP Genetic Analysis is an assay used to detect or diagnose virus types/subtypes, identify the diagnostic biomarkers of diseases, or reveal the relationship between gene expression and disease severity <xref rid="pone.0082030-Rai1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0082030-Farquharson1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. We employed GeXP to assess whether LV-mediated gene transduction could result in alteration of gene profiles in the transduced cells. Our findings revealed that while all of these reference genes remained stable, changed gene profiles were detected from transduced hMDM cultures, including three down-regulated genes (GK, GUSB, and UBE2D2) and an up-regulated PSMB6 gene. Among these genes, glycerol kinase (GK) is a phosphotransferase enzyme responsible for regulation of glycerol uptake and metabolism <xref rid="pone.0082030-Kida1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Human beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) is a member of the glycosidase family 2 with catalytic activity for –D-glucuronic acid residues. E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (UBE2D2) functions in the ubiquitination of the tumor-suppressor protein p53. PSMB6 is the gene that encodes for human proteasome subunit beta type-6, which is expressed in eukaryotic cells and known to cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in the non-lysosomal pathway. Despite the detected change of the genes, transduced hMDM showed no apparent difference as compared to non-transduced cells in terms of morphology and stable growth under the same in vitro conditions (&gt;3 weeks). This may suggest that statistical difference in their expression of these four genes may not indicatea significant alteration of cellular function. A recent study of long-term examination of LV-transduced CHME-5 and HTB-10 cells has revealed no apparent functional alteration of transductant cells including cell morphology and growth kinetics, as well as transgene expression (&gt;20 passages) <xref rid="pone.0082030-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Future of transduced MDM specifically at the altered genes will be conducted to ascertain whether LV-mediated transduction and expression of hBDNF may cause any adverse effects or functional changes to transduced cells in order to facilitate the development of MDM-mediated gene therapy for neuroAIDS.</p>

The final bicistronic plasmid construct, pDHR-hBDNF-eGFP, was designed to co-express the hBDNF protein and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). LVs encoding the hBDNF or control gene were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells.

                <p>A 96-well plate was coated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human hBDNF (Antigenix America, USA) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plate was washed three times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS and blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at room temperature on an orbital shaker. After washing three times with PBS, the plate was incubated with diluted hBDNF containing supernatant samples for 1 hour and then incubated with biotin-conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human hBDNF (Antigenix America, USA) for 1 hour. The plate was then washed and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Rockland) for 1 hour at room temperature. The presence of human hBDNF protein was detected with one-Step Ultra TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) (Pierce). The enzymatic reaction was stopped via the addition of 1 M sulfuric acid. The quantitation of hBDNF protein was based on optical density values at 450 nm with 570 nm as the reference wavelength, and compared with a standard curve of purified human hBDNF protein (Antigenix America, USA), using an ELISA reader (Beckman Coulter AD340).</p>

                <p>A neuroprotection assay was conducted to assess the degree of that hBDNF in neutralizedthe neurotoxic effects of TNF-α (R &amp; D, USA). LV-hBDNF-HTB-10 cells, mock cells, and non-transduced HTB-10 cells were all exposed to TNF-α at three different concentrations: 500 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, and 20 ng/mL, respectively. After 48 hours, MTT assay was performed to determine cell viability by absorbance reading at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter AD340). T-tests were used to assess any significant differences in cell viability between transduced and non-transduced cells as well as cells receiving conditioned media from transduced or non-transduced cells.</p>
                <p>Similarly, HTB-10 cells were exposed to TNF-α at 300 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL, and 75 ng/mL, diluted with culture medium or conditioned culture medium (1∶10 dilution) collected from LV-hBDNF-transduced cells. The cell viability in normal culture media or conditioned culture media without TNF-α is normalized to be 100%. Additionally, U937 cells were exposed to 16 ng/mL, 8 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL TNF-α, which was diluted with culture medium or conditioned culture media from LV-hBDNF-transduced cells. The cell viability from HTB-10 cells not exposed to TNF-α, but normal medium or conditioned medium (1∶10 dilution of collected medium from LV-hBDNF-transduced cells) alone was considered 100%. After 4-hour incubation, MTT assay was performed to determine cell viability with results read at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter AD340).</p>
                <p>SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were pretreated with conditioned media (1∶10 &amp; 1∶20 dilutions) from LV-hBDNF-transduced HTB-11 cells for 1 h, then exposed to HIV-1 Tat protein (200 ng/mL) for 48 hours, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay as described above. T-tests were used to assess any significant differences in cell viability between cells receiving conditioned media from transduced or non-transduced cells.</p>

                <p>Transduced primary hMDM were analyzed at day 6 post-transduction. The expression of 24 reference genes was analyzed using GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). RNA was extracted from hMDM using Qiagen RNeasy Kit (cat# 74104). First, cells were scraped and pelleted through centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer and neutralized with neutralization buffer. Cell debris was removed and RNA was captured using an RNeasy spin column, washed twice with wash buffer, and then eluted with RNase free molecular grade water. RNA concentration was determined via spectrophotometer at 260 nm. Human Reference RNA (Beckman Coulter, A54267) was used to develop a standard curve for a human reference multiplex. XP-PCR was performed on sample RNA with reverse transcriptase minus and the test included no template reactions as negative controls and reference RNA as a positive control. Kan<sup>R</sup> RNA (Beckman Coulter, #A85017) was added to each sample as an internal control and two genes were designated as reference genes. XP-PCR was conducted in two stages: the first was the RT reaction in which sample RNA was incubated with DNase/RNase free water, 5× RT buffer, reverse transcriptase, and the reverse primer plex for 1 min at 48°C, 60 min at 42°C, and 5 min at 95°C. And next, PCR was performed where cDNA from the RT reaction was incubated with 5× PCR buffer, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, DNA polymerase, and the forward primer plex for 10 min at 95°C, and 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 1 min at 70°C. Finally, amplicons were combined with DNA size standard-400 and sample loading solution (Beckman Coulter, #608098 and #608082), then subjected to capillary electrophoresis. The results were analyzed by Express Profiler and Quant Tool (Beckman Coulter)and normalized to the internal control Kan<sup>R</sup> to eliminate any inter-capillary differences and then normalized a second time to the pre-selected reference genes. Finally, results were compared to the standard curve created for the specific multiplex and normalized values and significance differences between samples were calculated using T-tests.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our study demonstrated that moderate to high levels of hBDNF transduction efficiency and expression can be obtained through the use of lentiviral vector system in human neuronal cell lines as well as primary cultures of human MDM. Moreover, the hBDNF produced from transduced cells is able to provide significant protection against TNF-α and HIV-1 Tat-mediated neurotoxicity. These in vitro study findings further research support that utilize genetically modified monocytes/macrophages as a possible gene delivery vehicle into the brain, with cell-mediated expression of hBDNF as a novel therapy for neuroAIDS.</p>
