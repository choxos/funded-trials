                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>This project seeks to improve providers’ practices and patient outcomes from prehospital (ie, ambulance-based) trauma care in a middle-income country using a novel implementation strategy to introduce a bundled clinical intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>We conduct a two-arm, controlled, mixed-methods, hybrid type II study.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>This study was conducted in the Western Cape Government Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system of South Africa.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>We pragmatically implemented a simplified prehospital bundle of trauma care (with five core elements) using a novel workplace-based, peer-to-peer, rapid training format. We assigned the intervention and control sites.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>We assessed implementation effectiveness among EMS providers and stakeholders, using the RE-AIM framework. Clinical effectiveness was assessed at the patient level, using changes in Shock Index x Age (SIxAge). Indices and cut-offs were established a priori. We performed a difference-in-differences (D-I-D) analysis with a multivariable mixed effects model.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>198 of 240 (82.5%) EMS providers participated, 93 (47%) intervention and 105 (53%) control, with similar baseline characteristics. The overall implementation effectiveness was excellent (80.6%): reach was good (65%), effectiveness was excellent (87%), implementation fidelity was good (72%) and adoption was excellent (87%). Participants and stakeholders generally reported very high satisfaction with the implementation strategy citing that it was a strong operational fit and effective educational model for their organisation. A total of 770 patients were included: 329 (42.7%) interventions and 441 (57.3%) controls, with no baseline differences. Intervention arm patients had more improved SIxAge compared with control at 4 months, which was not statistically significant (−1.4 D-I-D; p=0.35).

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Injured persons in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) experience a disproportionately large burden of global postinjury death and disability, in large part because of inadequate trauma care.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> New care delivery strategies tailored for limited resource settings are therefore needed, especially considering that the global burden of trauma is rising.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Improving the quality of prehospital (ie, ambulance-based) care in LMICs is one such strategy. High-quality prehospital care could avert 54% of all mortality from emergency conditions, including trauma.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> While the efficacy of individual interventions, such as on-scene haemorrhage control and maintaining short scene times have been demonstrated, strategies to implement a package of these interventions in LMIC prehospital settings remain underdeveloped.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> Less than 2% of emergency medicine guidelines are developed for LMICs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Understanding how best to implement prehospital trauma care in LMICs is a critical gap in the literature.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>To address this scientific gap, we previously created and pilot tested a simplified bundle of prehospital trauma care termed, Emergency Medical Services Traumatic Shock Care (EMS-TruShoC). EMS-TruShoC is both evidence-based and expert-ratified, and it is tailored for resource-limited settings.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> The EMS-TruShoC bundle is designed to support EMS providers in identifying and managing traumatic shock, a major cause of preventable death after trauma, which requires immediate resuscitation to reduce morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> EMS-TruShoC was designed and packaged to promote rapid clinical uptake and sustained use by prehospital providers. In a 2017 single-site pilot and feasibility study, we implemented EMS-TruShoC using a novel educational strategy developed for the Western Cape Government (WCG) EMS system termed, High-Efficiency EMS Training (HEET).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> HEET—the implementation strategy—is a low-dose, high-frequency, training and sensitisation programme, based on contemporary principles in adult learning. In the pilot study, we demonstrated that it was feasible to implement EMS-TruShoC via the HEET educational platform at a single site.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>The purpose of this study is to gain more robust implementation and clinical effectiveness data by using a larger participant sample size and by introducing a comparator arm of both providers and patients. The specific objective is to conduct a two-group controlled trial to assess the implementation effectiveness and clinical effectiveness resulting from a pragmatic implementation of EMS-TruShoC using HEET in a resource-constrained EMS system of the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>

                <p>The study was designed as a pragmatic, hybrid type II, quasi-experimental trial to assess the implementation of EMS-TruShoC bundled care using the HEET strategy compared with traditional (classroom-based) training of equivalent content. Implementation and clinical effectiveness outcomes were assessed using a sequential explanatory, mixed-methods approach.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> A mixed-methods evaluation allowed collecting experiences and perspectives that were important to better understand and explain the quantitative findings.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The sequential approach allowed the qualitative data to help explain quantitative trends identified.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The RE-AIM framework, a well-reported implementation science planning and evaluation framework, guided the project implementation and evaluation of outcomes.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> RE-AIM consists of five core domains—reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity and maintenance—and is intended to comprehensively evaluate pragmatic interventions. A hybrid type II design allowed equal emphasis to be placed on assessing implementation outcomes as well as clinical effectiveness.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A quasi-experimental approach was used because it was not possible to randomise the intervention at the level of the provider because of concerns about crossover, and there were not enough sites available to randomise at the level of the site. Ambulance base matching was based on the number of EMS providers, ambulance fleet size, the annual trauma patient volume and jurisdictional population type (ie, dense-urban) at each base. Clinical effectiveness was assessed in a convenience sample of adult trauma patients treated by EMS at both study sites.</p>

Study-eligible providers were approximately 120 clinically active EMS providers at each of the intervention and control ambulance bases with national qualifications of basic, intermediate and advanced life support (BLS, ILS and ALS, respectively). At the time of this study, foundational education for WCG EMS providers from across the Western Cape Province included a 6-week certificate course for BLS, a 12-week course for ILS and a 4-year (degree-earning) training for ALS providers.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

                <p>The Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain WCG EMS bases were identified as suitable research sites, and although either site was suitable to host the implementation activities, Khayelitsha was selected as the intervention site because it was more immediately administratively available.

                <p>EMS-TruShoC was implemented among EMS providers using the HEET programme. HEET was designed as a low-dose (15–20 min), high-frequency (once biweekly) training programme built on principles of professional adult learning.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14</xref> Training was delivered by self-nominated trained paramedics peers, called ‘facilitators’ instead of usual training officers. Each EMS provider participating in the study (the ‘learners’) at the intervention site received one training module every other week, for a total of five modules. Each module was structured around a clinical case scenario and incorporated knowledge acquisition, self-efficacy conditioning and skills practice. Key learning objectives were emphasised using a facilitated discussion approach.</p>

                  <p>This was assessed by patient’s physiological responses to onboard ambulance care. Two relevant measures were considered: the Shock Index (SI), which is calculated by dividing the heart rate by systolic blood pressure, and the SI times the age of the patient (SIxAge). Both SI and SIxAge have been used to identify patients in traumatic shock, perform comparably, and are better than traditional vital signs in predicting trauma outcomes.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–32</xref> We previously published findings of our primary outcome using changes in patient’s SI which demonstrated no significant difference between the intervention and control groups.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this paper, we conduct a preplanned secondary analysis using the SIxAge outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group. An SIxAge ≥36 is the cut-off point for shock in younger trauma populations characteristic of the Western Cape.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 31 32 34</xref> The delta SIxAge is the change of SIxAge calculated by the difference of SIxAge at (or close to) facility arrival minus the SIxAge at the scene of injury. In this study, a negative delta SIxAge (defined as SIxAge at facility arrival minus SIxAge at the scene) represents improved shock on facility arrival. The target effect of the study is the difference in delta SIxAge between the intervention and control groups from pre-implementation to post implementation (ie, difference-in-differences (D-I-D)).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> A more negative D-I-D, or improving SIxAge, indicates that the intervention is performing better than the control.</p>

                  <p>Within each of the four RE-AIM domains, data for each index was calculated as a percentage. Indices were averaged to generate a mean effectiveness score for each domain. The overall implementation effectiveness score was calculated as the average of the mean effectiveness score for all domains. Cut-offs for implementation effectiveness were defined a priori via consensus among the investigators, and defined similarly to the 2017 pilot study as: 80%–100% is excellent; 60%–79.9% is good; 40%–59.9% is fair and &lt;40% is poor.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
                  <p>Qualitative data, designed to help explain any quantitative trends, were converged with the quantitative data.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Two experienced research assistants, who conducted the interviews, coded all interview notes. Interview notes were reviewed to identify emerging themes using a consensus discussion between the lead author and the two research assistants. Themes were summarised (with supporting quotes) and arranged according to the four RE-AIM domains assessed in this study. The researchers adopted a postpositivist stance in the qualitative analysis (ie, the quantitative data were believed to be real, but it was acknowledged that environmental, social and individual differences influenced the quantitative reality).</p>

                  <title>Clinical outcomes (adjusted analyses)</title>
                  <p>The primary analysis was an adjusted D-I-D analysis to examine the difference between the control and intervention groups in changes in delta SIxAge over time.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> A D-I-D analysis has the advantage of accounting for the effect of changes due to factors other than the intervention (eg, temporal trends that affect both the control and intervention site). This analysis was performed using a multivariable mixed effects model with a random effect for provider to account for clustering of outcomes for patients cared for by the same provider. Due to lack of variability between providers, as suggested by an estimated random intercept variance closer to zero, a regression model assuming independence within providers was used. To estimate the D-I-D, an interaction between study period and group (intervention/control) was of primary interest. Study period for trauma cases was classified as pre-implementation, 0–4 months post implementation, 5–8 months post implementation or 9–13 months post implementation. We divided the study period into intervals to study the change in intervention effect over time. All models also adjusted for the following predictors: qualification of provider (BLS, ILS, ALS), patient sex, injury mechanism (blunt or penetrating), initial SIxAge and prearrival minutes (time from injury to ambulance arrival). Subgroup analysis was conducted by provider qualification. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute).</p>

                <p>One hundred and ninety-eight of two hunderd and forty (82.5%) eligible EMS providers provided informed consent and participated. Of the 198, 93 (47%) were at the intervention site and 105 (53%) were at the control site (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). There was no provider crossover. Each provider delivered care to a median of 3 (IQR: 1–4) traumatic shock patients during the study, and 150 (76%) of providers cared for fewer than 5 traumatic shock patients during the study. EMS providers in both cohorts had similar age, sex and years of experience in the pre-implementation (baseline) period. The intervention group had a significantly lower proportion of BLS providers compared with the control group.</p>

                  <title>Reach</title>
                  <p>Reach was the poorest scoring (65%) domain (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The participation rate for eligible learners was 70%, with 30% non-participatory primarily due to workplace leave which limited their participation in training sessions but was unavoidable. Fully participating providers who were interviewed explained that the on-shift timing of the HEET trainings was highly favourable (compared with traditional EMS trainings which were inconveniently scheduled on their days off and resulted in poor participation). One learner explained that HEET is ‘… accommodating to all staff, as some were not always able to attend the CME’s on specific dates’. Additionally, providers mentioned that the short duration of sessions allowed the trainings to be feasibly incorporated into their work day without disrupting ambulance operations. Finally, facilitators mentioned that support from the station managers and dispatch centre was critical for protecting training time.</p>
                  <p>Providers delivered all elements of bundle of care to only 59% of eligible patients, which contributed to the poor overall reach. When asked, providers explained that one of their major challenges was transport to the trauma centre due to ‘pushback from staff’ especially for patients who met shock criteria but appeared well. Additionally, EMS providers had variable access to tourniquets for external haemorrhage control. Finally, providers did endorse performing many procedures but often failed to record them in the clinical forms, which consequently impeded the ability to measure delivery of bundled care. Conversely, providers who delivered the bundle explained that its simplicity enabled recall and delivery, as opposed to complicated algorithms and protocols. One paramedic noted, ‘I could see massive difference in BLS/ILS patient management when they call for backup’.</p>

                  <title>Effectiveness</title>
                  <p>Effectiveness scored ‘excellent’ (87%) predominantly due to high improvements in pre-implementation versus post implementation assessments of knowledge, skills and attitudes, and also due to learners’ high ratings of the quality of training sessions (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Ninety-three intervention site providers completed pretraining and post-training assessments and were included in the analysis. Learners and facilitators explained that HEET used EMS-relevant cases in a discussion-based format led by non-intimidating peers which facilitated knowledge transfer. A BLS learner stated that, ‘I can ask the stupid questions and I know I won’t be looked down to’. Additionally, the skills practice using providers’ usual onboard equipment helped to facilitate good skills acquisition and retention. An ILS learner stated, ‘Enjoyed that it was in the back of the ambulance where we also treat patients’. Learners’ mentioned that their confidence was improved due to group discussion format, which helped identify deficiencies and allay any concerns, including when to call for ALS backup during challenging cases. A BLS learner noted, ‘I felt empowered and like a paramedic …’ and that it was, ‘Nice to have own ALS do training’.</p>

                  <title>Adoption</title>
                  <p>Adoption scored ‘excellent’ predominantly because all tiers of EMS stakeholders (facilitators, HEET team, station managers, learners) appraised the HEET programme and EMS-TruShoC content as excellent operational fit for the organisation and helped to overcome barriers to traditional training, including low attendance rates and low efficacy training formats (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Facilitators explained their personal satisfaction with the HEET programme included: ‘interaction with peers’, ‘learning how to present’, ‘refresher of information’, ‘safe environment to learn’, ‘feels nice to teach’ and ‘I gained confidence as a teacher’. Of note, three out of nine facilitators were unsure about resuming their role in future trainings specifically because they were unsure if they would be provided additional paid time to prepare for training sessions. Shift and station managers felt positively about the programme because they noted an improvement in team-wide communication and rapport, in addition to knowledge and skills acquisition. EMS leaders felt that although cost-effectiveness was not formally assessed, their observation was that HEET was incredibly cost-effective compared with their usual educational programmes, and felt that it had a future role within the EMS organisation, insofar as it was appropriately integrated.</p>

                  <title>Implementation fidelity</title>
                  <p>Implementation fidelity had a lower score of ‘good’ mainly because of logistic challenges associated with keeping the number of learners in small groups at three or less, and also due to delayed training start times (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The issue of &gt;3 learners in a training session arose because when providers missed trainings (most often due to leave), they would jump into another crew’s training session to ‘catch up so we don’t get left behind’, even though make up training sessions were offered. The latter issue of delayed start times was attributable to providers having a sluggish start to their work day which was termed, ‘heel-dragging’, and had no specific cause attributed. Overall high participation rates (ie, providers completing ≥80% of sessions) was facilitated by the organisation and conduct of training sessions during official shift time, with the implicit understanding that their participation was a part of their duties, which was driven by the HEET team. Finally, the facilitators and learners explained that facilitators were well trained, prepared and enthusiastic about the sessions, which translated to high-quality delivery and fidelity of the HEET programme.</p>

                    <p>A total of 755 of 770 (98%) trauma patients were analysed (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Fifteen (2%) patients were missing data needed to calculate a SI, hence, excluded from the analysis. In the 4 months post implementation compared with pre-implementation period, the intervention arm patients had more improved SIxAge compared with control arm, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (0.8 change in control arm, −0.6 change in intervention arm; −1.4 D-I-D, p=0.35) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Further, there was no significant difference in change over time between the groups for any of the other time intervals (5–8 months: D-I-D −0.5, p=0.79; 9–13 months: D-I-D 0, p=0.99). Finally, there were no differences in changes in SIxAge by ranks of EMS providers (BLS, ILS or ALS) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B–D</xref>).</p>

              <p>We successfully implemented EMS-TruShoC (simplified bundled care) in a pragmatic fashion using the HEET training approach. The overall implementation effectiveness was excellent (81%). The bundled care intervention did not significantly improve patient’s change in SIxAge when compared with usual (non-bundled) care.</p>
              <p>Our novel training programme, HEET, achieved excellent implementation effectiveness overall. HEET was successful for effective on-the-job trauma re-training of providers in this resource-limited EMS system. We found similar findings in our prior single-site feasibility study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There were several major factors contributing to the high implementation effectiveness, which were evidenced by the quantitative data and supported by the qualitative findings. First, short-burst (15–20 min) trainings scheduled and protected at the beginning of shift time proved to be a strong operational fit for this EMS system. Second, the programme was purposefully designed to be engaging for professional adult learners by using contextually relevant cases which were presented in a non-intimidating, structured discussion forum. Third, we used and simplified bundle of care, and skills practice, to help ‘drill’ the core components of the bundle of care to help promote recall and translation from the ‘class’ to practice. Finally, we intentionally used motivated peer paramedics as facilitators, instead of the traditional EMS educators—this approach helped to reduce learner anxiety and promoted more open communication and eagerness to learn. Consequently, we measured meaningfully improved educational outcomes attributable to the EMS-TruShoC training intervention.</p>
              <p>While fidelity of the implementation overall was excellent, there were modest challenges in delivering the intervention to small groups of participants at the beginning of their shifts. The HEET team felt that this was due to a combination of unavoidable logistic challenges which ultimately did not negatively impact delivery of the intervention. A critical factor underpinning the overall implementation success was advanced engagement and planning between the research team and the HEET team. The HEET team was comprised a motivated multi-disciplinary group of EMS educators and quality assurance personnel who worked alongside the researchers to design, implement and evaluate the programme with a deliberate goal of pragmatic implementation, strong organisational tailoring and sustainability.</p>
              <p>Our clinical intervention of bundled care (EMS-TruShoC) did not measurably improve patients’ shock physiology, measured by SIxAge, for several possible reasons. First, it is likely that three items in our core shock bundle (large intravenous catheter, scene time &lt;10 min and trauma centre transport destination) may cause no direct change to heart rate or systolic blood pressure. Second, it is possible that although the SIxAge performs better than traditional vital signs, it may have inadequate sensitivity and specificity to detect prehospital changes in physiology. A sentinel study by Zarzaur <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> demonstrated that SIxAge was a superior predictor of 48-hour mortality compared with systolic blood pressure, heart rate or SI.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In 2012, Bruijns and colleagues validated these findings in the UK’s national trauma registry in which SIxAge achieved the highest area under the receiver operator curve of 0.79 for predicting 48-hour mortality compared with SI and other age-based markers.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, the SIxAge thresholds varied across these studies from ≥35.6 to ≥55. We used a threshold of ≥36, which was based on Zarzaur’s original study and is more appropriate for a younger trauma population.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, further studies to establish a prehospital cut-off point would be useful, especially if conducted within a South African trauma population. Additionally, other hospital-based outcome measures, such as blood lactate, the need for blood transfusions or 24-hour mortality, could potentially detect a change where SIxAge did not—these are possible avenues for future research. However, the advantage of using an SI-based physiological measure is it facilitates prehospital research by avoiding costly and logistically complicated in-hospital clinical data collection.</p>
              <p>Our overall research design and approach (ie, a hybrid type II quasi-experimental trial) and the research context (ie, a South African prehospital system) are also noteworthy. Hybrid trials assess the implementation outcomes in tandem with the clinical effectiveness outcomes.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The rationale for conducting both in parallel is to test the intervention and implementation in a real-world context which improve the ability of findings to more rapidly translate into clinical practice settings.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 26</xref> Prior data suggest that it takes, on average, 17 years for 14% of biomedical research to translate from research into clinical practice which stifles advancements in clinical care worldwide.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Implementation science methodologies—such as the pragmatic hybrid trial design used in this study—are innovative and feasible approaches to narrowing this ‘know-do’ gap. The need for real-world data is arguably even more critical in lower-income settings which face the challenging paradox of having extremely high burdens of injury yet have a shortage of biomedical research. Prehospital care is a neglected area of research, according to the WHO and leading experts, necessitating more research to help improve care delivery and patient outcomes. In time-sensitive emergencies, such as traumatic shock, bringing basic yet essential treatment to the patient, at the scene of the event, is a cost-effective public health intervention to improve postinjury morbidity and mortality<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref>—yet, where prehospital systems exist, there is a paucity of research, due to poor awareness or the technical challenges. This body of work directly addresses these practice and scientific evidence gaps.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>There are several limitations to this work aside from those of the SIxAge described earlier. Despite our best efforts to select similar sites, the intervention site had a significantly lower proportion of BLS providers compared with the control site which may have influenced our implementation outcomes. Educational assessments were designed to be quick and easy for the HEET team assessors to administer, hence may have had limited sensitivity to detect changes in educational outcomes among the EMS participants, so may have under-estimated the true effect size. Additionally, the HEET team assessors could not be practically blinded to whether an EMS participant received the intervention or not, which may have introduced bias in their assessments.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this hybrid type II quasi-experimental trial of EMS-TruShoC (bundled care) using the novel HEET training approach, we found overall excellent implementation effectiveness but no overall statistically significant clinical effectiveness. HEET is an effective prehospital implementation strategy in a resource-constrained EMS setting, primarily explained by strong fit to the organisation’s operational needs and the adult-learner friendly approach to on-the-job training. Further clinical effectiveness studies are warranted to assess whether EMS-TruShoC confers a prehospital physiologic benefit for critically injured patients.</p>
