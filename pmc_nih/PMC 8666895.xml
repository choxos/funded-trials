                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Parents who receive the diagnosis of a life-threatening, complex heart defect in their fetus or neonate face a difficult choice between pursuing termination (for fetal diagnoses), palliative care or complex surgical interventions. Shared decision making (SDM) is recommended in clinical contexts where there is clinical equipoise. SDM can be facilitated by decision aids. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards collaboration recommends the inclusion of values clarification methods (VCMs), yet little evidence exists concerning the incremental impact of VCMs on patient or surrogate decision making. This protocol describes a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a decision aid (with and without a VCM) on parental mental health and decision making within a clinical encounter.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Parents who have a fetus or neonate diagnosed with one of six complex congenital heart defects at a single tertiary centre will be recruited. Data collection for the prospective observational control group was conducted September 2018 to December 2020 (N=35) and data collection for two intervention groups is ongoing (began October 2020). At least 100 participants will be randomised 1:1 to two intervention groups (decision aid only vs decision aid with VCM). For the intervention groups, data will be collected at four time points: (1) at diagnosis, (2) postreceipt of decision aid, (3) postdecision and (4) 3 months postdecision. Data collection for the control group was the same, except they did not receive a survey at time 2. Linear mixed effects models will assess differences between study arms in distress (primary outcome), grief and decision quality (secondary outcomes) at 3-month post-treatment decision.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Congenital heart disease occurs for about 40, 000 live births per year; of these, about 2%–3% are life-threatening congenital heart defects (CHDs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Even with early intervention those diagnosed with life-threatening CHDs have frequent readmissions, require additional interventions and typically face a shortened life span.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A diagnosis of a severe, life-threatening CHD in a fetus or neonate is an unexpected and emotionally distressful event for parents who must then decide between termination (when diagnosed prenatally), palliative care or surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> Parents experience significant grief,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> distress, depression and anxiety<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> surrounding this difficult decision, which can compromise their mental health.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref></p>
                <p>Shared decision making (SDM) is an approach for supporting patient engagement with clinicians that is particularly useful for contexts, such as life-threatening CHD, which involve clinical equipoise and value-laden, complex decisions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref> Decision aids are tools that improve the SDM process and include information on treatment options that are evidence based, balanced and help people clarify their values.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 22</xref> Decision aids increase patients’ knowledge, and engagement related to the diagnosis and treatment decision making. In addition, studies have found greater concordance between patients’ preferences and treatment received, improved patient–provider communication, and reduced uncertainty and decisional conflict in those receiving decision aids.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
                <p>The International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration developed criteria for a well-designed decision aid.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Values clarification methods (ie, processes that aid patients in clarifying their values and goals in order to improve alignment between their preferences and their treatments) were included as a critical component. Although some studies have found positive effects of values clarification methods on decision outcomes, there are few rigorous studies in real-world clinical contexts that evaluate whether values clarification methods improve key outcomes, prompting calls for additional research.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref></p>

                <title>Objectives and hypothesis</title>
                <p>The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a decision aid with and without a values clarification method on longitudinal parent mental and physical health, decision making and clinical encounter outcomes (eg, quality of clinician consultation and risk communication). Since no prior data on decision aid use in CHD exist, we will also compare parents who receive the decision aid to parents who do not (prospective observational control group enrolled during decision aid development) on the aforementioned outcomes.</p>
                <p>We hypothesise that participants who receive the decision aid with the values clarification method will report less distress (primary outcome), reduced grief and better decision quality (secondary outcomes) relative to participants who receive the decision aid only across 3 months post-treatment decision. We also hypothesise that participants who receive the decision aid with or without the values clarification method will report reduced distress, grief and better decision quality relative to participants who are in the prospective observational control group.</p>
                <p>We will also test the impact of the decision aid with a values clarification method on several exploratory measures (eg, self-efficacy, satisfaction and decision regret).</p>

                <p>This is a randomised clinical trial examining the effectiveness of a decision aid and values clarification method. There are two intervention groups and one prospective observational control group. Data collection for the prospective observational control group was conducted September 2018–December 2020 (N=35) and data collection for the intervention groups (the primary analytic sample) began October 2020 and is ongoing.

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>This is a single-site study at a children’s hospital in the Intermountain West. Physicians at this hospital perform &gt;650 fetal echocardiograms with about 125 new complex CHD diagnoses annually.</p>

              <sec id="s2-3">
                <title>Participants and eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>To be eligible for the study, parents must be at least 18 years old who have a fetus or neonate diagnosed with a complex, life-threatening CHD (whether diagnosed prenatally or postnatally). While the decision aid was being developed, the control group was recruited with these guidelines. The decision aid was developed to provide information on the following six CHD diagnoses: truncus arteriosus with greater than moderate truncal valve regurgitation, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum with a severely hypoplastic right ventricle that will require single ventricle palliation, complex single ventricle, complex single ventricle with heterotaxy, hypoplastic left heart syndrome and Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve with greater than moderate regurgitation. These diagnoses were chosen as they were deemed preference sensitive in that surgical intervention, palliative care and termination were all medically reasonable treatment options by expert consensus. Thus, in order to be eligible for one of the two intervention groups, the fetus/neonate must be diagnosed with one of the six aforementioned diagnoses.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s2-4">
                <title>Recruitment and consent</title>
                <p>When a fetus/neonate is diagnosed with a qualifying CHD, a paediatric cardiologist will evaluate the diagnosis to confirm eligibility for the study. Patients consult with a clinician immediately after the diagnosis. Then, they are approached by research staff for study participation. When an eligible fetus/neonate is identified, the parent(s) will be approached by the study team and invited to participate in the study. One or both parents may participate. Interested participants receive a link to complete the informed consent through a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). If both parents consent to participation, they will receive separate links to complete their own informed consent and surveys. For the intervention groups, the decision aid is initiated by the parent, independent of the provider or coordinator. Both the control and intervention groups consult with clinicians as they decide which treatment to pursue.</p>

              <sec id="s2-5">
                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Participants will be randomised using REDCap (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant remote data capture system) into one of two intervention groups, described below, after completing the baseline survey. Participants will not be explicitly told which group they were randomised to. Both intervention groups will receive the same decision aid, but one arm will receive a values clarification method integrated within the decision aid, while the other group will get the decision aid without the values clarification method. The decision aid is an app on an Amazon Fire tablet, which is either given to the parent(s) in clinic if they complete the baseline survey and consent in person, or is mailed to their home if they complete the consent outside of clinic. The tablet remains in their possession for the duration of the study so that they can consult the decision aid as often as they would like.</p>

                <title>Development of decision aid and values clarification method</title>
                <p>We used data from focus groups of parents who had a fetus/neonate diagnosed with a complex CHD, as well as semistructured interviews with family and provider stakeholders to identify important content to include in the digital decision aid.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> The tool was developed through an iterative process of content drafting by the development team followed by multiple rounds of content review and revision with the research team, parent partners, and healthcare providers in relevant fields (eg, paediatric cardiologists, surgeons, social workers, palliative care experts). The team gathered stories about parents’ experiences during several individual and group interviews.</p>
                <p>The research team also developed a values clarification method. We began by examining qualitative data from the focus groups and interviews related to factors influencing parents’ choices and identifying key elements that had influenced parents’ decision. The team then engaged in multiple workshop sessions, discussing how best to describe components of each value, with parent partners providing input on draft versions of these descriptions. The values clarification method interface was developed through an iterative process of creating alpha versions, testing and revision.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Three parents (two females and one male) whose children were diagnosed with complex CHD were invited to serve as parent collaborators. Discussions with these parents informed the design and development of the decision aid, outcome measures that were chosen and methods of recruitment for the study.</p>

                  <title>Values clarification method</title>
                  <p>The values clarification method is designed to help participants clarify the choice that feels better for them and their family. For those randomised to receive the values clarification method, the decision aid includes an extra module, What Matters Most to You. The goal of this exercise is to help participants think through some short-term and long-term consequences of their decision. When faced with a life-threatening diagnosis, there are many consequences to consider, and participants may not know how they feel about each of them or how to weigh them by importance or value. To begin, participants choose two of the possible treatment decision options (surgery, comfort care and ending the pregnancy) and compare them in 10 different topic areas. Some examples of the topics are: time in the hospital, the risk that the child will have impairments, financial issues and life in adulthood. The purpose of choosing two potential decisions at a time is to put them on a clear spectrum in a preference scale, as weighting all three at once would be too complicated in terms of determining weights. For each topic, there is a sliding scale between the two choices where they drag the slider to show how much they prefer one choice over another. At the end, they are shown a summary of which choice they preferred for each category. Participants are not issued a definitive result; the values clarification method allows them to look at a summary of their choices and draw their own conclusion about what they chose. They may repeat the exercise, selecting other options to compare.</p>

                <p>At least 100 families will be randomised 1:1 to the two intervention groups, allowing up to two parents to participate per fetus/neonate. Our sample size calculations were based on the primary comparison between DA with and without the VCM. Based on our previous work,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> we assume ≥80% retention, a 3-month pre–post R≥0.5, an average of ≥1.75 participating parents per participating family, an intraclass correlation between parents in the same family ≤0.50, and ≥50 families randomised to each of the intervention groups (decision aid only and decision aid with values clarification method). Using these assumptions, the mixed effects model will provide 80% power with two-sided α=0.05 to detect a mean difference in the primary outcome, distress, equal to 0.50 of 1 SD. This represents a medium effect size in Cohen’s terminology.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Assuming a pooled SD in the global distress of 0.56 units,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> the 0.50 SDs represents a minimum detectable effect of 0.28 units.</p>

                <p>Potentially eligible parents are identified by the provider. Following provider consultation, a study team member, trained in interacting with families going through highly emotional medical events, assesses if this is an appropriate time to approach them about the study. If the parents are too distressed, they are not approached at the time of the visit but asked if they would be willing to speak to research staff later. If the parents are deemed approachable by the trained staff, the study is presented using an informational pamphlet, and the potential participant(s) are encouraged to follow the link or QR code on the pamphlet if they would like to participate in the study. The parents who were given the link are recorded in a recruitment tracker. All parents who follow the link on their own are consented to participate in the study and recorded in REDCap. This usually happens with parents whose fetuses are prenatally diagnosed, and they follow the link from their home electronic devices. If the neonate was postnatally diagnosed, the parents are approached in the same manner in the hospital and are given the opportunity to consent and participate in the study using a tablet in person. Parents who are found to be ineligible or who decline participation will be recorded along with the reason.</p>

                <p>After data collection, we will use standardised mean differences to assess balance between intervention groups in baseline levels of study endpoints and other potential prognostic baseline indicators, including participants’ age, race and comorbidities. Outcome variables exhibiting substantial skewness may be transformed to better approximate normality. All participants will be analysed in their assigned intervention group according to intention-to-treat, irrespective of adherence to viewing the decision aid or completing the values clarification method. Although multiple outcomes will be considered, we have designated a single primary outcome (the Brief Symptom Inventory Global Severity Index of global distress, described above) and a single primary comparison time for this outcome at 3 months.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We do not plan formal multiple comparison adjustments for secondary and exploratory outcomes. Results for secondary and exploratory outcomes will support or qualify the analyses of the primary outcome, and will be interpreted based on the overall pattern of results with awareness that some nominally significant relationships may be false positive findings in the context of multiple analyses. If there is sufficient power to detect differences, exploratory sub-group analyses may be conducted to detect differences by factors such as pre vs post-natal diagnoses, CHD diagnosis, provider specialty, and parent dyads. We also do not plan formal multiple comparison adjustment for the randomised comparison between intervention groups (decision aid only vs decision aid with values clarification method) and the non-randomised comparison (decision aid vs control), as these comparisons address distinct hypotheses and are thus appropriate for evaluation on a comparison wise basis.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>

                  <p>The primary outcome, distress, measured at postdecision aid, postdecision and 3 months will be compared between groups by applying restricted maximum likelihood estimation to a linear mixed effects model<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> with fixed provider effects and random family effects to account for clustering of outcomes due to these factors and an unstructured residual covariance model to account for serial correlation across the three longitudinal assessments. Inclusion of fixed effects for provider is appropriate since families are randomised to the two intervention groups for each provider and may improve statistical power by controlling for provider variation. The model will also include fixed effects for randomised assignment as well as the baseline distress.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Additional prespecified covariate adjustment is not planned, as we are not aware of further baseline factors that are likely to have a strong association with the 3-month distress once the baseline distress is accounted for.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, should a prognostic baseline factor exhibit imbalance between the randomised groups, a post hoc sensitivity analysis will be performed with covariate adjustment for that factor to assess the robustness of the results to the imbalance. The 3-month comparison will represent the primary contrast for assessing the effect of the decision support intervention. It is possible that the full mixed effects model will fail to converge due to the inclusion of separate random effects for provider and family as well as an unstructured covariate matrix for repeated assessments in the same patient. In the event the full model fails to converge, we will repeat analyses after dropping the provider random effect. If this also fails to provide convergence, the unstructured covariance model for serial correlation will be simplified.</p>
                  <p>Similar mixed effects analyses will be used for numeric secondary and exploratory outcome variables, including the perinatal grief (secondary outcome) and most of the exploratory outcomes. For binary outcomes, including the decision quality secondary outcome, we will apply generalised estimating equations (GEE) for log-binomial regression (if convergence is achieved) or modified Poisson regression<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> (if not) to compare the proportions of participants with the outcome between the intervention groups. The postdecision comparison will be the main comparison for evaluating the effects of the interventions on secondary and exploratory outcomes hypothesised to respond quickly to the decision aid (eg, parent–provider communication, self-efficacy) while the 3-month comparison will represent the main treatment contrast for outcomes hypothesised to respond over a longer time (eg, grief, decision regret).</p>

                  <p>The primary outcome, distress, will be compared between the groups receiving the decision aid and the control group using an extension of the linear mixed effects model described above. The model will again include fixed effects for provider and random effects for family and an unstructured covariance matrix to account serial correlation, but will be expanded to include all three treatment groups and will include not only the baseline distress measure but also timing of diagnosis, race, and literacy level as covariates to reduce bias in these non-randomised comparisons. The comparison of decision aid without values clarification method versus control will represent the primary treatment comparison to evaluate the effect of the decision aid. The comparison of decision aid with values clarification method versus control will provide a secondary assessment of the combined effect of decision support and values clarification method together. Similar extensions using linear mixed models for numeric outcomes and GEE for binary or categorical outcomes will be applied for additional non-randomised comparisons between the decision support and control groups.</p>

If substantial imbalances are detected, or if &gt;10% of participants have missing data for a primary or secondary outcome, multiple imputation will be used to impute missing outcome measurements. The multiple imputation will be performed with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm using an imputation model incorporating each analysis variable as well as auxiliary variables that are related to the probability of missingness.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Rubin’s formulae will be used to account for the uncertainty introduced by the missing data.

              <p>Parents of a fetus or neonate diagnosed with a life-threatening congenital heart defect are confronted with a significant and challenging decision between termination (when diagnosed prenatally), palliative care or surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> This preference-sensitive decision should be supported through SDM whereby the family and providers can mutually engage in treatment decision making which is driven by what matters most to families and understanding of the diagnosis and treatment options.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Decision aids are one approach to facilitate SDM.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> This study aims to evaluate the effect of a novel, family-centred decision aid on parent mental and physical health, decision making and clinical encounter outcomes. Few studies have examined how effective values clarification methods, which the IPDAS standards collaborative added as criteria for decision aids, are when combined with a decision aid in clinical contexts.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, this study also aims to contribute to the literature by examining the effect of the decision aid with and without a values clarification method.</p>
              <p>There are some potential study limitations to note that are common when studying paediatric conditions. There may be issues with meeting sample size requirements for sufficient statistical power. This issue could arise due to the rarity of severe CHD diagnoses and the potential for high attrition as parents are under high emotional burdens and distress surrounding the diagnosis, decision, and coping or managing the treatment they choose. Our study design attempts to proactively address these issues. For instance, we will use extensive follow-up procedures via telephone or in person to minimise attrition. If questionnaire burden results in higher than expected attrition, we will limit questions to the primary and secondary outcomes.</p>
              <p>Our study will significantly contribute to advancing decision support and counselling for parents making life-altering decisions for their fetus or neonate with a life-threatening heart defect. This important and innovative decision aid and values clarification method will also build on the dearth of decision aids in paediatric, surrogate decision-making contexts.</p>
