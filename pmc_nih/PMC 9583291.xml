                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Even after a physician recommendation, many people remain unscreened for
colorectal cancer (CRC). The proliferation of electronic health records
(EHRs) and tethered online portals may afford new opportunities to embed
patient-facing interventions within clinic workflows and engage patients
following a physician recommendation for care. We evaluated the
effectiveness of a patient-facing intervention designed to complement
physician office-based recommendations for CRC screening.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Using a 2-arm pragmatic, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the
interventionâs effect on CRC screening use as documented in the EHR (primary
outcome) and the extent to which the intervention reached the target
population. Trial participants were insured, aged 50 to 75 y, with a
physician recommendation for CRC screening. Typical EHR functionalities,
including patient registries, health maintenance flags, best practice
alerts, and secure messaging, were used to support research-related
activities and deliver the intervention to enrolled patients.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 1,825 adults consented to trial participation, of whom 78%
completed a baseline survey and were exposed to the intervention. Most trial
participants (&gt;80%) indicated an intent to be screened on the baseline
survey, and 65% were screened at follow-up, with no significant differences
by study arm. One-third of eligible patients were sent a secure message.
Among those, more than three-quarters accessed study material.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>By leveraging common EHR functionalities, we integrated a patient-facing
intervention within clinic workflows. Despite practice integration, the
intervention did not improve screening use, likely in part due to
portal-based interventions not reaching those for whom the intervention may
be most effective.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite multiple effective screening tests, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remains
underutilized relative to other cancer-screening tests.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Our research has shown that a
driving factor behind this underutilization among insured individuals is the gap
that exists between physician recommendation and patient receipt of care. While the
overwhelming majority (93%) of patients who are due for CRC screening receive a
physician recommendation during routine primary care office visits, only 54% of
patients are screened in the following year.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The gap in adherence to CRC
screening following a physician recommendation is likely fueled by multiple factors,
including suboptimal patient-provider communication during screening recommendations

outside a research environment. The effectiveness and impact of previously tested
CRC screening interventions may be limited, in part, by such practice integration
challenges. The proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) and accompanying
patient portals may afford new opportunities to economically engage and support
patients at the time of a CRC screening or other physician recommendation for care
in ways that connect with existing clinic processes yet extend beyond the boundaries
of traditional office visits.</p>
              <p>Using the patient portal functionality now commonly available within EHRs, we
developed an EHR-embedded patient-facing intervention, e-Assist colon health, to
assist in obtaining care following a physician recommendation for CRC screening. To
ensure the interventionâs fit with practice, we partnered with clinicians and other
health system staff during the design and implementation of the
intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> We hypothesized that people who received the e-Assist
intervention would be more likely to complete CRC screening (primary outcome)
relative to those who received links to health education documents on CRC and CRC
screening (enhanced usual care). In this article, we report findings from the
randomized trial used to evaluate the interventionâs effectiveness and

                <title>Study Design and Trial Eligibility</title>
                <p>For the primary outcome, we evaluated the interventionâs effect on CRC screening
using a 2-arm practice-embedded pragmatic trial. The trial was conducted within
a large integrated health system servicing Detroit, Michigan, and the
surrounding tricounty area. Trial participants included insured patients aged 50
to 75 y who were eligible for CRC screening (as recommended by the US Preventive
Services Task Force at the time of study recruitment<sup><xref rid="bibr42-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>). As previously
reported,<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> the trial targeted adults of average risk for CRC and
thus excluded those with a personal or family history of CRC, colon polyps,
inflammatory bowel disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary
nonpolyposis as well as those for whom an accelerated screening schedule had
been documented in their medical record. Because the intervention was designed
to address common gaps in patient-provider conversations at the time of CRC
screening recommendation, trial eligibility was also limited to those with a
primary care office visit that included a physician recommendation for CRC
screening (as indicated by an open access colonoscopy referral or stool test
order). As described below, because the intervention was embedded within the
EHR, trial enrollment was also limited to patients with an activated portal
account. All aspects of the trial were approved by the health systemâs
Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <title>Identifying Trial Eligible Patients</title>
                <p>Two common EHR tools, the patient registry function and health maintenance flags,
were used to identify and allocate study-eligible patients to the appropriate
study arm. For study purposes, the EHR registry function was used to identify
patients who, should they have a primary care visit with a recommendation for
CRC screening, would meet the study inclusion criteria. As such, when a primary
care physician electronically signed the notes, or âclosedâ an office visit
encounter within the EHR, if that visit was with a patient previously identified
as study eligible (i.e., the patient was included within the EHR registry) and
included a stool test order or a colonoscopy referral (i.e., physician
recommendation for CRC screening), the patient became study eligible.</p>
                <p>An additional EHR tool, a health maintenance flag, was used to assist with study
randomization. Because it was not technically feasible to randomize patients
within the EHR in real time as they became study eligible, as we have described
elsewhere,<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> we randomized all patients included in the EHR
registry, storing their allocation as a health maintenance flag that was not
visible to clinicians or others accessing the EHR for patient care. This hidden
flag was used to electronically allocate the appropriate intervention or
enhanced usual care material to patients once they became study eligible via a
primary care physician electronically signing an office visit encounter that
included a CRC screening recommendation.</p>

                <title>Delivering Study Material</title>
                <p>When a patient became study eligible, a series of programming rules automated the
sending of study recruitment material and either the intervention or enhanced
usual care material. This was achieved using the best practice advisory/alert
(BPA) system within the EHR. While BPAs are generally used to send automated
notifications or reminders to alert physicians and other clinical staff to
important patient needs, they can be made silent or not appear as a pop-up
message or task when clinical staff are using the EHR. Instead, they can operate
in the background, routing notifications to specific user-owned in-boxes that
can be checked at the userâs discretion.</p>
                <p>For study purposes, when a physician electronically signed (i.e., closed) an
office-visit note that contained a CRC screening order with a study-eligible
patient, BPA programming logic led to a secure inbox message being sent to that
patientâs online portal account. While the content of the secure message
inviting the patient to participate in the trial was identical regardless of
randomization allocation, the programming logic behind the BPA used information
on the patientâs randomization allocation (as stored in the studyâs health
maintenance flag) to send patients in the 2 trial arms a different message
attachment. The attachment was an online questionnaire that contained the
informed consent material, a 6-item pretrial survey, and either the e-Assist
intervention or links to the enhanced usual care material. The informed consent
and pretrial survey material embedded within the attached questionnaire were
identical regardless of study arm. The content of the remainder of the attached
questionnaire differed by study arm (i.e., either the e-Assist intervention
content or links to enhanced usual care material) and could be accessed only
upon study consent.</p>

completing testing. The intervention content, all of which we were able to embed
within the questionnaire function within the EHR, included text, pictures, and
links to short videos. All users were presented with information reiterating
that their doctor had recommended CRC screening and the benefits of CRC. User
responses to questions facilitated progression through intervention content and
the branching logic that determined what content was visible. The latter enabled
users to select and filter what information was viewed and thus enabled the user
to tailor content based on relevance and interest. For example, to ensure
message salience, embedded questions inquired about the userâs readiness to be
screened.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Those indicating they were ready to be screened were
provided with tips for completing their preferred screening test, while those
indicating they were not ready to be screened were offered suggestions for how
to overcome common barriers to screening. Similarly, users who indicated they
were undecided about how to screen were provided with information regarding the
pros and cons of different test options. Additional questions further determined
the userâs preferences for additional information and thus determined the level
of detail regarding those options that users saw.</p>
                <p>Any trial participant who did not indicate they had completed CRC screening at
the end of the questionnaire received a follow-up module. The content of the
follow-up module was tailored to information collected during the initial module

introductory material reiterating that CRC screening had been recommended for
them and outlining the benefits of screening, but instead of the text, pictures,

which we have previously published results,<sup><xref rid="bibr57-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> we used the benchmark
reporting function within the EHR to track two, more narrow, measures of reach
among trial eligible patients. Among patients in the EHR registry (and thus due
for CRC screening and with an activated portal account), we tracked the
proportion who became study eligible by virtue of having a primary care visit
with a CRC screening order and, among those, the proportions who opened the
study messages sent to their portal inbox, interacted with the questionnaire
attached to that message, and consented to study participation. These custom
reports could be generated at any time by research staff, enabling real-time
participant tracking. From these reports, we developed 2 measures to assess the
degree to which the intervention or enhanced usual care material reached the
studyâs target population.<sup><xref rid="bibr58-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> First, among EHR registry
patients (i.e., those of average risk and due for CRC screening with an
activated portal account), we derived the proportion sent a secure message
containing the intervention or enhanced usual care material, and second, among
those sent a secure message, we derived the proportion who opened the message
and thus saw that they were invited to the trial.</p>
                <p>In addition to constructing these measures, for the individuals who consented to
trial enrollment, we were able to compile additional information regarding
implementation timing by using the date/time stamp associated with their
interactions with study material. For example, we tracked the number of days
between the office visit that triggered the personâs study eligibility (i.e.,
the date of CRC recommendation) and when the secure message that contained the
study invitation was sent. Gaps in days between these 2 dates are due to routine
variability in workflow processes, because not all physicians electronically
sign the notes from each of their office visit encounters on the day of the
visit. Second, we tracked the time in days between when a secure message was
sent (i.e., the date the physician electronically signed the note) and when it
was accessed by the patient in the online portal. Gaps in days between these 2
dates are due to routine variability in the frequency with which a person
chooses to view secure messages and/or access his or her portal account.</p>

                <p>Among those consenting to trial participation, 1419 (78%) completed the baseline
survey and were therefore exposed to the intervention/enhanced usual care
material. This included 720 (78.3%) of the patients in the intervention arm and
699 (77.2%) of the patients in the enhanced usual care arm. With the exception
that women who consented to trial participation were more likely to go on to
complete the baseline survey and therefore be exposed to the
intervention/enhanced usual care material, we did not find statistically
significant differences among those who consented to trial participation by
exposure status (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0272989X221104094" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Appendix Table A-1</ext-link>.).</p>

not differ significantly across study arms, except for marital status (68.6%
married in the e-Assist arm v. 60.9% married in the enhanced usual care arm) and
receipt of a colonoscopy referral, which remained significantly higher in those
allocated to the intervention compared with enhanced usual care (84.2% v. 77.3%,
respectively; data not shown). Pretrial survey responses among the exposed
sample did not differ by study arm (<xref rid="table2-0272989X221104094" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Sixty-five percent (65.1%) of trial enrollees who consented were screened for CRC
in the 12 mo following the office visit that triggered their trial eligibility
(i.e., a primary care office visit with a CRC screening recommendation), 65.7%
in the intervention and 64.5% in the enhanced usual care arm. Most of these
screenings occurred within the first 6 mo after that office visit: 47.1% of
trial enrollees were screened within 3 mo of their office visit and 60.1% within
6 mo of their office visit. This is in comparison with an overall CRC screening
rate of 62% among the health systemâs general population. Among those exposed to
either the intervention or enhanced usual care material, screening rates were
67.8% in the intervention-exposed group and 66.7% in the enhanced usual care
exposed group. Most screenings within the exposed groups similarly occurred
within 6 mo of their office visit, 49.8% within 3 mo of their visit, and 62.2%
within 6 mo. None of these differences were statistically significant (i.e.,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; .10), nor were 12-mo screening rates (the studyâs
primary outcome) statistically different once we adjusted for pretreatment
covariates that differed significantly across the 2 study arms (<xref rid="table3-0272989X221104094" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>We randomized a total of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 19,745 people who, per data
contained in the EHR, were insured, aged 50 to 75 y with an activated online
portal account, and of average risk and due for CRC screening. Between June 14,
2017, and September 15, 2019, almost one-third (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6,203 or
31.4%) became study eligible because they had a primary care visit with a
recommendation for CRC screening. Among those sent a message, more than
three-quarters (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4761 or 76.8%) accessed the trial
invitation. Overall, this resulted in the intervention reaching approximately
one-quarter (24.1%) of the study-eligible patients (<xref rid="fig2-0272989X221104094" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Among study-eligible people who accessed the trial invitation, 38.3% enrolled in
the trial (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1825), enabling us to meet study enrollment
goals. Those who enrolled in the trial accessed the secure message inviting them
to participate in the trial at an average of 6.1 (<italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 19.3) d
after the primary care visit in which they received a recommendation for CRC
screening (<xref rid="fig3-0272989X221104094" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).
This time delay is a result of both physician and patient actions. First, the
secure message inviting the patient to the trial was sent, on average, 1.3
(<italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 14.1) d following the patientâs office visit (i.e.,
the average time between an office visit and the physician electronically
signing the office visit note). While this ranged from the same day to 586 d
after the visit, 74% of visit notes were signed within 4 d, and only 61 patients
(3.3%) were sent the secure message more than 7 d after their appointment.
Second, once a secure message was sent, it was accessed by the patient on
average 5.0 d later, although this too ranged widely (from 0 to 352 d). This
resulted in a handful of patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 69) consenting to trial
participation after they completed CRC screening. In addition, some trial
enrollees (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 44) consented to trial participation without the
study team capturing a message read date. This happened either because the
patient used the questionnaire page within their portal to access the
questionnaire that contained the trial consent, baseline survey, and
intervention/enhanced usual care material (as opposed to using the attachment
provided with the study invitation secure message) or because the message and/or
questionnaire were accessed via a linked proxy account. None of these nuanced
situations differed significantly by study arm. Nor did accounting for them
alter the effectiveness results or conclusions (data not shown).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>By leveraging the functionality of an EHR, we were able to automate both the
identification of patients and the delivery of an intervention designed to engage
and support patients to complete CRC screening after a physician recommended it.
Doing so ensured the interventionâs integration with existing primary care workflows
without requiring busy primary care providers and staff to alter current practices.
Despite this successful practice integration, patientsâ use of the intervention did
not improve CRC screening rates. This may have been at least in part because the use
of an EHR-tethered patient portal limited our ability to reach those patients for
whom the intervention may have been most effective. This latter group, for example,
may include those who are aware that screening is recommended, have an interest in
learning more, but have not yet made a commitment to acting, or those who may want
to act, but who may face challenges in following through on their doctorâs
recommendation for care. As such, our results highlight some of the current
challenges in improving CRC screening rates among primary care patients as well as
both the opportunities and challenges in using the functionalities of the EHR to do
so.</p>
              <p>Importantly, given providersâ interest in leveraging their investments in EHR
technology, we found that using the EHR enabled us to efficiently identify and
automate the sending of a patient-facing intervention following a physician
recommendation for care. While this ability is potentially important to integrating
patient-facing interventions into clinical care delivery, there are significant
limitations in such interventions reaching patients when relying on patient portals
as the sole mode of delivery. Using data from this studyâs sampling process, we have
previously shown how only 28% of adults aged 50 to 75 y who are due for CRC
screening have an activated portal account as well as how, among this population,
Black adults are substantively and significantly less likely to have an active
portal account.<sup><xref rid="bibr57-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Thus, although we ultimately reached only a quarter of
study-eligible patients, we reached a substantially smaller proportion of all
primary care patients due for CRC screening, and those we did not reach were
disproportionately Black.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, as indicated by responses to the pretrial survey, those reached by the
intervention reported generally high levels of health literacy, a strong preference
to make their own decisions regarding CRC screening, and a strong intent to be
screened for CRC at the time of study enrollment. This selectivity is consistent
with prior studies that found an association between primary care visit
frequency<sup><xref rid="bibr60-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> and CRC screening as well as an association between cancer
screening and portal use.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Multiple studies that have been published since this
intervention was conceived have shown how Black and racially or otherwise
minoritized adults are not only less likely to use the patient portal<sup><xref rid="bibr62-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref rid="bibr63-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr64-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr65-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr66-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> but also to use each aspect
of the portal less.<sup><xref rid="bibr67-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="bibr68-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> As such, relying on patient portals alone to reach patients due
for CRC screening (or any other service) may not only limit the effectiveness of the
intervention but also further contribute to existing disparities and exacerbate
existing structural racism.</p>
              <p>Despite the limitations in overall reach when using portals for patient-facing
decision support, our results illustrate how EHR-tethered portals can be used as a
low-cost means to engage certain patients. In this study, more than three-quarters
of patients who were sent a secure message via their online portal not only accessed
that message but did so in a timely manner (i.e., within 1 wk of their office
visit). This finding is consistent with those of others researchers who successfully
engaged portal users around the time of a scheduled visit to primary care.<sup><xref rid="bibr69-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> Thus, for the
subset of patients with an active portal account, secure messaging around the time
of an office visit may be a good way to route <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0272989X221104094" ext-link-type="uri">supplemental material</ext-link> to patients that addresses common deficits in
physician office-based recommendations for care. But given known racial disparities
in portal use, including within the context of this trial,<sup><xref rid="bibr57-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> such interventions must be
used in combination with other modalities such as telephone calls, text messages,
and/or print material. Regardless of modality, ongoing challenges integrating
decision aids and shared decision making more generally into practice highlight the
importance of continuing to explore how not only to embed patient-facing
interventions within clinic workflows but how to do so in ways that reach all of
those needing support. Doing so undoubtably will mean not relying on one
communication channel but instead devising ways to meet patients where they are most
comfortable and able to receive that support.</p>
              <p>Regardless of challenges in intervention reach, for those reached, the provision of a
theory-based intervention designed to complement physician office-based
recommendations for CRC screening did not result in more screening than simply
providing links to existing online educational material on CRC etiology, symptoms,
screening, and treatment. Importantly, more than 80% of the people reached indicated
that they had either been screened in the prior 6 mo or intended to be screened in
the next 6 mo before they ever interacted with the intervention, and screening use
among these people topped 75%. While the intervention may be relatively more
effective in supporting screening among those who had less intentions to be
screened, the portal-based intervention did not frequently reach such people.
Whether the same intervention content might be effective among those still
contemplating whether to be screened or whether a more targeted intervention that
focused more heavily on barrier removal might be effective among the population
reached here should be explored in the future.</p>
              <p>Because few studies have reported how complex EHR functionalities such as BPAs,
registries, and health maintenance flags can be used to support research
activities,<sup><xref rid="bibr70-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">70</xref><xref rid="bibr71-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr72-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> our findings
contribute to the literature on the use of EHRs in pragmatic trials and other types
of practice-embedded research. While, as evidenced by our findings, caution needs to
exist surrounding the sole reliance on portals to route patient-facing material to
people,<sup><xref rid="bibr57-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> it is important to note that the other EHR functionalities we
leveraged work independently of the portal. In addition, most of the functionalities
can be set to work silently, in the background of the EHR, and thus in ways that
remain not visible or disruptive to clinic staff. Patient identification, follow-up,
and even the collection of patient-reported outcomes via in-clinic use of such
EHR-embedded tools<sup><xref rid="bibr73-0272989X221104094" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> can therefore greatly facilitate pragmatic and other trial
processes.</p>
              <p>Study limitations include the sole reliance on EHR data to obtain CRC screening
information, as such a reliance may have led to underreporting of CRC use. We do
not, however, have reason to believe that this underreporting would have differed by
study arm. As noted above, given the reliance on the patient portal, a primary study
limitation was the limited ability to reach the targeted population. In addition to
the challenges reaching the target population, among those who viewed the secure
study invitation, there may have been additional selectivity bias, as enrolling in
the trial required the ability not only to get to the secure message but open the
attachment and navigate within the questionnaire. This may have been especially true
for patients who prefer to receive information in a language other than English. In
addition, it is possible that those consenting to study participation differed from
those who may otherwise elect to engage with similar interventions outside of a
research setting. It may also be that physicians selectively order CRC screening for
only those patients who express an interest during the office visit (or, at least,
selectively do not order screening for those verbally refusing screening), further
limiting the reach of our intervention. Regardless, an intervention tied to an
office-based physician order for care will never reach those who choose not to seek
care, highlighting the importance of both in-reach and outreach strategies to
improve CRC screening rates in the primary care setting. Because our study did not
collect reasons for nonenrollment among those who did not consent to study
participation, we are not able to shed light on why people may have elected not to
view the study material. Furthermore, without a sample of people who provided
consent but were not exposed to anything (i.e., true usual care), we are not able to
determine whether the simple provision of information on CRC and CRC screening might
improve CRC screening use following a physician recommendation for care. Given what
is known about the complexities of behavior change and that the CRC screening rates
observed among trial enrollees (65%) were approximately equal to those observed
among the health systemâs general population of primary care patients aged 50 to 75
y with an activated portal account around the same time (62%), this would seem
highly unlikely. There may also be practice-level factors such as scheduling delays
or the use of reminder calls, which could affect CRC screening timeliness and
ultimately use. Although we did not compile such information within the context of
this trial, most practice-level preventive health initiatives are conducted by a
centralized (i.e., health system-level) population health management team within the
health system within which the study was conducted, thus minimizing potential
confounding.</p>
