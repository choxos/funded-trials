              <abstract>
                <p>The mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) crosses mucosal surfaces to establish infection are unknown. Acidic genital secretions of HIV-1-infected women contain HIV-1 likely coated by antibody. We found that the combination of acidic pH and Env-specific IgG, including that from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of HIV-1-infected individuals, augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20-fold compared with Env-specific IgG at neutral pH or non-specific IgG at either pH. Enhanced transcytosis was observed with clinical HIV-1 isolates, including transmitted/founder strains, and was eliminated in Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)-knockdown epithelial cells. Non-neutralizing antibodies allowed similar or less transcytosis than neutralizing antibodies. However, the ratio of total:infectious virus was higher for neutralizing antibodies, indicating that they allowed transcytosis while blocking infectivity of transcytosed virus. Immunocytochemistry revealed abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelia lining the human endocervix and penile urethra. Acidity and Env-specific IgG enhance transcytosis of virus across epithelial cells via FcRn and could facilitate translocation of virus to susceptible target cells following sexual exposure.</p>

                <p>HIV-1 causes a sexually transmitted disease. However, the mechanisms employed by the virus to cross genital tract tissue and establish infection are uncertain. Since cervicovaginal fluid is acidic and HIV-1 in cervicovaginal fluid is likely coated with antibodies, we explored the effect of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibodies on transcytosis, the movement of HIV-1 across tight-junctioned epithelial cells. We found that the combination of HIV-1-specific antibodies and low pH enhanced transcytosis as much as 20-fold. Virus that underwent transcytosis under these conditions was infectious, and infectivity was highly influenced by whether or not the antibody neutralized the virus. We observed enhanced transcytosis using antibody from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids and using transmitted/founder strains of HIV-1. We also found that the enhanced transcytosis was due to the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn), which binds immune complexes at acidic pH and releases them at neutral pH. Finally, staining of human tissue revealed abundant FcRn expression on columnar epithelial cells of penile urethra and endocervix. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein HIV-1 may facilitate its own transmission by usurping the antibody response directed against itself. These results have important implications for HIV vaccine development and for understanding the earliest events in HIV transmission.</p>

              <p>Sexual transmission of HIV-1 requires that virus establish infection across genital tract or intestinal tissue. Sexually transmitted infections, other causes of inflammation, and localized trauma may allow susceptible CD4+ target cells at skin or mucosal surfaces to become directly exposed to secretions from infected sexual partners <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Galvin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, when skin and mucosa are intact, it remains unclear precisely how HIV-1 gains access to target cells. One possibility is that virus translocates between epithelial cells until susceptible cells are found either in or below the epithelium <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Fanibunda1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Alternatively, Langerhans cells may sample the surface, acquire virus, and move it to areas of abundant target cells <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Mesman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Ballweber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Finally, transcytosis of HIV-1 (i.e., movement through cells) has been studied as a potential mechanism to translocate virus from mucosal surfaces to deeper-lying CD4+ cells <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Kage1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Saidi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Bobardt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Transcytosis offers an explanation for movement of virus across epithelial cells forming tight junctions, which might normally exclude pathogens from moving beyond the surface. However, <italic>in vitro</italic>, only a very small amount of virus, usually less than 0.3% of a cell-free virus inoculum, finds its way through cells into the medium bathing basolateral surfaces (<xref rid="ppat.1003776-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). Interactions between HIV-1 Env and several host cell surface molecules, including glycolipids, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and gp340, have been proposed to play a role in transcytosis <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Cannon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Viard1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Alfsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Stoddard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Stoddard2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
              <p>With the exception of the acute phase prior to development of anti-HIV-1 immune responses, semen, cervicovaginal, and rectal fluids from HIV-1-infected individuals contain antibodies against HIV-1 Env <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Raux1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Yates1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The concentration of Env-specific IgG present in such secretions varies considerably from person to person and is usually on the order of 100 to 1,000-fold less than concentrations found in plasma <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Mestecky1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The presence of Env-specific IgG strongly suggests that some proportion of Env molecules on the surface of infectious virions in genital tract secretions is coated with IgG. Since HIV-1 is successfully transmitted sexually, the coating antibody is either of insufficient quantity or quality to neutralize virus infectivity upon contact with an uninfected partner.</p>
              <p>Antibody in genital tract secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals could play a role in facilitating the transport of virus across mucosal epithelia. Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) in human genital mucosal tissue <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor belonging to the MHC class I family of proteins <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Roopenian1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The expression of FcRn in endothelial cells is thought to be critical for IgG homeostasis in blood <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Akilesh1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transporting maternal IgG to the fetal circulation <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Simister1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the Fc region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Raghavan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This pH-dependent binding allows the transport of intact IgG or of IgG immune complexes from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids, for example, cervicovaginal secretions, to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Cervicovaginal secretions are maintained at acidic pH by acid-producing bacteria that make up part of the normal vaginal microbiota <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Linhares1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although perturbations of normal microbiota, such as occur with bacterial vaginosis, raise the pH, the secretions generally remain in the acidic range <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Caillouette1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Atashili1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Semen rapidly neutralizes cervicovaginal secretions, but the extent of the pH change is variable. For example, a large amount of ejaculate may raise the pH to the neutral range, whereas a small amount may not <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Bouvet1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The pH of rectal secretions ranges from about 6.8 to 7.2 <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Nugent1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Given that HIV-1 in genital tract secretions may be complexed with IgG antibody, that female genital tract secretions are acidic, and that FcRn has been demonstrated in genital tract tissues, we evaluated the role of pH and antibody on transcytosis of HIV-1 through polarized epithelial cells.</p>

                <p>To investigate the effect of low pH and antibody on HIV-1 transcytosis across epithelial cells forming tight junctions, we exposed the apical surface of HEC-1A cells to HIV-1 at pH 6.0 or 7.4 with or without HIV-1-specific IgG (HIVIG). Virus was quantified in the medium bathing the basolateral cell surface (“subnatant fluid”) by RT-PCR and, although detectable as early as six hours after exposure of virus to the apical cell surface, the quantity was greater at 12 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>) <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Bobardt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, in subsequent experiments, transcytosis was measured at 12 hours. Using HIV-1<sub>US712</sub>, a clade B R5 clinical isolate, HIVIG enhanced transcytosis in a dose-dependent manner when virus and antibody were exposed to the apical surface at pH 6.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). There was no increase in transcytosis with HIVIG at pH 7.4 or with HIV-negative IgG (IVIG) at pH 6.0 or 7.4. We found similarly enhanced transcytosis using additional R5 as well as X4 and X4/R5 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Importantly, transcytosis of four of five clade C transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped viruses was enhanced in a pH and antibody-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). Enhanced transcytosis with HIV-1-specific antibody at low pH also occurred with T84 colon carcinoma cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p>

                <p>Since sexual transmission may occur with small amounts of virus, we investigated if pH- and antibody-dependent enhancement of transcytosis could occur at very low HIV-1 inocula. Using HIVIG or the anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2F5, we found that transcytosis occurred with virus inocula as low as 2 pg of p24 (about 60,000 RNA copies) with HIVIG and 0.02 pg of p24 (about 500 RNA copies) with 2F5, amounts too small to be detectable in subnatant fluid in the absence of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003776-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

The knock-down HEC-1A cells attained the same level of electrical resistance as did the wild-type cells (data not shown), indicating that FcRn knockdown did not affect the ability to form tight junctions. Unlike with wild-type HEC-1A cells, there was no enhanced transcytosis with FcRn-knockdown HEC-1A cells when either mAb 2F5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) or polyclonal HIVIG (data not shown) were used.

Blockade of FcRn with anti-FcRn antibody and inhibition of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 also substantially reduced or eliminated enhanced transcytosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s003">Figure S3D</xref></bold>–<bold>F</bold>), as did competition between the non-HIV-1-specific mAb Den3 and the anti-HIV-1 Env mAb VRC01 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s003">Figure S3G</xref></bold>). Consistent with other investigations of Fc-FcRn interactions, maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5.5–6.0, with some enhanced transcytosis apparent at pH 4.5 and 6.5 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s003">Figure S3H</xref></bold>) <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Mathur1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

                <p>Using 50 µg/ml of VRC01 or Den3, transcytosis of IgG alone increased approximately 3 fold from about 0.4% at pH 7.4 to about 1.3% at pH 6.0 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). However, the effect of FcRn-mediated transcytosis on IgG alone does not appear as strong as the effect on IgG immune complexes, where, for example, with complexes made with 50 µg/ml of VRC01 or 2F5, there was about an 8-fold increase in transcytosis under conditions allowing FcRn engagement. This difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of IgG by the epithelial cells at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4; IgG thus internalized can engage FcRn in acidic endosomes and be shuttled to the basolateral side of the cells <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Ramalingam1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The internalization of immune complexes, on the other hand, likely depends primarily on FcRn engagement at the surface of the cell at pH 6.0.</p>

                <title>Infectivity of transcytosed virus is affected by antibody function</title>
                <p>We evaluated the ability of HIVIG and a panel of mAbs with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH-dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV-1<sub>JRFL</sub>; 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>s) of the antibodies ranged from 0.06 to &gt;50 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). Both poorly neutralizing antibodies (HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>) and neutralizing mAbs (4E10, 2F5, 2G12, VRC01, and b12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6.0. At 50 µg/ml, transcytosis correlated directly with mAb binding to HIV-1<sub>JRFL</sub> (Spearman <italic>rho</italic> = 0.75; <italic>p</italic> = 0.052) and inversely with the IC<sub>50</sub> of the mAbs (Spearman <italic>rho</italic> = −0.71; <italic>p</italic> = 0.050) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). At pH 6.0, all Env-specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM-bl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Figure 3C and D</bold></xref>). However, there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis (Spearman's <italic>rho</italic> = 0.86; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG, F240 and b6, at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 µg/ml, was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non-FcRn-dependent manner (i.e., in the presence of Den3 control mAb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref>). Conversely, transcytosis mediated by antibodies with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub>s, such as VRC01 and b12, resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). Thus, strong binding activity results in more FcRn-dependent transcytosis, whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious. This point is further illustrated by the ratio of percent-transcytosed:percent-infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). For example, for every infectious unit, about 30 times more virus is transcytosed with VRC01 than with HIVIG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003776-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). Note that independently of transcytosis, HIV-1<sub>JRLF</sub> infectivity on TZM-bl cells increased about 3.5-fold after incubation of virus for 12 hours at pH 6.0 compared with pH 7.4; however, IC<sub>50s</sub> were very similar (&lt;15% difference) at the two pH values (pH comparisons done for 2F5 and VRC01 only; data not shown). Virus infectivity was essentially abrogated after a 12-hour incubation at pH 4.0 (data not shown).</p>

              <p>Female genital tract secretions are often acidic, and the secretions of HIV-infected individuals have antibody capable of coating virus contained in those secretions. These facts led us to explore the role of antibody and low pH on transcytosis of HIV-1 across epithelial cells. Our primary finding is that at acidic pH, IgG enhances transcytosis of HIV-1 clinical isolates, including transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped strains. Moreover, antibody from both cervicovaginal and seminal fluid mediates enhanced transcytosis at low pH. The enhanced transcytosis is abrogated by blocking or knocking down FcRn, which is known to bind IgG and immune complexes at low pH and release them at neutral pH <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Raghavan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Story1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We also establish that virus translocated across epithelial cells after incubation with antibody at low pH remains infectious. Although neutralizing antibodies generally promote more transcytosis, the transcytosed virus is relatively less infectious than virus whose transcytosis is mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate abundant FcRn protein expression in columnar epithelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra, suggesting that these sites could play a major role in FcRn-mediated immune complex transcytosis.</p>
              <p>Our results indicate that FcRn may be responsible for shuttling IgG-bound HIV-1 across epithelial cells in the genital tract. This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for FcRn in immune complex shuttling across tissues <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Maidji1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Mice expressing human FcRn in intestinal epithelial cells were able to deliver IgG to the luminal intestinal surface, which could then bind to its cognate antigen and return the immune complex back to the lamina propria for presentation by dendritic cells to CD4+ T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV) applied to human placental explants from women with high anti-CMV neutralizing antibody activity was rapidly transcytosed across syncytiotrophoblasts and captured by villus macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Maidji1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Under these conditions, the virus did not replicate. However, in explants from CMV-seropositive women with low or undetectable neutralizing antibodies, virus replication readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact, uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer. Thus, it appeared that neutralizing antibody inhibited infection after allowing virus to cross the syncytiotrophoblast layer. On the other hand, non-neutralizing antibody allowed or even promoted infection. Syncytiotrophoblasts express high levels of FcRn, and when FcRn on explants was blocked, IgG-virion complexes were not transported across the surface <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Maidji1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Just as we found with HIV-1, FcRn-mediated transcytosis of CMV occurred with both neutralizing and poorly neutralizing antibody, but transcytosed virus remained infectious only when complexed with poorly neutralizing antibody. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of placentas from <italic>in utero</italic> infections were consistent with this model of FcRn-mediated transcytosis <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Maidji1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, ours is the first study to investigate transcytosis using virus coated with HIV-specific antibody in an acidic environment that mimics that of the female genital tract. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations are applicable to male-to-female transmission via vaginal intercourse, where enhanced transcytosis could facilitate infection. In this regard, Li et al. reported FcRn expression and bidirectional IgG transport in a human vaginal tissue model <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although we did not detect FcRn in the apical layers of vaginal epithelium, we did detect abundant FcRn expression in columnar endocervical epithelial cells. These cells may be exposed to acidic vaginal secretions where they occur at the cervical os. Furthermore, cervical ectopy, a common condition characterized by the extension of endocervical columnar epithelium into the ectocervix and upper vagina, has been implicated as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Myer1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Moss1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Prevalent in reproductive-age women, these cervical lesions are exposed to vaginal pH conditions and could provide portals for FcRn-mediated male-to-female HIV-1 transmission <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. FcRn was also found, though not consistently, in basal epithelial cells of the vagina. These cells lie deep in the epithelium and are unlikely to come in contact with acidic secretions and HIV-1 immune complexes unless there were trauma or substantial thinning of the overlying squamous epithelium. It is important to note that seminal fluid can rapidly raise the pH of cervicovaginal secretions to levels which would not support immune complex-FcRn binding. However, the pH of cervicovaginal fluid following ejaculation is dependent on the quantity of the ejaculate and may stay within an acidic range <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, HIV is present in preejaculate secretions and could be introduced into the female genital tract prior to ejaculation <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Pudney1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p>
              <p>With respect to female-to-male transmission, the penis comes in contact with vaginal secretions that would remain at acidic pH at least until ejaculation, allowing time for exposure of penile tissues, including the foreskin and urethra, to IgG-coated virus at low pH <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Bouvet1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our demonstration of abundant FcRn on human penile urethral epithelium supports a model where exposure to antibody-bound HIV-1 might lead to enhanced female-to-male transmission. It should be noted that the pH of vaginal secretions is typically about 4, which is below the pH required for Fc-FcRn binding <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, there is substantial variability in normal vaginal pH <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Caillouette1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and we did begin to observe enhanced transcytosis at pH 4.5 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003776.s003">Figure S3H</xref></bold>). Furthermore, it is possible that there is some buffering effect of foreskin and urethral secretions. The foreskin, whose presence increases HIV infection rate, could trap secretions containing HIV-1 immune complexes and thereby allow greater urethral exposure to infected material within the pH range of Fc-FcRn binding <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Additionally, bacterial vaginosis, a condition associated with an increased risk of female-to-male (as well as male-female) HIV transmission, results in vaginal secretions ideal for Fc-FcRn binding <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Caillouette1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Atashili1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Exposure of penile tissues to the pH range of Fc-FcRn binding may also occur after ejaculation, since complete neutralization of vaginal acidity may not occur immediately or at all <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is also possible, though less likely, that FcRn mediates HIV transmission via the penis during insertive anal intercourse, where the penis may come into contact with slightly acidic rectal secretions <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Nugent1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The finding that IgG from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids obtained from HIV-infected individuals mediate enhanced transcytosis of infectious virus further suggests the biological relevance of our results. Cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of ∼3 µg/ml and up to ∼15 µg/ml of Env-specific IgG <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Mestecky1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Four of the six samples we evaluated bound to infectious HIV-1 at 5 µg/ml. Moreover, all of our samples mediated transcytosis at ≤12.5 µg/ml of total IgG, well below total IgG concentrations found in genital secretions of HIV-infected men and women <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Mestecky1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Even during acute HIV infection, when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest, 23 of 23 subjects (100%) were reported to have anti-gp41 IgG antibodies and 40% had anti-gp120 IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal and seminal fluids <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Yates1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Anti-gp41 IgG levels were on average 11-fold higher than gp41-specific IgA levels; anti-gp41 IgM was found less frequently and in lower quantity. Thus, HIV-1 immune complexes are likely to occur in mucosal secretions, are likely to contain predominantly IgG, and under acidic conditions, would be subject to FcRn-mediated transcytosis in an exposed host.</p>
              <p>The relevance of our findings is also supported by our demonstration that transcytosis of transmitted/founder strains of HIV-1 Env pseudotyped virus is enhanced by antibody. We are currently evaluating whether transmitted/founder strains, in comparison with chronic strains, are preferentially transcytosed, which would be consistent with a report showing a higher sensitivity of clade B transmitted/founder strains to anti-Env antibody binding <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Wilen1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Our findings represent a new model of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of HIV-1 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated ADE <italic>in vitro</italic> due to FcγR- or complement-mediated mechanisms or to modulation of the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Guillon1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that enhancement <italic>in vitro</italic> occurs at the level of transcytosis across epithelial cells and involves FcRn. <italic>In vivo</italic>, Ig isotype, as well as neutralizing activity, are likely to play a determining role in whether an antibody might protect from or enhance infection. As demonstrated recently, intrarectally applied dIgA1 HGN194 mAb, but less so the IgG1 version, prevented SHIV infection following intrarectal challenge <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the dIgA1 inhibited transcytosis, whereas we now show that the IgG1 version enhances transcytosis at pH 6.0. Another study showed that, compared to irrelevant- and no-antibody controls, there was an increase in the number of transmitted/founder SHIV variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of a non-neutralizing IgG1 mAb <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Clearly, other studies have found that IgG with neutralizing activity can prevent lentivirus infection after vaginal challenge <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Veazey1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Hessell1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Thus, whereas a strong vaccine-induced neutralizing IgG response may protect, non-neutralizing IgG or waning titers of neutralizing IgG present in an acidic lumen might enhance transcytosis across mucosal barriers while allowing infection of susceptible target cells. However, whether an antibody protects, enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity, the viral strain, the inflammatory state of the exposed individual, and genetic factors—such as FcγR polymorphisms—that might influence antibody function <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Forthal1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Finally, if FcRn-mediated transcytosis applies <italic>in vivo</italic>, our results would strengthen the argument for a mucosal IgA response to vaccination—though not at the exclusion of a strong IgG neutralizing or other anti-viral response—since IgA can inhibit transcytosis, would not engage FcRn, and mediates only uni-directional translocation of immune complexes from the subepithelial space into external secretions <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Some studies have reported that anti-HIV-1 Env IgG antibodies can inhibit transcytosis <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Tudor1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Chomont1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. One of these studies found that polyclonal anti-HIV Env IgG inhibited transcytosis of cell-free virus on HEC-1 cells, whereas none of 13 mAbs did; in fact, some of the mAbs might have increased transcytosis, although by no more than about 50% <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Chomont1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. To our knowledge, none of these studies was carried out under the acidic conditions that characterize female genital tract secretions.</p>
              <p>Our results suggest that FcRn might facilitate infection in hosts without pre-existing antibody or with a non-neutralizing IgG response to prior infection (which would result in secondary infection) or to vaccination. However, FcRn could also play a beneficial role in preventing infection after exposure. FcRn mediates the bidirectional transcytosis of IgG, and in immunized individuals, could provide a conduit for antibodies to neutralize virus as shown for herpes simplex virus type 2 <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition, IgG immune complexes can prime CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in an FcRn-dependent manner, and FcRn targeting may be a useful mucosal immunization strategy <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Qiao1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003776-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In summary, we have demonstrated that FcRn mediates enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 in the presence of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibody. We have also shown that FcRn is present on epithelial cells in areas of the genital tract that are potentially exposed to HIV-1 during sexual intercourse. Our findings point toward a novel mechanism by which the sexual transmission of HIV-1 may be facilitated.</p>

IVIG (Gamunex, Taleris Biotherapeutics) was commercially acquired. mAb b12 and control mAb Den3 were provided by Dennis Burton and Brian Moldt, and control mAb Fm-6 was a gift of Wayne Marasco (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute); b12 and the control mAbs are IgG1.

Briefly, the IgG constant region in pDR.12 (IgG b12) was replaced with the constant region of IgA2.

Constant regions were cloned into a mammalian expression vector used for subcloning of the HGN194 VH region. The HGN194 VH and VL chain were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned into an IgG1 and Ig-lambda expression vector. MAbs HGN194 dIgA1, dIgA2, and IgG1 were produced by transient transfection of 293 freestyle cells with polyethylenimine and expression plasmids encoding corresponding heavy and light chains (in the case of dIgA1 and dIgA2, the J chain expression plasmid was included). Supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7–10 days of culture. HGN194 dIgA1, dIgA2, and IgG1 were affinity purified by Peptide M (dIgA1 and dIgA2) or Protein A (IgG1) chromatography. Purified Abs were quantified by ELISA using dIgA1 and dIgA2 or IgG1-specific Abs (Southern Biotech). Purity and polymeric state of dIgA1 and dIgA2 were confirmed by native-PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography.

HEC1-1A or T84 cell monolayers were created on 0.4 µm polyethylene terephthalate membrane hanging transwell inserts (Millipore). Cell viability was &gt;95% at the time of plating. Electrical resistance across the membrane, which ranged from 400–450 mOhms/cm<sup>2</sup> at the start of the transcytosis assay, confirmed monolayer integrity. Resistance was re-measured after the transcytosis assay in more than 50% of wells and ranged from 450–480 mOhms/cm<sup>2</sup>. HIV-1 alone or with antibody was added to monolayers in media buffered to pH 6.0 or 7.4. After 12 hours, fluid in the lower chamber (“subnatant fluid”), maintained at pH 7.4, was collected and used to measure viral RNA copy number and infectivity. In the absence of cell monolayers, about 69% of the virus inoculum was present in the lower chamber of the wells after 12 hours.</p>

                <p>Cervical tissue, which included portions of endocervix and upper vagina (ectocervix), was obtained from 10 women aged 31–50 undergoing hysterectomy for nonmalignant conditions. Vaginal tissue was also obtained from women undergoing vaginal repair (n = 6, aged 44–78 years). Penile tissue, including urethra (n = 16) and foreskin (n = 2), was harvested at autopsy from 16 men aged 34–73 with no history of hormonal or immunosuppressive medications. Tissues were processed within 60 minutes of surgical removal. Samples were either embedded in Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc.) and rapidly frozen and stored at −70°C (frozen sections) or were fixed in formaldehyde and processed for paraffin embedding.</p>
