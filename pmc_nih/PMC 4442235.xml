                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Finding the optimal management strategy for patients with advanced, metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas is a work in progress. Sunitinib and everolimus are currently approved for the treatment of progressive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic low-grade or intermediate-grade pancreatic NETs. However, mutation-targeted therapy with sunitinib or everolimus has not been studied in this patient population.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This prospective, open-label phase II clinical trial was designed to determine if mutation-targeting therapy with sunitinib or everolimus for patients with advanced low-grade or intermediate-grade NETs is more effective than historically expected results with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary end point. Patients ≥18 years of age with progressive, low-grade or intermediate-grade locally advanced or metastatic NETs are eligible for this study. Patients will undergo tumour biopsy (if they are not a surgical candidate) for tumour genotyping. Patients will be assigned to sunitininb or everolimus based on somatic/germline mutations profile. Patients who have disease progression on either sunitinib or everolimus will crossover to the other drug. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent to withdrawal. Using the proposed criteria, 44 patients will be accrued within each treatment group during a 48-month period (a total of 88 patients for the 2 treatments), and followed for up to an additional 12 months (a total of 60 months from entry of the first patient) to achieve 80% power in order to test whether there is an improvement in PFS compared to historically expected results, with a 0.10 α level one-sided significance test.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and pancreas are a rare and heterogeneous group of neoplasms with unique tumour biology, natural history and clinical management issues.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> Most NETs are sporadic, but they can be part of familial cancer syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), tuberous sclerosis (TS) or Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref></p>
              <p>While poorly differentiated tumours may exhibit highly aggressive behaviour, well-differentiated, low-grade or intermediate-grade NETs have a relatively indolent behaviour with slow progression.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As a result of this insidious biological behaviour, many patients with well-differentiated, low-grade or intermediate-grade NETs have advanced disease at diagnosis, with regional or distant metastasis observed in more than 50% of patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Surgery is the only curative treatment option in patients with localised early stage NETs. The optimal management strategy for patients with advanced NETs is unknown.</p>
              <p>Our understanding of the genetic events associated with sporadic and familial NETs has improved considerably over the last three decades. Driver oncogene and tumour suppressor genes have been identified in most NETs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–19</xref> Overall, the majority of NETs have somatic mutations in <italic>MEN1</italic>, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<italic>PI3K)/AKT/</italic>mammalian target of rapamycin (<italic>mTOR</italic>) signalling pathway,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–24</xref> and/or overexpression of growth factors and their receptor such as vascular endothelial growth factor (<italic>VEGF</italic>), <italic>VEGF</italic> receptor (<italic>VEGFR</italic>), platelet-derived growth factor (<italic>PDGF</italic>), and <italic>PDGF</italic> receptor (<italic>PDGFR</italic>).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref> A recent study also revealed the presence of somatic mutations in <italic>MEN1</italic>, <italic>DAXX</italic>, <italic>ATRX</italic>, <italic>TSC2</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genes in the majority of sporadic pancreatic NETs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Moreover, the presence of these mutations was associated with better survival when compared with patients with NETs, which had wild-type <italic>MEN1</italic>, and/or <italic>DAXX/ATRX.</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p>In 2011, sunitinib (multityrosine kinase inhibitor) and everolimus (mTOR signalling pathway inhibitor) were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of unresectable, metastatic, progressive pancreatic NETs based on the results of phase III trials demonstrating a significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in the treatment versus placebo arm (11.4 vs 5.5 months for sunitinib, and 11.0 vs 4.6 months for everolimus).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, there are several important management issues that remain unclear: (1) Is treatment with everolimus/sunitinib beneficial to other groups of patients with advanced NETs, who have NETs of GI tract (also called ‘carcinoids’), and/or patients who have cytoreductive surgery? (2) While the choice of targeted therapies in other malignancies is more frequently being driven by the findings of the precise molecular alterations present in the tumour, no such study has been done in NETs. This is particularly important given that the survival of patients with malignant NETs appears to be different based on the driver mutation(s) present in the tumour and low-grade or intermediate-grade tumours can have a relatively indolent growth.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p>The primary objective of this phase II trial is to determine the PFS in patients with NETs of the GI tract and pancreas treated with sunitinib or everolimus based on tumour genotyping with or without surgical resection. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that an improvement in PFS can be achieved using this mutation-targeted treatment strategy when compared to previous studies.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

                <p>In this prospective, open-label, phase II clinical trial, patients will undergo cytoreductive surgery for standard-of-care indications, or an image-guided tumour biopsy will be performed for tumour genotyping in patients who do not undergo an operation and who do not have archived tumour tissue samples. Patients who have been potentially rendered disease free at the discretion of the principal investigator after surgical resection will not be assigned to a study medication and will be removed from the study. All other patients must begin study drug within 3 months after surgery/biopsy. Patients with syndromic NETs (eg, VHL and MEN1) will not undergo tumour biopsy. On the basis of the tumour genotype or germline mutation status, and the results of analysis of the involved cell signalling pathways (<xref rid="BMJOPEN2015008248TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), patients will be treated with sunitinib (for mutations in <italic>MEN1/PDGFR</italic>/<italic>KIT/FLT3</italic>) or everolimus (for mutations in <italic>NF1</italic>/<italic>PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/VHL/TP53</italic>) daily in 28-day cycles (<xref rid="BMJOPEN2015008248TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Patients will receive long-acting octreotide for symptoms associated with hormonal hypersecretion. Treatment with sunitinib/everolimus in patients who undergo surgical treatment will begin after recovery from surgery. Patients who have gene mutations not known to be specifically targeted by sunitinib or everolimus, or with more than one mutation, will be assigned to sunitinib.</p>

                <p>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the PFS of patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade NET who receive first-line targeted therapy with or without cytoreductive surgery. This will provide data to explore whether the PFS may represent a potential improvement over published results with treatment only with everolimus/sunitinib.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Secondary objectives include evaluation of response and OS as well as safety and exploring the association between tumour genotype and PFS, and response to treatment. If the findings of this study suggest improved PFS from mutation-targeted and/or combination treatment, larger randomised trials to confirm the findings will be developed.</p>
                <p>Following surgery or tumour biopsy for tumour genotyping, eligible patients will be treated with everolimus or sunitinib. On the basis of results of the genotyping, enrolled patients will then receive targeted treatment with sunitinib (for mutations in <italic>MEN1/PDGFR</italic>/<italic>KIT</italic>/<italic>FTL3</italic> or everolimus (for mutations in <italic>NF1</italic>/<italic>PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/VHL/TP53</italic>). Patients with other different mutations or multiple types of mutations will be assigned to receive sunitinib since almost all these tumours have elevated levels of <italic>VEGF</italic>/<italic>VEGFR</italic> expression.</p>
                <p>Results from previously published trials<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> both demonstrated approximately 11 months PFS in patients similar to the ones to be treated on this protocol. Those patients were not assigned to receive treatment on the basis of any tumour genotype information. The study was designed to determine if meaningful improvement in PFS may be obtained using this focused strategy. For purposes of sample size determination, patients will be primarily evaluated based on the treatment received. Thus, within each treatment group, using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley, with 44 patients accrued during a 48-month period (a total of 88 patients for the two treatments), and followed for up to an additional 12 months (a total of 60 months from entry of the first patient), there would be 80% power to test whether the median PFS is consistent with 18 months, and greater than 11 months, with a 0.10 α level one-sided significance test.</p>
                <p>In practice, a Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS will be constructed for each group, and will have the median as well as key time points such as 12 and 18 months estimated, along with appropriate 80% and 95% CIs to explore whether the present results exceed those from prior studies. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier curves for all patients who received either sunitinib and everolimus as their treatments may be combined into one pooled Kaplan-Meier curve if the two curves for these treatments are sufficiently similar to one another (p&gt;0.30 by a two-tailed log-rank test). This combined curve will then be evaluated relative to the published median of 11 months PFS for each group to provide a more powerful comparison relative to the historically expected results. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves limited to the patients who received targeted therapy based solely on mutation status may be constructed for exploratory and descriptive purposes.</p>
                <p>Response and OS will also be evaluated as secondary end points, based on the patients treated with sunitinib or everolimus, using all patients receiving treatment. These results will be descriptive and may consist of fractions of responses as well as Kaplan-Meier curves for survival. The association between genotype and PFS will be explored by evaluating the results within a treatment based on the major genotype categories identified. Safety will be evaluated by tabulating and reporting the distribution of the worst grade of each type of toxicity found, per patient, separately by treatment. Should any particular type of toxicity result in five or more patients with grades 3–4 toxicity, a comparison of the distributions of toxicity between the two treatments may be performed using a Cochran-Armitage test for trend.</p>
                <p>Because the patients may not end up being assigned in equal proportions to the two treatments, and because the goal is to have 44 evaluable patients who have received each treatment, additional patients beyond the 44 described above may be enrolled on the arm with faster accrual. As such, the study will have an accrual ceiling of 120 patients, with accrual ending when there are 44 evaluable patients on the arm with fewer patients. An amendment may also be needed if a lower proportion of patients than expected receive study drug therapy or if a high portion of treated patients are not evaluable for response. It is anticipated that 20–30 patients per year may enrol onto this trial; thus, accrual may be completed in 3–4 years.</p>

              <p>NETs of the GI tract and pancreas are rare and heterogeneous, but are a clinically important group of neoplasms that arise in the disseminated neuroendocrine cells of the GI tract and the pancreatic islet cells. The annual incidence of NETs has been increasing in the USA and worldwide, and was estimated to be 7.8/100 000 persons in 2013.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref></p>
              <p>NETs are classified into functioning (hormone hypersecreting) or non-functioning (clinically ‘silent’) tumours, based on their ability to produce hormone-associated symptoms. However, other classification systems with many common themes, such as the distinction of well-differentiated (low and intermediate grades) from poorly differentiated (high grade) NETs, and the prognostic significance of proliferative rate index have been used over the past five decades. The majority of NETs (60–90%) are clinically non-functioning, well-differentiated, slow-growing neoplasms diagnosed, in most instances, incidentally during an unrelated procedure.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–35</xref> As a result of this insidious biological behaviour, many patients with NETs have advanced disease at diagnosis, with regional or distant metastasis observed in more than 50% of patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> NETs most commonly metastasise to the loco-regional lymph nodes and liver, and 25% to 93% of patients will develop liver metastases during the course of their disease.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p>
              <p>Surgical resection alone is a valuable treatment option for patients with early-stage disease; however, the extent, timing and effect of surgical intervention for advanced, metastatic NETs remain controversial and difficult to estimate. Although not supported by randomised clinical trial data, currently it is advocated that surgery should be undertaken only if metastatic disease is confined to the liver and if 90% or more of the tumour mass, including liver metastases, can be successfully removed.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, most patients will present with multiple bilobar liver metastases, and, altogether, only 5–10% will have apparently solitary or dominant liver metastases amenable to surgical resection.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Furthermore, recurrence after surgery is common, and a significant number of patients with advanced NETs undergoing debulking surgery will have residual disease and suffer from complications associated with hormonal hypersecretion and/or tumour progression.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>
              <p>The approval, by the FDA, of sunitinib and everolimus for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NETs is a remarkable milestone in the field of medical therapy of malignant NETs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, while the mutation-targeted therapy in other malignancies is driven by the findings of the precise molecular alterations present in the tumour, no such study has been conducted in malignant NETs. In addition, it is not known if treatment with everolimus or sunitinib will be beneficial to other groups of patients with advanced NETs, including those with carcinoid tumours, or as adjuvant therapy for patients who have cytoreductive surgery.</p>
              <p>Although improving OS is the ultimate goal for any cancer therapy, the variable, and at times long survival time in many patients with NETs, makes OS a less suitable initial end point to study for the proposed strategy of targeted therapy.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In this regard, using PFS as a primary end point poses less significant scientific challenges and is attractive from both an ethical and feasibility standpoint.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> We believe that such an approach will allow us to generate enough data to determine whether a larger study is warranted using mutation-targeted therapy for patients with NETs. The results from this phase II open-labelled study could also provide important data for future study questions: (1) Does specific tumour genotype predict response to therapy? (2) Does adjuvant therapy after surgical debulking have any benefit? and (3) What are the long-term side effects associated with sunitinib or everolimus therapy?</p>
