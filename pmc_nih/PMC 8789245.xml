                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>We evaluated our SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike recombinant protein vaccine (CoV2 preS dTM) with different adjuvants, unadjuvanted, and in a one-injection and two-injection dosing schedule in a previous phase 1–2 study. Based on interim results from that study, we selected a two-injection schedule and the AS03 adjuvant for further clinical development. However, lower than expected antibody responses, particularly in older adults, and higher than expected reactogenicity after the second vaccination were observed. In the current study, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an optimised formulation of CoV2 preS dTM adjuvanted with AS03 to inform progression to phase 3 clinical trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This phase 2, randomised, parallel-group, dose-ranging study was done in adults (≥18 years old), including those with pre-existing medical conditions, those who were immunocompromised (except those with recent organ transplant or chemotherapy) and those with a potentially increased risk for severe COVID-19, at 20 clinical research centres in the USA and Honduras. Women who were pregnant or lactating or, for those of childbearing potential, not using an effective method of contraception or abstinence, and those who had received a COVID-19 vaccine, were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using an interactive response technology system, with stratification by age (18–59 years and ≥60 years), rapid serodiagnostic test result (positive or negative), and high-risk medical conditions (yes or no), to receive two injections (day 1 and day 22) of 5 7mu;g (low dose), 10 7mu;g (medium dose), or 15 7mu;g (high dose) CoV2 preS dTM antigen with fixed AS03 content. All participants and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment; unmasked study staff involved in vaccine preparation were not involved in safety outcome assessments. All laboratory staff performing the assays were masked to treatment. The primary safety objective was to describe the safety profile in all participants, for each candidate vaccine formulation. Safety endpoints were evaluated for all randomised participants who received at least one dose of the study vaccine (safety analysis set), and are presented here for the interim study period (up to day 43). The primary immunogenicity objective was to describe the neutralising antibody titres to the D614G variant 14 days after the second vaccination (day 36) in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naive who received both injections, provided samples at day 1 and day 36, did not have protocol deviations, and did not receive an authorised COVID-19 vaccine before day 36. Neutralising antibodies were measured using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay and are presented here up to 14 days after the second dose. As a secondary immunogenicity objective, we assessed neutralising antibodies in non-naive participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04762680) and is closed to new participants for the cohort reported here.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Of 722 participants enrolled and randomly assigned between Feb 24, 2021, and March 8, 2021, 721 received at least one injection (low dose=240, medium dose=239, and high dose=242). The proportion of participants reporting at least one solicited adverse reaction (injection site or systemic) in the first 7 days after any vaccination was similar between treatment groups (217 [91%] of 238 in the low-dose group, 213 [90%] of 237 in the medium-dose group, and 218 [91%] of 239 in the high-dose group); these adverse reactions were transient, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and occurred at a higher frequency and intensity after the second vaccination. Four participants reported immediate unsolicited adverse events; two (one each in the low-dose group and medium-dose group) were considered by the investigators to be vaccine related and two (one each in the low-dose and high-dose groups) were considered unrelated. Five participants reported seven vaccine-related medically attended adverse events (two in the low-dose group, one in the medium-dose group, and four in the high-dose group). No vaccine-related serious adverse events and no adverse events of special interest were reported. Among participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 at day 36, 158 (98%) of 162 in the low-dose group, 166 (99%) of 168 in the medium-dose group, and 163 (98%) of 166 in the high-dose group had at least a two-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres to the D614G variant from baseline. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) at day 36 for participants who were naive were 2189 (95% CI 1744–2746) for the low-dose group, 2269 (1792–2873) for the medium-dose group, and 2895 (2294–3654) for the high-dose group. GMT ratios (day 36: day 1) were 107 (95% CI 85–135) in the low-dose group, 110 (87–140) in the medium-dose group, and 141 (111–179) in the high-dose group. Neutralising antibody titres in non-naive adults 21 days after one injection tended to be higher than titres after two injections in adults who were naive, with GMTs 21 days after one injection for participants who were non-naive being 3143 (95% CI 836–11 815) in the low-dose group, 2338 (593–9226) in the medium-dose group, and 7069 (1361–36 725) in the high-dose group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Two injections of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 showed acceptable safety and reactogenicity, and robust immunogenicity in adults who were SARS-CoV-2 naive and non-naive. These results supported progression to phase 3 evaluation of the 10 7mu;g antigen dose for primary vaccination and a 5 7mu;g antigen dose for booster vaccination.</p>

                  <p id="para40">We searched PubMed from database inception up to Sept 27, 2021, with no language restrictions, for studies reporting the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 using the search terms “vaccine”, “clinical trial”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “recombinant AND protein”, and “adjuvant”. Among published trials, one phase 1 study showed acceptable safety and immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine containing MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein (NCT04495933), and a phase 1–2 safety and immunogenicity trial (NCT04368988) and a phase 2 efficacy trial (NCT04533399) showed that the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (containing recombinant spike protein adjuvanted with matrix-M1 adjuvant) had an acceptable safety profile and was effective against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, including in patients who were HIV positive and against cases caused by the beta (B.1.351) variant. Although not retrieved in our search, a recently published phase 3 trial in 14 039 participants reported a vaccine efficacy of 89·7% against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine and high efficacy against the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant (EudraCT number 2020-004123-16). Another protein-subunit vaccine candidate containing a stabilised trimeric form of the spike protein combined with either AS03 or CpG with alum adjuvants has also shown acceptable safety and immunogenicity in phase 1 evaluation (NCT04405908). Preliminary data for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (including a virus-like particle vaccine manufactured in plants) have additionally shown evidence of acceptable safety and promising immunogenicity profiles when adjuvanted with the AS03 adjuvant system. In a Phase 1–2 study (NCT04537208), we previously evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein candidate vaccine, CoV2 preS dTM, combined with the AS03 adjuvant system or AF03 adjuvant, at two different antigen doses in healthy adults (aged 18 years or older). Interim data from that study enabled the selection of a two-injection schedule and the AS03 adjuvant for further clinical development, although lower-than-expected antibody responses, particularly in older adults, and higher-than-expected reactogenicity were observed. These were hypothesised to be caused by the formulations tested having lower-than-planned antigen doses and higher-than-anticipated host-cell protein content. Therefore, there was a need to optimise the vaccine formulation.</p>

                  <p id="para60">The current phase 2 study showed an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile, and favourable immune responses, of two injections of optimised CoV2 preS dTM formulations adjuvanted with AS03, at three different antigen doses (5 7mu;g, 10 7mu;g, or 15 7mu;g CoV2 preS dTM antigen), in adults who were SARS-CoV-2 naive and non-naive, including those in high-risk groups (ie, aged ≥60 years or with pre-existing medical conditions, or both). Our findings supported progression of the 10 7mu;g dose formulation to phase 3 efficacy evaluation (NCT04904549). Furthermore, given the high neutralising antibody titres and acceptable safety profile after a single vaccine dose observed in participants with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, we are evaluating the lower antigen dose (5 7mu;g) for use as a booster vaccine (NCT04762680).</p>

This adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine, using a well established vaccine-manufacturing platform with favourable cold-chain requirements (distribution at 2–8°C), offers an alternative to currently approved vaccines.</p>

                <p id="para130">A randomisation list was generated by an independent group with planned randomisation and a built-in interactive response technology system before the start of enrolment. The randomisation had three stratification factors, comprising age group (18–59 years and ≥60 years), baseline SARS-CoV-2 rapid serodiagnostic test positivity (positive or negative by COVID-19 immunoglobulin [Ig]G and IgM Rapid Test Cassette; Healgen Scientific, Houston, TX, USA), and high-risk medical conditions (yes or no). Within each stratum, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio, with a block size of six, to receive two injections (on day 1 and day 22) of 5 μg (low dose), 10 μg (medium dose), or 15 μg (high dose) of CoV2 preS dTM antigen, with a fixed dose of AS03 adjuvant. A subset of participants who tested negative with the SARS-CoV-2 rapid serodiagnostic test were additionally stratified by age and study group and randomly assigned to provide samples for assessment of cell-mediated immunity and mucosal antibodies.</p>

An equal volume of the adjuvant emulsion was added to the vial containing the antigen and mixed before injection. Vaccinations (0·5 mL per dose) were administered by qualified and trained study personnel by intramuscular injection into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
                <p id="para160">Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected before each vaccination to establish whether participants had past or present SARS-CoV-2 infection (naive or non-naive). Participants were classified as naive or non-naive at day 1 and day 22 or day 1 or day 22 by assessment of blood samples using Elecsys electrochemiluminescence immunoassays for detection of anti-S antibodies (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) on study day 1 and for detection of anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 N; Roche) on study days 1 and 22; and detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs using nucleic-acid amplification tests (NAAT; Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay; Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA) on study days 1 and 22. Analyses were done according to the manufacturers' instructions. We defined participants as naive to SARS-CoV-2 on study days 1 and 22 if they tested negative for anti-S antibodies on study day 1 and for both anti-nucleocapsid antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids on days 1 and 22; we defined participants as non-naive if they tested positive on at least one of the three tests on study days 1, 22, or both <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">(appendix p 5)</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para170">Blood samples will be collected from participants at all study visits up to day 387 for immunogenicity assessments; immunogenicity assessments at day 1, day 22, and day 36 are presented here. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising-antibody titres against the D614G variant and the beta (B.1.351) variant were measured with a pseudovirus neutralisation assay, using HIV-1 pseudovirions expressing the full-length S protein of the respective variant,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> at Monogram Biosciences LabCorp (South San Francisco, CA, USA). The pseudovirus neutralisation assay is described in detail in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>. Neutralising antibody titres were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution resulting in 50% neutralisation. Binding antibody profiles were assessed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 anti-S protein IgG antibodies with an indirect ELISA (Nexelis, Laval, Canada), as described previously.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The reference standard (006/GCN4/Std/01/2020) was prepared by pooling four 5 mL samples of COVID-19 convalescent serum (Quebec, Canada) from patients with no symptoms at least 14 days after infection. We established unitage in EU/mL, on the basis of the geometric mean of the half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) from 69 valid standard curves, as an arbitrary concentration of 1142 EU/mL. Neutralising antibody and binding antibody responses to D614G were measured in all participants on day 1, day 22, and day 36. Neutralising antibody responses to the beta variant were measured at day 36.</p>
                <p id="para180">Whole blood samples were stimulated ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2 S antigen (spike-GCN4; Nexelis), using the TruCulture system (Rules-Based Medicine, Austin, TX, USA) as described previously.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> A microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (TruCulture OptiMAP assay; Rules-Based Medicine) was used to evaluate specific concentrations of interferon γ (IFNγ), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 on validated cytokine-profiling panels. Reaction plates were analysed on a Luminex platform (Luminex Corporation, Austin, Texas, USA), and cytokine concentrations were calculated with adapted software (Rules-Based Medicine plate reader version 2.1.5.8; plate viewer version 5.1.1.2) using a standard curve for specific cytokine production at each timepoint.</p>

                <p id="para200">The primary safety objective was to describe the safety profile in all participants, for each candidate vaccine formulation. In this interim analysis, we describe primary safety endpoints up to day 43 (21 days after the second injection), which included unsolicited systemic adverse events within 30 min of each injection, solicited injection-site reactions (pain, erythema, and swelling) and solicited systemic reactions (fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and chills) up to 7 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events up to 21 days after the last injection, and medically attended adverse events, SAEs, and adverse events of special interest throughout the study. Adverse events of special interest included anaphylactic reactions, generalised convulsions, thrombocytopenia, and potential immune-mediated disorders.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Secondary safety objectives (to be presented elsewhere) were laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 and serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
                <p id="para210">The primary immunogenicity objective was to describe the neutralising antibody response to the D614G variant 14 days after the second vaccination (on day 36) in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naive. Secondary immunogenicity objectives included assessing binding antibody responses in naive participants and binding antibody and neutralising antibody responses in participants who were non-naive. Antibody responses were described on the basis of geometric mean titres (GMTs) for neutralising antibodies or geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for binding antibodies. We calculated GMT ratios (GMTRs) and GMC ratios (GMCRs) for after vaccination (day 36) versus prevaccination (day 1), proportions of participants with at least two-fold or four-fold rises in antibody titres from baseline at each postvaccination timepoint, and proportions of responders. Among participants who had neutralising antibody titres below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at baseline, responders were defined as those with at least a two-fold increase in titres after vaccination relative to day 1. In participants with baseline titres higher than the LLOQ, responders were those with at least a four-fold increase in titres after vaccination relative to day 1. Prevaccination titres below the assay's LLOQ (1:40) were assigned a value of half the LLOQ.</p>
                <p id="para220">For cell-mediated immune responses (an exploratory objective), fold rises in individual cytokines at day 36 from day 1 and at day 22 from day 1 were calculated by dividing the day 22 or day 36 measurement by the day 1 measurement; the ratios of fold rises for cytokine pairs (eg, IFNγ to IL-4) and their 95% CIs were computed. Other exploratory immunogenicity objectives, to be presented elsewhere, included the assessment of the ratio of neutralising to binding antibodies and the evaluation of mucosal antibody responses. We also assessed the neutralising antibody responses on day 36 to the beta variant as an exploratory objective.</p>
                <p id="para230">In a post-hoc analysis, neutralising antibody and binding antibody responses against the D614G variant were measured in a panel of human convalescent-serum samples (Sanguine Biobank, Waltham, MA, USA; iSpecimen, Lexington, MA, USA; PPD, Wilmington, NC, USA; 79 samples) using the same assays that were used on the participant serum samples, in the same laboratory, and within a contemporaneous timeframe to minimise assay variability over time.

Assuming an attrition rate of 15% and capping the proportion of those testing positive by the SARS-CoV-2 rapid serodiagnostic test at 20% of the study population, a total study size of 720 participants (240 in each group) was planned.</p>
                <p id="para250">Safety endpoints were assessed in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and whose data were analysed according to the vaccine actually received. Immunogenicity was assessed in the per-protocol analysis set, which comprised participants who received both injections, provided blood samples at day 1 and day 36, did not have prespecified protocol deviations, and did not receive an authorised COVID-19 vaccine before day 36; data were analysed according to the vaccine group to which participants were randomly assigned. The full analysis set included all participants who received at least one study injection. Cell-mediated immunity was analysed in a randomly selected subset of the per-protocol analysis set.

              <p id="para440">Almost all (≥97%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naive attained a four-fold rise in neutralising antibody titres to the D614G variant at day 36, regardless of age strata, presence of high-risk medical condition, or antigen dose. The magnitude of the neutralising antibody response observed at day 36 in the naive study population was similar to that observed for a panel of human convalescent sera. Early phase studies of other candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have also shown similar results for vaccine-elicited antibody titres and those measured in convalescent plasma samples,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which supported their further clinical development to efficacy trials; however, direct comparisons with other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are not possible at this time because different laboratories and different assays were used. Among adults who were non-naive in our study, a single injection increased D614G neutralising-antibody titres to concentrations higher than those observed after two injections in adults who were naive and exceeded those measured in the convalescent sera. Our findings are in line with the robust antibody responses previously observed after a single dose of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> It is interesting to note the variability in responses after the first dose in participants who were non-naive, potentially because of the variability in previous infection and priming, as well as in the duration of the interval between infection and vaccination.</p>
              <p id="para450">Information regarding correlates of protection is scarce.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, recent work has modelled the correlation between the ratio of neutralising antibody responses in vaccinees to convalescent sera and the observed vaccine efficacy to account for differences across assays and convalescent sera.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In these models, ratios of 1 correlate with vaccine efficacy of 80–90% and ratios of 0·8 correlate with vaccine efficacy of 70–80%. These models were based on neutralising antibody responses and efficacy against homologous variants, or variants with small drifts. In the current study, the ratio of neutralising antibody titres to convalescent sera ranged from 1·38 to 2·40 across groups among the younger adults who were naive, and between 0·65 and 0·81 among the older adults who were naive. The lower responses to the beta variant seen in our study, consistent with data from other authorised or investigational COVID vaccines,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> suggest neutralising antibody titres and predicted vaccine efficacy against heterologous variants are likely to be lower.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> These comparisons with convalescent sera should be interpreted with caution because they are exploratory and we have scarce information on the donors of the convalescent sera used in this study.</p>
              <p id="para460">On the basis of the interim data described here, the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 candidate vaccine has progressed to phase 3 efficacy evaluation (NCT04904549). As the reactogenicity and safety profiles were similar across antigen dose groups, the choice of antigen dose to progress to phase 3 efficacy evaluation was largely dependent on the observed immunogenicity profile in adults who were naive. The selection of a 10 7mu;g S antigen dose for a monovalent vaccine, over the 5 7mu;g dose, might mitigate the potential effect of variant circulation because it provides higher cross-reactive antibody titres against variant strains in individuals who are naive, albeit we did not observe a clear dose–response relationship to the beta variant. On the basis of the above-mentioned models of predicted vaccine efficacy curves, we would expect any potential difference in vaccine protection between antigen dose groups to be limited. Furthermore, in the context of a pandemic, a lower antigen dose would translate into a substantial increase in vaccine supply. In the phase 3 study, a bivalent AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 5 7mu;g D614G antigen and 5 7mu;g beta antigen is being evaluated. Because the 5 7mu;g dose in the naive population in this study provided homologous neutralising-antibody responses similar to convalescent sera, it is expected that a similar homologous response would be elicited by the beta component of a bivalent vaccine.</p>
              <p id="para470">Fractionation of doses has been suggested as an important strategy for meeting global vaccine demand,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> particularly for booster vaccines. The robust neutralising antibody responses observed after a single injection of the 5 7mu;g antigen-dose formulation in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 non-naive suggest that a single dose of 5 7mu;g CoV2 preS dTM antigen with AS03 adjuvant might be sufficient for boosting previously primed individuals. This phase 2 study has been amended to include cohorts of previously vaccinated individuals to evaluate a single 5 7mu;g antigen dose as a booster vaccine.</p>
              <p id="para480">The number of participants in this study limited the assessment of rare SAEs and adverse events of special interest, although continued follow-up and the large sample size recruited for the subsequent phase 3 study will provide a robust dataset for further safety evaluation. Although we report neutralising antibody responses to the beta variant, a major variant of concern at the time we designed the study, we acknowledge that we have not evaluated neutralising antibody responses to either the delta variant or the omicron variant, which have since become the dominant circulating variants of concern. Other limitations include that information on the durability of the immune response is not available from this interim analysis, and that antigen doses lower than 5 7mu;g, which could be of interest for boosting primed individuals, were not evaluated here.</p>
              <p id="para490">In summary, two doses of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine candidate showed an acceptable safety profile and robust immunogenicity in adults who were naive to SARS-CoV-2, including in individuals aged 60 years and older and those with high-risk medical conditions. On the basis of these results, two formulations of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine candidate, a monovalent D614G and a bivalent D614G and a beta variant vaccine, are undergoing efficacy evaluation in phase 3 trials. Furthermore, the high neutralising titres and acceptable safety after a single vaccine dose observed in participants with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection indicate the possibility of developing a formulation with a lower antigen dose, and a single-dose vaccination strategy, for use as a booster for adults who have been previously primed.</p>
