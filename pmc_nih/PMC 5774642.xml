                <p id="P3">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 mediate potent effects in relapsed/refractory pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) but antigen loss is a frequent cause of resistance to CD19-targeted immunotherapy. CD22 is also expressed on most B-ALL and usually retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase I trial testing a novel CD22-CAR in twenty-one children and adults, including 17 previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose dependent anti-leukemic activity was observed with complete remission in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving ≥ 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD22-CART cells/kg, including 5/5 patients with CD19dim/neg B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted escape from killing by CD22-CART cells. These results are the first to eastablish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in pre-B cell ALL, including in leukemia resistant to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating comparable potency to CD19-CART at biologically active doses in B-ALL. They also highlight the critical role played by antigen density in regulating CAR function. (Funded by NCI Intramural Research Program)</p>

                <p id="P8">The first twenty-one consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL treated with CD22 CAR T cells are included in this analysis. The median age was 19 years (range 7–30 years), and all patients had undergone at least 1 prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 2 patients had received 2 prior HSCTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Seventeen patients had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 15 who received prior CD19-CAR therapy. Lymphoblasts were CD19-negative or dim in 10 patients, including 9 following CD19-CAR therapy and 1 following blinatumomab. Median marrow blast percentage was 70.5% (range 1%-99%) and all were CNS1 (&lt; 5 WBC/mcL and no blasts). Median CD22 site density was 2839 molecules per cell (range 613–13452).

Protocol-defined (supplemental methods) grade 1 CRS occurred in 9 patients and grade 2 CRS occurred in 7 patients. Patient #2 experienced grade 3 self-limited, non-infectious, diarrhea during CRS which resolved with supportive care, but resulted in a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the first dose level requiring a protocol-specified expansion of the first dose level to 6 patients with no further DLTs observed. Three patients received dose level 2 (1×10<sup>6</sup>/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg) with no evidence of DLT. Two patients then proceeded to dose level 3 (3 × 10<sup>6</sup>/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg), and patient #10 developed dose limiting grade 4 hypoxia associated with rapid disease progression requiring brief intubation with complete resolution of the hypoxia within 24 hours after initiation of steroids. A second patient was safely treated at this dose level without DLT. Based on the single DLT at dose level 3 and clinical activity associated with significant CD22-CAR T cell expansion and persistence at dose level 2, 1×10<sup>6</sup>/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg was identified as the recommended phase II dose and the cohort was expanded to ten additional patients (n=13 total at dose level 2). One subject (patient #14) with a pre-enrollment history of multi-organ failure due to sepsis, died from gram negative rod sepsis developing after resolution of CRS and neutrophil count recovery to &gt;1000 cells/mcL. Prospective neurotoxicity evaluations demonstrated no irreversible neurotoxicity or seizure. Amongst the first 16 patients with complete assessments, transient visual hallucinations (n=2), mild unresponsiveness (n=1), mild disorientation (n=1) and mild-moderate pain (n=2) were observed but returned to baseline by day 28 post-infusion.

CAR-T cells remained detectable in the blood of 7 of 9 patients evaluated 3 months post-infusion, in 2 of 3 patients evaluated at 6 months post-infusion, and in one patient each evaluated 9 and 18 months post-infusion who were in ongoing remission at these timepoints.</p>

Among patients receiving ≥ 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD22-CAR/kg, complete remissions occurred in 9/10 patients who had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 5/5 who enrolled with CD19dim/neg B-ALL and 1 patient who was refractory to both CD19-CAR and blinatumomab (patient #11). Thus, we saw no evidence that previous CD19-directed immunotherapy or diminished expression of CD19 impacted response to CD22-CAR T cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates response in patient #2 whose leukemia had dim CD19 expression with substantial disease burden and experienced an MRD negative complete remission following infusion of 3×10<sup>5</sup> CAR T cells/kg.

Eight patients relapsed 1.5–12 mos (median 6 months) post CD22-CAR infusion and relapse was associated with diminished CD22 expression in 7 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Illustrative examples include patient #9, who enrolled with CD19 negative leukemia and experienced relapse 6 months following CD22-CAR therapy with blasts that were negative for both CD19 and CD22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Two patients who enrolled after receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin experienced early relapse including Patient #11, who relapsed at 1.5 mos following anti-CD22-CAR infusion with low but variable CD22 expression on leukemic blasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and patient #15 with CD19 negative leukemia following CD19-CAR therapy who relapsed with variable dim to negative CD22 expression 2 months following CD22-CAR infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), despite high-levels of circulating CD22-CAR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P15">Rather than the persistent and complete absence of target that has been reported following CD19 directed immunotherapy due to preferential expression of CD19 splice variants in resistant leukemia lacking the targeted epitope<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, we observed a pattern of acquired resistance to CD22-CAR associated with diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>) CD22 site density assessed by flow cytometry as described in Methods. To determine whether diminished CD22 site density may have had a causal role in relapse in this setting by enabling escape from CD22-CAR T cells, we assessed functionality of the CD22-CAR against NALM6 derived cell lines engineered to express varying CD22 site densities reflecting the range observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). IFN-gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) production by CD22-CAR T cells was reduced following exposure to NALM6 expressing low CD22 density corresponding to levels observed at the time of relapse in patients following CD22-CAR therapy. Finally, although CD22 CAR T cells delay <italic>in vivo</italic> progression of CD22lo ALL, leukemia progression eventually ensues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results implicate diminished CD22 expression on B-ALL as a mechanism for relapse following CD22-CAR therapy.</p>
                <p id="P16">To identify possible genetic or transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the observed alteration in CD22 site density, longitudinal assessment of the CD22 genomic locus and corresponding mRNA was evaluated in two patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR with diminished CD22 site density. Genome-wide copy number profiles of the leukemias remained stable despite substantial changes in CD22 site density. Heterozygosity of the CD22 locus was maintained and no focal copy number changes were observed. Mutation analysis comparing the pre-treatment and post-treatment samples demonstrated no aquired mutations within the CD22 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). Corresponding analysis of CD22 mRNA levels pre- and post-CD22 CAR treatment demonstrated no qualitative change in the observed CD22 transcripts, and no evidence for diminished transcription of CD22, since in each case, total CD22 mRNA levels were slightly increased at the time that CD22 site density was diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). We saw no evidence for alternative CD22 isoforms as a cause of the downmodulation of CD22 expression observed although a novel isoform cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, we studied a patient derived xenograft model in mice subjected to pressure with CD22-CAR T cells which induced complete loss of CD22 surface expression. Remarkably, such leukemias again showed no evidence for genetic mutation, changes in gene copy number or isoform expression and no evidence for diminished mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Together, the data implicate post-transcriptional effects in modulating CD22 protein levels rather genomic mutation, modulation of gene expression or altered isoform expression.</p>

The results presented here credential a novel CAR-based therapeutic for the treatment of B-ALL, but also illustrate the challenges associated with sequential administration of CD19 CAR followed by CD22 CAR therapy.

Using a single CAR construct that incorporates both CD19 and CD22 scFv sequences into one bivalent receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), we demonstrate <italic>in vitro</italic> cytokine production against and killing of CD19+/CD22+, CD19+/CD22−, and CD22−CD19+ cell B-ALL cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>).

A recent phase 3 trial of inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 mAb conjugated to the toxin calicheamicin, demonstrated complete responses in 80.7% of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, liver toxicity limited the dose intensity that could be safely delivered and the agent is associated with higher rates of veno-occlusive disease following subsequent HSCT.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P19">We generated a novel CAR targeting CD22, which we optimized by comparing potency across multiple scFvs and multiple costimulatory domains.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Therapeutics incorporating the m971 binding domain<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> have not been tested previously in clinical trials. The data presented here demonstrate no evidence for off-target toxicity, modest cytokine release syndrome and potent anti-leukemic activity following CD22-CAR therapy. Doses ≥ 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD22-CAR cells/kg mediated substantial anti-leukemic activity, comparable to results with CD19-CAR, with 11/15 patients rendered into complete remission, including 8/10 patients previously treated with CD19 based immunotherapies, and 5/5 patients who enrolled with CD19 neg/dim relapse. Notably, all patients enrolled had undergone previous HSCT and patient #7 who had undergone two previous HSCTs prior to receiving CD22 CAR T-cells, remains in remission 21 months following CD22-CAR therapy with persistent CAR T cells and has received no additional anti-leukemic therapy since treatment with CD22-CAR T cells. Together, the data provides no evidence to suggest that previous chemotherapy or CD19-based immunotherapy diminishes the likelihood of remission induction following bioactive doses of CD22-CAR T cells. The CD22-CAR studied here incorporates a 4-1BB costimulatory endodomain, and the cells demonstrate a pattern of expansion and persistence that is similar to that observed following CD19-CAR T cells incorporating a 4-1BB endodomain, consistent with previous evidence that CAR costimulatory domains play a dominant role in modulating the rate of expansion and the likelihood of persistence following CAR therapy.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> CD22-CAR cells also migrated efficiently to the CSF, but we observed no evidence for severe neurologic toxicity or seizures, which have been observed in studies of CD19-CAR therapy.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P20">CARs targeting CD19 have demonstrated remarkable activity in B-ALL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and we demonstrate similar complete response rates in B-ALL with the CD22-CAR tested here. This is notable since numerous non-CD19 targeted CARs have entered clinical trials for B cell malignancies, (CD20-CAR<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, κ-CAR<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, CD138-CAR<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, BCMA-CAR<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>), AML<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and solid tumors, yet none of these have demonstrated complete responses rates of &gt;50%. This work therefore provides the first evidence that CD19 is not a uniquely effective CAR T cell target and raise the prospect that similarly effective CARs could ultimately be developed for an array of antigenic targets. Future studies are needed to determine whether the high rates observed with CD22-CARs in B-ALL will translate into similarly significant response rates in DLBCL, where CD22 expression is common.</p>
              <p id="P21">CD19 is universally expressed at high levels on B-ALL at the time of diagnosis and is retained following cytotoxic therapy.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> However, since the introduction of CD19-based immunotherapies, relapse with diminished or absent surface CD19 has been increasingly observed and has emerged as the dominant mechanism of resistance to this class of therapeutics. CD19 immune escape was first reported following blinatumumab therapy<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, but has now been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In a recent report of 50 patients rendered into remission with CD19-CAR therapy, with a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 40% of patients had relapsed, and loss of the CD19 target accounted for 65% of the total relapses.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Thus, while the true incidence is unknown, CD19 immune escape is emerging as the most common cause of relapse following CD19-CAR therapy for B-ALL. Recent investigation into the biology of “CD19 negative B-ALL” has revealed that the majority of cases retain mRNA specific for CD19, but are enriched for CD19 isoforms that preferentially remain intracellular and/or lack the epitopes targeted by all CD19-CARs currently under study as well as blinatumumab.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> An alternative pathway for loss or diminished CD19 expression involves lineage switch of blasts with acquisition of myeloid markers and characteristics.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> None of the patients enrolled on this study appeared to manifest CD19 loss associated with lineage switch.</p>
              <p id="P22">The data presented here demonstrate that diminished CD22 site density, rather than total loss of expression, is sufficient to permit escape of leukemia from CD22-directed CAR therapy. This is not unique to the CD22-CAR, but rather reflects a pattern observed across chimeric antigen receptors, which demonstrate a higher requirement for antigen induced activation than is seen for native T cell receptors<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Decrease in CD22 site density or complete CD22 loss were observed in 7/8 patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR induced remission. Given that CD22 expression is often variable at presentation, it appears likely that this phenomena represents selection of pre-existing CD22lo cells within the heterogeneous leukemia population. Notably, we identified no genetic basis for the change in expression level and no evidence for diminished mRNA levels in leukemic cells demonstrating low CD22 site density, thus implicating post-transcriptional mechanisms in this biology. Regardless of the mechanism, decades of experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy for B-ALL have convincingly established that multimodal chemotherapy is required to achieve long-term remission. Based on clear evidence for CD19 antigen loss or downregulation following CD19-directed immunotherapy, and evidence for diminished CD22 expression contributing to relapse following sequential CAR therapy, we propose that simultaneous immunotherapeutic targeting of multiple antigens may diminish the likelihood of antigen loss escape. Proof-of-principle for bioactivity of a multispecific CD19/CD22-CAR in mice is demonstrated here.</p>
              <p id="P23">The majority of patients who develop CD19 immune escape following CD19 directed immunotherapy retain CD22 expression and this report demonstrates that such leukemias retain susceptible to immune-based targeting. Furthermore, while we demonstrate proof-of principle that sequential immunotherapeutic targeting of a second antigen can mediate clinical benefit, we also observe a high rate of relapse associated with diminution in CD22 expression using this approach, raising the prospect that simultaneous multispecific targeting may be a more effective approach to enhance the durability of immunotherapy-induced remissions in B-ALL. Toward this end, we have developed a chimeric antigen receptor that simultaneously targets both CD19 and CD22, which could prove more effective at inducing remissions and be less susceptible to relapse associated with antigen escape<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>.

                <p id="P25">This Phase I, first-in-human, dose escalation trial conducted at the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute was designed to test the safety and feasibility of CD22-CAR T cell therapy in children and young adults, aged 1–30 years, with relapsed or refractory CD22 expressing hematopoietic malignancies which had not responded to or had recurred following standard regimens. The protocol was approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board and the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (NCT02315612). All authors reviewed, discussed and interpreted the study results and vouch for the data and analyses. Written informed consent for participation was obtained from patients or the parents according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.. This report represents an interim analysis from the first, consecutively treated 21 patients with pre-B ALL who received CD22-CAR T cell infusions between December 2014 and August 2016 with a data cut-off of June 1, 2017. A total of 23 subjects were enrolled, but in one case T lymphocyte numbers were inadequate for CAR cell production and thus this patient was not treated on study; in a second case the diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which is not included in this analysis of efficacy in B-ALL.</p>
                <p id="P26">A standard 3 + 3 Phase I dose escalation design was used. If 2/6 patients experienced a DLT at dose level 1, safety would have been evaluated in a de-escalated dose of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> transduced T cells/kg. Once the maximum tolerated dose (or highest level evaluated) was reached, enrollment into an expansion cohort of a total of 12 patients in two strata proceeded to provide additional information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment. In the expansion cohort, patients who have previously received CD19-CAR T cells will be evaluated as a separate stratum from CAR-naïve patients. All doses allowed a range of ± 20% of the prescribed dose to allow for potential variations in the cell products.</p>
                <p id="P27">Dose limiting toxicity was defined as any ≥ Grade 3 toxicity attributed as possibly, probably, or likely related to either the lymphodepletion regimen or the CD22-CAR T cells with exception of low electrolyte levels responding to supplementation, tumor lysis syndrome, hypoalbuminemia, liver dysfunction resolved to &lt; grade 2 within 14 days, transient (&lt; 72 hours) grade 4 hepatic enzyme abnormality, pre-existing coagulopathy, grade 3 or 4 fever lasting 7 days or less, grade 3 diarrhea that resolves to grade 2 within 4 days, grade 3 nausea and/or anorexia and any infusion related toxicity occurring within 24 hours that would resolve with minimal intervention. and grade 3 cytokine release syndrome.

This laboratory operates under principles of Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice with established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or protocols for sample receipt, processing, freezing, and analysis. All patients underwent leukapheresis within 5 days following enrollment. Leukapheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cells were either placed directly into culture or cryopreserved prior to culture initiation on a subsequent day. In cases where substantial numbers of myeloid cells were present in the apheresis products, elutriation and/or plastic adherence<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> was performed based on evidence that such cells inhibited expansion<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>.

                <p id="P39">CD22 and CD19 site density on blasts was enumerated by flow cytometry according to manufacturer's instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The antibody bound per cell (ABC) was determined as previously described<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> for anti-CD19PE (clone SJ25C1) and anti-CD22PE (clone S-HCL-1) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on leukemic blasts using saturating concentrations of antibody and the BD Biosciences QuantiBRITE system (QuantiBRITE standard beads and QuantiCALC software) for fluorescence quantitation. The ABC value represents the mean value of the maximum capacity of each cell to bind the antibody. QuantiBRITE PE beads are pre-calibrated standard beads containing known numbers of PE molecules bound per bead. QuantiBRITE beads were acquired on a FACSCanto™II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on the same day at the same instrument settings as the individual patient specimens. A standard curve comparing the geometric mean of fluorescence to known PE content of the Quanti-BRITE beads was constructed using QuantiCALC software. The regression analysis, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient were determined. By gating based upon immunophenotype, blasts were distinguished from normal cells and the geometric mean fluorescence of CD19 and CD22 staining was reported for each population. The ABC values were generated from the measured geometric mean fluorescence of the gated cells using the QuantiBRITE standard curve. ABC values were only determined for populations containing 100 or greater events to achieve adequate precision. The geometric mean fluorescence of T- and NK-cells stained with the B-cell antibodies (negative control) has been previously determined and the negative ABC range is used to confirm positivity versus negativity. In addition, blasts with anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 staining less than or equal to T-cells (internal negative control) are considered negative.</p>
