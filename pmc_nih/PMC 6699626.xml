                <p id="P5">Immunologic responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients occur rapidly with pharmacodynamic T cell responses detectable in blood by 3 weeks. It is unclear, however, whether these early blood-based observations translate to the tumor microenvironment. We conducted a study of neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in stage III/IV melanoma. We hypothesized that immune reinvigoration in the tumor would be detectable at 3 weeks and this response would correlate with disease-free survival. We identified a rapid and potent anti-tumor response, with 8/27 patients experiencing a complete or major pathological response after a single dose of anti-PD-1, all of whom remain disease-free. These rapid pathologic and clinical responses were associated with accumulation of exhausted CD8 T cells in the tumor at 3 weeks with reinvigoration in the blood observed as early as 1 week. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated a pre-treatment immune signature (Neoadjuvant Response Signature) that was associated with clinical benefit. In contrast, patients with disease recurrence displayed mechanisms of resistance including immune suppression, mutational escape, and/or tumor evolution. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment is effective in high-risk resectable stage III/IV melanoma. Pathological response and immunological analyses after a single neoadjuvant dose can be used to predict clinical outcome and to dissect underlying mechanisms in checkpoint blockade.</p>

              <p id="P6">Clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapies can occur rapidly<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. A pharmacodynamic response including reinvigoration of exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells (T<sub>EX</sub>) can be detected in blood of cancer patients after a single dose<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. However, the precise type(s) of T cells in the tumor that respond to anti-PD-1 remains poorly understood. Moreover, whereas early immunological responses to checkpoint blockade are observed at 3 weeks in blood, the kinetics of immune reinvigoration in the tumor and the relationship to pathological response and clinical outcomes are unclear.</p>
              <p id="P7">We conducted a neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-PD-1 clinical trial in stage III/IV resectable melanoma. This approach provided early on-treatment tumor tissue at resection and insights into the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade. Our study demonstrated the clinical feasibility of neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma, and identified a rapid pathological and immunologic response in tumors. Complete pathological responses could be identified by 3 weeks and correlated with disease-free survival. Data from early on-treatment resected tumor indicate that T<sub>EX</sub>, but not bystander cells, are a major responding cell type. Studies in an additional cohort identified reinvigoration of T<sub>EX</sub> as early as day 7 after the first dose of anti-PD-1. Finally, in patients who developed disease recurrence, potential mechanisms of resistance were identified.</p>

              <p id="P8">A pharmacodynamic immune response can be detected in blood 3 weeks after initiation of PD-1 blockade<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. To understand the early effects of anti-PD-1 in tumors, we conducted an investigator initiated clinical trial of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) in stage IIIB/C or IV melanoma. All patients underwent baseline pre-treatment biopsy and received a single dose of pembrolizumab (200 milligrams), followed by complete resection three weeks later and adjuvant therapy (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and treated; (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Patients proceeded to surgical resection at three weeks (median 21 days, range 17-42). Median interval between surgery and initiation of adjuvant pembrolizumab was 23 days (range 13-39). There were no unexpected adverse events (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 2</xref>); the rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events not attributed to pembrolizumab or to surgery alone was not higher than 30%, the prespecified safety endpoint (observed rate was 0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, z test). There were no unexpected delays in surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab, or unexpected surgical complications.</p>
              <p id="P9">We assessed the pathologic response after one dose of pembrolizumab in the resection specimens of 27 patients available at time of data cut-off. Resected tumor had features of completely viable, mixed viable and necrotic, or completely necrotic tumor upon gross examination (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). On histologic assessment, 8 of 27 patients (29.6%, 95% CI 13.8–50.2%) had a complete (no residual tumor identified; n=5) or major (10% or less viable tumor cells; n=3) pathologic response<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The median duration of follow-up for disease-free survival (DFS) was 25 months; median DFS has not been reached. The 1-year DFS rate ± SE was 63% ± 9% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P10">Approximately 30% of patients had a complete or major pathologic response after one dose of pembrolizumab, consistent with a recent neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 clinical trial in melanoma that observed a pCR of 25% after 4 doses of nivolumab<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In 20 patients with paired pre- and post-treatment tumor samples, the percentage of viable tumor significantly decreased after treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). All patients with complete or major pathologic responses remain disease-free (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>); viable tumor ≤10% at resection was associated with a low risk of recurrence independent of stage (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). LDH, BRAF status, and tumor burden (unidimensional tumor diameter) were not associated with recurrence (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). In 20 patients with paired samples, a single dose of pembrolizumab significantly increased the fraction of patients with brisk TIL (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 4</xref>; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) which was also associated with complete or major pathologic response (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref>; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>) and significantly improved disease-free survival (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 3</xref>; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P11">We examined a subset of 6 patients that had early imaging at 3 weeks (trial UPCC11615). <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography - computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) scans were performed at baseline and prior to surgical resection; images were analyzed per RECIST 1.1. Consistent with the pathological responses, radiographic responses were observed after one dose of anti-PD-1. In 3 patients, we observed a ≥20% decrease in tumor diameter and these patients remained recurrence free (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the 3 patients without evidence of tumor shrinkage at 3 weeks had recurrences. Changes in tumor size at 3 weeks correlated with the percentage of viable tumor observed histologically (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>-<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). However, changes in FDG avidity were not associated with response (<bold>Data not shown</bold>). The percentage of viable tumor at 3 weeks was correlated with a change in tumor dimensions by imaging and recurrence status which were both inversely correlated with TIL infiltration (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>-<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P12">Given the rapid pathological effects of anti-PD-1, we hypothesized that the reinvigoration of anti-tumor immune responses might occur before 3 weeks. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence of expansion of CD39+ exhausted phenotype CD8 T cells 9 days after anti-PD-1<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. We conducted an additional trial of anti-PD-1 (UPCC02616) with blood collected at day 7 after initiation of therapy. We observed robust increases in Ki67+ CD8 T cells at day 7; the responding cells were PD1+ and enriched for cells that co-expressed PD-1 and CTLA-4 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>-<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). This response peaked at day 7 and then declined. Analysis of the Ki67+ cells at day 7 and week 3 showed similarity in expression of markers of differentiation state (CD45RA, CD27), inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4), and other markers of T cell exhaustion (CD39) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref>-<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>), indicating similar qualitative responses at day 7 and 3 weeks. Ki67+ cells pre-treatment also had similar phenotype, suggesting that that PD-1 blockade reinvigorates a pre-existing pool of T<sub>EX</sub> cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). The robust response of T<sub>EX</sub>-like CD8 T cells to anti-PD-1 as early 7 days post treatment is consistent with the robust tumor eradiation in many patients by 3 weeks.</p>
              <p id="P13">To further investigate the nature of the rapid intratumoral response to anti-PD-1, we compared PBMC to TIL at week 3. Increased proliferation of CD8, CD4, and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) was detected in the blood after anti-PD-1 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2A</xref>) as described<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In the tumor, CD8 T cell proliferation increased (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2B</xref>) and as expected<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> pembrolizumab treatment increased CD8 T cell infiltration (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The majority of CD8 T cells in the tumor were CD45RA<sup>lo</sup> CD27<sup>hi</sup>. PD-1 was co-expressed with Tim-3, CTLA-4, LAG3, TIGIT and CD39, and many of these TIL CD8 T cells expressed high Eomes, but low Tbet (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), consistent with the phenotype of T<sub>EX</sub><sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In addition, the majority of CD8 T cells in the tumor were bound by pembrolizumab (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P14">At 3 weeks there was a robust increase in Ki67 in PD-1+ and PD-1+CTLA4+ CD8 T cells in the blood. Although there was an increase in Ki67 in PD-1+ CD8 T cells in the tumor, the PD-1+CTLA4+ subset lacked a consistent increase in Ki67 whereas the proportion of PD1+CTLA4+ CD8 T cells in the tumor increased following treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). This finding suggested that: 1) Immune reinvigoration in the tumor may be early and transient, while systemic reinvigoration may be sustained, and/or 2) T cells may be reinvigorated in the periphery before trafficking to the tumor.</p>
              <p id="P15">We observed a high frequency of PD-1+CD39+ CD8 T cells in the TIL pre-treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with tumor-reactive T cells<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. To examine tumor specificity in more detail, we examined gp100 and CMV-specific CD8 T cells using HLA/peptide tetramers pre and post-treatment in two patients. There was no consistent change for these populations in the blood following treatment. However, in both patients, gp100-specific CD8 T cells were present at higher frequencies in the tumor than blood pre-treatment and these cells increased in frequency after anti-PD-1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, CMV-specific CD8 T cells in the tumor did not expand after treatment. At week 3, gp100-specific CD8 T cells in the tumor were CD45RA<sup>lo</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup>, expressed high PD-1, Tim-3, and CTLA-4, and most were Eomes<sup>hi</sup>T-bet<sup>lo</sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Compared to blood, the gp100-specific CD8 T cells in the tumor had similar PD-1, more Tim-3 and CTLA-4, but less Ki67. In contrast, CMV specific CD8 T cells in the blood were CD45RA+CD27-, coexpressed Eomes and T-bet and had lower inhibitor receptors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, melanoma-specific CD8 T cells in the blood and tumor of a subset of patients had a phenotype consistent with T<sub>EX</sub> in the tumor and increased numerically after anti-PD-1.</p>

Moreover, analysis of whole exome sequencing data revealed a deleterious single-nucleotide variant (SNV) at the <italic>TP53</italic> locus (encoding p53) that was heterozygous at resection (allele frequency of 0.55), but homozygous at recurrence (allele frequency of 0.84; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). P53, a tumor suppressor, may also play a role in immunogenic cell death, CD8 T cell responses, and suppressive myeloid subsets such at MDSCs<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Thus, p53 loss may lead to a more aggressive tumor at recurrence and decreased anti-tumor immunity, including increased suppressive myeloid cells.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P19">Despite the clinical success of checkpoint blockade, we still understand relatively little about the precise mechanism(s) of response or resistance to these treatments. A neoadjuvant approach with anti-PD-1 therapy allowed us to address this question and was feasible and effective in stage IIIB/C and IV melanoma with 63% disease-free survival and 93% overall survival at 2 years. There are several major findings. First, we observed a rapid immune response after PD-1 blockade with T cell reinvigoration peaking 7 days post treatment initiation and complete or major pathologic response in 30% of patients within 3 weeks. Notably, these patients with early complete or major pathological tumor response have 100% disease-free survival at 24 months. In contrast, patients without robust pathological responses at surgery had a poor prognosis with greater than 50% risk of recurrence despite adjuvant therapy. A neoadjuvant approach might allow for early identification of high-risk patients and a change to more effective adjuvant therapy. Second, the data from TIL pre and post-treatment support a role for CD8 T cells with characteristics of T<sub>EX</sub>. Finally, these studies provide evidence for mechanisms of response and adaptive resistance including immune failure, immune regulation and immune escape.</p>
              <p id="P20">Many patients displayed rapid (i.e. 3 weeks) complete or nearly complete pathologic responses. These data support the notion that anti-PD-1 revitalizes an already-existing T cell response. In support of this hypothesis are the observations that baseline proliferation of CD8 T cells was associated with clinical benefit and that the immunologic pharmacodynamic response to PD-1 blockade peaked at day 7 after treatment initiation. Although new T cell priming cannot be excluded, this rapidity and robustness favors a model where previously primed CD8 T cells become exhausted and then, upon PD-1 blockade, get rapidly reinvigorated. These immune response data are consistent with the rapid anti-tumor responses observed, but also suggest that preventing or avoiding early concomitant immunoregulatory (e.g. Treg) and/or later acquired resistance may require combination immunotherapies delivered at times that synergize with this early response to anti-PD-1 therapy.</p>
              <p id="P21">An obvious question relates to the specificity of the CD8 T cells responding to PD-1 blockade. Previous work has shown that the T<sub>EX</sub> phenotype cells in the blood responding to PD-1 blockade were enriched for TCRs also found in TILs<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Although it is possible that some of these cells are bystander cells that can be found in blood and tumor, our current studies suggest that CMV-specific CD8 T cells are not likely to respond to anti-PD-1 whereas tumor-specific CD8 T cells targeting gp100 do respond. Moreover, recent work indicates that the PD-1+CD39+ subset of T<sub>EX</sub> are enriched for tumor-specific T cells compared to the CD39- subset<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and we find strong enrichment for the CD39+ subset among the cells responding to PD-1 blockade in this cohort. It will be important to extend these types of studies to larger cohorts with detectable shared or neo-antigen specific CD8 T cell populations. However, based on these previous studies, the cells responding to PD-1 blockade in the cohorts analyzed here are likely to be enriched for tumor-specific CD8 T cell populations.</p>
              <p id="P22">We identified an association between accumulation of T<sub>EX</sub> phenotype (Eomes<sup>hi</sup>Tbet<sup>low</sup>) CD8 T cells and clinical benefit. Minimal changes in Ki67 at 3 weeks contrasted with an increased frequency of T<sub>EX</sub>-like cells in the tumor after anti-PD-1. These observations suggest that either reinvigoration in the tumor occurs before week 3, and/or that T<sub>EX</sub> are reinvigorated peripherally and migrate to the tumor. Indeed, our data demonstrate a peak of T<sub>EX</sub> reinvigoration in the blood by day 7 and data in mice suggest that immune activity in the tumor occurs early and transiently, whereas a systemic immune response may persist longer<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Ki67+ Tregs were also observed in the tumor and correlated with Ki67+ CD8 T cells at week 3. Moreover, proliferation of Tregs was associated with poor disease-free survival. PD-1 blockade may therefore reinvigorate T<sub>EX</sub> in the tumor but also activate Tregs; the relationship between these changes may be an important feature influencing clinical outcome and an opportunity for Treg-modulating drugs. Analysis of pre-treatment tumor also revealed Ki67 expression by non-naïve CD8 T cells as a potential pre-treatment biomarker of response. This observation is consistent with published data in Stage IV melanoma where a pre-existing CD8 T cells in the tumor are associated with clinical benefit following PD-1 blockade<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrate that this pre-existing CD8 T cell immune response is initiated earlier in cancer development (i.e. Stage III disease). Consistent with this notion, NanoString data demonstrated a distinct inflamed signature prior to therapy. These observations support the idea that even in localized disease, the tumor microenvironment is already primed for response or non-response to checkpoint blockade. In patients who recurred, distinct genomic and cellular resistance factors were identified, including <italic>B2M</italic> and <italic>P53</italic> loss of heterozygosity, as well as increased myeloid cell accumulation. Future neoadjuvant studies will allow further study of mechanisms of resistance that may help tailor therapies and/or clinical trials in patients.</p>

Patients then received a single flat dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously, followed by complete resection three weeks later. Patients also provided paired blood samples at the pre-treatment and post-treatment time points. After resection and upon surgical recovery, patients continued to receive adjuvant pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to one year, or until the time of recurrence or any unacceptable treatment related toxicity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Both the biopsies and the resection specimens were processed in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and immediately snap or formalin fixed and paraffin embedded, with a portion of unfixed tissue allocated for extraction of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) for translational studies. Gross photos were taken of resection specimens. Patients were assessed for pathologic response at the 3-week resection time point, with the resection tumor assessed for percentage of viable tumor by a melanoma pathologist. Complete pathologic response was defined as the absence of viable tumor based on hematoxylin and eosin staining. A major pathologic response was defined as less than 10% of viable tumor. Pre- and post-treatment tumors were also assessed for TIL infiltration and scored as either brisk (diffuse lymphocytes throughout the tumor), non-brisk (only foci of lymphocytes), or absent.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Imaging (PET CT or CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) was performed at baseline and on study.

The target sample size was 30 patients. If 5 or fewer of 30 patients experienced a severe (grade 3 or higher) adverse event that was not attributable to pembrolizumab or to surgery alone, then safety was established since the true toxicity rate is likely no higher than 30% based on the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval.</p>

Multivariable models were employed to adjust for established prognostic factors. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated.

                <p id="P31">RNA was isolated from slides of FFPE tissue for analysis on the NanoString nCounter™ gene expression platform (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). Prior to RNA isolation, tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene for 3 × 5 min, then sequentially rehydrated in 100% ethanol for 2 × 2 min, 95% ethanol for 2 min, 70% ethanol for 2 min and then immersed in dH2O until ready to be processed. Tissue was lysed on the slide by adding 10-50ul of PKD buffer (Qiagen catalog #73504). Tissue was then scraped from the slide and transferred to a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube. Proteinase K (Roche Catalog #03115836001) was added at no more than 10% final volume and the RNA lysate was incubated for 15 min at 55ºC and then 15 min at 80ºC. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy FFPE kit per manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sample concentration was measured on the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA) per manufacturer protocol. The resulting total RNA was stored at −80ºC until gene expression profiling was performed using the NanoString nCounter™ system. Per sample, 50ng of total RNA isolated from FFPE was mixed with a 3′ biotinylated capture probe and a 5′reporter probe tagged with a fluorescent barcode, from a custom designed gene expression codeset. Probes and lysate were hybridized overnight at 65 ºC for 12-16 hours. Hybridized samples were then run on the NanoString preparation station using their high sensitivity protocol per manufacturer’s instructions (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). The samples were scanned at maximum scan resolution capabilities using the nCounter™ Digital Analyzer (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). All sample and data normalization occurred within the nCounter™ digital analyzer software, nSolver™. Specifically, the raw code count data was normalized using a positive control normalization factor based on the spiked-in positive control raw counts and also a content normalization factor derived from the raw counts of a set of relevant housekeeping genes. Transcripts with counts less than or equal to the highest embedded negative controls (background noise) in that sample are first set to its background. The gene count for each gene is then subtracted from this background so that each sample has the same footing where zero numbers represent undetectable noise.</p>

                <p id="P32">R package ‘limma_3.34.9’ was used to do pairwise comparisons of the normalized NanoString gene expression data. R package ‘pheatmap_1.0.10’ was used for creating heatmaps to display NanoString gene expression data. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Metascape.org">Metascape.org</ext-link> was used to enrich genes for GO biological processes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Broad Institute software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/</ext-link>) was used to check for enrichment of gene signatures from microarray data in the NanoString data. The 18-gene T-cell inflamed Gene Expression Profile (GEP) was developed as described by Ayers et al. and consists of genes related to antigen presentation, chemokine expression, cytolytic activity and adaptive immune resistance<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These genes are as follows: <italic>CCL5, CD27, CD274 (PD-L1), CD276 (B7-H3), CD8A, CMKLR1, CXCL9, CXCR6, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-E, IDO1, LAG3, NKG7, PDCD1LG2 (PDL2), PSMB10, STAT1, TIGIT</italic>. The GEP score was computed by taking a weighted sum of the housekeeping normalized values of the 18 genes on the GEP18 signature.</p>

                <p id="P33">Whole exome sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue with matched germline DNA. Manual macrodissection was performed on FFPE slides, if necessary, using a scalpel and H&amp;E stained slide as a guide. Tissue deparaffinization and DNA extraction were performed using standard methods. DNA was quantified using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen) and sheared to an average of 250 bp with the Covaris LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). For genomic library preparation, paired-end libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and DNA library quality and fragment size were measured with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Exome sequences were enriched from the genomic libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the SureSelectXT2 Human All Exon V6+COSMIC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000 with 150 bp paired end reads with an average target depth of 87x.</p>
