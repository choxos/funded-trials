                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>For many people, blood pressure (BP) levels differ when measured in a medical office versus outside of the office setting. Out-of-office BP has a stronger association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared with BP measured in the office. Many BP guidelines recommend measuring BP outside of the office to confirm the levels obtained in the office. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) can assess out-of-office BP but is not available in many US practices and some individuals find it uncomfortable. The aims of the Better BP Study are to (1) test if unattended office BP is closer to awake BP on ABPM compared with attended office BP, (2) assess if sleep BP assessed by home BP monitoring (HBPM) agrees with sleep BP from a full night of ABPM and (3) compare the strengths of associations of unattended versus attended office BP, unattended office BP versus awake BP on ABPM and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with markers of end-organ damage.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We are recruiting 630 adults not taking antihypertensive medication in Birmingham, Alabama, and New York, New York. Participants are having their office BP measured with (attended) and without (unattended) a technician present, in random order, using an automated oscillometric office BP device during each of two visits within one week. Following these visits, participants complete 24 hours of ABPM and one night of HBPM, in random order. Psychosocial factors, anthropometrics, left ventricular mass index and albumin-to-creatinine ratio are also being assessed.</p>

              <p>Elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension are associated with more cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and disability-adjusted life years lost than any other modifiable risk factor, both in the USA and worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> US guidelines and scientific statements recommend that BP be measured in the office setting by a trained healthcare professional or technician to identify individuals with hypertension.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â€“5</xref> In clinical practice and most research studies conducted in the USA, BP is measured in the office with medical staff present, an approach sometimes referred to as attended office BP measurement. It has been suggested that measuring office BP without medical staff present, unattended office BP measurement, using an automated office BP (AOBP) device, would be preferable to measuring office BP with medical staff present since the presence of an observer may lead to an alerting phenomenon that increases BP.</p>
              <p>The US Preventive Services Task Force and the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guideline recommend measuring out-of-office BP before initiating antihypertensive treatment for most patients except those with extremely high office BP.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This recommendation is based on a large body of evidence demonstrating BP in many adults differs substantially when measured outside of the office versus when measured attended in the office setting and a stronger association of CVD with out-of-office BP than with attended office BP.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7â€“9</xref>
</p>
              <p>Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is widely considered to be the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment and for confirming an initial diagnosis of hypertension based on office BP.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A comprehensive assessment of BP requires office and out-of-office BP measurements, including while individuals are awake and asleep. ABPM devices are usually programmed to obtain BP readings every 15â€“30â€‰min for 24 hours, including during sleep and can be used to identify white coat hypertension, masked hypertension and nocturnal hypertension. Prior studies have reported strong associations of awake and sleep systolic BP (SBP), assessed by ABPM, with target organ damage and CVD events.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Despite the value of ABPM for diagnosing hypertension, there are barriers to its use, including a lack of availability and poor tolerability for some individuals.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12â€“14</xref>
</p>
              <p>Data from studies conducted in Canada suggest that measuring unattended office BP yields lower BP readings compared with attended measurements and are, on average, closer to the average awake BP assessed by ABPM.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> In a meta-analysis of 16 studies, unattended office BP was lower than attended office BP (SBP: âˆ’10.48â€‰mm Hg; 95% CI, âˆ’13.15 to âˆ’7.81; and diastolic BP (DBP): âˆ’4.44â€‰mm Hg; 95%â€‰CI, âˆ’6.07 to âˆ’2.80), and was not statistically significantly different from awake BP assessed by ABPM.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, there were several limitations associated with this meta-analysis. Many of the studies included did not randomise the order of BP measurement, attended office BP followed by unattended office BP versus unattended office BP followed by attended office BP. Also, the meta-analysis did not report participant-level differences between unattended office BP, attended office BP and BP assessed on ABPM.</p>
              <p>Previously, ABPM was the only method for assessing BP while a person was sleeping. However, home BP monitoring (HBPM) devices have recently been developed that can measure BP while asleep. Prior studies suggest that compared with ABPM, HBPM devices are better tolerated as they are only worn while a person is sleeping versus a full 24 hours, and BP is measured fewer times.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, few data are available comparing sleep SBP and DBP on HBPM versus ABPM.</p>

              <title>Objectives</title>
              <p>The overall goal of the Better BP Study is to determine the extent to which AOBP, used to measure unattended office BP, and an HBPM device that measures BP during sleep estimate BP readings obtained while awake and asleep on ABPM. The Better BP Study has three study aims. The first aim is to test whether, when following a standardised protocol, unattended office BP provides a more accurate estimate of awake SBP and DBP on ABPM than attended office BP. We hypothesise that the absolute difference between unattended office BP and awake BP on ABPM is less than the absolute difference between attended office BP and awake BP, and that the agreement between hypertension status based on office BP versus awake BP will be greater when office BP is measured unattended versus attended. The second aim is to evaluate the extent to which sleep BP obtained from a single night of HBPM agrees with sleep BP assessed by ABPM. We are also asking participants to rate the acceptability of both approaches to assessing out-of-office BP and hypothesise that HBPM will be better tolerated than ABPM. The third aim is to compare the strengths of associations of unattended versus attended office BP, unattended office BP versus awake BP on ABPM and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with markers of end-organ damage, including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and albuminuria. We hypothesise that the association with target-organ damage will be: (1) stronger for unattended versus attended office BP, (2) similar for unattended office and awake BP, and (3) similar for sleep BP by HBPM and ABPM.</p>

                <title>Brief study overview</title>
                <p>Participants are completing four study visits that include BP measurement in an office setting, blood and urine collection, and an echocardiogram (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). There is a 24-hour interval between each of the study visits as depicted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. The order in which office BP is measured at the first and second visit, unattended followed by attended or attended followed by unattended, as well as the order in which participants undergo ABPM and HBPM at the third and fourth visit is determined by 1:1:1:1 block randomisation of 4 groups with each block size consisting of either 8 (2 per condition) or 12 (3 per condition) participants. Participants are randomised to one of the following conditions: (1) unattended office BP first and attended office BP second; ABPM first and HBPM second, (2) attended office BP first and unattended office BP second; ABPM first and HBPM second, (3) unattended office BP first and attended office BP second; HBPM first and ABPM second and (4) attended office BP first and unattended office BP second; HBPM first and ABPM second. The size of the block (8 or 12 participants) is also randomised. All randomisations are conducted by study staff. At the fourth study visit, participants are providing blood and urine specimens and an echocardiogram is performed.</p>

                  <p>Both unattended and attended office BP are being measured using the Microlife WatchBP Office AFIB automated BP device (Microlife USA). The device is programmed to have a 5â€‰min rest period followed by three consecutive BP readings taken at 1â€‰min intervals. All office BP measurements are obtained using the participantâ€™s non-dominant arm, unless this is not feasible, in which case their dominant arm is used for office BP measurements. Prior to having their BP measured, participants are asked to place their feet flat on the ground (levelled), uncross their legs, sit with their back flat against the chair, place their arm in a resting position on a hard surface at heart level, and remain still and quiet until all BP readings are obtained. The research coordinator sets up the device and leaves the room for 10â€‰min in order to obtain the unattended office BP or remains in the room for the attended office BP measurements. When the research coordinator remains in the room, he/she instructs the participant not to talk during the 5â€‰min rest period or while their BP is being measured.</p>

                  <p>Participants are wearing a wrist activity monitor, Philips Respironics Actiwatch 2 Device (Philips USA), on the same arm as the BP cuff from study visit 2 to study visit 4 (ie, when ABPM and sleep HBPM are being conducted) and are being instructed to press a button on the device when they are going to sleep and when they wake up in the morning. The device has a light sensor and records the amount of physical movement (activity count) and light in 1â€‰min epochs. The data are being uploaded and stored in a database using the Actiware software (Philips USA), which also generates preliminary estimates of sleep onset and wake-up times. A trained technician reviews and can adjust these software-generated times based on the actigram, an on-screen graphic showing both the activity count and the level of light on a minute-by-minute basis and the participantâ€™s self-reported sleep/wake times. Once sleep/wake times are finalised, the software computes a number of sleep-related parameters; for example, sleep duration, wake after sleep onset and a sleep fragmentation index. The sleep/wake times are also used to differentiate sleep from awake BP readings on ABPM for the calculation of mean awake and mean sleep SBP and DBP and measures of absolute and relative nocturnal BP dipping.</p>

Through randomisation, 50% of participants should have their first three office SBP and DBP measurements obtained unattended at study visit 1 and attended at study visit 2, while 50% should have their first three office SBP and DBP measurements attended at study visit 1 and unattended at study visit 2. For a sensitivity analysis, the analysis will be repeated using the unattended and attended measurements collected at study visit 1 and study visit 2, separately. Additionally, we will do an analysis using unattended and attended BP measurements from both visits. Awake and sleep SBP and DBP on ABPM are being defined as the mean of all SBP and DBP readings while participants are awake and asleep, respectively, as determined from the actigraphy data in conjunction with the self-reported sleep and wake times from the device log.

For each pair of SBP measures, intraclass correlation coefficients will be calculated.

We will also generate Bland-Altman plots showing the differences between unattended and attended SBP, separately, versus awake SBP assessed by ABPM. The absolute differences of mean attended office SBP and unattended office SBP from awake SBP assessed by ABPM will be calculated. Next, we will determine whether the absolute difference between unattended office SBP and awake SBP is different than the absolute difference between attended office SBP and awake SBP by calculating if the difference in differences (ie, absolute difference of unattended office SBP minus awake SBP minus absolute difference of attended office SBP minus awake SBP) is different than zero using a multilevel mixed models. Next, a two-way ANOVA will be conducted treating SBP as a repeated measures outcome, with indicator variables for (1) whether SBP was measured unattended versus attended, (2) visit and (3) the order effect. These analyses will be repeated for DBP. The overall agreement and agreement above that expected by chance (ie, the Kappa statistic) will be calculated between (1) attended and unattended office hypertension, (2) attended office hypertension and awake hypertension and (3) unattended office hypertension and awake hypertension.</p>

The statistical significance of differences in mean sleep SBP and DBP assessed by HBPM versus ABPM will be determined using multilevel mixed models. In addition, the mean absolute differences between SBP and DBP, separately, assessed by HBPM versus ABPM will be reported and a Bland-Altman plot generated. We will also calculate the overall agreement and Kappa statistic between nocturnal hypertension when sleep BP is assessed by HBPM and ABPM. We will report tolerability scores for ABPM and HBPM, separately, and test for differences in mean tolerability using multilevel mixed models.</p>

The association between each BP measure and LVMI will be estimated using linear regression. An initial model will include adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, sex and study site (UAB or CUIMC). A second model will include further adjustment for education, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sleep quality, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate and 10-year predicted atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. We will also model the association of each BP measure with the outcome of LVH using Poisson regression with the same covariates as mentioned above. The correlation coefficients and regression models for each BP measure will also be generated for the outcomes of albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a continuous outcome and albuminuria as a binary outcome. The statistical significance of the difference in the correlation coefficients will be calculated using the Fisher r-to-z transformation and test for dependent correlations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 28</xref>

                <title>Additional potential limitations of the study design</title>
                <p>A potential limitation includes the exclusion of individuals taking antihypertensive medication. Although ABPM can also be used to monitor on-treatment BP for people with hypertension and who are taking antihypertensive medication, this is a less common recommendation. Another potential limitation is that ABPM instead of HBPM is assumed to be a reference standard for measuring awake BP. We have chosen to use ABPM rather than HBPM to assess awake BP because it is widely considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment and confirming hypertension status. Further, conducting HBPM to assess awake BP was not practical for the proposed study because it requires up to 7â€‰days of measurements, which will confound the ability to assess the tolerability of the HBPM device for assessing sleep BP, based on a single night.</p>
