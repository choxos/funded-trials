                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To compare the impact of intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering right after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) on clinical and hematoma outcomes among patients from different geographic locations, we performed a prespecified subanalysis of a randomized, multinational, 2-group, open-label trial to determine the efficacy of rapidly lowering BP in hyperacute ICH (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage [ATACH]-2), involving 537 patients from East Asia and 463 recruited outside of Asia.</p>

            <p>Stroke was estimated to occur in ≈14 million population annually and was the second largest cause of death (≈5.5 million) and the second most common cause of disability-adjusted life-years (≈116 million) globally from 1990 through 2016.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Of all strokes, 14% to 18.5% were reportedly intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although both the incidence and mortality of ICH decreased in the past 2 decades worldwide, ICH is still a devastating disease.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Acute therapeutic strategies for ICH lag far behind those for acute ischemic stroke in their practical impact<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>; among these, acute lowering of elevated blood pressure (BP) may attenuate early hematoma expansion and have the potential to decrease death and disability. The Second Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) demonstrated possibly better functional outcomes for patients with acute ICH with early intensive lowering to a targeted systolic BP (SBP) of &lt;140 mm Hg than the standard target of SBP &lt;180 mm Hg (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–1.01).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, another global randomized controlled trial, the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH)-2 trial, which overlapped in time with INTERACT2, did not show benefit in reducing the rate of the primary outcome of death or disability, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4 to 6, between the 2 treatment groups with the same target level of SBP as in INTERACT2 (relative risk [RR] with intensive treatment 1.04, 95% CI 0.85–1.27).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We hypothesized that the prevalence and geographic variety of patients from Asia would have affected the difference in the efficacy outcomes between the trials.</p>

                <p>ATACH-2 was a randomized, multinational, 2-group, open-label trial to determine the efficacy of rapidly lowering SBP in patients with hyperacute spontaneous supratentorial ICH from 110 sites in the United States, Japan, China, Taiwan, Germany, and South Korea.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A detailed description of the protocol has been provided elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Briefly, patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥5 and an SBP ≥180 mm Hg on arrival at the emergency department and intraparenchymal hematoma with a volume &lt;60 cm<sup>3</sup> on initial non–contrast-enhanced CT were centrally randomized to undergo either intensive SBP lowering (target SBP 110–139 mm Hg) or standard SBP lowering (target SBP140–179 mm Hg) in a 1:1 ratio within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.</p>
                <p>IV nicardipine infusion was started to reduce hourly minimum SBP to the target level within 2 hours of randomization and to maintain this level through 24 hours for each participant. SBP was measured every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes after initiation of nicardipine infusion followed by at least every 15 minutes for the remainder of the first hour and at least every 30 minutes during the period from 1 to 24 hours. Minimum and maximum SBPs were recorded each hour.</p>
                <p>Neurologic status was assessed with the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at baseline by a qualified study investigator. The trial mandated a head CT at 24 (±8) hours after initiation of treatment. CT images underwent post hoc computerized volumetric analysis by central neuroimaging specialists who were blinded to the treatment assignment, clinical data, adverse events, and CT results from different time points. Postdischarge follow-up included telephone contact at 1 month to collect data on mRS scores, adverse events, and death and an in-person clinical evaluation at 90 days to perform physical and neurologic examinations and to assess the mRS score by a qualified investigator who did not participate in the randomization, treatment, or in-hospital clinical management of the study participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>A total of 1,000 patients were randomized in ATACH-2. All patients recruited in East Asia (Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea) were included in the Asian group, and all patients recruited outside of Asia (United States and Germany) were included in the non-Asian group, regardless of Asian or non-Asian race. Analysis of each outcome was performed under the intention-to-treat principle, including all patients randomized to either treatment group. In addition, a secondary analysis on racial differences was performed with 980 patients who self-identified as White, Black, or Asian race in accordance with the NIH guidelines for reporting race (<ext-link xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-01-053.html" ext-link-type="uri">grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-01-053.html</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients from Asia and those outside of Asia (or among Asian, White, and Black participants) using χ<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank tests for continuous variables. Interaction effects between treatment and cohort were assessed using the cohort, treatment group, and the treatment-by-cohort interaction term as covariates and further adjusted for known predictors for clinical outcomes after ICH that were chosen in our previous substudy of ATACH-2,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> including sex, age, baseline NIHSS score, baseline hematoma volume, hematoma location (lobar hematoma), intraventricular hemorrhage, and time from symptom onset to randomization. Quartile categories were used for these continuous factors.</p>
                <p>The PROC GENMOD procedure of the latest version of SAS software and JMP version 14 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) were used to obtain test statistics and results. Values of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.15 were considered significant for assessment of the treatment-by-cohort interaction. In the other comparisons, values of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant because the analyses were exploratory rather than an attempt to definitively establish the existence of racial differences in the effect of intensive SBP reduction after ICH. Therefore, caution in interpretation of any significant findings is advised.</p>

              <p>In the present analysis of patients from Asia and outside of Asia of the ATACH-2 trial data, the aim was to determine the association between geographic locations and clinical (90-day mRS score), imaging (hematoma expansion within 24 hours), and safety (cardiorenal adverse events within 7 days) outcomes in patients with acute ICH. One of the major findings was the large differences in ICH characteristics between the patients from Asian (to be precise, East Asian) and non-Asian regions. In particular, hematomas in the basal ganglia were more common and intraventricular hemorrhage was less common in the Asian cohort than in the non-Asian cohort. Second, the Asian cohort overall had better outcomes in terms of lower rates of poor functional outcome (32.0% vs 45.9%, absolute difference 13.9 percentage points) and death (1.9% vs 13.3%, absolute difference 11.4 percentage points) and lower incidence of cardiorenal adverse events (3.9% vs 11.2%, absolute difference 7.3 percentage points) than the non-Asian cohort. Third, intensive SBP lowering did not show significant treatment-by-cohort interactions on clinical outcomes, hematoma expansion, and cardiorenal adverse events, although the direction of the effect of intensive SBP-lowering treatment was positive in the Asian cohort with respect to death. Fourth, hematoma expansion was significantly attenuated by intensive SBP lowering only in the Asian cohort. Fifth, cardiorenal adverse events were significantly increased by intensive SBP lowering in both Asian and non-Asian cohorts. These results were similar when the 3 races by self-identification, Asian, White, and Black, were compared.</p>
              <p>A reason for the neutral results of the ATACH-2 trial was that intensive SBP lowering did not sufficiently reduce hematoma expansion, partly because the majority of participants had relatively mild ICH, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and median hematoma volume of 10 mL.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials, including INTERACT2 and ATACH-2, with a total of 4,360 patients reported that intensive BP lowering was associated with a nonsignificant trend for a lower risk of death or disability at 3 months and for a lower risk of hematoma expansion.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A pooled analyses of INTERACT2 and ATACH-2 indicated a continuous association between the level of achieved SBP in the initial 24 hours and the distribution of mRS scores at 90 days.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> There were several differences in study protocols such as time allowed from symptom onset to randomization and allowable antihypertensive drug, and in therapeutic results, including the target SBP levels and the time frame to achieve those levels, between INTERACT2 and ATACH-2.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In addition, there was a difference in the regional distribution of participants; 68% were from China in INTERACT2 and 56% were from 4 countries of East Asia in ATACH-2.</p>
              <p>The predominance of intracranial arteriopathy and arteriolopathy is a unique feature of stroke in Asia.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> As a good example, ICH is 2 to 4 times more common in Asian than in White individuals.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Hereditary susceptibility to intracranial vasculopathy,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> high sodium intake,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> high sensitivity to warfarin,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and other factors cause a high incidence of ICH in Asian individuals. Asian participants had smaller hematoma size at baseline and were less likely to die and had better quality of life than White participants according to the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive and Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke Trial involving 1,011 patients.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Another meta-analysis reported lower mortality after ICH in Japan than other countries,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> presumably due in part to the tendency of maintaining intensive therapy even for terminal patients.</p>
              <p>The ATACH-2 trial data present a valuable opportunity to assess baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with ICH from Asia compared to those outside of Asia because the trial involved 1,000 participants with nearly equal proportions of Asian and non-Asian cohorts. In an analysis limited to patients receiving standard SBP-lowering treatment, poor functional outcome at 90 days was less common (32.8% vs 43.9%), as was death (2.2% vs 13.2%), in Asian than non-Asian participants, although the initial NIHSS score and hematoma volume were almost identical. Thus, patients from Asia seem to recover relatively better from ICH than those outside of Asia with the same patient selection criteria for patients independently of intensive SBP lowering.</p>
              <p>Hematoma expansion during the initial hours is an established risk factor for poor outcome after ICH.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In the ATACH-2 cohort, hematoma expansion was significantly associated with poor functional outcome; 65.9% with expansion and 29.5% without expansion had poor outcomes. The possibly positive effect in INTERACT2 and the neutral effect in ATACH-2 on good clinical outcomes by intensive SBP lowering are due in part to weak protection against hematoma expansion by intensive treatment.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In contrast, hematoma expansion was attenuated by intensive treatment in the Asian cohort of ATACH-2, showing a decrease in expansion by 9% absolutely and by 48% relative to patients receiving standard SBP lowering, although the treatment-by-cohort interaction was not significant. Black participants also showed an absolute decrease in expansion by 8% after intensive treatment, without a statistically significant difference presumably due to the small number of patients.</p>
              <p>Median onset-to-randomization time was 33.5 minutes shorter in the Asian cohort than non-Asian cohort. A shorter time delay appears to be essential for acute ICH therapy. The rate of hematoma expansion is the highest in the initial 3 hours after symptom onset.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The initial inclusion criterion of ATACH2 was not within 4.5 hours but within 3 hours of symptom onset<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; 56.6% of Asian and 39.0% of non-Asian participants met the older criterion. Time from randomization (or imaging) to reach the target SBP level was inversely associated with hematoma expansion in INTERACT2 and our multicenter, observational, Stroke Acute Management With Urgent Risk-Factor Assessment and Improvement (SAMURAI)-ICH study.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In addition, another exploratory analysis of the ATACH-2 reported that intensive SBP lowering was associated with a decreased risk for expansion of basal ganglionic hematoma but not of thalamic hematoma or lobar hematoma.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> ICH at the basal ganglia has mostly a hypertensive etiology. Severe hypertensive vasculopathy would predispose a patient to additional rupture of small vessels triggered by a BP surge, and intensive SBP lowering would prevent them from rupture and attenuate hematoma expansion. Patients from Asia had 10% more ICHs in the basal ganglia and may have received a clearer protective effect from hematoma expansion than non-Asian patients.</p>
              <p>Cardiorenal adverse events were significantly associated with poor functional outcome in the ATACH-2 trial cohort<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>; 62.5% with events and 36.2% without events had poor outcomes (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The observed excess cardiorenal adverse events in intensive SBP lowering for patients with acute ICH were more common in both the Asian and non-Asian cohorts. Intensive SBP lowering is known to cause acute kidney injury in patients with acute ICH.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Thus, any beneficial effects of intensive SBP lowering on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion may be offset by the adverse events. In addition, cardiorenal adverse events were much more common in the non-Asian than Asian cohort.</p>
              <p>Although the patients recruited from 4 East Asian countries were regarded as the Asian cohort in the present study, Asia includes &gt;4 dozen countries and an extremely wide variety of physical phenotypes, socioeconomic political boundaries, and cultural practices. Thus, the present results would not be generalizable to persons under the broad social category of Asian. Similarly, patients recruited only in United States and Germany were not representative of all non-Asian people. Inclusion of 25 patients from United States or Germany of Asian ancestry would strengthen or weaken the difference in the results between the Asian and non-Asian cohorts. A wide variety of factors other than differences in ancestry might underlie regional differences in ICH presentations, outcomes, and responses to interventions. These problems were essential limitations of the present study.</p>
              <p>In addition, the following limitations to the present study need to be considered. First, patients with ICH with more severe symptoms were excluded, including those with huge hematoma and those with infratentorial hemorrhage. In fact, the patient sample in the study was dominated by cases of milder ICH, with 56% having a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and median hematoma volume of 10 mL. Second, the numbers of patients in some subgroups, especially the Black group, were small, which might weaken statistical power. Third, data on premorbid mRS scores, which might influence mRS scores at 90 days, were not collected. Fourth, cardiorenal adverse events were reported by the nonblinded investigators, although severe events were checked by blinded physicians in the Independent Oversight Committee.</p>
              <p>Patients from East Asia seemed to recover relatively better from ICH than those outside of Asia with the same patient selection criteria. Intensive SBP-lowering treatment showed a protective effect against hematoma growth in the Asian cohort, although the treatment did not improve the clinical outcomes at 3 months.</p>
