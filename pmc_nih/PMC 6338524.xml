                <sec id="ijpo12464-sec-0001">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Clinical approaches to treating childhood obesity can be expensive and poorly reimbursed, and often produce suboptimal results. It has been theorized that overeating may have addictive qualities, and a sizable number of adolescents with obesity endorse addictive habits. Interestingly, few weight management interventions have tested techniques founded in addiction medicine principles. We therefore performed a pilot study of an addiction model based mHealth weight loss intervention in adolescents.</p>

                <sec id="ijpo12464-sec-0002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Adolescents with obesity were recruited from an multidisciplinary weight management clinic (EMPOWER). Adolescents without significant obesity comorbidities, who exhibited signs of addictive eating, based on the Yale Food Addiction Scale, were enrolled in a pilot study of an interactive, addiction‐based, weight loss smartphone app with coaching (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT02689154). The app was designed to help subjects omit problem foods, avoid snacking and reduce meal size. A contemporary cohort of adolescents who completed the EMPOWER program were evaluated. Feasibility of recruitment, adherence, retention rates, BMI change and cost of intervention were examined.</p>

                <sec id="ijpo12464-sec-0003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Eighteen participants were recruited to app intervention. App participants had higher retention (100% vs. 37%) and lower total cost per patient ($855.15 vs. $1428.00) than the EMPOWER clinic participants. App participants exhibited a significant decrease in zBMI and %BMI<sub>p95</sub> over the 6 months (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), which was comparable to the age‐matched EMPOWER program completers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.06).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>An addiction medicine‐based mHealth intervention targeted for adolescents was feasible to implement, resulted in high retention and adherence rates, and reduced zBMI and %BMI<sub>p95</sub> in a more cost‐effective manner than an in‐clinic intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>It has been theorized that overeating may have addictive qualities (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>), and there is a growing body of literature which reports that craving for drugs and drive for food involve similar hypothalamic pathways as seen on functional MRI (fMRI) studies (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>). Recent studies have reported that 5.9–30.7% of adolescents with overweight and obesity enrolled in weight management interventions endorse addictive‐like eating habits, similar to the 15–19% reported by adults seeking obesity treatment (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>). Interestingly, few weight management interventions have tested therapeutic techniques founded in addiction medicine principles to date, targeted towards adolescents (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>). The notion of obesity as an addictive process in adolescents is controversial, yet this should not preclude evaluating addiction‐model methods as a viable intervention strategy.</p>
              <p>The general consensus is that clinical interventions for adolescent obesity require intensive management with interdisciplinary teams, frequent visits, and many contact hours (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>). However, the high prevalence impedes this as a practical strategy to combat obesity (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>). Advances in mobile health technologies (mHealth) offer an opportunity to monitor various behaviours, and to deliver interventions in the adolescent's natural environment (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>). Thus, mHealth platforms may be a cost‐saving alternative to an in‐clinic intervention for paediatric weight management (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Pretlow <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>) reported an intervention which applied addiction‐based treatment methods to obesity in adolescents, delivered as an iPhone® app. The treatment methods were proposed after analysis of an interactive website for youth with obesity which revealed common themes of food cravings, withdrawal‐like symptoms and nervous, habitual eating patterns. The app intervention is founded on three addiction‐based principles: (i) divide‐and‐conquer approach; (ii) staged withdrawal/abstinence; and (iii) body focused repetitive behavioural intervention methods (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>). Specifically, the intervention targets three features of addictive eating behaviour: (i) staged withdrawal from participant identified problem foods; (ii) staged withdrawal from daytime snacking between meals; and (iii) withdrawal from excessive amounts of food consumed at meals (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>). To date, this app intervention has been tested, as proof of concept, in a self‐selected cohort of 43 young people with obesity between 12 and 21 years of age (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>). This study recruited youth from newspaper ads and screened volunteers for weight loss motivation and interest in technology. The authors reported that a food withdrawal approach was feasible to implement in this motivated community‐based sample (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>We aimed to assess whether this intervention could be a feasible and effective approach for adolescent patients in a health‐care setting. We therefore performed a pilot study of the addiction‐based, app‐mediated intervention in adolescents who were referred to a tertiary care weight management clinic and who self‐reported addictive eating behaviours. Our objectives were to assess (i) feasibility of recruitment, (ii) adherence to the intervention components and retention rates to scheduled visits, (iii) effect of the app intervention on BMI Z‐score (zBMI) and excess percent over the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (%BMI<sub>p95</sub>) and (iv) the cost saving benefits of the app intervention. All the aforementioned objectives were compared to youth who attended at least six visits (program completers) of an in‐clinic weight management intervention.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and eligibility</title>
                <p>Study procedures were approved by the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Institutional Review Board (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT02689154) and were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. Participants were recruited for the app intervention from the CHLA multi‐disciplinary weight management clinic (EMPOWER). Newly referred patients were pre‐screened for eligibility prior to their first clinic visit. At the first visit, the Yale Food Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS‐c) was utilized to screen for traits of addictive eating (see below) (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>). Inclusion criteria included age 12–18 years and positive YFAS‐c. Exclusion criteria were as follows: obesity co‐morbidities (impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and fatty liver with alanine aminotransferase greater than 45 units/litre, and blood pressure greater than 99<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, gender and height), known psychiatric illness and/or developmental delay, and the inability to read English.</p>

                  <title>App enrollment</title>
                  <p>A total of 50 eligible adolescents were approached to participate in the addiction‐based, app‐mediated intervention via consecutive enrollment from April 2016 to June 2017. Eighteen adolescents self‐selected into the app intervention. Demographic information was collected from all participants (Table <xref rid="ijpo12464-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Each app participant was supplied with an iPhone® 5S (unless they already owned an iPhone®), a wireless Bluetooth body weight scale (Wahoo Fitness Balance Scale; Wahoo fitness, Atlanta, GA) and a wireless Bluetooth digital food scale (Escali Smart Connect Kitchen Scale, Escali Corp., Burnsville, MN) both of which were interfaced to the app. During the intervention period, the app participants did not attend the EMPOWER intervention. The app program did not require parental involvement.</p>

                <p>The EMPOWER clinic consists of a team of physicians, dietitians, physical therapists and psychologists who administer the EMPOWER intervention in a clinic setting. Treatment is administered over monthly clinic visits (averaging 100 min at the initial visit and 80 min per follow up visit, ~8 contact hours per participant per 6‐month intervention period). During each EMPOWER visit; patients are evaluated by the team. Providers rotate through individually, obtaining history and assessing patients based on their discipline. Individualized behaviour change goals for healthy eating, physical activity, emotional well‐being and family support are then followed up at subsequent monthly visits. The behavioural treatment strategies adopted in the EMPOWER intervention do not address eating as an addiction or incorporate addiction‐based therapeutic targets into the treatment model.</p>

                <p>The specific details of the addiction model obesity intervention have been described by Pretlow <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>) Briefly, the intervention was implemented through an iPhone® app called W8Loss2Go©, which was securely integrated with a network‐server for real‐time data access and storage (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>). The intervention included two clinic visits at 3 and 6‐month intervals (45 min per visit), text messages 5 days per week (2 min/SMS = 240 min), weekly phone sessions (15 min × 24 sessions = 360 min), for a total of ~11.5 contact hours per participant per 6‐month intervention period. The intervention targets three features of addictive eating behaviour: (i) staged withdrawal from participant identified problem foods; (ii) staged withdrawal from snacking between meals; and (iii) withdrawal from excessive amounts of food consumed at meals (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>). Problem foods were defined as specific foods for which participants felt they had cravings or difficulty resisting. Participants sequentially withdrew from two self‐selected problem foods at a time, with the goals of total abstinence from the food for a minimum of 10 days in a row, plus cravings resolution (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>). Consumption of a problem food during or after this 10‐day period would result in a re‐start of the abstinence period.</p>
                <p>After withdrawing from two problem foods, participants would start the second phase of eliminating snacking by choosing time periods to avoid snacking (i.e. morning, afternoon, evening or nighttime). Once the participant had abstained from snacking during their chosen time interval for 10 days, the participant then chose additional time intervals to abstain from snacking, with the overall goal of eliminating snacking between meals for the entire day. After snacking was eliminated from one time period, the third stage would commence and excessive food amounts at meals were targeted. Each participant weighed and recorded typical serving amounts of all foods at meals in the app. At subsequent meals, when a recorded food was served again the app reduced amounts of each food (decrease of 2% per food item) and the participant weighed out and ate only those amounts. If weight loss had not occurred within 4 days, the app further reduced all logged food amounts in 2% increments, until weight loss ensued. Participants took photos of meals via the app, post weighing, which were reviewed by the mentor (APV) weekly, to allow for external confirmation of amount reduction. After the participant had eliminated at least two problem foods, stopped snacking in one time period and started weighing their foods at meals, they continued to interact with all three phases for the remainder of the intervention period. In addition, participants had access to the app home page, which included various addiction model strategies, including motivation, distraction ideas and coping skills techniques (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>).</p>
                <p>Participants were asked to weigh themselves daily and participate in weekly phone meetings with the mentor. Two 45‐minute face‐to‐face meetings were held at month 3 and 6. Participants were sent daily text messages from their mentor. The mentor utilized a motivational interviewing paradigm to interact with the participants (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>) and an electronic system within the app database to document each encounter.</p>
                <p>The first four recruited participants received financial compensation of three hundred dollars upon completion of the study. The app was then upgraded to include a point accrual system in which the active (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and newly recruited (<italic>n</italic> = 6) participants earned points as they completed specific tasks, which were associated with a dollar amount, up to three hundred dollars over the course of the intervention.</p>

              <p>Of the 50 eligible adolescents approached, 18 elected to participate in the app intervention (Fig. <xref rid="ijpo12464-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As this was a pilot study, the sample size was small, and the self‐selection process resulted in a recruitment rate of 36%. The 32 youth that declined to participate cited lack of interest in technology, minimal incentive from financial compensation and parental desire for intensive monthly visits as reasons for refusal (Fig. <xref rid="ijpo12464-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the EMPOWER comparator group, 532 unique patients with 1759 clinic visits were evaluated. There were 95 program completers (17%), while 156 (31%) attended only one visit. Seventeen of the program completers were ages 13–18. The characteristics of the study cohort are shown in Table <xref rid="ijpo12464-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Mean age of participants was 14.4 years (range, 12.3–17.9). The female to male ratio, racial/ethnic distribution, zBMI at baseline, and government insurance rates were comparable between the app group and the EMPOWER program completers.</p>

By comparison, on average completion of the EMPOWER intervention decreased the zBMI by 0.06, and cost more, $1427.78 per patient per 6‐month in‐clinic intervention.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We report herein that an addiction model‐based mHealth weight loss intervention for adolescents was feasible to administer in a tertiary care weight loss setting. The intervention was associated with high retention and adherence rates and resulted in modest but significant improvements in obesity over a 6 month period, comparable to youth who completed an in‐clinic intervention, with lower cost than a traditional multidisciplinary approach. Remarkably, although there are many freely available mHealth technologies which address behaviour change, few employ addiction principles, including withdrawal response and tolerance, and even fewer are targeted towards children (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>). Thus, coupling addiction medicine principles with mHealth approaches may improve the effectiveness of similar interventions.</p>
              <p>Two common barriers to implementing innovative weight loss interventions, especially in adolescents, is the difficulty in recruitment and sustained engagement. The recruitment rate of this study was 36%, demonstrating the potential difficulty of recruiting eligible youth into weight management studies. Incentivized, mHealth‐based interventions may provide a more attractive option for this population than traditional in‐clinic interventions and requires further investigation.</p>
              <p>In addition, a recent meta‐analysis revealed that the majority of mHealth weight loss interventions targeted for youth did not maintain sustained engagement during the intervention with only 39% of individuals utilizing a weight loss app for more than 10 interactions (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>). In contrast, participants in the current study used the app on average more than 500 times, over the 6‐month period. There are multiple factors that may have resulted in improved app usage in this study, including personalized coaching, daily text messages, app‐generated daily reminders and financial incentive. Personalized coaching is likely to impact both traditional and mHealth weight loss interventions (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>). Given these findings, it is not possible to estimate how much of the engagement and efficacy of the app intervention was due to the coaching component vs. the app itself.</p>
              <p>Another major benefit of mHealth approaches is the potential for cost savings. Our estimated‐cost analysis revealed that although the app intervention cost more than routine care management, it was cheaper than a multidisciplinary weight loss intervention. This does not include the decreased burdens placed on patients and families who do not have to miss work/school and travel to in‐person visits. Currently, obtaining insurance coverage for mHealth interventions can be difficult; however, a strong argument can be made for payer's potential cost savings through implementing these interventions in clinical practice.</p>
              <sec id="ijpo12464-sec-0027">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Although these results are encouraging, there are limitations to interpreting them as they arise from a small, time limited, pilot study. Our recruitment strategy, without randomization, may have selected more motivated patients, or those more open to mobile health interventions. The study was not designed to test efficacy of the addiction intervention alone on weight loss; however, by utilizing a convenience comparator sample from EMPOWER program completers, we were able to report how the complete intervention package (app plus coaching) affected weight trends compared to adolescents who adhered and completed an in‐clinic intervention. Compared to program non‐completers, those youth who completed the EMPOWER program were predominantly male, with lower reported rates of anxiety and depression in one or more parent; these differences must be recognized when evaluating the results. Furthermore, the app intervention was time limited, with no weight maintenance phase included. Therefore, while these results are promising, further randomized and longer‐term investigations are required to evaluate the efficacy of both the addiction intervention itself and the mHealth component on weight loss and maintenance.</p>
                <p>App participants received substantial financial incentives for participation. Financial incentives improve adherence and outcome of obesity interventions (<xref rid="ijpo12464-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>) and thus likely contributed to the success of the app intervention group. The coaching component for this study was implemented by only one mentor (APV). Patient retention and efficacy could vary with different mentors. Standardized curricula and protocols could be utilized to train mentors and evaluate the effect of having multiple coaches on participant's weight status. Despite these limitations, our study provides important formative feedback for the development of future randomized controlled trials of addiction model based mHealth weight loss interventions in paediatrics.</p>

              <p>Findings from this pilot study suggest that youth that participated in an addiction model‐based mHealth intervention targeted towards adolescents had high retention and adherence rates and modest but significant improvements in obesity over a 6‐month intervention.
