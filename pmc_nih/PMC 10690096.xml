                <sec>
                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Vaccination with dendritic cell (DC)/multiple myeloma (MM) fusions has been shown to induce the expansion of circulating multiple myeloma–reactive lymphocytes and consolidation of clinical response following autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto-HCT).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>In this randomized phase II trial (NCT02728102), we assessed the effect of DC/MM fusion vaccination, GM-CSF, and lenalidomide maintenance as compared with control arms of GM-CSF and lenalidomide or lenalidomide maintenance alone on clinical response rates and induction of multiple myeloma–specific immunity at 1-year posttransplant.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>The study enrolled 203 patients, with 140 randomized posttransplantation. Vaccine production was successful in 63 of 68 patients. At 1 year, rates of CR were 52.9% (vaccine) and 50% (control; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.37, 80% CI 44.5%, 61.3%, and 41.6%, 58.4%, respectively), and rates of VGPR or better were 85.3% (vaccine) and 77.8% (control; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.2). Conversion to CR at 1 year was 34.8% (vaccine) and 27.3% (control; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.4). Vaccination induced a statistically significant expansion of multiple myeloma–reactive T cells at 1 year compared with before vaccination (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.024) and in contrast to the nonvaccine arm (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.026). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed clonotypic expansion of activated CD8 cells and shared dominant clonotypes between patients at 1-year posttransplant.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>DC/MM fusion vaccination with lenalidomide did not result in a statistically significant increase in CR rates at 1 year posttransplant but was associated with a significant increase in circulating multiple myeloma–reactive lymphocytes indicative of tumor-specific immunity. Site-specific production of a personalized cell therapy with centralized product characterization was effectively accomplished in the context of a multicenter cooperative group study.</p>

              <p>In contrast to lenalidomide maintenance therapy alone, vaccination with patient-specific dendritic cell/tumor hybridomas following autologous transplant for multiple myeloma was uniquely associated with the statistically significant and durable expansion of myeloma specific T cells at 1 year posttransplant. Vaccination induced the clonal expansion of activated T cells against shared epitopes as determined by single-cell transcriptomics. Differences in early clinical response between the vaccine and control arms did not meet statistical significance and may require longer follow-up. Vaccine-mediated expansion of tumor-specific T cells provides a platform for myeloma-directed immunity that may be augmented through enhancement of T-cell functional activity and targeting of the immune microenvironment. The study is a first-of-its-kind, academically led, collaborative multicenter randomized trial of personalized cell therapy with site-specific production and centralized assessment of vaccine characterization and immune response.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The advent of combination biologic therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) has significantly improved patient outcomes. Induction therapy followed by consolidation with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) results in effective cytoreduction of disease and prolongs progression-free survival (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The addition of posttransplant lenalidomide maintenance therapy further extends the duration of remission and may augment clearance of residual malignant cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, the vast majority of patients ultimately experience disease progression due to the emergence of resistant disease. The development of strategies to enhance the durability of posttransplant response remains a major unmet need in the field. Immune dysregulation and loss of antitumor immunity contribute to the disease evolution of multiple myeloma (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref>). Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated dramatic responses in patients with relapsed/refractory disease, illustrating the potential unique efficacy of immune effector cells in targeting multiple myeloma that is resistant to standard biologic agents (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>).</p>
              <p>The development of cancer vaccines is being investigated in multiple myeloma with the goal of stimulating tumor-specific immunity within the native T-cell repertoire and restoring immune surveillance (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>). Critical elements of vaccine design include the presence of costimulatory signaling necessary for T-cell activation and the identification of appropriate targets that demonstrate immunogenicity and tumor selectivity. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells that prominently express costimulatory signaling necessary for optimal T-cell activation, cross-presentation of antigen to reactive CD8 T cells, and the development of primary immunity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>). Neoantigens arising from tumor-associated mutations are a powerful substrate for vaccination, showing heightened responses with high-affinity T cells (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Lymphopoietic reconstitution following auto-HCT is characterized by transient disruption of immune-tolerance mechanisms, thus providing a powerful platform for therapeutic vaccination (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>). Potential synergy between lenalidomide and vaccine therapy has been demonstrated with the pneumococcal vaccine and in preclinical studies with a personalized cancer vaccine (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>).</p>
              <p>We have developed a personalized cancer vaccine in which patient-derived tumor cells are fused with autologous monocyte-derived DCs to present a broad array of tumor antigens, including potentially shared epitopes and neoepitopes, in the context of DC-mediated costimulation to restore the immune repertoire against multiple myeloma and improve clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Importantly, this vaccine design offers a platform to direct an immune response <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> against the most immunogenic targets of an individual's tumor. In a phase II study, vaccination with autologous DCs fused with primary multiple myeloma tumor cells (DC/MM fusions) in conjunction with GM-CSF after auto-HCT induced the expansion of circulating multiple myeloma–reactive lymphocytes and was associated with conversion to complete response (CR) post-auto-HCT in the absence of maintenance therapy (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The promise of this vaccine approach is further supported by a study for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in which vaccination of DC/AML fusions for older patients in chemotherapy-induced remission resulted in the durable expansion of tumor-reactive lymphocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, with 71% of patients in ongoing remission at 5 years of follow-up (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>This multicenter randomized phase II study examined the efficacy of the DC/MM fusion vaccine in conjunction with lenalidomide maintenance therapy after auto-HCT, compared with maintenance alone. The primary immunologic endpoint was to examine the impact of vaccination on the durable expansion of multiple myeloma–reactive T cells, as compared with that observed with lymphopoietic reconstitution in the context of lenalidomide maintenance alone. The primary clinical endpoint was to assess the capacity of vaccination to enhance clinical response at 1-year posttransplant with respect to the percentage of patients achieving CR and those converting to CR during the period of posttransplant therapy. The study offered a first-of-its-kind academic collaborative effort of personalized cell therapy using an open-source format, site-specific production, and centralized product characterization/release criteria verification in a large multicenter setting.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 1401 was a randomized phase II study at 18 transplantation centers in the United States. Participating centers demonstrated proficiency in vaccine production at their respective sites after receiving in-person training. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02728102). Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, age ≤70 years, candidates for auto-HCT, and having received not more than one cycle of induction therapy were potentially eligible for enrollment. Bone marrow plasma cell infiltration ≥20% was required to ensure sufficient tumor cells for vaccine generation. Patients received standard-of-care induction therapy and auto-HCT conditioned with melphalan 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The choice of pretransplant induction therapy was not prescribed by the study and commonly consisted of combination biologic therapy with a bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone or an equivalent regimen. At approximately 2 months after auto-HCT, patients without significant ongoing transplant-related toxicity were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 manner to vaccination with DC/MM fusions with GM-CSF and lenalidomide, lenalidomide and GM-CSF, or lenalidomide alone, stratified by disease response posttransplant (CR vs. not CR). Lenalidomide was required for 2 years following transplant and then continued as per standard-of-care maintenance. Coprimary endpoints were comparison of CR conversion across treatment arms and treatment-induced expansion of multiple myeloma–specific T cells. Multiple myeloma with high-risk features was defined by the presence of elevated LDH, β2 microglobulin &gt; 5.5 mg/L, and/or high-risk cytogenetics, including 17p, t(4;14), t(14,20), t(14,16) del 13q, and 1p/1q abnormalities.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>After initial enrollment, patients underwent tumor collection from 30 mL of bone marrow aspirate, which was cryopreserved for future vaccine production and immune response assessments. A minimum of 10 million CD38-expressing plasma cells, quantified by immunocytochemistry, was required for vaccine production. Approximately 2 months after auto-HCT, patients randomized to the DC/MM vaccine arm underwent leukapheresis for isolation of adherent mononuclear cells for vaccine generation. All patients started lenalidomide maintenance approximately 3 months post–auto-HCT at a dose of 10 mg a day for 28 days of a 28-day cycle. On day 1 of cycles 2, 3, and 4 of lenalidomide maintenance, patients assigned to the vaccine arm underwent subcutaneous administration of the DC/MM fusion vaccine along with 100 μg GM-CSF administered subcutaneously adjacent to the vaccine site on days 1 to 4. Patients randomized to the nonvaccine control arms received either lenalidomide alone or lenalidomide with GM-CSF at the same dose and schedule as the vaccine arm.</p>

                <title>Vaccine generation</title>
                <p>Vaccines were produced at each participating site using a shared manufacturing protocol. Central characterization of the DC, tumor, and vaccine components was conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). Vaccine uniformity was enhanced through the use of common lots for all reagents. Microbiologic assessments for sterility, mycoplasma, and endotoxin were performed centrally. Adherent mononuclear cells were cultured with rhGM-CSF and IL4 for 5 to 7 days and matured with TNFα. DC and tumor cells were transiently resuspended in polyethylene glycol to generate fusion cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which were quantified based on the dual expression of cell-specific markers. Release criteria included: (i) ≥20% CD38 or CD138 expression by the tumor cell prep; (ii) ≥10 million plasma cell yield from the tumor cell prep; (iii) ≥ 50% of DC prep expression of CD86; (iv) &gt;50% viability of DC prep; (v) &gt;15% fusion efficiency; (vi) &gt; 50% fusion viability; and (vii) negative sterility, mycoplasma, and endotoxin assays.</p>

                <title>Assessment of clinical and immunologic response</title>
                <p>Multiple myeloma response and disease progression were determined using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria. Minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis was performed centrally by multichannel flow cytometry (Roswell Park Core Facility). The flow cytometer employed in the data acquisition was a BD FACS Canto, 10-Color Configuration (BD Biosciences) using 8 color flow cytometry (tube 1: CD38/CD56/CD45/CD19/CD117/CD81/ CD138/CD27 and tube 2: CD38/CD56/CD45/CD19/cKappa/cLambda/CD138/ CD27). Bone marrow aspirate samples (3 mL) were collected at 1-year posttransplant from patients without overt progression. MRD analysis was reported on 112 patients excluding patients with insufficient material for the assay. MRD was determined by multi-parameter flow cytometry identifying malignant plasma cells defined as CD45 <sup>(-/dim)</sup>, CD38<sup>+</sup>, CD138<sup>+</sup>, CD19<sup>−</sup>, CD56<sup>+</sup>, and kappa or lambda-restricted at a level of detection of 10<sup>−5</sup>. Adverse events were assessed using NCI CTCAE version 4.0 at prior to initiation of lenalidomide maintenance and during maintenance therapy monthly for the first 4 cycles and then at cycles 6, 9, 15, 21, and 24.</p>
                <p>Peripheral blood samples were collected at serial time points, including at enrollment, prior to initiation of posttransplant lenalidomide maintenance, following cycle 1 of lenalidomide and prior to vaccination, following 2 cycles of lenalidomide and vaccination, and following 3 vaccinations and 8 cycles of lenalidomide maintenance (approximately 1-year posttransplant). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077 Hybry-Max, Sigma-Aldrich), cryopreserved, and subsequently thawed concurrently for immune analysis. Multiple myeloma–reactive T cells were quantified by determining the percentage of IFNγ-expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells following exposure to autologous tumor lysate <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic>. Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs were plated in 1 mL of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L Glutamine (Gibco) 10% fetal bovine serum (R&amp;D Systems), 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) and pulsed with 20 μL of tumor lysate obtained by repeated freeze/thaw cycles and sonication of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> BM/tumor cells collected at time of patient enrollment into the study. T-cell expression of IFNγ was measured after 5 days of culture. For intracellular IFNγ staining, cells were incubated for 6 hours with 1 μg/mL GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) to inhibit IFNγ secretion. Cells were then stained with APC-Cy7–conjugated anti-CD4 (Molecular Probes) and PE-conjugated anti-CD8 (BD Pharmingen) antibodies. PBMCs were then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm plus (BD Bioscience) before staining with PB-conjugated anti-IFNγ antibody (Invitrogen). The percentage of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing IFNγ was determined by flow cytometry with a Gallios instrument (Beckman Coulter). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using isotype control antibody to set the quadrants for quantification of IFN© expression.</p>

                <p>The primary analysis compared the proportion of patients in CR/stringent CR (sCR) at 1-year posttransplant between the vaccine and nonvaccine groups using an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. A sample size of 66 patients in each cohort (132 total) targeted 85% power to detect an improvement in the CR/sCR rate at 1 year from 40% to 60%, using a two-sample Z test comparing proportions with a one-sided type I error of 10%. Because randomization occurred after tumor cell collection and transplant, target enrollment was 188, assuming 30% dropout between tumor cell collection and randomization. The difference in response rates was also estimated with 80% confidence intervals, consistent with the one-sided type I error of 10%. A secondary analysis stratified by disease response prior to randomization used a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test and stratified odds ratio. A secondary pairwise analysis compared the vaccine arm, lenalidomide/GM-CSF arm, and the lenalidomide alone arm. Proportions of patients who converted to CR and proportions with MRD present were compared using the <italic toggle="yes">χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test.</p>
                <p>PFS (progression-free survival) and OS (overall survival) were secondary endpoints of the study. Death or disease progression was considered an event for PFS. The time to event was calculated as the time from randomization to disease progression, death, or initiation of nonprotocol anti-myeloma therapy, whichever occurred first. The Kaplan–Meier estimators were constructed for each treatment arm. PFS/OS was compared between the vaccine and the combined non-vaccine arms using the log-rank test. Patients experiencing grade 3–5 toxicities were compared between vaccine and non-vaccine group using <italic toggle="yes">χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test. Incidence of grade 2–3 infections were compared between vaccine and non-vaccine group using Gray test by cumulative incidence function, treating death as a competing risk. The proportion of patients with MRD present (MRD+) was described using frequencies at pre-randomization and 9th cycle post-randomization and compared between the vaccine arm with the nonvaccine arms combined using the <italic toggle="yes">χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test. For immune response assessments, nonparametric tests were used because of data nonnormality. A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare 3 groups, and Mann–Whitney test was used to compare two groups. For the within-group comparison over time, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. All secondary analyses, exploratory analyses, and immunologic analyses used a two-sided significance level of 5%. Analyses of clinical endpoints and primary immunologic endpoint were performed using SAS version 9.4 and R version 3.6. Analyses of secondary immunologic endpoints were calculated using Prism 8 software (GraphPad).</p>

                <title>Single-cell immunoprofiling</title>
                <p>To characterize the cellular landscape before and after DC/MM fusion vaccination, we performed single-cell immunoprofiling (5′ mRNA expression + V(D)J sequencing) using the 10× Genomics Chromium platform on samples collected at enrollment, 90 days posttransplant, following 2 vaccinations, and at 1-year posttransplant following 3 vaccinations. Briefly, cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and processed using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Kit v2 (10X Genomics) and loaded on a Chromium Next GEM Chip K for gene expression library preparation. Full-length paired α/β TCR libraries were obtained using the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment, Human T Cell kit. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina sequencer.</p>

                  <p>Cell Ranger v.4.0.0 was used for cell assignment and gene expression quantification. Gene expression libraries were loaded, and droplets were subsetted using mitochondrial content (&lt;20%), number of genes detected in each cell (250 &lt; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &lt; 5000), and total number of unique molecules detected within a cell (250 &lt; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &lt; 20,000). Samples derived from 13 vaccinated patients across 4 timepoints were integrated and utilized for cluster detection using Seurat v.3.2.3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; ref. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Variable genes were defined with the FindVariableFeatures function from Seurat, while dimensionality reduction was performed on the first 30 PCA-retrieved principal components (PC) and the top 2,000 variable genes. Cluster detection, two-dimensional representations, and batch-effect correction were performed with Harmony (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We applied Seurat's FindClusters and FindMarkers functions on the harmonized embeddings to define the distinct cell populations and the differentially expressed markers of each cluster, respectively. Cell type characterization was performed using SingleR (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), supported by domain expert manual annotation based on canonical markers for each lineage. Comparisons in cluster relative abundances were detected using a Dirichlet multinomial regression model, taking into account the distinct time points.</p>

The Shannon–Wiener Diversity Index was used to calculate diversity scores with the vegan package in R (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26, 27</xref>). Comparisons in the abundances of TCRs among the different time points were detected using a Dirichlet multinomial regression model, taking into account the distinct time points and the distinct TCR frequency thresholds, i.e., ∼Timepoint*TCR_frequency. GLIPH2 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was used to detect antigen-specific T-cell groups based on CDR3b sequences. A reference set of 840,162 distinct CDR3b sequences from CD4 and CD8-naïve T cells was utilized to extract clusters of β TCR sequences that share global or local motifs. High-confident TCR clonotype clusters were prioritized compared with the reference dataset (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 120, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Fisher exact test) and further refined to select groups with at least 3 CDR3b members in &gt;2 patients.

                <p>The study accrued patients from July 2016 to October 2018, with 203 patients enrolled from 18 participating centers. The study schema is depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. Sixty-three patients dropped out of the study from enrollment to randomization, concordant with the expected rate of 30% pre-specified in the protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays the demographic and baseline characteristics for 140 patients randomized by treatment group and demonstrates balanced distribution of disease prognostic factors between the assigned treatment cohorts (Supplementary table S1). High-risk features observed in the randomized patients included t(4,14), t(14,16), t(14,20), and deletion of 17p (totaling 8.8%); deletion 13/13q (8.8%);and abnormalities in 1p/1q (25.3%). Sixty-eight patients were randomized to DC/MM fusion vaccine/GM-CSF and lenalidomide maintenance, 37 to lenalidomide maintenance with GM-CSF, and 35 to the lenalidomide alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The percentage of patients randomized on stratum 1 (sCR/CR) and stratum 2 (VGPR/PR/stable disease) was 36.4% and 63.6%, respectively, and was balanced between the treatment arms. Median time from enrollment to transplant, transplant to randomization, and randomization to initiation of maintenance therapy was 5 months, 68 days, and 28 days, respectively. The median follow-up time was 26.7 months postrandomization.</p>

                <title>Vaccine generation</title>
                <p>A collaborative process was established for the standardization of vaccine manufacturing, including tumor cell harvest and cryopreservation, DC generation from leukapheresis collection, creation and quantification of the DC/tumor fusion vaccine, and the process of characterizing each of the cellular products. Site validation required successful production of DC/tumor fusions in two mock runs meeting requisite fusion efficiency and sterility parameters, as outlined in the study release criteria.</p>
                <p>Of the 140 patients undergoing randomization, the median percentage of plasma cells in bone marrow aspirate differential at time of enrollment was 45%. The mean CD86 expression and viability of the DC preparations were 80.6% and 79.3%, respectively. The mean fusion efficiency of the DC/MM product, as determined by coexpression of standard DC (CD86) and multiple myeloma (CD38) markers, was 47.9%. Mean fusion cell viability was 78.6%.</p>
                <p>Vaccines were successfully generated for 63 of 68 patients (93%) assigned to the vaccine arm of the study. Reasons for production failure (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4) included insufficiently viable final cell product (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3) and cell culture contamination (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1); these four patients were treated per the lenalidomide arm. One patient never initiated maintenance therapy and later died of disease progression. Sixty-three patients received vaccines, including 57 receiving three doses, 5 receiving two doses, and 1 receiving one dose.</p>

                <title>Clinical response</title>
                <p>Differences in rates of clinical response between the vaccine and control arms did not reach statistical significance. Thirty-six of the 68 (52.9%) evaluable patients on the vaccine arm [80% confidence interval (CI), 44.5–61.3] and 34 of the 68 (50.0%) of the nonvaccine arms (80% CI, 41.6–58.4) achieved best response of CR/sCR at 1-year posttransplant (difference in response rates 2.9%; 80% CI, −8.8%–14.6%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.3; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Of the patients not achieving CR at time of randomization posttransplant, conversion to CR at 1-year was 34.8% for the vaccine arm and 27.3% for the nonvaccine arm (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.4). Best response of VGPR or better at 1 year was achieved by 85.3% and 77.8% of patients on the vaccine and nonvaccine arms, respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.2). A secondary pairwise analysis of CR rates comparing the vaccine arm with each of the nonvaccine arms did not show a significant difference in CR rates. Assessment of MRD in the bone marrow was performed at 1-year posttransplant in patients without disease progression and with an adequate sample for analysis. In the vaccine arm, 38 of 53 (71.7%) achieved MRD-negative disease at 1-year posttransplant compared with 41 of 59 (69.5%) in the combined nonvaccine groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.80). At 2 years, PFS in the vaccine and nonvaccine arms was 79.3% (95% CI, 67.6–87.2) and 88.2% (95% CI, 77.8–93.9), respectively (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.168). OS was 97% and 98% at 2 years, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).</p>

                <p>Immunologic response was calculated by determining the peak change from baseline values, as well as quantification of MM-reactive T cells at 1-year posttransplant in each of the treatment cohorts. The peak change in tumor-reactive CD8 T cells from baseline for the vaccine, lenalidomide alone, and lenalidomide + GM-CSF arms were 5.29%, 0.21%, and 2.25%, respectively (Kruskal–Wallis test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.157, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The peak change of circulating CD8 T cells for vaccine and combined non-vaccine cohort was 5.29% and 0.68%, respectively (Mann–Whitney test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.065). At 1-year posttransplant, the median percentage of circulating multiple myeloma–reactive CD8 T cells was 5.80% for patients on the vaccine arm, 0.58% on the lenalidomide + GM-CSF arm, and 1.03% on the lenalidomide alone arm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Within the vaccine arm, there were statistically significant increases in multiple myeloma–reactive CD8 T cells following 3 vaccinations at 1-year posttransplant as compared to 2 time points prior to vaccination, prior to the initiation of lenalidomide maintenance and following one cycle of lenalidomide maintenance (Wilcoxon signed-rank test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.040, 0.024 respectively; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, within each of the control cohorts (lenalidomide + GM-CSF for 3 cycles and lenalidomide maintenance alone), there was no statistically significant increase in multiple myeloma–reactive CD8 T cells over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). At 1-year posttransplant, patients on the vaccine arm showed a statistically significant increase in the percentage of circulating multiple myeloma–reactive CD8 T cells as compared with the control arms (Mann–Whitney test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.026 for comparison of vaccine arm to combined nonvaccine arms). A statistically significant rise in multiple myeloma–reactive CD4 T cells was observed transiently after the second vaccination (1.39% at maintenance cycle 1 to 2.00% at cycle 3 with Wilcoxon signed-rank test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.029) but did not persist at 1-year posttransplant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
                <p>Further characterization of the T-cell repertoire was performed by single-cell transcriptomic analysis on a subset of 13 vaccinated patients with adequate samples for analysis. Assessment of serial peripheral blood samples from this initial cohort pre-/postvaccination differentiated key immune subsets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) and provided a detailed picture of the T-cell landscape, including subsets of regulatory, effector, and memory compartments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C–E</xref>).

              <p>There has been renewed interest in the potential for cancer vaccines to induce tumor-specific immunity within the native T-cell repertoire through the effective physiologic presentation of cancer antigens. The DC/tumor fusion vaccine has the potential advantages of inducing broad immunity against multiple antigens, including shared epitopes and neoepitopes that captures tumor heterogeneity (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 22</xref>). Administration of cancer vaccines during lymphopoietic reconstitution posttransplant associates with enhancement of multiple myeloma–specific immunity, targeting of residual disease, and prolongation of response (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
              <p>This multicenter randomized trial examined the clinical and immunologic impact of a personalized DC-based cancer vaccine administered with GM-CSF posttransplant in conjunction with lenalidomide maintenance, as compared to lenalidomide maintenance alone or with GM-CSF. Analysis of an initial cohort of 24 patients from the vaccine arm showed a statistically significant progressive and durable expansion of multiple myeloma–specific CD8 T cells following vaccination persisting at 1-year posttransplant. In contrast, a statistically significant expansion of multiple myeloma–specific CD8 T cells was absent in 21 patients following lenalidomide and GM-CSF or lenalidomide maintenance alone. At 1-year posttransplant, the vaccine arm showed a statistically higher median percentage of multiple myeloma–specific CD8 T cells of 5.80%, as compared with 0.70% for the combined nonvaccine group. Of note, the use of lenalidomide maintenance alone in the context of posttransplant lymphopoietic reconstitution did not result in the expansion of tumor-reactive clones in the peripheral circulation.</p>
              <p>Consistent with these observations, single-cell transcriptomics from an initial subset of vaccinated patients revealed the expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells, the recovery of clonal diversity, and the emergence of dominant TCRs within the activated CD8 T-cell compartment (clonotype frequency &gt; 20) corresponding to clonal expansion after vaccination. At 1 year, TCR signature clustering was observed within the CD8 effector memory and activated T-cell compartments in vaccinated patients. Concordance of dominant TCR signatures was observed across the vaccinated patient population and is indicative of shared immunogenic targets. These findings are consistent the emergence of dominant T-cell clones that may correlate with the presence of tumor-specific T cells and provide a unique platform to interrogate potential targets mediating long-term response. While transcriptomic analysis was not performed on the samples from the maintenance alone arm, the findings from patients undergoing vaccination indicative of clonal expansion of CD8 compartment are consistent with the expansion of multiple myeloma–reactive T cells observed in the vaccine but not maintenance alone arm.</p>
              <p>Although vaccine-mediated expansion of multiple myeloma–reactive T cells was observed at 1 year, this did not coincide with a statistically significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving CR at 1 year. The percentage of patients achieving CR + VGPR in the vaccine and nonvaccine arms was 85% and 77%, respectively, not reaching statistical significance. The percentage of patients who converted from partial response posttransplant to CR at 1 year was 34.8% and 27.3%, respectively, which also did not reach statistical significance. Vaccination in conjunction with lenalidomide maintenance was well-tolerated without manifestations of autoimmunity. The 2-year PFS did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the vaccine and nonvaccine arms. The clinical findings are limited by sample size in the study arms and the heterogeneity of the patient populations. Of note, 65% of the patient population met criteria for high-risk disease by cytogenetic classification that may have impacted response to immunotherapy. Importantly, the full clinical impact of vaccination and comparative changes in antitumor immunity will likely require longer follow-up.</p>
              <p>Previous studies of cancer vaccines have shown an association between vaccine-mediated immune response and long-term impact on disease-free survival (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31, 32</xref>). In the current trial, the durable expansion multiple myeloma–reactive T cells was not associated with a statistically significant improvement of CR rate at 1 year or PFS. Similarly, a recently reported phase II randomized trial of an idiotype based vaccine post-transplant for multiple myeloma, as compared with a KLH control, demonstrated upregulation of genes associated with memory and cytotoxicity and downregulation of regulatory T cell function in the vaccine arm without a statistically significant impact on the early response rate (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
              <p>CAR T-cell therapy has shown dramatic efficacy in patients with advanced multiple myeloma associated with high rates of response, clearance of minimal residual disease, and prolonged remissions (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>). However, the supraphysiologic mechanism of T-cell activation may be associated with exhaustion, loss of persistence, and subsequent tumor escape (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In contrast, cancer vaccines employ physiologic stimulation of the native T-cell repertoire to establish long-term memory but are dependent on the functional competence of the effector cell compartment and are countered by the surrounding immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic efficacy of vaccination may be mitigated by the upregulation of negative costimulatory receptors on T-cell populations indicative of an exhausted phenotype or the development of terminal differentiation leading to senescence and apoptosis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). In addition, elements within the immunologic milieu, including accessory cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells), immunosuppressive factors (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, IL10), and metabolic regulation (adenosine) may neutralize tumor-specific populations.</p>
              <p>While expansion of the MM-reactive T cells may be sufficient to buffer disease progression in settings of greater immune competence, vaccine-mediated modulation of the T-cell repertoire may require combinatorial strategies that target critical aspects of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. For example, vaccine efficacy is being examined in the context of checkpoint inhibition and immunoregulatory agents (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35, 36</xref>). In addition, engineered T-cell platforms such as CAR T cells are subject to resistant mechanisms but may synergize with vaccination by providing a pool of functionally competent T cells receptive to vaccine-induced physiologic stimulus for T-cell expansion and activation (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37–40</xref>). Similarly, T-cell engagers (TCE) have demonstrated significant potency in multiple myeloma by creating a synapse between activated T cells and multiple myeloma cells (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This effect may be further augmented and potentially prolonged through the introduction of vaccine-educated T cells as a substrate for TCE-mediated tumor localization and TCR-mediated lysis. As such, we have demonstrated that administration of the DC/MM hybridomas posttransplant induces the durable expansion of multiple myeloma–reactive T cells against shared epitopes and provides a critical step in the development of combination immunotherapy reliant on multiple myeloma–specific effector cells.</p>
              <p>An important objective of this study was to determine the practicality of performing a personalized cellular immunotherapy trial as a multi-institutional academic endeavor sharing unique national expertise in cell production, vaccine characterization, and platforms for immune response analysis. Site-specific vaccine generation mirrors the process by which hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is accomplished. A critical factor is the development of clear criteria for site training and validation, shared standards of practice and reagents for vaccine production, and centralized verification of vaccine characterization. For the current study, vaccine production was successfully completed for 63 of 68 participants across 18 different centers. The trial sets an important precedent for cell-based therapeutics in an academic framework that will facilitate combined or sequential interventions for immune-based therapy for cancer.</p>
