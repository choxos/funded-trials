                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Oklahoma’s cumulative COVID-19 incidence is higher in rural than urban counties and higher than the overall US incidence. Furthermore, fewer Oklahomans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine compared to the US average. Our goal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to test multiple educational interventions to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among underserved populations in Oklahoma.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Our study uses the preparation and optimization phases of the MOST framework. We conduct focus groups among community partners and community members previously involved in hosting COVID-19 testing events to inform intervention design (preparation). In a randomized clinical trial, we test three interventions to improve vaccination uptake: (1) process improvement (text messages); (2) barrier elicitation and reduction (electronic survey with tailored questions/prompts); and (2) teachable moment messaging (motivational interviewing) in a three-factor fully crossed factorial design (optimization).</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Because of Oklahoma’s higher COVID-19 impact and lower vaccine uptake, identifying community-driven interventions is critical to address vaccine hesitancy. The MOST framework provides an innovative and timely opportunity to efficiently evaluate multiple educational interventions in a single study.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">As of February 2023, 1,281,551 cases of COVID-19 and 17,827 deaths have occurred in Oklahoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Oklahoma’s cumulative mortality is higher in rural (430 per 100,000) compared to urban (320 per 100,000) counties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is particularly problematic due to the current state of rural healthcare including the lack of providers and recent closure of many rural hospitals in Oklahoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Even before the pandemic, rural healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and hospitals were under stress that threatened care delivery in these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rural providers and hospitals are often under-resourced; and the existing health disparities in rural America that exacerbate COVID-19 cases may further strain capacity in these settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Oklahoma is a highly rural state with 1.3 million residents (33%) living in rural areas in 2021, more than twice the national average of 14% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. High rates of tobacco use, obesity, poor health literacy, and other health risk factors, often compounded by the additional distance required to access care and an older population, contribute to the high incidence and mortality rates for a range of chronic conditions among underserved rural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Over 6.7 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Oklahoma, with 75% of the population having received one dose, 60% fully vaccinated with the primary vaccine series, and 11% with an updated bivalent booster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Vaccine uptake is particularly low in the southeastern and northwestern areas of the state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy when initially developing our project in April 2021 was concern about vaccine side effects and safety (30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other reasons for hesitation included waiting for more data/information (15%), lack of trust in government (13%), and concerns about how rapidly vaccines have been developed (10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>

              <p id="Par8">The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges to health communication and messaging, with limited knowledge about what interventions are most effective in increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Studies have indicated that tailored, community-engaged approaches are necessary to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly in rural and underserved communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This emphasizes the need for studies to evaluate tailored, community-based interventions through multiple modalities, including text messages, written educational messaging, and personal interactions with community members to determine the most effective strategies for reducing vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccine uptake.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Conceptually rooted in engineering, MOST (multiphase optimization strategy) emphasizes incremental, evidence-based advancement in intervention science to ensure optimal COVID-19 vaccine uptake in underserved populations. The goal of MOST is to identify interventions that are effective, economical, efficient, and scalable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To understand which interventions are most effective, we use MOST to address the following research aims: (1) Identify COVID-19 vaccination barriers/facilitators and assess acceptability and feasibility of a suite of evidence-based vaccine intervention strategies among Oklahoma’s rural, minority, and high-risk populations to inform a targeted multicomponent intervention; and (2) Develop and optimize a multicomponent intervention to improve COVID-19 vaccination among Oklahoman’s seeking COVID-19 testing events.</p>

                <p id="Par10">This project is an extension of a COVID-19 testing project, which included both viral and antibody point-of-care testing, funded through the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics – Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) initiative through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. CATCH-UP (Community - engaged Approaches to Testing in Community and Healthcare Settings for Underserved Populations) Vaccines has a goal of addressing vaccine hesitancy in Oklahoma and was funded as a supplement to the CATCH-UP grant (which is a supplement to the Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources parent grant). The parent CATCH-UP project works closely with our community partner, Public Health Institute of Oklahoma (PHIO), to identify partners interested in providing COVID-19 testing in their communities either through hosting dedicated events or sponsoring booths at broader events. Most of the CATCH-UP events prior to 2022 offered viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and/or rapid antigen-based testing. Some events also included serology testing by lateral-flow assays (LFA), which proved to be highly popular and was a major driving force for community acceptance of the CATCH-UP events. While LFA tests are not recommended for clinical-decision making, the CATCH-UP researchers observed that they did provide a convenient entry-point for discussions about the need for vaccination, particularly among individuals who had either documented cases of COVID-19 or believed they may have contracted the virus early in the pandemic and were undecided about vaccination. Due to these factors, our team decided to develop our vaccine hesitancy intervention around testing events and build on the program implemented through CATCH-UP.</p>

We recruit focus group participants in conjunction with testing events and through conversations with community leaders prior to testing events. Focus groups: (1) explore vaccine-related concerns and motivators, (2) evaluate educational material for local and cultural acceptability; and (3) examine outreach and communication intervention strategies detailed in the NIH COVID-19 Vaccination Communication white paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] for feasibility to be implemented at later testing events.</p>

Focus groups examine barriers and facilitators to vaccination within each community (e.g., perceptions of COVID-19 severity, vaccine concerns, vaccine availability/accessibility, competing priorities, etc.). Educational material is examined for local and cultural acceptability. Participants are presented with several vaccine interventions selected by the team for demonstrated efficacy as well as likely acceptability among Oklahoma communities. Responses to selected interventions are elicited, with special attention to perceived effectiveness and acceptability within their respective communities, barriers to/facilitators of implementation, and needed modifications for local/cultural relevance. We ask participants to complete a brief demographic survey that is de-identified. We expect to enroll a maximum of 60 focus group participants (approximately 6 participants per focus group).</p>

                <p id="Par28">Interventions address three primary areas to improve vaccination uptake (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The intervention period of the study is expected to take 15–30 min. Participants may be randomized to receive all three factors (treatment), all three control factors, or any combination of treatment/control (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). All participants have the opportunity to receive point-of-care LFA serology antibody testing using a finger stick, but this is not required for participation. The test takes 15 min to process and will return immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody response, allowing a semi-quantitative interpretation ranging from no antibody response to a strong positive antibody response based on darkness of the indicator. While the nature of the LFA is qualitative for the presence of IgG or IgM antibodies, the strength of the response correlates well to recent viral exposure or vaccination. While not used for diagnostic purposes, this semi-quantitative nature does provide the opportunity to encourage individuals that are out-of-date for vaccination to receive a booster shot. Following CDC recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the test is not used to assess vaccination status and we recommend all individuals to receive vaccinations irrespective of their test results in order to provide maximal protection. While participants are waiting for the results, the participants receive the interventions.</p>

The text language differs depending on whether vaccines are available at the event. If vaccines are available: “[First name], think about getting your COVID-19 vaccine at the event today.

                <p id="Par30">Participants are randomized to receive (1) educational messaging about COVID-19 vaccines (treatment) or (2) attention control educational message not related to COVID-19 (control). These messages are delivered on a tablet through REDCap and are tailored to vaccine-related concerns that participants report in the pre-intervention survey. Vaccine-specific educational messages use reputable COVID-19 resources from the National Institutes of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The attention control message focuses on general health and wellness from the Shape Your Future website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and does not address the COVID-19 vaccine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). While we initially planned to format these messages with engaging images (e.g., photographs and cartoons), initial testing identified challenges in bandwidth availability for the larger file sizes in both rural and urban areas. Thus, the final versions are text-based.</p>

                <title>Motivational interviewing</title>
                <p id="Par32">Participants are randomized to receive feedback on their antibody tests by one of these methods: (1) receive interpretation of their antibody results and participate in a motivational interview encouraging vaccine uptake following the 5 A’s strategy (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) using a semi-structured format (treatment) or (2) interpretation of antibody test results and encouragement of vaccine uptake (as per standard practice) without further prompting by the investigators about reasons to not receive a vaccine (control). The treatment group receives tailored messaging based on concerns reported in the pre-intervention survey that are identical to the messages reviewed in the tailored messaging intervention (if assigned to the treatment group for that intervention). During pilot intervention events, personnel make notes regarding any deviations from the semi-structured script or assigned treatment arm (e.g., some participants may decline to discuss the vaccine) to improve this factor at future events.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Example text interpreting the antibody tests results for a participant with low IgG antibodies, no IgM antibodies, and no history of a COVID-19 vaccine: “Your test results are similar to [show image like theirs]. This image [show high IgG image] is what we would expect to see if you had either had a recent infection with COVID-19 or were up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccines. The faint red line (next to IgG on the participant’s test) means that your antibodies are low because of not being exposed to COVID-19 recently and not being vaccinated. This means that your body is not as prepared to fight a COVID-19 infection as it could be.” Those randomized to the intervention group are further asked if they would like to discuss the vaccine (Ask), discuss their concerns using evidence-based vaccine messaging (as in the Tailored Messaging component) (Advise), ask if they are ready to receive a vaccine that day (Assess), provide guidance to access a vaccine (Assist), inform participant about future follow-up surveys that will also include information on how to access vaccines (Arrange). If participants decline to participate in any step of the 5 A’s, we end the intervention, thank the participant for their time, and encourage vaccine uptake.</p>

The screening form collects age and vaccine history (manufacturer, number of doses, dates received). The pre-intervention survey requests demographics (race, ethnicity, sex, occupation, county of residence), likelihood of receiving an approved COVID-19 vaccine or booster (if fully vaccinated with the primary series), and reasons to and not to get a vaccine.</p>

                <p id="Par35">Once the interventions are complete, the participants complete a brief exit survey that repeats the questions about intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine or booster and reasons to and not to get a vaccine. The survey is re-sent to participants through text message at 30 and 60 days after the intervention. In addition, we request participants self-report whether they received a vaccine since the intervention. We send up to three daily reminders to the participant to complete the 30- and 60-day follow-up surveys. After the intervention is complete, participants are also sent a survey required by NIH to collect the RADx-UP Common Data Elements through text message or email, with follow-up daily for up to three days after the initial survey invitation is sent.</p>
                <p id="Par36">To evaluate the intervention, we contact up to 60 participants who have agreed to future contact to participate in an interview to help the personnel determine what did and did not work well during the intervention. The interview lasts 30 min to one-hour.</p>
                <p id="Par37">At all events, key personnel conduct a field observation of how the events flow, including external factors such as weather or logistical problems, and where challenges to implementing the study or recruiting participants occurred. At the conclusion of all events, we will conduct evaluation focus groups with event site staff to determine what did and did not work during the event.</p>

                <p id="Par39">All analyses are intent-to-treat. Outcome measures are assessed at baseline, 30 days, and 60 days follow-up. At the outset, we will examine the frequency distributions of all variables. We will compare the baseline characteristics to assess whether randomization distributed covariates evenly. We will determine whether there is differential dropout and consider developing probability-of-completion weights to obtain unbiased estimates of treatment effect.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The primary analysis will assess the effects of each intervention component in terms of its association with the primary outcome (intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine immediately after the interventions are completed), comparing each intervention individually with the outcome. The primary outcome question is ordinal, with responses ranging from “very likely” to “definitely not”. We will analyze this variable as continuous and calculate the difference in score pre v. post intervention. For binary association analysis, we will use chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests (when sample size is small) for categorical variables and two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, whichever is more appropriate, for continuous variables. If there are no significant differences in covariates by intervention group, we will use one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, if there are significant differences in covariates across intervention groups, we will use multiple linear regression to compare the difference in intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by intervention group accounting for potential confounders. We will evaluate the assumptions for linear regression and transform data as appropriate. Missing values are excluded from the analysis. All analyses will use an alpha of 0.05 and are conducted in SAS v. 9.4 (Cary, NC).</p>

We expect to recruit 400 participants during the study. A sample size of 80 (control group plus one intervention group) achieves above 85% power to detect an R-Squared of 0.1 attributed to one independent variable (binary indicator of control or intervention group) using an F-Test with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05. The variables tested are adjusted for an additional 1 to 5 independent variables with an R-Squared of 0.1. Since we expect to recruit 400 participants during the study, we expect to have more than 80 participants for the combination of control group and any intervention group.

              <p id="Par44">We expect to obtain information on interventions that are likely to increase uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines from both focus group data and discussions with key informants in the partnering communities. We anticipate that information obtained from pilot interventions will provide insights in improving interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake in underserved communities. This study will focus on designing and testing a multilevel process of improving COVID-19 vaccine uptake, but it will not have the resources to assess the underlying details of individual care steps closely. For example, this study will not provide a detailed examination of the processes underlying clinical decision support, academic detailing, etc., as exploration of these outcomes would require resources that go beyond the scope of the present study. However, community experience in vaccine uptake will be explored through robust qualitative inquiries to elucidate cultural values, preferences, and needs related to COVID-19 vaccine uptake that are specific to underserved populations in Oklahoma. Our study purposefully incorporates community-based collaborations that can be replicated in other settings (e.g., diversifying the skills of existing personnel and building upon exiting infrastructure) to ensure generalizability.</p>
              <p id="Par45">There is always some uncertainty in how the landscape of vaccination for COVID-19 will change over time, including resources, personnel, infrastructure, leadership, and eligibility for vaccination. However, our team has shown in past studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] that it is possible to minimize the impact of time-bound uncertainties on the success of community-engaged health improvement programs by establishing durable relationships and engagement with stakeholders and ongoing adaptation to their needs. Incentivizing community participation in research is always a challenge. However, we have carefully aligned this study with the internal goals and ongoing strategic healthcare programs of our community partners, so leadership buy-in has already been accomplished. The study team will work closely with our community partners to find ways to provide additional support that may help community partners continue participation if they experience unforeseen challenges.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Compared to the US overall, Oklahoma has lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake, particularly in rural areas of the state. Thus, it is important to identify community-driven and community-delivered interventions to address vaccine hesitancy. The MOST framework provides an innovative and timely opportunity to efficiently evaluate multiple educational interventions in a single study and is also being applied in COVID-19 testing interventions in underserved communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
