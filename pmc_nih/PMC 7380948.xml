                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Preclinical data suggest cell cycle checkpoint blockade may induce an immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment. However, it remains elusive whether immunomodulation occurs in the clinical setting. To test this, we used blood and fresh tissue samples collected at baseline and post therapy from a phase II trial of the cell cycle checkpoint 1 inhibitor (CHK1i) prexasertib in recurrent ovarian cancer.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Paired blood samples and fresh core biopsies, taken before treatment was started at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)) and post second dose on day 15 of cycle 1 (C1D15), were collected. To evaluate changes in the immune responses after treatment, multiparametric flow cytometry for DNA damage markers and immune cell subsets was performed on paired blood samples. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of paired core biopsies was also analyzed. Archival tissue immune microenvironment was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. All correlative study statistical analyses used two-sided significance with a cut-off of p=0.05.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Flow cytometric analysis showed significantly increased Î³-H2AX staining after CHK1i treatment, accompanied by increased monocyte populations, suggestive of an activated innate immune response (median 31.6% vs 45.6%, p=0.005). Increased expressions of immunocompetence marker HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte Antigen DR antigen) on monocytes and of <italic>TBK1,</italic> a marker of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway activation, in biopsies were associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) (9.25 vs 3.5 months, p=0.019; 9 vs 3 months, p=0.003, respectively). Computational analysis of RNAseq data indicated increased infiltration of tumor niches by naÃ¯ve B-cells and resting memory T-cells, suggestive of a possibly activated adaptive immune response, and greater T-reg infiltration after treatment correlated with worse PFS (9.25 vs 3.5 months, p=0.007). An immunosuppressive adaptive immune response, perhaps compensatory, was also observed on flow cytometry, including lymphodepletion of total peripheral CD4+ and CD8+T cells after CHK1i and an increase in the proportion of T-regs among these T-cells. Additionally, there was a trend of improved PFS with greater tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in archival tissues (13.7 months &gt;30% TILs vs 5.5 months â¤30% TILs, p=0.05).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Our study demonstrates that a favorable clinical response in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients treated with CHK1i is possibly associated with enhanced innate and adaptive immunity, requiring further mechanistic studies. It is supportive of current efforts for a clinical development strategy for therapeutic combinations with immunotherapy in ovarian cancer.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Ovarian carcinoma accounts for the majority of gynecologic cancer deaths in the USA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common subtype of ovarian cancer and typically presents as advanced disease with a high frequency of recurrence, requiring new effective therapeutic strategies. The molecular characteristics of HGSOC include universal <italic>TP53</italic> dysfunction that disrupts the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint. This leaves the cells heavily dependent on cell cycle checkpoint-mediated G2-M arrest for DNA repair.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which regulates the G2-M checkpoint, is overexpressed in nearly all HGSOC,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> making it a rational target to induce DNA damage and tumor cell death.</p>
              <p>CHK1 is activated by the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinases in response to DNA damage or replication stress.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> On activation, CHK1 phosphorylates and inhibits its substrates, M-phase inducer phosphatases 1 (CDC25A) and 3 (CDC25C), which led to cell cycle arrest at the G2-M checkpoint.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â6</xref> This allows for DNA damage repair and stabilization of stalled replication forks, without which double-stranded DNA breaks and consequent cell death would occur.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Prexasertib, the second-generation CHK1 inhibitor (CHK1i), has been reported to induce DNA damage and apoptosis in numerous preclinical models including ovarian cancer.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8â10</xref></p>
              <p>Preclinical data also suggest that the efficacy of CHK1 inhibition may be associated with innate and adaptive immunomodulation, although studies are limited, particularly in ovarian cancer. It has been shown that both CHK1 and ATR activation after DNA damage leads to upregulation of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> potentially via the STAT/IRF1 pathway.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In vitro work in osteosarcoma, prostate and lung cancer models demonstrated that PD-L1 expression induced by ionizing radiation-related DNA damage was thereby downregulated by CHK1i.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> ATR inhibition also has been shown to decrease PD-L1 expression, sensitizing tumor cells to T-cell-mediated killing.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Recently, Sen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported that DNA repair inhibition, such as with the CHK1i prexasertib, causes increased DNA damage and accumulation of broken DNA fragments in the cytoplasm. Cytosolic DNA fragments can then bind to cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leading to upregulation of the cGAS-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> The STING pathway is a potent activator of type I interferons (IFN) and elicits both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses, including increased production of immunostimulatory cytokines and recruitment of T-cells.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13â18</xref></p>
              <p>However, while CHK1 inhibition enhanced anti-tumor CD8+T cell infiltration, it was also reported to increase endogenous immunosuppressive PD-L1 expression, enabling synergy with anti-PD-L1 therapy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These varying results reflect a complex biology as well as different experimental conditions and thus highlight the need for further studies in the context of immunomodulation in the clinical setting. We recently reported promising clinical activity of the CHK1i prexasertib in heavily pre-treated <italic>BRCA</italic> wild-type (<italic>BRCA</italic>wt) patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the present study, we hypothesized that CHK1i may have induced both innate and adaptive immune responses in addition to its effect on the cell cycle regulation, thus contributing to the observed clinical activity in ovarian cancer patients. To test this hypothesis, we investigated changes in the peripheral and tumoral innate and adaptive immune responses in patients treated with CHK1i monotherapy using paired pre-treatment and post-therapy blood and tissue samples. We now report the increases in cellular and molecular markers of innate and adaptive immunity by CHK1i monotherapy that correlated with a favorable clinical response.</p>

                <p>This single arm proof-of-concept phase II study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, Maryland, USA, and written informed consent was obtained from participating patients. Comprehensive enrollment criteria have previously been published.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Briefly, eligible patients had recurrent HGSOC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2 and good end-organ function. The <italic>BRCA</italic>wt HGSOC cohort completed enrollment in November 2016 for which details were published and data from that cohort are used for this pilot project.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation HGSOC cohort is currently enrolling the patients (NCT02203513). There was no limit on number of prior therapies, however, patients had to have at least 4 weeks wash-out period from their last treatment. Clinical study details, including drug administration, safety, adverse events, and tumor response in the <italic>BRCA</italic>wt HGSOC cohort have been reported<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the schema for treatment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>. Paired blood samples, taken before treatment was started at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)) and 6 to 24 hours post second dose on day 15 of cycle 1 (C1D15), were collected from all patients. Pre-treatment and C1D15 percutaneous core biopsies were obtained by interventional radiologists under CT or ultrasound guidance using local anesthesia. All core biopsy samples were processed immediately in real time into optimal cutting temperature compound and stored at â80Â°C prior to analysis. Paraffin-embedded archival tissue samples from the time of original diagnosis were obtained at trial enrollment for immunohistochemistry as fresh frozen biopsy samples did not yield evaluable immunohistochemistry findings.</p>

                <p>Cells were incubated with Fc receptor blocking agent (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and stained with monoclonal antibodies for 20 min at 4Â°C. For intracellular staining for Foxp3 and Ki67 expression, cells were fixed and permeabilized using a Fix/Perm buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, then stained with anti-Foxp3 or anti-Ki67 antibody. Live cells were discriminated by means of LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Life Technologies, New York, USA) and dead cells were excluded from the analysis. All analyzes were performed using multiparametric flow cytometry (MACSQuant; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and data were analyzed using FlowJo software âV.10.0.7 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, Oregon, USA). Gating was first performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with doublet exclusion and then on viable cells. CD8+ or CD4+T cells were further gated for functional markers PD-1, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR), Human Leukocyte Antigen DR antigen (HLA-DR), inducible T-cell costimulatory (ICOS) or Ki-67. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) were defined as CD11b+CD14+HLA-DR-CD15-, early-stage MDSCs (E-MDSCs) as CD11b+CD3-CD14-CD15-CD19-CD56-HLA-DR-CD33+ and polymorphonuclear MSDCs (PMN-MDSCs) as CD11b+CD14 CD15+. For monocytes, total monocytes were subdivided by CD14 and CD16 expression: classical monocytes (CD14 ++CD16â); non-classical monocytes (CD14 +CD16++); and intermediate monocytes (CD14 ++CD16+).

                <p>Total RNA was isolated from pre-treatment and available C1D15 fresh-frozen core biopsies using the RNeasy microkit (Qiagen). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA integrity number (RIN) values were ensured to be &gt;8.0. For total RNA sequencing (RNAseq), each sample (20 to 100 ng) was preprocessed with NEBnext rDNA depletion kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) to remove ribosomal RNA, then barcoded and pooled to ensure at least 100 million reads per sample on a HiSeq3000 sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). The human reference genome Hg38 was used to align reads and gene expression data were generated as counts per million mapped reads (CPM) values. Quality check of sample and sequencing outputs were performed by the CCR sequencing facility and CCR collaborative bioinformatics resource at NCI, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. As previously described,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> RNAseq data of normal ovarian tissues were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx project, NIH; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/">https://www.gtexportal.org/home/</ext-link>, last accessed on January 13, 2019) as Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM) values and then converted to CPM values using the formula RPKM=CPM/L, where L is the exonic length in kilobases. Log2 of CPM values were used throughout. Biopsies determined to be derived from normal tissue were excluded from analysis.

                <p>Pre-treatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 24 patients were sent to Johns Hopkins Hospital for pathologic correlative studies; the tissue from one patient (Study ID 40) was inadequate for correlative studies due to tissue preservation. H&amp;E-stained slides of the tissue samples from the remaining 23 patients were evaluated to confirm the pathologic diagnosis of high-grade ovarian carcinoma and to score the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TIL were scored as the percentage (0% to 100%) of tumor stroma area occupied by mononuclear inflammatory cells, as previously described.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> TILs were not scored in tumor specimens lacking stroma, that is, those specimens consisting entirely of detached fragments of carcinoma cells without interface to adjacent stroma. The presence of TAM was recorded as: score 0 (absent), score 1 (focal, largely confined to papillary cores), score 2 (non-focal, involving both papillary cores and tumorous stroma), and score 3 (diffuse, involving papillary cores, tumorous stroma, and carcinoma cell nests). Immunohistochemistry for CD68 (Clone KP1, Dako; Bond RX, Bond Polymer Refine Detection) was performed on all cases to confirm the histologic impression of TAM.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
                <p>Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed manually on unstained slides (PD-L1 clone SP142, 0.096 Âµg/mL concentration; Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, California, USA), as described.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Specifically, the Spring Bioscience PD-L1 clone SP142 was used with a laboratory-developed assay validated against the labeling results of comparable assays.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Briefly, slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated using standard methods. Antigen retrieval was performed in pH 6.0 CB buffer in a decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA, USA), and slides were treated with peroxidase, protein, avidin, and biotin blocking, and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Slides were then treated with a biotin-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1 Âµg/Âµl concentration). The signal was developed with horseradish peroxidase using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA), amplified using a Tyramide Signal Amplification PLUS Biotin KIT (dilution 1:50; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), and visualized by 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB). PD-L1 labeling of carcinoma cells was evaluated in all cases and was scored as percentage (0% to 100%) of malignant cells with membranous labeling, with a cut-off of <underline>&gt;</underline>1% carcinoma cell labeling considered positive.</p>

                <p>Comparison of correlative markers were performed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (for unpaired analyses) or a non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test (for paired analyses) using GraphPad Prism, V.6. Immunohistochemistry data analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel (t-test) or GraphPad Online (Fisherâs exact test). The significance of difference between Kaplan-Meier survival curves was compared with a Mantel-Cox log-rank test. All statistical tests used two-sided significance with a cut-off of p=0.05 and are reported without adjustment for multiple comparisons due to the small study cohort and exploratory nature of this analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Immune responses to the DNA-damaging drugs is a complex process involving multiple elements within the tumor microenvironment. Thus, it is necessary to translate preclinical findings of immune modulation with CHK1i into the clinical setting given the immune microenvironment observed in preclinical models are often not translatable to humans. We hypothesized that CHK1i would induce DNA damage by impairing the DNA damage repair response pathway, leading to increased tumor immunogenicity in ovarian cancer. For this, we used a variety of methods including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and RNAseq to assess the immune landscape of paired clinical trial patient samples before and after treatment. Our exploratory studies indicate increased DNA damage in immune cells of patients treated with prexasertib, enhanced innate and adaptive immune activity, and a potentially compensatory immunosuppressive response.</p>
              <p>The role of the innate immune response in malignancy and the tumor immune microenvironment has been well characterized. MDSCs play an immunosuppressive role and are associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> On the other hand, anti-tumor effects of activated monocytes have been reported. In the presence of a tumor, monocytes differentiate into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages which inhibit tumor proliferation, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and promote NK cell differentiation for enhanced cytotoxicity.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Here, we report that CHK1i treatment led to an increase in the percentage of monocytes among total PBMCs. Moreover, the association between patients with increased HLA-DR positive monocytes and improved PFS suggests that immunocompetent monocytes may contribute to the anti-tumor activity of prexasertib. The STING pathway has been implicated in driving an innate immune response after CHK1i treatment.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 39â41</xref> We therefore evaluated changes in mRNA expression levels of key genes related to the STING pathway and PFS. Patients with increased post-treatment expression of TBK1, a downstream protein critical for production of type I IFNs, had improved PFS, indicating STING-pathway activation and innate immunity may be associated with duration of response to CHK1i.</p>
              <p>This highlights the question of whether CHK1i also induces alterations in the adaptive immune response leading to clinical benefit in patients. Several studies have shown an association between the presence of TILs and improved patient survival in ovarian cancer.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> In the present study, although we observed increased naÃ¯ve B-cell and resting memory T-cell infiltration after CHK1i treatment by CIBERSORT,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> neither was associated with PFS. However, a greater proportion of T-reg infiltration after treatment correlated with worse PFS, consistent with previous reports.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 45</xref> These findings further indicate cross-talk between cell cycle checkpoint inhibition and the adaptive immune response and warrant additional investigation.</p>
              <p>Recently, Sen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported that CHK1i treatment enhanced anti-tumor adaptive immunity in a STING-dependent manner but in turn led to upregulation of the immunosuppressive cell surface marker PD-L1. We did not observe increases in PD-L1 expression in our RNAseq analysis. However, it is worth noting the possible immunosuppressive adaptive immune changes after CHK1i treatment, requiring further mechanistic studies. Specifically, flow cytometry analysis of PBMCs revealed peripheral lymphodepletion of CD4+ and CD8+T cells, consistent with the leukopenia observed in patients on treatment<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> as well as either selective repopulation with T-regs or selective depletion of effector T-cells in patient samples.</p>
              <p>To date, no validated biomarkers have been defined to guide CHK1i therapy. The presence of TILs at diagnosis, but not TAMs, has been associated with improved overall survival in ovarian cancer.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Our biomarker data also suggest a prognostic association between greater archival tissue TILs, but not TAMs, with longer PFS. This finding should be prospectively tested in a randomized setting for its predictive potential for CHK1i response. Limitations of our study include its small size, the post hoc exploratory nature of this analysis, and all tests reported are without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Therefore, all findings should be interpreted with caution and will need to be validated in a larger, prospective setting. Additionally, while flow cytometry-based detection of Î³-H2AX is a validated tool to detect DNA damage and is supported by the observed lymphodepletion after treatment with prexasertib,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> we were unable to confirm CHK1i-induced DNA damage by tissue immunofluorescence due to limited available tissue samples.</p>
              <p>The CHK1i prexasertib has marked clinical activity in women with recurrent <italic>BRCA</italic>wt HGSOC.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Our exploratory translational studies are the first to report increased DNA damage and depletion of peripheral lymphocytes while apparently activating specific immune subsets that contribute to innate and adaptive immunity in ovarian cancer patients treated with prexasertib. These findings provide insights into the biological effect of CHK1i and present the opportunity to identify potential therapeutic immunotherapy combinations. Further clinical exploration of biomarkers is warranted.</p>
