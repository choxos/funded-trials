                <p>Food-related emotional expectancies influence food intake, yet little is known about their determinants. The present study objectives were to experimentally test how food advertisements affect food-related emotional expectancies in adults and whether effects differed by individual levels of “food addiction” symptoms. Participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 718; <italic toggle="yes">M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 35.88, 36.8% with food addiction) were randomly assigned to watch video advertisements for highly processed foods, minimally processed foods, both food groups, or cellphones (control). Participants completed an attention check and questionnaires including the Anticipated Effects of Food Scale. Main effects of condition were non-significant. In participants with fewer symptoms of food addiction, watching video advertisements for highly processed foods increased expectancies that one would feel positive emotions while eating those foods, <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">SE</italic>) = 0.40(0.16), <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.016, 95% CI (0.08, 0.72), <italic toggle="yes">ΔR</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.03. Highly processed food advertisements may affect food-related emotional expectancies in adults who have not previously formed strong expectancies.</p>

              <p>Many people overeat highly processed foods (e.g. cheeseburger sandwiches, fries, milkshakes), designed to be particularly rewarding through the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates (<xref rid="bibr29-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al., 2015</xref>). Overeating highly processed foods displaces intake of minimally processed foods (e.g. berries, pecans, plain yogurt), which are more natural and contain health-promoting nutrients (<xref rid="bibr2-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Ayton et al., 2021</xref>). This pattern of food intake may result in lower diet quality, which robustly increases risk of non-communicable chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer (<xref rid="bibr32-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Schwingshackl et al., 2018</xref>). Applying psychological theory to the study of food intake may reveal critical information into why individuals overeat highly processed foods and undereat minimally processed foods. Understanding food intake is paramount given the high prevalence of non-communicable chronic diseases globally (<xref rid="bibr15-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Habib and Saha, 2010</xref>).</p>

                <title>Expectancy theory</title>
                <p>A long-standing psychological theory applied to understand health-related behaviors is Expectancy Theory, which posits that through social and personal learning individuals develop memories of behavior outcomes, known as “expectancies,” and these expectancies impact their future behavior (<xref rid="bibr3-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">James, 1890</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Tolman, 1949</xref>). For example, by watching others experience or by personally experiencing strong positive emotions when drinking alcohol, one may expect this outcome and be predisposed to drink more frequently and heavily (<xref rid="bibr14-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Goldman et al., 1999</xref>). Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental evidence support the tenets of Expectancy Theory in explaining several health-related behaviors including alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use (<xref rid="bibr6-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Buckner and Schmidt, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Montes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Morean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Scott-Sheldon et al., 2012</xref>) and disordered eating (<xref rid="bibr1-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Annus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
                <p>Expectancy Theory may apply to other eating behaviors including overeating highly processed foods and undereating minimally processed foods. Food-related emotional expectancies—the anticipated positively- and negatively-valenced emotional outcomes of eating different foods (distinct from more general expectancies about eating)—may especially be relevant to understanding food intake (<xref rid="bibr9-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2020</xref>). In a cross-sectional study, stronger expectancies that one will feel positive emotions while eating highly processed foods and negative emotions while eating minimally processed foods were associated with greater intake of highly processed foods (<xref rid="bibr9-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2020</xref>). In a randomized experiment, increasing expectancies that one would feel positive emotions while eating highly processed food increased intake of those foods at the expense of minimally processed foods (<xref rid="bibr8-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

                <title>Determinants of food-related emotional expectancies</title>
                <p>Although food-related emotional expectancies have explained patterns of food intake, little is known about their determinants. Research on alcohol expectancies suggests that expectancies begin forming in childhood and become relatively stable by adulthood (<xref rid="bibr10-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Dunn and Goldman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Goldman, 1994</xref>); however, the situational-specificity hypothesis proposes that relevant situations can shift expectancies after they are formed, influencing behavior in the moment (<xref rid="bibr40-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 2000</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, being in a bar versus neutral space led college students to have greater positive alcohol expectancies (<xref rid="bibr22-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Monk and Heim, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bibr41-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Being in a simulated fast-food restaurant caused college students to have greater positive highly-processed food expectancies (<xref rid="bibr8-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2021</xref>), yet no other situational influences on food-related emotional expectancies have been explored.</p>
                <p>Food advertising, which is an activity an organization engages in to facilitate an exchange between its food products and customers, is widespread (<xref rid="bibr35-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Story and French, 2004</xref>) and may impact food-related emotional expectancies. Food-related organizations in the United States are the leading buyers of television, newspaper, magazine, billboard, and radio advertising (<xref rid="bibr35-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Story and French, 2004</xref>), spending almost $13 billion per year (<xref rid="bibr37-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, 2017</xref>). More than 80% of food advertising promotes highly processed foods (<xref rid="bibr37-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, 2017</xref>), although there is public interest in minimally processed food advertising as a strategy to improve diet quality (<xref rid="bibr19-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Kraak et al., 2006</xref>). Regardless of food type, marketers design food advertisements to promote viewers’ association of positive emotions with the specific food advertised (<xref rid="bibr25-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Page and Brewster, 2009</xref>). As a result, highly and minimally processed food advertisements may shift corresponding food-related emotional expectancies to be more positive and less negative.</p>

                <title>Individual differences</title>
                <p>Food advertisements may differentially affect food-related emotional expectancies in individuals with and without “food addiction,” a phenotype marked by strong cravings for highly processed foods, diminished control over their intake, and overconsumption despite negative consequences including clinically-significant distress and diet-related disease (<xref rid="bibr30-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Schulte and Gearhardt, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al., 2015</xref>). Individuals with elevated food addiction symptoms hold stronger food-related emotional expectancies, particularly expectancies that one will feel positive emotions while eating highly processed foods and negative emotions while eating minimally processed foods (<xref rid="bibr9-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2020</xref>). In response to highly processed food images and anticipated receipt of highly processed food, individuals with food addiction have shown greater neural activation in reward-related regions compared to control (<xref rid="bibr12-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Gearhardt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests highly processed food advertisements may especially amplify positive and reduce negative expectancies regarding eating highly processed foods in individuals with a greater number of food addiction symptoms. Alternatively, food advertisements may not impact food-related emotional expectancies in these individuals because their existing expectancies are strong and potentially less malleable.</p>

                <title>The present research</title>
                <p>The primary aim of the present study was to test effects of food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies. We hypothesized that (a) highly processed food advertisements would increase positive and decrease negative highly-processed food expectancies and would not affect minimally processed food expectancies; (b) minimally processed food advertisements would increase positive and decrease negative minimally-processed food expectancies and would not affect highly processed food expectancies; and (c) a mixture of highly and minimally processed food advertisements would increase positive and decrease negative highly- and minimally-processed food expectancies. The secondary aim was to test the moderating role of food addiction symptoms. We hypothesized that highly processed food advertisements would increase positive and decrease negative highly-processed food expectancies to a greater extent in individuals with a greater number of food addiction symptoms.<sup><xref rid="fn1-13591053231168340" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup></p>

                <p>The study design was a four-level [video advertisements for highly processed foods, minimally processed foods, both food groups, or cellphones (control)] randomized between-subjects experiment. Video advertisements for cellphones were selected as the exposure for the control condition because cellphones (like food) are frequently advertised and widely purchased (<xref rid="bibr16-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Harris, 2013</xref>); however, cellphones are non-ingestible products.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited August 11th–12th, 2020 via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for “A Study on Advertisements and Beliefs” in which they would, “watch and rate the effectiveness of four short advertisement clips and complete some questionnaires about beliefs, feelings, and typical behaviors.” A power analysis conducted in G*Power Version 3.1.9.6 with the following parameters determined a sample size of 788 participants: one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with four groups, power = 0.90, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.05, and a small expected effect size (Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.29). The expected effect size was based on prior work demonstrating exposure to a simulated fast-food restaurant increased positive highly-processed food expectancies (<xref rid="bibr8-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2021</xref>). The power analysis yielded a sample size of 608 but, due to available research funds, 180 participants were added to mitigate anticipated non-compliance.</p>
                <p>A total of 947 participants started the study before expiration. Inclusion criteria were ⩾18 years old, living in the United States, and ⩾99% approval rating by other investigators. Data of a participant were excluded from analysis if a participant did not complete the study (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 36) or at least one of the following preregistered exclusion criteria were met: participant completed the study in &lt;3 minutes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2), participant incorrectly answered the attention check question about what kind of advertisements they watched (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 56), participant reported improbable values for adult height and weight (i.e. body mass index &lt;12 or &gt;70; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 125), and participant incorrectly answered quality control questions (e.g. “What year is it?”) at the end of the study (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10). The analytic sample therefore included 718 participants. Demographics of the analytic sample are provided in <xref rid="table1-13591053231168340" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board termed the study exempt (HUM00186009). Participants answered a question to ensure they were ⩾18 years old and provided informed consent. Participants were next randomly assigned via a randomizer in survey flow to watch video advertisements for highly processed foods, minimally processed foods, both food groups, or cellphones (control).</p>
                <p>In each condition, participants viewed four 15-second video advertisements back-to-back. Participants were unable to move to the next survey page until 60 seconds passed after clicking play. In the highly processed foods condition, participants viewed commercials for McDonald’s Quarter Pounders©; McDonald’s dipping sauces and McNuggets©; Wendy’s Bacon Deluxe, Baconator, and Bacon and Blue©; and Wendy’s Jr. Frosty©. In the minimally processed foods condition, participants viewed commercials for McDonald’s Fruit and Yogurt Parfait©; McDonald’s Southwest Salad©; Wendy’s Apple Pecan Chicken Salad©; and Wendy’s Harvest Apple Chicken Salad©. In the both food groups condition, participants viewed commercials for McDonald’s Fruit and Yogurt Parfait©; McDonald’s Quarter Pounders©; Wendy’s Harvest Apple Chicken Salad©; and Wendy’s Jr. Frosty©. In the control condition, participants viewed commercials for cellphones with AT&amp;T Mobile Share©; HTC Aria©; HTC Imagio©; and AT&amp;T Samsung Galaxy©. All commercials focused on the foods/cellphones and did not feature fully visible people interacting with the foods/cellphones (a few showed hands interacting with the foods/cellphones).<sup><xref rid="fn2-13591053231168340" ref-type="fn">2</xref></sup></p>
                <p>After watching the video advertisements, participants completed an attention check in which they were asked what kind of advertisements they just watched and then completed the Anticipated Effects of Food Scale. Next, they completed the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 and additional measures in randomized order and answered demographic questions. Participants had the option to select <italic toggle="yes">Prefer</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">not to answer</italic> for questions. Before receiving compensation, participants answered quality control questions. Participants received $1.00 for study completion, completing in an average of 14.19 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 7.48) minutes.</p>

Participants were asked to imagine eating highly processed foods (e.g. sweets, salty snacks, fast foods, sugary drinks) and rate how much they expect to feel 31 positive (e.g. relaxed, cheerful, glad) and negative (e.g. disgusting, worried, frustrated) emotions while eating. Participants were then asked to imagine eating minimally processed foods (e.g. fruit, vegetables) and rate how much they expect to feel the same 31 positive and negative emotions while eating. Participants rated items on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 (<italic toggle="yes">Definitely Not</italic>) to 6 (<italic toggle="yes">Definitely</italic>). The scale yielded four food expectancy subscales by separately averaging positive and negative emotion ratings for each food group [positive highly-processed food expectancies (α = 0.95), negative highly-processed food expectancies (α = 0.96), positive minimally-processed food expectancies (α = 0.94), and negative minimally-processed food expectancies (α = 0.97)].</p>

All symptom values were summed to create a dimensional score of food addiction (<italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.93).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Little is known about the determinants of food-related emotional expectancies, which is a critical gap because of the influence of these expectancies on food intake. This was the first study (to our knowledge) to test effects of food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies. There was much strength in the study design including transparency and openness, a large sample of adults, randomization to groups, inclusion of a control group, and use of ecologically valid advertisements for highly and minimally processed foods.</p>
              <p>In individuals with fewer symptoms of food addiction, viewing highly processed food video advertisements increased expectancies that one would feel positive emotions while eating those foods. Prior work shows individuals with fewer food addiction symptoms hold weaker food-related emotional expectancies (<xref rid="bibr9-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2020</xref>), whereas individuals with greater symptoms hold much stronger expectancies, a finding replicated in the present study. Highly processed food advertisements may therefore only situationally affect food-related emotional expectancies in adults who have not previously formed strong expectancies. Although a small effect size was observed in the present study, advertisements for highly processed foods are wide-reaching in the United States (<xref rid="bibr35-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Story and French, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, 2017</xref>), which suggests there could be a larger net effect of highly processed food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies in adults with few symptoms of food addiction.</p>
              <p>Main effects of food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies, however, were non-significant. Although being in a bar and a simulated fast-food restaurant led college students to have greater positive alcohol (<xref rid="bibr22-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Monk and Heim, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bibr41-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and highly-processed food (<xref rid="bibr8-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Cummings et al., 2021</xref>) expectancies, respectively, there may be boundary conditions to situations affecting expectancies across individuals. Entering a built environment with an array of stimuli and food cues is more immersive than viewing video advertisements, and the former may more consistently influence food-related emotional expectancies for adults regardless of their previously formed expectancies. It is also possible that repeated exposure to food advertisements over time exerts a stronger influence on food-related emotional expectancies compared to a one-time situational effect. Future longitudinal research examining cumulative exposures to food advertisements and subsequent changes in food-related emotional expectancies could test this possibility.</p>
              <p>Food advertisements may also have a greater impact on food-related emotional expectancies during adolescence or childhood, when expectancies may be especially malleable (<xref rid="bibr10-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Dunn and Goldman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Goldman, 1994</xref>). Prior experiments have shown that viewing film clips depicting desirable outcomes of alcohol use increased positive alcohol expectancies in adolescents (<xref rid="bibr20-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Kulick and Rosenberg, 2001</xref>), and viewing video advertisements for beer increased positive alcohol expectancies in fourth to fifth grade children (<xref rid="bibr11-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Dunn and Yniguez, 1999</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">c.f.</italic>
<xref rid="bibr21-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Lipsitz et al., 1993</xref>). Future research should incorporate a developmental perspective in research on food advertisements and food-related emotional expectancies. Food-related emotional expectancies may mediate the consistently-observed stimulatory effect of food advertisements on food intake in children (<xref rid="bibr5-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Boyland et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>Identifying potential determinants of food-related emotional expectancies including food advertisements is important for policy makers and practitioners. Successful interventions on other health-related behaviors have indirectly targeted those behaviors through influencing emotional expectancies. For example, a meta-analysis of 23 studies indicates the efficacy of reducing alcohol use in high school and college students through reducing positive alcohol expectancies (<xref rid="bibr13-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Gesualdo and Pinquart, 2021</xref>). Knowledge on how to influence food-related emotional expectancies will shed light on dietary intervention strategies (e.g. policies limiting food advertisements, therapy including expectancy challenge).</p>
              <p>Readers should consider study limitations when interpreting results. Video advertisements for highly and minimally processed foods were from fast food companies; it is possible that video advertisements for minimally processed foods from companies that only sell minimally processed foods may have different effects on food-related emotional expectancies. Companies like these occupy less than 5% of the food advertising landscape (<xref rid="bibr38-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, 2019</xref>), yet future research should test the effects of video advertisements from these companies and consider study designs that disentangle the effects of branding versus food cues on food-related emotional expectancies. The available measurement method for food-related emotional expectancies is a self-report questionnaire, yet it is possible the effect of food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies would be differentially captured by an implicit measure of expectancies like an implicit association test (<xref rid="bibr27-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Reich et al., 2010</xref>). It is also possible the food expectancy measure’s 6-point Likert scale restricted responses for some individuals (albeit responses were normally distributed with means around the midpoint of the scale). Particularly for clinical samples with higher rates of food addiction, widening response options may increase sensitivity to detecting situational fluctuations in food-related emotional expectancies. The present study did not include measurement of food intake, precluding tests of the effects of food advertisements on food intake mediated by food-related emotional expectancies. Future studies on determinants of food-related emotional expectancies could measure food intake or food choice (if online; <xref rid="bibr28-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Schreiber et al., 2020</xref>) to test for mediation. While Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform allowed for recruitment of more demographically-varied participants than traditional approaches (e.g. University subject pool) (<xref rid="bibr4-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Berinsky et al., 2012</xref>), data quality may be limited. Following principles of web survey design (e.g. designing surveys to be no longer than necessary, including several data quality checks)—as was done in the present study—improves data quality (<xref rid="bibr17-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Hauser et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, the generalizability of the results may be limited due to the crowdsourcing approach and researchers should consider data collection via alternatives to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in light of concerns with the platform (<xref rid="bibr42-13591053231168340" ref-type="bibr">Webb and Tangney, 2022</xref>). Although the sample size was large, with over a third of the sample meeting criteria for food addiction, the sample may have been underpowered to detect all moderation effects.</p>
              <p>Limitations notwithstanding, findings from this experiment are novel and contribute to knowledge on the determinants of food-related emotional expectancies. For adults who have not previously formed strong food-related emotional expectancies, video advertisements for highly processed foods may have a stimulatory effect on expectations that one would feel positive emotions while eating those foods. These findings are important for public health because of the pervasiveness of highly processed food advertisements and the role of expectancies in shaping behavior.</p>

                  <p>The research was preregistered in an independent registry with an analysis plan: <ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/mep23" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/mep23</ext-link>. Our secondary aims also included tests of the moderating role of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (indicated by highest education level), and dietary restraint (measured by averaging the items from the Restrained Eating subscale from the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire; <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.93) in the effects of food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies. Our hypotheses that advertisements for highly processed food would increase positive and decrease negative highly-processed food expectancies to a greater extent in Black Americans, individuals with less education, and individual scoring higher in dietary restraint were not supported. In post hoc analysis suggested by a reviewer, we tested the moderating role of gender in the effects of food advertisements on food-related emotional expectancies. Gender did not significantly moderate the effects of food advertisements on positive and negative highly-processed, and positive minimally-processed, food expectancies. Gender significantly moderated the effect of food advertisements on negative minimally-processed food expectancies, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic> = 4.81, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.003, <italic toggle="yes">η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.02, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.29.
