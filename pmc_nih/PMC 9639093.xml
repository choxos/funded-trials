                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Male clients (MCs) are integral to sex work-driven HIV transmission dynamics as sexual partners of female sex worker (FSW). MCs contribute disproportionately to incident HIV globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, with 27% of new infections attributed to MCs of FSW and other partners of key populations. Gaps in coverage of HIV testing and prevention services for men, including MCs, are well-documented, yet research and innovative interventions to improve MC uptake of effective prevention services, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), are scarce.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>MPrEP+ is a cohort study designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a PrEP-focused HIV prevention strategy providing daily oral tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in combination with three adherence self-management interventions: (1) use of a validated point-of-care urine drug-level assay with real-time feedback and tailored self-management counselling; (2) frequent HIV self-testing; and (3) weekly one-way text messaging. This package of interventions is being delivered to 120 MCs enrolled in the study in Kisumu, Kenya over a 6-month period. The primary outcome is PrEP adherence at 6 months as measured by PrEP drug levels. Bivariate and multivariable regression models will be used to identify predictors of PrEP adherence. We will also explore associations of sociodemographic characteristics and PrEP beliefs with PrEP adherence.</p>

                  <p>The study was approved by the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board and the Maseno University Ethical Review Committee. Study enrolment was initiated in November 2021 with participant follow-up planned through August 2022. Study results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Summaries and infographics of study findings will be developed and distributed to MC, FSW and stakeholders working in HIV prevention and support for people who sell and buy sex, including Kenya’s Ministry of Health.</p>

              <p>Globally male clients (MCs) of female sex workers (FSWs) experience a greater burden of HIV compared with men who do not pay for sex<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> due to a constellation of factors, including number of sexual partners, elevated HIV prevalence among FSW and patterns of condom use with FSWs. A recent meta-analysis of 87 population surveys in 35 sub-Saharan African countries between 2000 and 2020 indicated that paid sexual encounters by men are prevalent: 8% of sexually active men aged 15–54 reported they had ever paid for sex, and this per cent was higher in studies conducted in East Africa (11.3%).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Based on 52 of these surveys, men who paid for sex were 50% more likely to be living with HIV (prevalence ratio = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.72) compared with men who had not. This meta-analysis also estimated that only 67.5% of men surveyed between 2010 and 2020 reported using a condom during their last paid sex encounter. A second meta-analysis of 44 studies in low-income and middle-income countries conducted between 1989 and 2019 also found an elevated risk of HIV among men who purchased sex (5% pooled HIV prevalence; n=21 studies), and in studies conducted between 2011 and 2019 (2.85%), compared with men who did not purchase sex.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Thus, an effective response to the elevated HIV vulnerability experienced by MC is essential to controlling the HIV epidemic, particularly in East and Southern Africa, where MC and other sexual partners of key populations, including FSW, accounted for 15% of new infections among those aged 15–49 years in 2019.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, data on factors associated with risk of HIV acquisition as well as studies of HIV prevention interventions among this population are limited, likely due to stigma, difficulty in identifying them and varying legality of commercial sex across countries.</p>
              <p>Interventions directed to MCs are needed to strengthen the impact of combination prevention strategies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious biomedical HIV prevention intervention<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> and an optimal tool for MC of FSW, given the multiple barriers to condom use in the sex work context.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> In Kenya, the site of this study, the 2018 national guidelines recommend PrEP for individuals at substantial risk for HIV, including those engaged in transactional sex.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> HIV prevalence in Kenya in 2018 was estimated at 4.9% (males: 3.1%; females: 6.6%), with 1.3 million people living with HIV; however, in the Lake Victoria region where this study is conducted in Kisumu County, adult prevalence is 17.5%.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The HIV epidemic in western Kenya is significantly impacted by HIV infection in FSW. In 2013, the most recent year in which HIV surveillance data for key populations are available, national HIV prevalence among FSWs was 29.3%.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Under Kenya’s national policy guidelines, PrEP is prioritised as part of combination HIV prevention for people who engage in sex work, including MCs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, MCs have not been a focus of national PrEP implementation plans.</p>
              <p>Formative research we conducted to inform the study protocol indicated that MCs were supportive of and interested in PrEP, and most FSWs and MCs viewed PrEP as life-saving protection for both themselves and their non-commercial sex partners.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Yet, we are unaware of any published studies offering PrEP to MCs of FSWs. This highlights the need for implementation science research in real-world settings to demonstrate how to engage MCs in PrEP use and to inform national programmes as they expand PrEP to reach key and priority populations. Additionally, as adherence is a critical determinant of PrEP efficacy, research to guide the design and implementation of evidence-based adherence support interventions for MCs is needed to realise PrEP’s individual-level and population-level effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Self-management approaches offer a promising and novel framework to improve adherence and engagement in PrEP, whereby persons at substantial risk for HIV initiate PrEP, and proactively adopt and monitor their own behaviours to optimise PrEP effectiveness and safety. Such approaches have been used to manage chronic conditions, for example, cardiovascular disease, creatinine monitoring post-kidney transplant, glycaemic control for diabetes, body weight in obesity and HIV treatment, but are less frequently applied for HIV prevention.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–20</xref> Objective feedback on adherence behaviour to tailor counselling and reinforce successful adherence is a critical component in self-management approaches,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> and a potentially impactful support for PrEP adherence.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> Therefore, we are implementing MPrEP+, to our knowledge, the first HIV combination prevention strategy that offers oral PrEP with adherence support interventions to increase PrEP use among MCs.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>MPrEP+ is a single-arm longitudinal study offering PrEP and adherence support to MC of FSW in Kisumu County, western Kenya. The study assesses adherence, feasibility and acceptability of a PrEP-focused prevention strategy offering daily oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)) in combination with three adherence self-management interventions: real-time feedback from point of care (POC) urine drug-level assay, HIV self-testing (HIVST) and weekly one-way text message reminders plus standard of care HIV risk-reduction counselling over a 6-month period among MCs in Kisumu, Kenya. All participants receive the same intervention and attend four study visits over a 6-month follow-up period.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Participants are HIV-negative men aged 18 and older who report having exchanged money, goods or services for sex with a woman in the past 3 months, and live or work and intend to stay in Kisumu County for the next 6 months. Other inclusion criteria include ability to provide informed consent and complete study procedures in English, Kiswahili or Dholuo, report no current or recent (within past 3 months) PrEP use and are willing to participate in study procedures, including the study intervention.</p>

                <title>Sampling and recruitment</title>
                <p>Recruitment is conducted by trained, supervised mobilizers connected to FSW groups active in the study catchment area. Mobilizers conduct outreach and education about the study aims and components in community-based venues such as bars and other social spaces where people sell and buy sex in the Kisumu urban area. Interested individuals are asked for verbal consent to undergo prescreening at the venues. Those providing verbal consent are prescreened with a brief questionnaire to assess initial eligibility (age, residence and intent to stay in Kisumu County for study duration, and having exchanged money, goods or services for sex with a woman in the past 3 months).</p>
                <p>Mobilizers invite MCs identified in prescreening as potentially eligible to the study site to complete an enrolment visit, beginning with the informed consent process and study eligibility assessment, including eligibility for PrEP. The recruitment goal is 120 HIV-negative MCs enrolled in the cohort. Study staff document the number of individuals approached by mobilizers; number agreeing to prescreen; number prescreened as potentially eligible who attend scheduled enrolment visits; and number enrolled.</p>

                  <p>All consented participants undergo HIV rapid testing and counselling following national guidelines and are assessed for PrEP eligibility using screening procedures detailed in the 2018 Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing HIV Infection in Kenya.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Standard procedures include assessment of behavioural and medical eligibility for PrEP using national tools; symptom-driven assessment for acute HIV infection; and assessment for contraindications for use of TDF/FTC.</p>
                  <p>A 10 mL blood sample is collected via venipuncture for measurement of creatinine and hepatitis B surface antigen testing as required in the PrEP guidelines. Additionally, a 10 mL urine sample is taken for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis screening. If a participant is found to have one of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs), he is immediately referred to the study clinician for further management.</p>

                  <p>At each follow-up visit, participants undergo HIV rapid testing and counselling following Kenya’s national guidelines and a symptom-driven clinical exam including assessment of symptoms of acute HIV infection or STIs. Participants found to be HIV-positive receive confirmatory testing and appropriate post-test counselling, including assisted referral for immediate HIV treatment initiation at local health facility. There is no further study follow-up for participants who were HIV-positive.</p>

Follow-up questionnaires are 45–60 min in duration; see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for interview domains at 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The 6-month follow-up interview includes several open-ended questions regarding participants’ experience taking PrEP and with study participation. Participants who express a desire to end study participation at the 3-month visit will be asked to complete the module of open-ended questions during the 3-month interview. Responses to open-ended questions will be transcribed verbatim, and if needed, translated from Kiswahili or Dholuo into English, reviewed for accuracy and completion, deidentified, and entered into a Dedoose database for analysis.</p>

Also, real-time feedback based on test results at study visit can assure adherent PrEP users that they are achieving the prerequisite drug level for protection. Study participants are provided with brief interactive counselling tailored to results of their urine assay at their 3-month and 6-month visits.</p>
                  <p>At enrolment, study staff explain the use of this UrSure kit and how it will be used experimentally to inform PrEP adherence counselling at follow-up visits. At months 3 and 6 follow-up visits, participants are asked to provide a 5 mL urine sample that will be used to perform the UrSure test.

                  <p>The study sample size was determined to be 120 MCs based on feasibility concerns for conducting a convenience sample of this population. An estimate of the precision of the 95% CI of our primary outcome of 6-month adherence (described below) was obtained using the methodology applied by Cornfield and assuming a Design Effect of 2.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> A Design Effect is a simple number that estimates how much less efficient a non-random sample is compared with a simple random sample; a Design Effect of 2 implies that a non-random sample would need twice the number of individuals as a simple random sample to obtain the same-precision estimates .<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>
                  <p>With 120 participants enrolled, and treating those lost to follow-up as ‘not adherent’ (as in the primary analysis), this sample size will result in a reasonably precise estimate of adherence at 6 months. For example, assuming 70% adherence at 6 months, our powered 95% CI will be 58.4%–81.6%% (11.6% precision). Similarly, conducting a ‘complete case’ analysis (as in the secondary analysis) restricted to those with complete outcome ascertainment and assuming loss-to-follow-up of 10%, our powered 95% CI will be marginally wider at 57.8%–82.2% (12.2% precision).<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> With 120 participants, our precision will be similar across a range of measured adherence proportions at 6 months (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>
