                  <p>Does extended care for obesity management delivered remotely via individual or group telephone counseling in rural communities improve the maintenance of weight loss compared with an education program about weight gain prevention?</p>

              <p>The burden of obesity in the US disproportionately affects rural communities. Compared with urban and suburban locales, rural areas have a greater prevalence of obesity<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and higher rates of obesity-related morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Rural communities have less access to preventive health care services,<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> including comprehensive lifestyle treatment for obesityâthe criterion standard recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and multiple scientific societies.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Documentation of the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment has come from efficacy trials, commonly conducted with middle-class participants from urban or suburban locales and delivered by experts from academic medical centers.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Few studies have been implemented in medically underserved rural settings with local staff delivering treatment to economically disadvantaged participants, and current dissemination efforts have failed to narrow the rural-urban gap in access to weight-management services.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Comprehensive lifestyle interventions can produce initial body weight reductions of 5% to 10%,<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a magnitude of weight loss that can yield clinically significant reductions in hypertension and hyperlipidemia and prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, after treatment ends, participants typically begin to regain weightâoften regaining one-third to one-half of initial weight losses within 1 year.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Supplementing initial treatment with extended care programs delivered via face-to-face sessions can improve the maintenance of weight loss.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, in rural communities, the long distances that participants must travel to attend face-to-face sessions constitutes a major barrier to implementation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The Treatment of Obesity in Underserved Rural Settings trial<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> demonstrated that providing extended care via individual telephone counseling improved the maintenance of weight loss, comparable with face-to-face sessions (and at a lower cost), compared with an education control. However, individual telephone counseling is resource intensive with respect to interventionist time. Using a conference-call format to deliver telephone counseling simultaneously to multiple participants may provide an innovative, cost-effective alternative to individual telephone counseling.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In a randomized clinical trial conducted in a rural setting in 2016,<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> lifestyle treatment delivered entirely via group telephone counseling improved long-term weight losses compared with a newsletter control group. However, that study provided participants with 2 free meal-replacements per day during initial treatment. While such an approach may increase initial weight loss, it complicates the interpretation of the effects of extended care interventions, which began at the same time that meal replacements ended. Moreover, the provision of no-cost meal replacements has limited feasibility for implementation in low-resource rural communities. To our knowledge, no trial has examined the effectiveness of group-based telephone counseling as an extended-care intervention in rural areas absent the use of study-provided meal replacements.</p>
              <p>This study was a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual and group telephone extended care programs for weight-loss maintenance in rural communities compared with an education control. Treatment was delivered through the US Cooperative Extension System (CES),<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> a federal-state-county partnership with offices in approximately 2900 of 3007 counties in the US. We hypothesized that extended care delivered via either individual or group telephone counseling would produce greater long-term maintenance of weight loss than an education control program.</p>

In the missing-not-at-random analysis, individuals who discontinued participation prior to month 22 were assumed to have regained weight at an mean rate of 0.3 kg per month after dropping out.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Intermittent missingness was assumed to be partially ignorable.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Inferences were based on examination of whether the 95% credible intervals (CrIs) contained 0 and were quantified by posterior probabilities (PPs). The results were highly similar under missing-at-random and missing-not-at-random assumptions; hence, only the missing-at-random results are reported. We also analyzed percentage change in body weight during months 4 to 22 by computing percentage weight changes from the models used for the primary outcome.</p>

The difference in percentage regain between the individual telephone counseling and control groups was 1.8% (95% CrI, 0.2% to 3.4%), and the difference between group telephone counseling and control groups was 1.5% (95% CrI, â0.3% to 3.3%). Only the individual telephone counseling vs the control comparison had a 95% CrI excluding 0 (PPâ&gt;â.98). Percentage changes in weight during the year-long extended care period were 0% (95% CrI, â1.1% to 1.1%) for the individual telephone counseling group, 1.3% (95% CrI, 0% to 2.5%) for the group telephone counseling group, and 2.6% (95% CrI, 1.7% to 3.6%) for the educational control group, indicating regain in the control group, a smaller but not statistically significant regain in the group telephone counseling group, and no evidence of regain in the individual telephone counseling group. During the no contact follow-up interval (months 16-22), the percentage weight changes were 2.6% (95% CrI, 1.9% to 3.3%) for the individual telephone counseling group, 1.6% (95% CrI, 0.8% to 2.4%) for the group telephone counseling group, and 1.7% (95% CrI, 1.0% to 2.4%) for the control group, indicating regains in all 3 groups.</p>
                <p>The percentages of participants in each group who achieved body weight reductions of at least 5% at month 22 were 51.4% (95% CrI, 43.4% to 59.7%) for the individual telephone counseling group, 49.6% (95% CrI, 42.2% to 57.7%) for the group telephone counseling group, and 42.3% (95% CrI, 35.4% to 48.9%), in the control group, and the between-group differences were not statistically significant. The percentages of participants who achieved weight reductions of at least 10% at month 22 were 31.5% (95% CrI, 24.1% to 40.0%) for the individual telephone counseling group, 27.6% (95% CrI, 21.0% to 35.7 %) for the group telephone counseling group, and 19.1% (95% CrI, 14.1% to 24.9%)for the control group. The difference between individual telephone counseling and control groups in proportion of participants who achieved weight reductions of at least 10% was statistically significant (12.4% [95% CrI, 2.9% to 22.3%]; PPâ&gt;â.99).</p>
                <p>The number of days that participants met their caloric intake goals partially mediated between-group differences in weight change.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial conducted in CES offices in rural communities had 3 main findings. First, extended care delivered via individual telephone counseling produced significantly better long-term maintenance of lost weight than did an education control program. Second, a significantly larger proportion of participants who received individual telephone counseling achieved long-term weight reductions of at least 10% compared with the education control group. Third, the effect of individual telephone counseling on improved long-term maintenance of lost weight was partially mediated by greater adherence to caloric intake goals.</p>
              <p>The benefits of individual telephone counseling demonstrated in this study replicate the findings from the Treatment of Obesity in Underserved Rural Settings trial.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In that study, participants who received extended care via individual telephone counseling maintained a mean of 88% of their initial weight losses at a 12-month follow up. In our study, the participants who received individual telephone counseling maintained a mean of 100% of their initial weight losses at the 12-month follow-up. At the final follow-up, 18 months after the initial treatment, participants who received individual telephone counseling in this study sustained a mean of 72% of their initial weight losses, compared with 49% for participants in the education control group; the individual telephone counseling group had a mean net reduction in baseline body weight of 6.1%, compared with 3.9% for the control group. In addition, the proportion of individuals who achieved clinically meaningful reductions of at least 10% of body weight at 22 months was significantly greater in the individual telephone counseling group than in the control group (31% vs 19%).</p>
              <p>Findings from the mediational analysis provide insight into a mechanism likely contributing to the enhanced maintenance observed in the individual telephone counseling intervention vs the control group. Individual telephone counseling increased both the frequency of self-monitoring and the number of days in which participants achieved their caloric intake goals compared with the control group. Ongoing contacts with a supportive counselor may set an expectation for program adherence that increases the likelihood that the participant will achieve targeted goals or engage in problem-solving efforts to overcome barriers to attaining those objectives.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Providing extended care via individual telephone contacts may enhance attendance, adherence, and engagement in self-regulatory processes important to sustaining weight-loss progress.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The group telephone counseling group in this study did not demonstrate the effectiveness observed in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In prior trials, the group conference call strategy has been used to induce initial weight loss and to provide extended care. In this trial, participants received face-to-face treatment during the initial weight-loss period but subsequently were assigned randomly to the group telephone counseling modality. The change in mode of treatment delivery may have contributed to the poorer performance in the group telephone counseling group in this trial compared with prior studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The focused attention received by participants in the individual telephone counseling group may have minimized negative reactions to the shift from face-to-face to telephone contacts.</p>
              <p>During the extended-care phase of this study, participants in the group telephone counseling group compared with participants in the individual telephone counseling group attended fewer sessions (54% vs 67% of sessions) and met their caloric intake goals less often (29% vs 37% of possible days). The individual telephone counseling program permitted participants to reschedule a planned session, an option not available in the group telephone counseling group. In addition, participants in the group telephone counseling group may have been reluctant to disclose their setbacks in the relatively public group setting.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In prior trials<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> in which both initial treatment and extended-care sessions were conducted entirely via group conference calls and in which the individuals had no history of face-to-face contacts with other group members, participants may have been more comfortable in discussing dietary lapses and weight gains.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Several limitations should be noted. First, the findings were based on a study population with a community environment and sociodemographic characteristics common to adults residing in rural areas of the southeastern US; generalizability to other populations may be limited. Second, the assessment of adherence was based on uncorroborated data from daily self-monitoring records. However, a systematic review of 15 studies found a consistent and significant positive association between dietary self-monitoring and successful weight-management.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Third, the benefits of individual telephone counseling must be considered in relation to its costs, particularly the time required to provide each participant with 18 individual telephone sessions. An economic analysis incorporating the perspectives of the participant, interventionist, and society may elucidate the relation of costs to benefits of extended care via individual telephone counseling.<sup><xref rid="zoi200303r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200303r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>National guidelines recommend comprehensive lifestyle intervention as the frontline treatment for people with obesity. Nonetheless, lifestyle treatment continues to be challenged by the maintenance problem and by limited data demonstrating effective dissemination into low-resource communities. The results from this randomized clinical trial inform each of these limitations. Our findings indicate that providing extended care via individual telephone counseling can enhance maintenance of lost weight and increase the proportion of participants who achieve clinically meaningful long-term reductions in body weight. The findings also demonstrate that the existing infrastructure of the CES can be mobilized for effective dissemination of comprehensive lifestyle treatment into underserved rural communities throughout the US.</p>
