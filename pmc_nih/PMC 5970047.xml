              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">High-intensity lifestyle interventions induce losses of 5–10% of initial body weight that are associated with improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These losses also are associated with improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), commonly measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). On the whole, weight loss is associated with improvements in physical HRQOL but little to no improvement in mental HRQOL, as assessed by the SF-36 (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Relatedly, studies have found small to minimal improvements in depressive symptoms and perceived stress following lifestyle intervention (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P6">In addition to general HRQOL, aspects of weight-specific HRQOL frequently are assessed by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Scale – Lite (IWQOL-Lite), which consists of a total score and five subscales: physical function; self-esteem; sexual life; work; and public distress about one’s weight (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Greater weight loss is typically associated with increased (i.e., improved) total scores on the IWQOL-Lite (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Results are less consistent for changes on the IWQOL-Lite subscales. Some studies have shown positive effects of weight loss interventions across all subscales (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>); others have found benefits most consistently for physical functioning (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); while some studies also have shown benefits for other subscales such as self-esteem (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and sexual life (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P7">Patients typically do not report additional improvements in HRQOL when acute weight loss ends, after approximately 6 to 9 months, and weight loss maintenance begins. Maintaining weight loss is widely known to be less innately rewarding than losing weight (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Moreover, following completion of a high-intensity lifestyle intervention, individuals with obesity are vulnerable to weight regain, which may be associated with deterioration in HRQOL (and CVD risk factors) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, novel interventions are needed to sustain long-term weight loss, in order to maintain improvements in HRQOL and other health outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P8">The current study examined whether lorcaserin, a serotonin 2C receptor agonist approved for chronic weight management (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), would facilitate the maintenance of weight loss and improvements in weight-specific HRQOL and related psychosocial outcomes. Specifically, we examined changes in weight-specific HRQOL, depression, and perceived stress in patients who had lost 5% or more of initial weight during a 14-week intensive lifestyle intervention that included a low-calorie diet (LCD). We anticipated that participants would achieve substantial improvements in these outcomes, particularly in physical health aspects of HRQOL, at the end of this 14-week intervention. Thereafter, we hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to receive lorcaserin for the ensuing 52 weeks would maintain larger weight losses and, thus, significantly greater improvements in weight-specific HRQOL than those assigned to placebo. Consistent with prior studies (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we also expected that, independent of treatment condition, larger weight losses would be associated with greater improvements in weight-specific HRQOL at the end of the trial.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p id="P9">As described previously (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), this was a two-phase weight loss maintenance trial. Participants attended a 14-week, non-randomized, intensive lifestyle intervention/LCD program (i.e., phase 1), followed by a 52-week double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT; i.e., phase 2) for participants who lost ≥5% of initial weight during phase 1. The study protocol was approved by the university’s institutional review board, and a data and safety monitoring board provided trial oversight (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P10">The current study represents a secondary analysis of the RCT, with primary findings reported previously (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In sum, 137 participants completed the 14-week LCD program, lost &gt;5% of initial weight, and accepted randomization in a 52-week RCT. Participants lost a mean 9.3±2.9% of initial weight (10.7±4.0 kg) during the 14-week LCD program, which was associated with clinically meaningful (≥5%) improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and insulin) (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

Approximately half of the sessions were conducted in person and the other half by teleconference, given the potentially greater convenience to participants of conference calls. Participants were instructed to consume a calorie-reduced diet of conventional foods based on current dietary guidelines in order to maintain their weight loss (although participants were allowed to continue to lose weight if desired).

                <p id="P14">Weight-specific HRQOL and related psychosocial outcomes were assessed at baseline (prior to the start of phase 1), randomization (after completion of phase 1), and week 52 of phase 2. Measures included the IWQOL-Lite (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and the Perceived Stress Scale – 14 item version (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The IWQOL-Lite includes five subscales that assess the effects of weight on physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, work, and public distress. A total score is also computed. Scores are transformed and range from 0–100, with higher scores signifying better QOL. The PHQ-9 is recommended by the American Psychiatric Association as an optimal, brief depression scale (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Scores range from 0 to 27, with established cutoffs of 0–4 for minimal symptoms of depression, 5–9 for mild, 10–14 for moderate, 15–19 for moderately severe, and 20–27 for severe symptoms of depression (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The Perceived Stress Scale assesses thoughts and feelings related to stressful events in the past month, with scores ranging from 0–56 (higher scores indicate greater perceived stress) (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). All scales were pro-rated to account for missing items. Height and weight were measured at screening, and weight was measured at all on-site group visits.</p>

Additionally, hierarchical linear regression models were used to determine the contribution of weight loss to changes in weight-specific HRQOL, depression, and perceived stress, controlling for variables that may be related to weight loss: demographics (age, race, gender); baseline body mass index (BMI); and treatment condition. Continuous predictor variables included in the regression analyses were centered at their means. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to determine the effects of losing &lt;5%, 5–9.9%, and ≥10% of body weight on all weight-specific HRQOL outcomes, controlling for demographics, baseline BMI, and treatment condition. Post-hoc paired comparisons tested for differences in weight-specific HRQOL among the three levels of weight loss.</p>

Mean (±SD) BMI at baseline was 40.8±5.9 kg/m2. At randomization, all characteristics were evenly distributed between groups except for height. Height did not correlate significantly with changes in any HRQOL or psychosocial outcome and, thus, was not included as a covariate in between-group analyses of phase 2 data.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P27">This study observed distinctly different changes in weight-specific HRQOL and related psychosocial outcomes during the weight loss and weight loss maintenance phases of the trial. During the initial 14-week LCD program that produced a mean loss of 9.3% of initial weight, participants achieved statistically significant improvements in total IWQOL-Lite scores, as well as the physical function, sexual life, self-esteem, and work subscales. Additionally, mean symptoms of depression, which were low to begin with (due to the exclusion of participants with major depressive disorder or on anti-depressants), declined significantly, though modestly. The present findings are consistent with prior reports of the favorable effects of initial weight loss on multiple components of weight-specific HRQOL and related psychosocial outcomes (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P28">Weight loss, however, was not linearly related to improvements in weight-specific HRQOL and psychosocial outcomes during the 14-week LCD program. It accounted, for example, for only 0.6% of the variance in the change in IWQOL-Lite total scores. The lack of a relationship is likely due to the requirement that all participants had to have lost at least 5% of initial weight to be randomized into the 52-week trial, which limited variability in the sample’s weight losses.</p>
              <p id="P29">In contrast to the improvements in weight-specific HRQOL during the initial weight loss phase, scores on these measures did not change appreciably during the 52-week RCT, during which weight increased, on average, by 2.0–2.5 kg. As reported previously (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), lorcaserin did not significantly improve weight loss at week 52, as compared with placebo, and we observed no differences between groups in the maintenance of improvements in weight-specific HRQOL scores achieved in the first 14 weeks. PHQ-9 depression scores increased significantly more in lorcaserin- than placebo-treated patients from randomization to week 52 (+2.2 vs. +0.1, respectively). However, mean scores for both groups were within normal limits at both times, and lorcaserin-treated participants completed the trial with a mean PHQ-9 score 0.9 points less than their value at the start of the 14-weeek LCD program.</p>
              <p id="P30">Examining the treatment groups together, weight-specific HRQOL scores generally did not deteriorate during the 52-week RCT, despite the mean weight regain of 2.0–2.5 kg. Preservation of improvements may have been attributable to the relatively small amount of regain and to the social and cognitive support provided by the 16-session WLM intervention. We were surprised to find that public distress about one’s weight, which did not change with weight loss during phase 1, improved significantly during phase 2 (with weight stability). Distress related to weight stigma may take more time to improve, due to the pervasiveness of such prejudice and some individuals’ internalization of negative weight-based stereotypes (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). It also may have improved with the additional social, cognitive, and behavioral support provided by the WLM intervention.</p>
              <p id="P31">Collapsing across treatment groups, all measures of weight-specific HRQOL and depressive symptoms (though not perceived stress) improved significantly from the start of the 14-week LCD program to the end of the 52-week RCT (i.e., 66 total weeks in total). The magnitude of improvement was greatest for physical function, and larger weight losses were associated with greater improvements in the total IWQOL-Lite score, as well as the physical function and self-esteem subscales. Additionally, losses of 10% or more of initial weight conferred significantly greater benefits than the loss of &lt;5%. This clear effect of ≥ 10% weight loss on weight-specific HRQOL is consistent with prior findings suggesting that large magnitudes of weight loss are needed to substantially improve HRQOL (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Further studies are needed to clarify the psychosocial effects of 5–9.9% weight loss.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p id="P32">Adults with obesity who achieved an average of 9.3% weight loss during a 14-week LCD program achieved improvements in several measures of weight-specific HRQOL, particularly physical function, as assessed by the IWQOL-Lite. These improvements were generally maintained during a 52-week RCT which provided 16 group WLM sessions, combined with lorcaserin or placebo. Larger weight losses were associated with greater overall improvements in physical function, self-esteem, and total IWQOL-Lite scores, and we found evidence of particularly robust benefits with a loss of ≥10% of initial weight. Adjunctive interventions that target weight-related public distress, depression, and perceived stress may be needed to improve these aspects of psychosocial well-being in patients who report these or related problems.</p>
