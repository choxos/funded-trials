                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The introduction of option B+—rapid initiation of lifelong antiretroviral therapy regardless of disease status for HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women—can dramatically reduce HIV transmission during pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding. Despite significant investments to scale-up Option B+, results have been mixed, with high rates of loss to follow-up, sub-optimal viral suppression, continued pediatric HIV transmission, and HIV-associated maternal morbidity. The Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) cluster randomized trial demonstrated that a package of systems engineering tools improved flow through the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) cascade. This five-step, facility-level intervention is designed to improve understanding of gaps (cascade analysis), guide identification and prioritization of low-cost workflow modifications (process mapping), and iteratively test and redesign these modifications (continuous quality improvement). This protocol describes a novel model for SAIA delivery (SAIA-SCALE) led by district nurse supervisors (rather than research nurses), and evaluation procedures, to serve as a foundation for national scale-up.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The SAIA-SCALE stepped wedge trial includes three implementation waves, each 12 months in duration. Districts are the unit of assignment, with four districts randomly assigned per wave, covering all 12 districts in Manica province, Mozambique. In each district, the three highest volume health facilities will receive the SAIA-SCALE intervention (totaling 36 intervention facilities). The RE-AIM framework will guide SAIA-SCALE’s evaluation. Reach describes the proportion of clinics and population in Manica province reached, and sub-groups not reached. Effectiveness assesses impact on PMTCT process measures and patient-level outcomes. Adoption describes the proportion of districts/clinics adopting SAIA-SCALE, and determinants of adoption using the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) tool. Implementation will identify SAIA-SCALE core elements and determinants of successful implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Maintenance describes the proportion of districts sustaining the intervention. We will also estimate the budget and program impact from the payer perspective for national scale-up.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">UNAIDS goals to have 90% of HIV-infected individuals diagnosed, 90% linked to care and on treatment, and 90% virally suppressed are largely not being met for pregnant women. In Mozambique—a resource-limited setting with high HIV prevalence—94% of HIV-infected pregnant women are diagnosed and 92% initiate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but over 40% do not return for follow-up visits after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The combination of undiagnosed, untreated, and poorly controlled HIV infection results in high mother-to-child HIV transmission, and high maternal morbidity.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Recognizing the potential benefits of early ART initiation in pregnancy, the World Health Organization (WHO) amended its guidelines in 2013 to recommend that countries with generalized HIV epidemics adopt Option B+ (lifelong ART to all HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women regardless of CD4 count–Option B+) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sub-Saharan African countries rapidly implemented Option B+, and access to ART increased substantially. In Mozambique, the proportion of pregnant women in PMTCT initiating ART increased from 10 to 50% in the year of Option B+ introduction, and achieved over 90% in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Though PMTCT services have achieved scale, quality gaps constrain adherence and viral suppression, leaving children at risk for acquiring HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In central Mozambique, 58% of women in Option B+ are lost to follow-up by 6 weeks postpartum, and only 37% remain in care by 6 months postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Of those retained in care, less than half are virally suppressed (&lt; 1000 copies/mL) at their first postpartum visit.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Health system weaknesses are important barriers to Option B+ effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Factors such as long wait and short consult times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], unreliable medicine and supply systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and poor counseling impede support to patients to remain in care and adhere to ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Improving PMTCT service efficiency may address performance gaps by providing more time for limited human resources to interact with patients, improving integration across services, and reduce missed opportunities that lead to loss to follow-up, poor ART adherence, mother-to-child HIV transmission, and poor maternal health outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par24">The priority for improving the effectiveness of PMTCT services is to increase the number of women-infant pairs successfully passing through the multiple, sequential steps in the PMTCT cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and ensuring their access to efficacious interventions. Structural implementation strategies—like the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA)—improve PMTCT effectiveness, and are potentially scalable across public sector health systems. Such novel systems engineering approaches have been increasingly applied in health care to improve program effectiveness by identifying and reducing system inefficiencies in complex, multi-step health services, such as the PMTCT cascade. These tools, including process mapping and continuous quality improvement, have been adapted from systems engineering manufacturing improvement, and have led to increases in efficiency through simple, low cost, iterative adaptations in service delivery design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Systems engineering encourages participation of frontline staff to analyze systems, and to define, implement, and evaluate improvement strategies; and with involvement of senior management champions, has been shown to lead to appropriate, effective, and sustainable solutions, improved health service delivery, and improved patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Experience with systems engineering is growing in resource-constrained settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], including in applications to PMTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a previous cluster randomized trial, we found our systems engineering strategy (SAIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] improved PMTCT performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and was highly accessible and user-friendly for frontline health workers and managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The SAIA implementation strategy enables frontline staff to gain a comprehensive view of their complex delivery systems, identify target areas to improve, and iteratively test modifications to improve the quality and quantity of system outputs and patient health outcomes. Participants noted that SAIA was practical and easy to use; stimulated communication, consensus decision-making, and accountability across multiple service points in their facility (e.g., antenatal, maternity, postpartum, laboratory, and pharmacy); and was accessible by relying on routine data to guide decision-making in real-world service delivery environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. SAIA is flexible, and can be applied through routine management systems to lead to enduring improvements in cascade effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Despite evidence on the effectiveness of systems engineering, research on strategies to scale-up these improvement strategies is lacking. Systems engineering approaches must be expanded using models that are scalable (achieve broad scale across delivery systems), affordable (require modest resources to align with current health sector investments), sustainable (integrated into and led by public sector health systems), and effective (retain active ingredients for impact). Without research on how to scale-up evidence-based structural implementation strategies for PMTCT through routine management systems, we will fail to address poor performance and to maximize significant investments in Option B+.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Goals and objectives</title>
                <p id="Par27">The overall goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of a dissemination and implementation model for the SAIA intervention (SAIA-SCALE) that is delivered by district maternal and child health supervisors (rather than research nurses) to serve as a foundation for national scale-up. We selected districts as the unit of intervention allocation as district management structures link health systems (which allocate human resources, medical supplies and financial resources, and provide oversight and support to ensure strong governance and foster accountability) and health facilities (where services are delivered). Districts are the logical disseminating vehicle for structural interventions as they have oversight responsibility for services within their districts, ability to access resources to meet health facility needs, and authority to put in place management decisions that affect the environment within subordinate health facilities. By focusing on testing a novel approach to scale the SAIA implementation strategy through routine management structures, the study is designed to address critical gaps in the field of implementation science. SAIA-SCALE’s specific objectives are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">Develop a district-based dissemination and implementation strategy for SAIA (SAIA-SCALE), using the RE-AIM model to evaluate the program’s Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Estimate the budget and program impact from the payer perspective to scale-up SAIA compared to the standard of care using activity based micro-costing and mathematical models of HIV transmission.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par30">SAIA-SCALE employs a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial implementation schedule to randomly allocate all 12 districts in Manica province into three implementation waves, staggered by 1 year (3 years total). District maternal and child health supervisors deliver the intervention in three health facilities per district (36 total) during a 1-year intensive phase (mentored by research nurses experienced with the intervention from the SAIA trial), with subsequent implementation led independently by the district supervisors (sustainment phase) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our design has a number of advantages for this study. First, a phased-in design will ensure that all 12 districts in Manica province will receive the evidence-based SAIA implementation strategy. Second, the design will assess SAIA’s performance under pragmatic conditions. Third, a randomized design reduces potential confounding, and provides robust evidence of SAIA-SCALE’s impact. Fourth, the design is appropriate to assess the dissemination strategy for SAIA-SCALE (delivery by district health system managers), while assessing impact on the facility and patient levels. Finally, the design allows for assessing maturation patterns in SAIA-SCALE’s effects over time, including during the intensive and sustainment phases.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SAIA-SCALE stepped wedge implementation timeline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2019_889_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Description of the SAIA implementation strategy</title>
                <p id="Par31">The core elements of the SAIA implementation strategy have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The strategy includes a package of systems engineering and improvement tools that are delivered iteratively at the health facility level by trained mentors. SAIA provides facility-level PMTCT staff and managers with a holistic view of their systems’ performance, highlights gaps, prioritizes cascade steps for improvement, identifies modifiable processes for improvement, and tests contextually appropriate solutions. The approach is designed to be user friendly, relies on routinely reported data, and engages clinic teams in consensus decision-making to lead to sustainable solutions that are within their control and adapted to the clinic context.</p>
                <p id="Par32">SAIA is designed as a cyclical, five-step process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par33">Step 1: Understand PMTCT performance and identify priority areas for improvement. The PMTCT cascade analysis tool (PCAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) uses routine data to provide a rapid, systems-level view of drop-offs along the PMTCT cascade. As an analytic tool, the PCAT provides frontline staff and facility managers with a view of the greatest potential for flow improvements through maternal (antenatal care➔postpartum care) and pediatric (birth➔ART initiation) cascades. As a departure from the original SAIA trial, SAIA-SCALE employs a mobile application of the PCAT that describes the PMTCT cascade using Android-based tablets or cellular phones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Step 2: Identify facility-level modifiable bottlenecks using process mapping. Enabling facility-level staff to identify and gain consensus on bottlenecks to address in their PMTCT system is essential to defining innovations to implement. SAIA applies sequential process flow mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2), coupled with workflow observation, to identify bottlenecks and guide discussion on opportunities to modify workflow across PMTCT services.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Step 3: Define and implement facility-specific workflow adaptations to address modifiable bottlenecks. After identifying modifiable barriers within cascade steps, facility staff identify a simple, specific change to improve performance within the targeted step. Selected workflow adaptations should be feasible to implement, be within the scope of influence of facility management and PMTCT staff, and be expected to lead to rapid, substantial improvements in the targeted cascade step (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for examples from the original SAIA trial). Ideas for adaptations come from brainstorming solutions with facility-level staff as well as from modifiable best practices from the SAIA trial, high performing PMTCT services in Mozambique, and the published literature. An implementation plan for the innovation is described in writing to clarify operational design and roles, and ensure clinic-level consensus.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Step 4: Monitor changes in routine performance and initiate additional iterations. Facility staff monitor improvements in routine data for the PMTCT step selected for improvement. Measuring the absolute increase in the proportion of women and infants progressing through targeted steps captures large, rapid improvements accompanying modifications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">Step 5: Repeat cycle. Systems engineering process improvements are by definition iterative, with ongoing testing of innovations responsive to evolving, contextually specific barriers. Facility staff repeat steps 1–5, focusing on identifying new approaches to modify previously identified barriers, or if the first cycle was successful, improving priority bottlenecks identified in a repeated systems analysis.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Five steps of the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) implementation strategy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2019_889_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Facility-level workflow modifications from the original SAIA trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Type of change</th><th>Specific example</th><th>Process improvement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> 1.

                <p id="Par39">SAIA-SCALE’s delivery schedule, intervention guides, and intervention tools are based on the SAIA trial. Immediately prior to initiating implementation, two maternal and child health supervisors from each district initiating implementation in the activating wave receive a 1-week group training on the SAIA strategy led by research nurses from the original SAIA trial. This training covers an introduction to the SAIA analysis and improvement tools, implementation schedule, and data collection procedures. If district management personnel change, newly appointed managers will receive on-the-job training in study procedures from SAIA-SCALE research nurses.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Subsequently, district maternal and child health supervisors, together with study nurses, introduce SAIA to selected health facilities over a 2-day period (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Within each district, SAIA is introduced one facility at a time, until all three intervention facilities are covered in each district. For the first 2 months post-introduction, district maternal and child health supervisors visit implementing health facilities every 2 weeks, followed by monthly visits through the 10-month intensive implementation phase and 2-year sustainment phase. Throughout the first year, maternal and child health supervisors are accompanied on facility visits by study nurses. Based on the initial SAIA trial, it is expected that analysis and improvement cycles will be approximately monthly, with an average of 12 cycles per year in each facility.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>SAIA introduction schedule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Day 1 AM</th><th>Day 1 PM</th><th>Day 2 AM</th><th>Day 2 PM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intro to SAIA</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Process mapping (ANC, maternity, postpartum, at-risk care)</td><td/><td>X</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>PCAT</td><td/><td/><td>X</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Feedback session</td><td/><td/><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Implementation start</td><td/><td/><td/><td>X</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>ANC</italic> antenatal care, <italic>HIV</italic> human immunodeficiency virus, <italic>PCAT</italic> PMTCT cascade analysis tool, <italic>SAIA</italic> Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

              <p id="Par71">SAIA-SCALE is a pragmatic trial to test a novel, scalable dissemination approach designed to lead to broad improvements in implementation of Option B+ to reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission across a large health system network. The implementation approach aligns with existing administrative structures, providing a practical tool to integrate into routine functions of district supervisors. As many countries decentralize authority to jurisdictions closer to where services are offered (e.g., districts, sub-districts, and counties), the SAIA-SCALE model is an approach that can enable health authorities to facilitate improvements in their facility network. The phased-in design has a number of advantages. It ensures that all districts receive SAIA; allows for understanding SAIA’s impact during periods of intensive implementation and sustainment of effect when study personnel withdraw their support; and is feasible given the large number of districts and facilities in the study province. The stepped wedge cluster randomized design represents a rigorous approach that is sufficiently powered to detect improvements in process and patient-level outcomes, and reduces sources of bias. The inclusion of multiple implementation science frameworks provides a comprehensive understanding of the implementation process, identifies core intervention components, identifies determinants of successful implementation, and improves transferability of the SAIA-SCALE approach to other settings. The economic evaluation provides practical information for the Ministry of Health in Mozambique to further spread SAIA, and to validate an approach to integrating electronic data capture and activity-based costing into large-scale government programs. Ultimately, the study is uniquely positioned to fill a critical evidence gap on integrating and scaling-up implementation strategies across management systems to optimize PMTCT services across broad facility networks.</p>
              <p id="Par72">The SAIA implementation strategy is user-friendly and low-cost approach to deliver a package of systems engineering tools to improve complex care cascades that require progression through multiple sequential steps, with linkage to other services within and outside of primary care facilities. The strategy has proven to be flexible to content and context, and we are currently adapting SAIA for a number of complex cascades beyond the PMTCT in primary care settings in east and southern Africa (including the pediatric HIV testing and linked care cascade, the services for severe mental illness cascade, the hypertension screening and management cascade, the HIV testing in family planning services cascade, and the cervical cancer screening and treatment cascade). SAIA-SCALE represents the first attempt to study an approach to deliver SAIA, which is a precursor to enabling further spread.</p>
              <p id="Par73">At the time of submission, SAIA-SCALE is in month 12 of implementation in the first four intervention districts and 12 intervention facilities. There has been tremendous enthusiasm for the study among provincial, district, and health facility leadership and staff. Given that district maternal and child health supervisors are delivering the intervention to facilities in their districts, buy-in from authorities is essential for an effective approach and further scaling-up.</p>

                <p id="Par17">• Research on implementation strategies generally focus on whether or not they improve adoption and/or implementation of evidence-based interventions. Relatively little research has focused on how to scale-up effective implementation strategies through routine management structures.</p>
                <p id="Par18">• Research on systems engineering tools has largely come from high-resourced health systems, with little from low-income countries.</p>
                <p id="Par19">• Our study examines if delivery of a user-friendly, low-cost package of systems engineering tools through district health teams in a low-income public sector health system improves health system performance and patient outcomes, and provide decision-makers with evidence they need to decide whether and how to further scale-up the approach.</p>
