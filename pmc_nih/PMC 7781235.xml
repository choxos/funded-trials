                <p id="P3">Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells are effective treatment for B-cell lymphoma but often cause neurologic toxicity. We treated 20 patients with B-cell lymphoma on a phase I, first-in-humans clinical trial of T cells expressing the novel anti-CD19 CAR Hu19-CD828Z (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02659943">NCT02659943</ext-link>). The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility of Hu19-CD828Z T-cell therapy. Secondary objectives included assessments of CAR T-cell blood levels, anti-lymphoma activity, second infusions, and immunogenicity. All objectives were met. Fifty-five percent of patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells obtained complete remissions. Hu19-CD828Z T cells had similar clinical anti-lymphoma activity as T cells expressing FMC63–28Z, an anti-CD19 CAR tested previously by our group that contains murine binding domains and is used in axicabtagene ciloleucel. However, severe neurologic toxicity occurred in only 5% of patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells versus 50% of patients who received FMC63–28Z T cells (P=0.0017). T cells expressing Hu19-CD828Z released lower levels of cytokines than T cells expressing FMC63–28Z. Lower levels of cytokines were detected in blood of patients receiving Hu19-CD828Z T cells versus FMC63–28Z T cells, which could explain the lower level of neurologic toxicity with Hu19-CD828Z. Levels of cytokines released by CAR-expressing T cells particularly depended on the hinge and transmembrane domains included in the CAR design.</p>

Anti-CAR T-cell responses were detected after CAR T-cell infusion in 3 patients on the Hu19-CD828Z trial and 8 patients on the FMC63–28Z trial (Extended Data 8, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We also assessed blood CAR<sup>+</sup> T-cell levels in patients on the Hu19-CD828Z and FMC63–28Z clinical trials. We did not find a difference in either peak blood CAR<sup>+</sup> cell levels or 1-month CAR<sup>+</sup> cell levels in patients with or without anti-CAR T-cell responses (Extended Data 9). For patients on the FMC63–28Z clinical trial, there was a not statistically-significant trend toward higher blood CAR<sup>+</sup> cell levels one month after CAR T-cell infusion for patients without anti-CAR T-cell responses versus patients with anti-CAR T-cell responses (P=0.061).</p>

              <p id="P31">In our previous clinical trial with FMC63–28Z CAR T cells, neurologic toxicity was a more substantial clinical problem than CRS<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In the previous NCI clinical trial of FMC63–28Z T cells, 4 of 22 patients had Grade 3 or 4 CRS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) while 11 of 22 patients had Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity. In the Hu19-CD828Z trial, 2 patients had Grade 3 or 4 CRS (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); both had high lymphoma burdens (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P32">Compared with FMC63–28Z-expressing T cells, Hu19-CD828Z-expressing T cells released lower levels of cytokines, and patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells had lower serum levels of many immunological proteins compared with patients who received FMC63–28Z T cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">k</xref>). We conclude that a likely reason for the lower incidence of neurologic toxicity with Hu19-CD828Z T cells versus FMC63–28Z T cells is release of lower levels cytokines and other potentially neurotoxic substances by Hu19-CD828Z T cells. Although a causative mechanistic explanation is not provided by this report, most authors consider elevated serum cytokines an important factor in CAR T-cell neurologic toxicity<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P33">Because only 1 patient in the current Hu19-CD828Z trial had Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity, we were not able to assess for associations between serum immunological protein levels and severe neurotoxicity. In our previous trial of FMC63–28Z T cells, the serum proteins most closely associated with Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity were Granzyme A and B, IL-10, IL-15, interferon-inducible protein-10, and IFNγ<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Many of these proteins associated with neurotoxicity in our previous trial<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> were lower in the serum of patients receiving Hu19-CD828Z T cells compared with patients receiving FMC63–28Z T cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">k</xref>, Extended Data 4 and 6).</p>
              <p id="P34">We found equivalent peak blood CAR<sup>+</sup> cell levels with Hu19-CD828Z and FMC63–28Z (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). One-month after the day of infusion, blood levels of Hu19-CD828Z T cells were higher than blood levels of FMC63–28Z T cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">k</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the lower level of neurologic toxicity with Hu19-CD828Z T cells versus FMC63–28Z T cells was not due to lower levels of blood Hu19-CD828Z T cells compared with FMC63–28Z T cells.</p>
              <p id="P35">Some phenotypic markers, including CCR7, CD45RA, and CD28 indicated that the infusion Hu19-CD828Z T cells were slightly less differentiated than infusion FMC63–28Z T cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">f</xref>), but other markers indicated a more differentiated or activated phenotype for Hu19-CD828Z T cells versus FMC63–28Z T cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P36">Our results did not demonstrate that recipient T-cell responses against CARs were a critical factor in CAR<sup>+</sup> cell blood levels (Extended Data 9); however, the number of patients assessed was small, so firm conclusions on the importance of CAR immunogenicity cannot be reached.</p>
              <p id="P37">Despite the lower level of neurologic toxicity with Hu19-CD828Z, clinical anti-lymphoma activity was equivalent with Hu19-CD828Z and FMC63–28Z. Incidence of Grade 3–4 neurologic toxicity was 28% in a large multicenter clinical trial of FMC63–28Z-expressing T cells (axicabtagene ciloleucel)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Although the number of patients treated with Hu19-CD828Z was small, the incidence of neurologic toxicity with this CAR compares favorably with the rates of neurologic toxicity on other anti-CD19 CAR trials<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. The anti-CD19 CAR Juno(J)CAR015 was associated with substantial neurologic toxicity including 5 deaths from cerebral edema<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the 19–28z CAR in JCAR015 contained CD28 hinge and transmembrane domains<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Our results with Hu19-CD828Z show that CARs targeting CD19 are not intrinsically linked to high levels of neurologic toxicity and that inclusion of CD28 domains in CARs is not intrinsically linked to high levels of toxicity, especially neurologic toxicity.</p>
              <p id="P38">This work demonstrates that CAR design affects CAR T-cell function in a clinically-significant manner. The difference in function between Hu19-CD828Z T cells and FMC63–28Z T cells was in part due to the difference in hinge plus transmembrane domains as shown by our prior work<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and the lower levels of CD19-specific cytokine-release by Hu19-CD828Z T cells versus Hu19–28Z T cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). The difference in cytokine release between Hu19-CD828Z T cells and FMC63–28Z T cells was not completely explained by the difference in hinge and transmembrane domains between these CARs because the difference in cytokine release between T cells expressing Hu19-CD828Z and T cells expressing FMC63–28Z was larger than the difference in cytokine release between T cells expressing Hu19-CD828Z and T cells expressing Hu19–28Z (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>) despite inclusion of CD28 hinge plus transmembrane domains in both Hu19–28Z and FMC63–28Z. There was no consistent difference in IFNγ release by T cells expressing Hu19-CD828Z versus FMC63-CD828Z, a CAR that differed from Hu19-CD828Z only in the scFv (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), so the choice of scFv in isolation, was not the explanation for the difference in cytokine release by Hu19-CD828Z versus FMC63–28Z T cells. We hypothesize that structural characteristics of Hu19-CD828Z and FMC63–28Z including the hinge plus transmembrane domains and possibly interactions of the hinge plus transmembrane domains with scFvs or the cytoplasmic CD28 domain caused the large magnitude of difference in cytokine release between Hu19-CD828Z T cells and FMC63–28Z T cells. Further work to more definitively determine the structural differences between Hu19-CD828Z and FMC63–28Z is underway.</p>
              <p id="P39">These findings demonstrate that CARs can be designed to minimize toxicity while retaining anti-malignancy activity. Our results agree with recent work by Ying et al. relating CAR design to toxicity<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Our work differs from this prior work in several critical aspects. First, our work provides a comparison of clinical and immunologic results of two CARs tested at the same institution, so many confounding factors that arise in comparing different trials were minimized. Second, our work focuses on a comparison of CARs with hinge plus transmembrane domains from CD8α versus CD28; in contrast, the focus of Ying et al. was on the length of hinge and transmembrane domains. Third, our work focused on neurologic toxicity and demonstrated that a novel CAR, Hu19-CD828Z, was associated with less neurologic toxicity than FMC63–28Z, the CAR used in the U.S. Food and Drug administration-approved product axicabtagene ciloleucel. Fourth, our work showed that clinically-effective CARs containing CD28 costimulatory domains are not always associated with high levels of toxicity; in contrast, Ying et al. focused exclusively on CARs containing 4–1BB costimulatory domains.</p>
              <p id="P40">Our group and others have reported that inactivating CD3ζ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) caused improvement of CAR T-cell survival and anti-tumor efficacy in mice; these ITAM studies showed another approach for a potentially beneficial reduction in CAR T-cell activation strength<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Reducing scFv affinity is another potential way to reduce CAR T-cell toxicity<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P41">Future CAR T-cell therapies can be improved by designing CARs with an aim to increase the efficacy to toxicity ratio. CARs associated with low to moderate levels of in vitro cytokine production could be prioritized for development over CARs associated with high levels of cytokine production. Clinical development of the Hu19-CD828Z CAR is continuing with Hu19-CD828Z as one CAR in a biscistronic construct encoding Hu19-CD828Z and an anti-CD20 CAR.</p>

Only 1 patient who had received an allogeneic stem cell transplant was enrolled, and this patient never received protocol treatment. Twenty-five patients were enrolled on the main cohort for patients who had never received allogeneic stem cell transplantation; twenty of these patients received protocol therapy and are all reported in this manuscript. Five patients were enrolled but never received CAR T cells because either clinical parameters changed so that patients no longer met protocol eligibility requirements and/or the CAR T-cell product did not meet certificate of analysis requirements (CoA). One patient had treatment cancelled because of rapid lymphoma progression causing decreased performance status. A second patient had treatment cancelled because of neutropenia. One patient had treatment cancelled for both thrombocytopenia and failure of the CAR T-cell product to meet CoA requirements due to a low percent CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells in the clinical T-cell product. The fourth patient enrolled but not treated had treatment cancelled for both neutropenia and failure of the CAR T-cell product to meet CoA requirements due to a low percent CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells among the clinical T-cell product. The fifth patient enrolled but not treated voluntarily withdrew from the protocol. Patients were enrolled between 1-21-2016 and 1-5-2018. Enrollment to the trial has permanently ceased. All patients received Hu19-CD828Z CAR T cells between 2-17-2016 and 12-14-2017. Data was finalized (locked), on 5-7-2019. Patients were not formally recruited. Eligible patients were enrolled on a first-come, first-serve basis.

                <p id="P62">The cryopreserved FMC63–28Z T cells received by patients 29 to 43 on the FMC63–28Z trial were produced by a method similar but not identical to the process described above for fresh FMC63–28Z T cells. On day 0, PBMC were cultured in PermaLife bags (OriGen Biomedical) at 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in serum-free media Optimizer CTS with T-cell Serum Replacement (LifeTechnologies). T cells were activated with OKT3 at 50 ng/ml and IL-2 (300 IU/ml) for 2 days. On day 1 new PermaLife bags were coated with retronectin (10 μg/mL) and stored at 4°C overnight. On day 2, liquid was removed from the bag, and the bag was washed once with a 2.5% HEPES in Hank’s balanced salt solution (Lonza). Retroviral vector supernatant was then added to retronectin-coated bags and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. For untransduced control cells, bags were loaded with medium only. The activated PBMC were washed using the Sepax II, an automated closed system for processing blood-derived cell products. Cells were then transferred to the retrovirus loaded bags at a concentration of 0.5 ×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and incubated at 37°C. On day 3, cells were transferred into new bags for further proliferation. The entire culture period from initiation until cryopreservation was 6 to 9 days. On the day of cryopreservation, the cells were washed with 0.9% saline with the Sepax II. The FMC63–28Z T-cell product was formulated in CS250 cryostorage bags (OriGen Biomedical) at the target dose. T cells were suspended in a solution containing 0.9% saline plus 5% HSA and a 1:1 volume of Cryostor 10 (BioLife Solutions) was added. The cells were frozen in a controlled-rate freezer (Planer) and stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen. On the day of infusion, the frozen cells were thawed at 37°C and infused into patients within 2 hours.</p>

                  <title>CAR detection on FMC63–28Z infusion T cells by anti-Fab antibody staining to determine clinical T-cell dose</title>
                  <p id="P63">This method was used to determine the percentage of CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells among infusion FMC63–28Z T cells. For each patient, a sample of FMC63–28Z-transduced cells was stained with biotin-labeled polyclonal goat anti-mouse-F(ab)<sub>2</sub> antibodies (anti-Fab, Jackson Immunoresearch) to detect the CAR. A sample of untransduced identically-cultured cells from the same donor was stained with the anti-Fab antibodies as a control. Next, the cells were all stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin (BD), anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8. The percentage of FMC63–28Z-transduced T cells that expressed the CAR (CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells) was calculated by subtracting the percentage of untransduced CD3<sup>+</sup> cells that were stained with the anti-Fab antibodies from the percentage of FMC63–28Z-transduced CD3<sup>+</sup> cells that were stained with the anti-Fab antibodies.

                <p id="P65">For each patient on both the Hu19-CD828Z trial and the FMC63–28Z trial, DNA was extracted from PBMC collected before treatment and at multiple time-points after treatment. DNA was extracted by using a Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit. DNA from each time-point was amplified in duplicate with a primer and probe set (Applied Biosystems) that was specific for either Hu19-CD828Z or FMC63–28Z. Real-time PCR was carried out with a Roche Light Cycler 480 real-time PCR system. Similar to an approach used previously by other investigators, we made serial 1:5 dilutions of DNA from the infusion T cells of each patient into pretreatment DNA from the same patient, and we made standard curves by performing qPCR on this DNA<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. We determined the percentage of the infusion T cells that were CAR<sup>+</sup> by flow cytometry. We assumed that only infusion T cells with surface CAR expression detected by flow cytometry contained the CAR gene. This assumption probably underestimates the actual number of cells containing the CAR gene because all cells containing the CAR gene might not express the CAR protein on the cell surface. To determine the percentage of PBMC that contained the CAR gene at each time-point after CAR T-cell infusion, we compared the qPCR results obtained with DNA of PBMC from each time-point to the qPCR results obtained from each patient’s infusion cell standard curve. All samples were normalized to β-actin with an Applied Biosystems β−actin control reagents kit. After the percentage of CAR<sup>+</sup> PBMC was determined by PCR, the absolute number of CAR<sup>+</sup> PBMC was calculated by multiplying the percentage of CAR<sup>+</sup> PBMC by the sum of the absolute number of blood lymphocytes and monocytes.</p>
                <p id="P66">The qPCR reactions with different primers and probes had to be used for Hu19-CD828Z and FMC63–28Z because the DNA encoding the different CARs had little sequence in common. The PCR reactions were comparable. The lower limits of detection of both PCR reactions were not different. The mean lower limit of detection for the Hu19-CD828Z PCR was 0.04% (range 0.003–0.111%), and the mean lower limit of detection for the FMC63–28Z PCR was 0.07% (range 0.004–0.294%). The R<sup>2</sup> for all qPCR assays was 0.99.</p>

CD19-K562 and NGFR-K562 cells were generated in our lab by obtaining K562 cells from ATCC and transducing them with gamma-retroviral vectors encoding either the gene for CD19 or the gene for low-affinity nerve growth factor (NGFR). Expression of either CD19 or NGFR was confirmed by flow cytometry on CD19-K562, and NGFR-K562, and all cells were mycoplasma negative. Final cell concentrations were adjusted to 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL for both target cell lines and T cells. Viable target cells (2.5×10<sup>4</sup>) and viable CAR T cells (2.5×10<sup>4</sup>) were combined into individual wells of a 96-well U-bottom plate in duplicate. In addition, as controls, CAR T-cell-only and target-only (CD19-K562 and NGFR-K562) cultures were run at the same time as co-culture replicates. All cultures were incubated overnight (~18 hours) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The following day, supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and transferred into a fresh 96-well U-bottom plate. Supernatants were stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis.</p>

The initial partial models were obtained using structure prediction methods including: SwissModel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/">https://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>); Phyre2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/">www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/</ext-link>); I-Tasser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/">https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/</ext-link>) and Robetta (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://robetta.bakerlab.org">robetta.bakerlab.org</ext-link>) The structures of the hinges were further refined using Feedback Restrained Molecular Dynamics (FRMD)<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> as implemented in X-plor-NIH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih/">https://nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih/</ext-link>). FRMD affords a simple protocol to bias a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory towards a consensus arrangement, allowing the combination of multiple structures. The best models for each section were selected based on compactness, energy, and the exposure of the N and C termini to facilitate their connection to other segments. The partial models were homo docked to form C2 (two-fold rotation axis) symmetric dimers using the program ZDOCK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zdock.umassmed.edu">http://zdock.umassmed.edu</ext-link>). The dimerized partial models were combined by first inserting the trans-membrane region in a model membrane and subsequently attaching the other segments followed by constrained relaxation. In this work, we used the Lipid14 extension using a very soft restraint in the lipid heavy atoms (0.1kcal/mol.A<sup>2</sup>), and we followed the recommendations in Marrink et al.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. The very soft restraint is sufficient to stabilize the membrane while allowing enough flexibility for the transmembrane domain. Initial models were annealed in an explicit solvent box using MD simulations. All MD calculations were performed using Gromacs 5.1.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gromacs.org">http://www.gromacs.org</ext-link>) with the AMBER Force field and default parameters in the NPT ensemble. Coarse grain MD simulations were performed to accelerate the exploration of conformations and to compute the diffusion coefficients<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Finally, full atom MD production trajectories (25 to 50 ns) were collected after stabilization. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2</xref> presents a representative conformation of the CAR (top) and a set of conformations most representative of the flexibility observed during the MD trajectories (bottom).

The peptide bins used to assess construct immunogenicity were composed of 15mer peptides &gt;95% purified with 5mer-overlaps in C terminals and N terminals (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Ninety-six well-ELISPOT plates (BioWhittaker) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μL capture antibody in PBS (anti-IFN-γ M700A-E, 2 μg/ml; Endogen) then blocked with bovine serum albumin fraction V (10 g/L in PBS) for 60 minutes and washed three times with PBS. Live frozen PBMCs were thawed and incubated at 4.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per M700A-E-coated well for 24 h at 37 °C, 7% CO2, in complete RPMI medium (94% RPMI, 1% l-glutamine, 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum). Medium alone served as negative control and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at 5 pg/ml served as positive control. Four positive control samples were identified in a library of 40 normal donors (CTL e-PBMC<sup>®</sup> library) with low background (BG) in medium (spot forming cells per well ‘SFC’ below 10), SFC 302 ± 31 with peptide stimulation, and TNTC (“too numerous to count” &gt; 1,000 spots) after PHA activation; two of the 4 donors were used as positive controls during patient sample screening. After cell incubation with mitogen or peptide pools, ELISPOT plates were washed three times with PBS, three times with PBS-TWEEN (0.5%), and captured IFN-γ was detected by anti-IFNγ 133.5 biotin (2 μg/ml; Endogen). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween and incubated 120 min with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (50 μl/well) at 1:1000. Development solution (BCIP/NBT Phosphatase Substrate, KPL) was added, and the reaction was stopped after spots became visible.

Proteins were measured in serum samples by Luminex<sup>®</sup> assay from days 2 to 14 after CAR T-cell infusion. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by trapezoidal method. Statistics were by 2-tailed Mann-Whitney test.</p>

                  <p id="P101"><bold>Structural models of CARs</bold>. Top row: schematic representations of Hu19-CD828Z (left) and FMC63–28Z (right) CAR models are shown; scFv in blue; hinge in green; transmembrane domain in yellow; intracellular domain in red. The membrane position during molecular dynamics simulations is shown in grey. Bottom row: conformational flexibility for each corresponding CAR depicted as superimposed carbon-alpha traces for a set of 50 representative conformations observed during a 50 nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectory. The differences in flexibility originate in the very different structure and dynamic behavior of the corresponding hinge regions during the dynamics simulations. Transmembrane and scFv domains are affected by the hinge properties and display very different behaviors as well. A quantitative analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories reveals that these behaviors affect the scFv mobility (assessed as molecular diffusibility) and the proper formation of a transmembrane dimer evaluated by the helix-helix occluded surface. All models assume a dimeric structure anchored by disulfide bonds. In short, Hu19-CD828Z exhibited less conformational flexibility than FMC63–28Z.</p>

No statistically significant differences in blood CAR<sup>+</sup> cell levels were found between patients with or without anti-CAR responses. All patients with adequate cell samples for both ELISPOT and qPCR are included. P values by Mann-Whitney test are shown on the plots; significance was defined as P&lt;0.05. Of the 4 comparisons, the FMC63–28Z 1-month comparison was closest to statistical significance with P=0.061. Each symbol represents an individual patient. The number of unique patients analyzed were as follows: Hu19-CD828Z Peak, n=18; FMC63–28Z Peak, n=18; Hu19-CD828Z 1 month, n=18; FMC63–28Z 1 month n=13.</p>

                <p id="P90">(<bold>a</bold>) Hu19-CD828Z contained the Hu19 human scFv, CD8α hinge and transmembrane domains, the CD28 cytoplasmic domain, and a CD3ζ domain. FMC63–28Z was used in prior clinical trials. FMC63–28Z had a scFv from a murine antibody, hinge, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains from CD28, and a CD3ζ domain. (<bold>b</bold>) The clinical protocol included a CAR T-cell infusion preceded by conditioning chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide 300mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day and fludarabine 30mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day both daily for 3 days. (<bold>c</bold>) Hu19-CD828Z expression on infusion CAR T cells of Patient 12 was assessed by staining with the anti-CAR antibody and anti-CD3. Staining of pre-culture PBMC from Patient 12 is shown as a control. Similar results were obtained with all 20 patients that received Hu19-CD828Z T cells. (<bold>d</bold>) Durations of response are shown. Duration of response was from the day of 1<sup>st</sup> response until one of the following: progressive lymphoma, the patient started a different lymphoma therapy, or latest documented ongoing response; (*) indicates ongoing response at last follow-up. (<bold>e</bold>) Event-free survival of all 20 patients is shown. (<bold>f</bold>) Patient 6 obtained an ongoing CR of DLBCL. Yellow areas indicated by the arrows on the PET-CT scan are lymphoma. Lymphoma resolved after Hu19-CD828Z CAR T-cell infusion. The yellow areas in the heart and kidneys are from accumulation of radiotracer, not lymphoma. (<bold>g</bold>) PET-CT scan of Patient 13 shows areas of follicular lymphoma as red and yellow before CAR T-cell treatment and (<bold>h</bold>) disappearance of lymphoma after CAR T-cell treatment. Brain, kidneys, and bladder are normally red or yellow because of high metabolism and accumulation of radiotracer.</p>

Our trial did not record Grade 1 adverse events. ^Patient 4 had continuous SD from the time of his first CAR T-cell infusion until going off-study to pursue other therapy.</p>
