              <p id="P2">Key checkpoints in T cell-dependent antibody responses <italic>in vivo</italic> are dependent on antigen-specific B cell-T cell interactions. The initiation of T cell-dependent antibody responses occurs in secondary lymphoid organs and is dependent on the stable interaction of antigen-primed helper T (T<sub>H</sub>) cells with activated antigen-specific B cells through peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presented on the B cell surface [reviewed in <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>]. Depending, in part, on the quality of the B cell-T<sub>H</sub> cell interaction, B cells either enter germinal centers (GCs) or differentiate into short-lived plasma cells (PCs) and GC-independent memory B cells (MBCs) <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Within GCs, the competitive process of affinity selection occurs based on the ability of B cell receptors (BCRs) to capture, process and present antigen to T follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells. The B cellsâ€™ successful presentation of antigen to T<sub>FH</sub> cells ultimately results in the differentiation of GC B cells to long-lived MBCs and PCs.</p>
              <p id="P3">B cells also express germline encoded Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that respond to microbial products expressing pathogen-associated molecular patterns <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The dual expression of the BCR and TLRs allows B cells to modulate the outcome of antigen encounter in the presence of pathogens (reviewed in <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>). Indeed, TLR9 signaling has been shown to enhance the response of B cells to antigens coupled to the TLR9 agonist CpG in terms of proliferation and differentiation to antibody secreting cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition to signaling for B cell activation, the BCR functions to transport bound antigen to specialized intracellular compartments in which the antigen is degraded and the resulting peptides are bound to MHC class II molecules that are presented on the cell surface for recognition by antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub> cells <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. At present, we do not know whether TLR signaling influences the antigen processing and presentation function of the BCR.</p>
              <p id="P4">Although TLR signaling has the potential to amplify humoral responses to antigen<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, B-cell intrinsic TLR signaling does not appear to be required for adjuvant-enhanced T cell-dependent antigen-specific antibody responses <italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Although adjuvants can influence several qualities of antibody responses including kinetics, magnitude and breadth <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, until recently the ability of adjuvants to augment B cell GC responses including somatic hypermutation (SHM) events has not been explored. Recently, the HIV envelope (Env)-specific B cell receptor response in nonhuman primates to immunization with Env formulated with eight different adjuvants, including ones that target TLR pathways, were compared<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The adjuvants increased Env-specific antibody titers, but remarkably, did not increase SHM frequencies essential for the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies in this system.</p>
              <p id="P5">Here we provide evidence that although TLR9 signaling enhanced BCR-induced B cell proliferation and differentiation to antibody-secreting cells, TLR9 signaling reduced the ability of B cells to capture, process and present antigen, and to interact with and to activate antigen- specific T<sub>H</sub> cells <italic>in vitro</italic> which was detrimental to the establishment of high-affinity, long-lived Ab responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

                <title>The impact of TLR9 signaling on BCR-dependent B cell activation</title>
                <p id="P6">We determined the effect of CpG on several antigen-driven BCR-signaling functions in mouse splenic B cells purified by negative selection and treated with soluble polyclonal F(ab)â€²<sub>2</sub> IgM-specific antibody (Anti-IgM), CpG or Anti-IgM plus CpG. These included: phosphorylation of kinases in the BCR signaling pathway (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1aâ€“d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1aâ€“c</xref>); Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1d</xref>); the mRNA expression for cytokines at 3h post stimulation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) and cytokine protein levels at 18h (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>); the proliferative responses of B cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>); and IgM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>) and IgG (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>) secretion in culture supernatants over seven days. We determined that although Anti-IgM or CpG treatment resulted in different patterns of kinase phosphorylation, the result of treatment with both Anti-IgM and CpG was additive, Anti-IgM concentration dependent and for CpG responses, dependent on TLR9 expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1aâ€“c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1aâ€“c</xref>). In contrast, B cells only fluxed Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to Anti-IgM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1d</xref>) and this response was unaffected by CpG. CpG and Anti-IgM synergized to induce high expression of IL-2 and TNF at both mRNA and protein levels whereas the CpG-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-10 was substantially antagonized by Anti-IgM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). CpG enhanced the proliferation of sub-optimal Anti-IgM treated B cells in a TLR9-dependent fashion (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1e,f</xref>). CpG induced IgM secretion by B cells that was weakly antagonized by Anti-IgM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>), whereas Anti-IgM enhanced the CpG-induced secretion of IgG by IgG<sup>+</sup>-depleted B cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1g</xref>).

                <title>BCR internalization and trafficking of soluble antigen</title>
                <p id="P8">We measured the ability of the BCRs to internalize soluble antigen, either Anti-IgM by C57BL/6 B cells or hen egg lysozyme (HEL) by HEL-specific B cells from MD4 transgenic mice, in the presence or absence of CpG. CpG did not affect the rate or magnitude of BCR internalization in either case (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a,b</xref>). We characterized the intracellular vesicles into which Anti-IgM was internalized by incubating B cells with Anti-IgM-coated electron-dense metal particles and imaging the cells by transmission electron microscopy and tomography. Quantification of three dimensional reconstructions of the images showed Anti-IgM-particles in morphologically similar compartments in both CpG-treated and untreated cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2câ€“g</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P9">Once internalized into early endosomes, the BCR traffics antigen to increasingly acidic late endosomes. We measured the fluorescence intensity (FI) of HEL-specific MD4 B cells internalizing soluble HEL conjugated to the pH sensitive dye, pHrodo, the FI of which increases with decreases in pH. For both CpG-treated and untreated B cells, the FI increased at the same rate for the first 20 min at 37 Â°C (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a</xref>). In the absence of CpG, the FI of the B cells continued to increase with time. In contrast, the FI of the CpG-treated B cells increased little after 30 min and the block in trafficking was TLR9 dependent (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P10">We further characterized the endosomal compartments into which the BCR internalized rhodamine-conjugated HEL in the presence or absence of CpG by confocal microscopy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2câ€“e</xref>). Cells were fixed, stained with DAPI to label nuclei, and antibodies specific for either: CD71, the transferrin receptor, a marker of early endosomes, LAMP1, a marker of late endosomes, or H2M, a MHC class II chaperon present in antigen-processing compartments. Three dimensional colocalizations of HEL with CD71, LAMP1 or H2M were quantified by Imaris (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2câ€“e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3b,c</xref>). HEL colocalized with CD71 in early endosomes at 10 min and CpG treatment had no significant effect on colocalization (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Colocalization of HEL with both LAMP1 and H2M increased from 10 min (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3b,c</xref>) to 60 min and treatment with CpG significantly diminished the 60 min colocalization (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that TLR9 signaling compromised the BCRâ€™s delivery of antigen into late endosomes and the antigen processing compartments.</p>

                <p id="P11">We determined the effect of CpG treatment on B cell responses to antigen incorporated into fluid planar lipid bilayers. MD4 HEL-specific B cells were labeled using a Dylight 649-Fab Anti-IgM and placed on bilayer contained Alexa Fluor 488-labeled HEL and live cell imaging was carried out by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary videos S1aâ€“S1c</xref>). When pretreated for 20 min with CpG, the B cells spread more robustly over the HEL-containing bilayer, covering larger areas as compared to untreated B cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) but did not form a well-organized central synapse and accumulated less BCR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) and HEL (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) in the contact area. B cells pretreated for 60 min with CpG behaved similarly but contracted after 90s and accumulated less BCR but comparable amounts of HEL as compared to the untreated B cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) suggesting an antigen-independent component of BCR accumulation as described earlier<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P12">We also measured the BCR-dependent internalization of HEL incorporated into plasma membrane sheets (PMS) by HEL-specific MD4 B cells. B cells were labeled with Dylight 649-Fab Anti-IgM and placed for 30 min at 37 Â°C on CM-DiI- labeled PMS into which Alexa Fluor 488-HEL was incorporated. Confocal <italic>z</italic>-stack images were obtained and reconstituted as an <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic> view (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) using Matlab programs to quantify only the internalized antigen, excluding antigen tethered on the PMS surface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). In the absence of CpG, B cells internalized HEL from the PMS, but in the presence of CpG, HEL internalization was markedly less, as measured by either the percent of the HEL in the bilayer that was internalized or the total HEL internalized (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). We also determined the degree of colocalization of the BCR and HEL, and of HEL and fragments of the PMS in 3D-reconstructed images of the confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks of B cells placed on HEL-containing PMS for 30 min (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary videos 2a,b</xref>). HEL, BCR and fragments of the PMS above the contact area with the PMS surface indicate internalization (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). In the absence of CpG, B cells were frequently observed in contact areas in which the PMS had been cleared in contrast to CpG-treated B cells that were observed in areas covered by the PMS. Videos of 3D surface images showed that in both CpG-treated and untreated cells little antigen was retained on the B cell surface. In the <italic>xy</italic> and <italic>xz</italic> cross sections of B cells not treated with CpG, the BCR and HEL and PMS fragments to which HEL was bound are evidently inside the cell (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary videos 2a,b</xref>) where the BCR and HEL colocalized (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>) as did HEL and PMS fragments (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). However, for CpG-treated B cells although BCR and HEL were present intracellularly, very few PMS fragments were evident (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Co-localization of HEL and the BCR were similar to untreated cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>), however, the co-localization of HEL and fragments of the PMS were significantly decreased (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). The lack of PMS in CpG-treated B cells suggests that antigen taken up by BCRs in the presence of CpG did not involve pulling the antigen and attached PMS into the cell but likely was the result of the internalization of antigen that was not tightly attached to the PMS.</p>

A venn diagram (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and a principle component analysis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) of the results showed a remarkable separation of the transcription profiles of B cells under the different stimulation conditions. Thus, treatment of B cells with Anti-IgM and/or CpG resulted in activation of a distinct transcriptional program. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differentially expressed genes in B cells treated with Anti-IgM or CpG alone or together relative to unstimulated cells showed a variety of pathways were affected including those related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, signal transduction, responses to cytokines and cytoskeleton organization (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P14">We also quantified by flow cytometry the B cell surface expression of approximately 250 mouse cell surface proteins using a barcoding strategy<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and BioLegend LegendScreen kit (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). As compared to unstimulated cells, the expression of 63 surface proteins changed significantly upon treatment. We observed synergy (up to 55 fold) between CpG and Anti-IgM which induced increases in 48% of surface proteins; antagonism of Anti-IgM responses by CpG for 9.5% of markers and antagonism of CpG responses by Anti-IgM in 8% of surface proteins. The expression of 30% of surface proteins decreased in response to CpG and/or Anti-IgM. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that signaling through the BCR alone, TLR9 alone or both resulted in distinct outcomes.</p>
                <p id="P15">We further analyzed the effect of CpG and Anti-IgM on the expression of an early activation marker (CD69) and three cell surface molecules that are critical to B cell antigen presentation and activation of T<sub>H</sub> cells, namely MHC class II, CD86 and CD80 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4aâ€“g</xref>). MHC class II surface expression increased approximately eight- to 10-fold 24 to 48 h after B cells were treated with Anti-IgM alone which was antagonized by the addition of CpG in a TLR9-dependent process (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4c,f</xref>). However, treatment with CpG alone induced a four to five-fold increase in MHC class II surface expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4c,f</xref>) indicating that CpG initiates at least two signaling pathways through TLR9, one that antagonizes BCR-induced MHC class II expression and one that independently enhances MHC class II expression. We also determined the effect of CpG treatment on the ability of HEL-specific B cells from MD4 mice to process HEL and present HEL-peptide MHC class II IA<sup>k</sup> complexes (HEL- IA<sup>k</sup>) on the B cell surface using a HEL- IA<sup>k</sup>-specific mAb. After 24 h incubation with HEL, HEL-specific B cells significantly increased the cell surface levels of HEL- IA<sup>k</sup>, by approximately 2.5 fold and the addition of CpG blocked this increase (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e,f</xref>).</p>

In contrast, Anti-IgM treatment induced a large increase in the expression of CD86, that was blocked by CpG (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a,e</xref>). The regulation of the surface expression of CD69 showed a pattern consistent with a simple additive effect of Anti-IgM and CpG (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4d,g</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P17">We tested the effects of several inhibitors for kinases in the BCR and TLR9 signaling pathways on the induced expression of MHC class II and CD86.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P27">It was established over thirty years ago that the processing and presentation of antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> cells by antigen-specific B cells is highly efficient <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, although it was clear that antigen-specific B cells were able to efficiently process and present antigen, the role of B cell antigen processing and presentation in T cell-dependent antibody responses was not elucidated until recently. Several studies have now provided evidence that the ability of B cells to process and present antigen to antigen-activated T<sub>H</sub> cells and to T<sub>FH</sub> cells provides critical check points for the entry of B cells into the GC and for affinity selection of B cells expressing somatically hypermutated Ig genes in the GC <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The quality of the B cellâ€™s presentation of antigen to antigen-activated T cells at the T cell-B cell border in lymphoid organs determines, in part, if a B cell will enter the GC or differentiate along a GC-independent pathway to become short-lived plasma cells or GC-independent memory B cells <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In the GC light zone selection by T<sub>FH</sub> cells is dependent on the density of MHC peptide complexes on the B cell surface, reflecting the B cellâ€™s affinity-dependent ability to compete for antigen capture from FDCs <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Thus, B cell antigen processing and presentation controls, to a large extent, B cell clonal selection.</p>
              <p id="P28">Given the central role of B cell antigen gathering, processing and presentation in the generation of high affinity, long-lived antibody responses, it is likely that this B cell function is regulated to ensure appropriate and timely responses to antigenic challenge, particularly during infection. However, little is known about the role of innate immune receptors that respond to PAMP-containing microbial products in regulating these processes. We show that TLR9 signaling promotes B cell proliferation and differentiation into antibody secreting cells as previously shown <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and in addition triggers changes in gene expression including the downregulation of BCL6, a transcriptional repressor of PC differentiation, and upregulation of BLIMP1, a transcription factor that promotes PC differentation. However, TLR9 signaling greatly diminished the ability of antigen-specific B cells to gather, process and present antigen, and to interact with and activate antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the presence of CpG, antigen-specific B cells also fail to upregulate important costimulatory ligands for T cells, including CD86. The ability of CpG to diminish the ability of B cells to capture antigen from membranes and cell surfacesâ€”as was shown hereâ€”is particularly relevant to the regulation of B cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic> where the B cells in lymphoid organs access most antigens on the surfaces of FDCs <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P29">These findings have implications for the outcome of T cell-dependent antibody responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. If during an infection B cells encounter TLR9 ligands, our data suggest that the B cells would have diminished ability to gather, process and present antigen to antigen-activated T<sub>H</sub> cells at the T-B border of lymphoid organs. As a consequence, B cells would be directed to GC-independent pathways, yielding affinity unselected plasma cells and GC-independent memory B cells. It may be advantageous to rapidly produce antibodies with a wide range of affinities in response to TLR9 activation during an acute infection and to leave an unselected broad B cell repertoire for future antigen challenge <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Such a mechanism may underlie a recent observation in a nonhuman primate model, that although adjuvants that stimulate innate immune receptors, including TLRs, were effective in enhancing the magnitude of Ab responses to protein immunogens, remarkably, these were not able to increase SHM <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P30">We present evidence both in mice and in humans consistent with this model. We compared the responses of chimeric mice containing B cells that were WT to the responses of chimeric mice containing MyD88 KO B cells upon immunization with an alum adsorbed protein antigen (NP-CGG) given together with CpG. The ability of B cells to respond to CpG resulted in short-lived low-affinity IgG responses and reduced numbers of antigen-specific GC B cells. In humans we provided evidence that the inclusion of CpG in a recombinate protein vaccine formulated on alum resulted in increased levels of antigen-specific Abs but had no detectable effect on the apparent affinity of the antibodies as compared to the response of individuals receiving the vaccine alone. To our knowledge the studies presented here and those of Francica <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> are the only ones to address the impact of TLR ligands as adjuvants on antibody affinity maturation. It will be of genuine interest to determine the generality of these findings to other vaccines and vaccine regimens.</p>

                <p id="P54">For RNA sequencing, 250 Î¼l of purified mouse B cells cultured in full media for 4 h were mixed with 750 Î¼l of Trizol LS (Thermofisher) and RNA was isolated according to manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. Total RNA was prepared for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA-Seq library preparation kit (Illumina). Quality and size of the final purified libraries were tested on BioAnalzyer DNA 1000 chips (Agilent Technologies.). Libraries were quantified by qPCR using the Kapa Quantification Kit for Illumina sequencing (Kapa Biosystems) and then normalized to 2.0 nM stocks. These samples were pooled equally and clustered on the HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using 12 pM of template for a 2x100 bp Rapid sequencing run. Raw NGS reads were prepped by first removing any illumina adapter sequences using Cutadapt v1.12 <sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, and then trimmed and filtered for quality, q=18, and length, min length 35bp using FastX Tool Kit v0.0.13 (Hannon Lab, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory).

                <p id="P55">Total serum IgG antibodies from Pf AMA1 immunized patient subjects were purified by protein G affinity chromatography. Briefly, 0.5 ml serum from each individual subject was loaded onto a 5 ml HiTrap Protein G column (GE healthcare) and subjected to a standard elution with a glycine pH gradient. The eluted IgG protein was pooled together and dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes(pH 7.5) and 0.15 M NaCl for binding studies.</p>
                <p id="P56">Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument and analyzed with BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore AB). To measure the affinity, Pf AMA1 protein was immobilized on caboxylated dextran CM5 chips (Biacore AB) to 500â€“1500 response units (RU) using a primary amine-coupling and 10 Î¼l/min flow rate in 10mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5). The analyte consisted of serial dilutions of IgG antibodies between 16.0 and 75 nM in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.15 M NaCl. The dissociation constants were obtained by kinetic curve fitting using BIAevaluation 4.1 (BIAcore Inc.).</p>
