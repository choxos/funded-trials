                <p id="P7">Accurate identification of tumor-derived somatic variants in plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) requires understanding the various biologic compartments contributing to the cfDNA pool. We sought to define the technical feasibility of a high-intensity sequencing assay of cfDNA and matched white-blood cell (WBC) DNA covering a large genomic region (508 genes, 2Mb, &gt;60,000X raw-depth) in a prospective study of 124 metastatic cancer patients, with contemporaneous matched tumor tissue biopsies, and 47 non-cancer controls. The assay displayed a high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for <italic>de novo</italic> detection of tumor-derived mutations and inference of tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, mutational signatures and sources of somatic mutations identified in cfDNA. The vast majority of cfDNA mutations (81.6% in controls and 53.2% in cancer patients) had features consistent with clonal hematopoiesis (CH). This cfDNA sequencing approach revealed that CH constitutes a pervasive biological phenomenon emphasizing the importance of matched cfDNA-WBC sequencing for accurate variant interpretation.</p>

              <p id="P8">Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the plasma of cancer patients constitutes a potential source of tumor-derived DNA<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Massively parallel sequencing analysis of cfDNA samples from cancer patients revealed that tumor-derived cfDNA (ctDNA) accounts for only a fraction of the total cfDNA, and this fraction varies according to disease burden, site, and tumor biologic features including histology, vascularization, proliferation and apoptosis rates<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. ctDNA fraction is extremely low in many early-stage and some metastatic cancers<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, requiring methods to detect mutations at extremely low allele fractions<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Most previous studies focused on analysis of patients with advanced disease using a panel of hotspot mutations or limited genomic regions of key cancer genes sequenced at high depths<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, a large number of genes at moderate sequencing depths<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, or a combination of methods to define ctDNA fraction using shallow whole-genome sequencing or targeted methods followed by whole-exome analysis of samples with a high ctDNA fraction<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P9">Even when accurate cfDNA assays are utilized, cfDNA sequencing results may still be confounded by biological signals arising from somatic mosaicism<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. One form of somatic mosaicism is clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which results from the accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are clonally propagated to their progeny<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. These somatic mutations may provide a fitness advantage to some HSCs and/or their descendant cells, resulting in their disproportionate expansion<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, or arise through neutral drift<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. CH increases with age and occurs in up to 31% of older individuals<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and can also be detected in cfDNA sequencing analysis<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In this context, it may confound the interpretation of cfDNA sequencing, particularly because a large proportion of the cfDNA fragments originate from hematopoietic cells<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P10">Comparisons of somatic genetic alterations detected in cfDNA samples and their respective tumor biopsies have revealed relatively good concordance between cfDNA and tumor biopsy sequencing, particularly among patients with advanced disease<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Additional somatic variants not present in tumor biopsies but in cfDNA only have also been documented<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>; their nature and source (tumor-derived vs. other sources), however, have yet to be defined.</p>
              <p id="P11">Here, we report on the development of a high-intensity sequencing assay of matched cfDNA and white blood cells (WBCs) for <italic>de novo</italic> characterization of the repertoire of somatic mutations in cfDNA, without <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of variants present in a matched tumor biopsy. This approach, combined with sequencing of DNA samples extracted from matched tumor tissue biopsies using an FDA-authorized targeted sequencing assay, allowed for categorization and quantification of cfDNA variant sources.</p>

                <p id="P12">This prospective observational study examined the technical feasibility of a high-intensity circulating cfDNA-based platform in patients with advanced untreated or progressive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), as well as non-cancer control participants (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Briefly, plasma cfDNA and matched WBC genomic DNA (gDNA) from patients with MBC, NSCLC, CRPC, or non-cancer controls were subjected to a targeted capture sequencing assay comprising the entire coding regions of 508 genes and intronic and/or regulatory regions of selected genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In cancer patients, tumor biopsies and matched normal WBC samples were collected within 6 weeks of plasma cfDNA samples with no intervening therapy change, and were sequenced in a CLIA-certified environment using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay, an FDA-authorized capture-based sequencing assay targeting the coding regions of 410 genes and intronic and/or regulatory regions of selected genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. For the purpose of comparison to tumor biopsies, only variants mapping to the intersection of the 410 genes present in the two gene panels were considered.</p>
                <p id="P13">Of 161 potentially eligible cancer patients (53 MBC, 53 NSCLC and 55 CRPC) enrolled between September 24, 2015-August 01, 2016, 124, 39 MBCs, 41 NSCLCs and 44 CRPCs were included in the concordance subset (evaluable for both tumor tissue and cfDNA analysis, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). The clinicopathologic features of the cohort were consistent with those of a contemporary prospectively collected cohort of consecutive cases of these malignancies (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Of the 50 non-cancer control samples, three failed cfDNA sequencing resulting in 47 evaluable samples.</p>

                <title>De novo detection of tumor-derived cfDNA mutations</title>
                <p id="P14">To identify the source of somatic variants found in cfDNA, sequencing was performed independently on cfDNA, WBC gDNA, and each cancer patient’s matched tumor biopsy and WBC gDNA samples (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The high-intensity cfDNA sequencing approach simultaneously analyzed plasma cfDNA and WBC gDNA using a targeted assay spanning approximately 2 Mb and utilizing unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to suppress technical assay errors at a minimum raw average target depth of 60,000X (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). A joint-variant-calling of plasma cfDNA and WBC gDNA variants was performed utilizing a machine learning-based noise model (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>–<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Together, this resulted in an assay with performance characteristics necessary for the detection of mutations near the molecular limits (high technical sensitivity; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>), low false positive (&lt;1 error in one million bases sequenced; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>–<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">h</xref>), high reproducibility in independent biological replicates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>) and a detection performance comparable to that of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Our high-intensity sequencing assay was found to have a per base error rate ranging from 1×10<sup>−5</sup> to 3×10<sup>−5</sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 2</xref>–<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>), which is comparable to that of other high-fidelity cfDNA sequencing assays<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="P15">Given these assay characteristics, we first sought to define the performance of the high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay for the detection of tumor-derived biopsy-matched somatic mutations without prior knowledge of the somatic alterations in the tumor cfDNA sequencing analysis (henceforth referred to as <italic>de novo</italic> detection). <italic>De novo</italic> detection of at least one tumor-derived mutation, as defined by MSK-IMPACT sequencing of the tumor biopsy, was observed in 104 of the 124 evaluable patients (84%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 76%−90%; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The detection rate in MBCs (95%, 95% CI: 83%−99%) was significantly higher than in NSCLCs (76%, 95% CI: 60%−80%; p=0.0258), and comparable to that of CRPCs (82%, 95% CI: 67%−92%). The large genomic footprint of the assay further allowed <italic>de novo</italic> cfDNA detection of 530 of 740 mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT in tumor biopsies (72%, 95% CI: 66%−75%; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), with similar percentages of tumor-derived mutations detected in MBCs (73%, 95% CI: 67%−79%), NSCLCs (71%, 95% CI: 65%−76%), and CRPCs (71%, 95% CI: 63%−78%).</p>
                <p id="P16">We next sought to define the genes targeted by <italic>de novo-</italic>detected somatic mutations in cfDNA. Our analysis of genes recurrently mutated in cfDNA as defined by the <italic>de novo</italic>-detected somatic mutations revealed that they consisted mostly of the same genes found to be mutated in the respective tumor samples (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Most importantly, this led to <italic>de novo</italic> detection of somatic mutations in cfDNA that were present in tumor biopsies but below the MSK-IMPACT assay limit of detection (subthreshold for previously established clinical variant calling cut-offs)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, or were neither detected in the tumor biopsy nor WBCs (variants of unknown source; VUSo).</p>
                <p id="P17">Given the low false positive rates and accuracy of the assay for measuring variant allele fractions (VAFs; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>), we quantified the VAFs of somatic mutations not present in the WBCs in controls and cancer patients. All but two of the 67 mutations (97%) detected in controls occurred at VAFs of &lt;1% (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), whereas 51.1%, 56.6%, and 54.5% of the variants detected in MBCs, NSCLCs, and CRPCs, respectively, were detected at VAFs of &lt;1%. In the vast majority of patients (88%), somatic mutations with the highest VAF (mean highest VAF 15.10%; median highest VAF 9.18%) were tumor-matched (biopsy-matched or biopsy-subthreshold; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P18">We next investigated whether the sensitivity of the assay would vary according to the prevalence of a given mutation within the tumor biopsy. The detection rate of mutations in cfDNA was significantly correlated with their cancer cell fractions in the tumor biopsies (the percentage of cancer cells within a biopsy bioinformatically inferred to harbor a given mutation in a particular patient; <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), with mutations defined as clonal being significantly more frequently detected than subclonal ones (p= 5.33e-21; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Additionally, the ctDNA fraction (the fraction of tumor-derived cfDNA) in metastatic cancer patients varied significantly according to tumor type (p=0.0046; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). To assess the association between disease burden and ctDNA fraction, volumetric assessment of the disease burden was performed (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We found a significant association between the estimated disease volume based on CT scans and the ctDNA fraction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>) in both MBC (n=34, p=1.03e-4) and NSCLC (n=29, p=0.042) patients.

                <p id="P19">Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that this cfDNA sequencing assay has a high sensitivity for detection of tumor-derived somatic mutations and identifies mutations subclonally present in tumor tissues. VUSo, on the other hand, which are detected in neither tumor biopsy nor WBC may derive from multiple origins but comprise a set of alterations from which a subset may reflect ongoing tumor evolution and heterogeneity not captured in a small and anatomically constrained biopsy.</p>

Analysis of TMB by MSK-IMPACT sequencing of tumor biopsies revealed six samples with a high TMB (based on the predefined &gt;13.8 mutations/Mb cut-off<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>), including two MBCs, three NSCLCs and one CRPC. Four of these cases were also classified as having high TMB by cfDNA (&gt;22.7 mutations/Mb; <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). The remaining two samples displayed relatively low ctDNA fractions (0.2 and 8.6%) and borderline cfDNA TMB (18.2 and 20.0 mutations/Mb, respectively). cfDNA analysis identified six additional cases with a high TMB not detected as hypermutators by MSK-IMPACT analysis of the tumor biopsy (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, a total of ten cases henceforth referred to as hypermutated).

The ten hypermutated cfDNA samples accounted for 75% of the cfDNA biopsy-subthreshold mutations and VUSo across the entire cohort (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) and displayed mutational signatures consistent with the modalities of genetic instability known to occur in MBCs, NSCLCs, and CRPC.

Consistent with the results of previous analysis of NSCLCs<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, the mutational signatures of the two hypermutated NSCLCs comprised the smoking-related signature and a combination of other signatures, including APOBEC, homologous recombination DNA repair-deficiency (HRD), and loss-of-function of mismatch repair (MMR; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P22">Despite the specificity of the assay for somatic mutation detection, tumor-matched alterations (biopsy-matched and biopsy-subthreshold) accounted for only 24.4% (739/2983 mutations) of all somatic mutations detected in the cfDNA of cancer patients (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Notably, a median of 7.27 (range 0.91–20.91) mutations per Mb were detected in the cfDNA samples of non-cancer controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Although previous studies have suggested that these alterations likely constitute technical artifacts of ultra-high-depth sequencing analysis<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, based on the specificity of our assay, we posited that these variants instead stemmed from somatic mosaicism, in particular CH, and tumor-derived events resulting from spatial genetic heterogeneity (as seen in the hypermutated cancer cases).</p>
                <p id="P23">We first investigated the presence of somatic mutations in the WBC sequencing results (WBC-matched mutations) for the mutations defined as somatic by cfDNA analysis but for which there was no evidence of the mutational event in the matched tumor biopsy. This analysis revealed that in non-cancer controls, the vast majority (81.6%, 297 of 364) of somatic mutations detected were also identified in WBCs, suggesting that these somatic genetic alterations were likely not technical artifacts but rather a result of CH (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Likewise, the majority (53.2%, 918/1727) of the mutations identified in cfDNA samples of non-hypermutated cancer patients were also WBC-matched (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, the number of WBC-matched cfDNA variants in cancer patients did not correlate with the number of tumor-matched mutations (biopsy-matched or biopsy-subthreshold), making them less likely to be of tumor origin (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). As CH is related to age<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, we examined the association of age with the number of somatic DNA variants in the cfDNA samples from individual participants. As expected, the number of WBC-matched variants, but not the number of the biopsy-matched or biopsy-subthreshold variants, significantly correlated with age (smoking-adjusted p=3.86e-27; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Based on this interpretation, the cfDNA and WBC sequencing analysis as performed here suggests that 89.5% of cancer patients and 83% of non-cancer controls have evidence of CH in their cfDNA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Consistent with recent observations in a non-cancer population<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and with the notion that these mutations constitute CH events, the vast majority of the WBC-matched somatic mutations detected in cfDNA of cancer patients and non-cancer controls involved canonical CH genes, such as <italic>DNMT3A, TET2, PPM1D</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, while some of these pathogenic alterations affected cancer genes other than the canonical CH genes (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Additionally, the VAFs of WBC-matched cfDNA variants were correlated with their VAFs in the WBCs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>–<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), making it unlikely that they resulted from systematic sequencing errors or background noise.</p>
                <p id="P24">Previous studies of hypermutated tumors have demonstrated significant spatial heterogeneity resulting in numerous subclonal mutations private to each tumor site<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Consistently, the overall proportion of tumor-matched mutations (biopsy-matched and biopsy-subthreshold) was significantly lower in the 10 hypermutated patients (17.2% [216/1210] non-WBC-matched mutations) than in the 114 non-hypermutated patients (30.3% [523/1727]; p=1.2e-16), whereas a higher proportion of tumor-derived variants were subclonal biopsy-subthreshold variants in hypermutated cases (41.2% [89/216] vs. 15.3% [80/523] respectively; p=1.7e-13). These findings support the notion that a single tumor biopsy may not always capture the full landscape of tumor mutational profile in patients whose tumors harbor a hypermutator phenotype.</p>
                <p id="P25">Given the correlation between sequencing depth and occurance of technical artifacts, we next investigated whether mutations detected in cfDNA at ultra-high sequencing depths could be attributed to residual sequencing noise. Of 215 mutations detected at a collapsed depth of &gt;10,000X, 121 (56.3%) and 20 (9.3%) mutations were identified in two known hypermutated patients (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). The variant level collapsed depth of somatic mutations was a function of the mean collapsed target coverage in cfDNA and the amount of input DNA (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>–<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Furthermore, there was no association between the VAF and the sequencing depth of variants irrespective of source of origin (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). These mutations were also highly replicable and could not be attributed to copy number gains or amplification of the corresponding loci (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>–<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that the mutations found at high sequencing depths were unlikely to constitute sequencing artifacts.</p>
                <p id="P26">We next sought to define the biological source of nonsynonymous VUSo in cfDNA (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). After removing variants with known source-of-origin (WBC-matched; biopsy-matched and biopsy-subthreshold in cancer patients), approximately 31.9% of non-cancer controls had no additional variants identified in cfDNA, with the remaining 68.1% harboring at least one VUSo (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P27">In cancer patients, 77.7% (994/1280) of the VUSo were detected in the 10 hypermutated cancer samples. In fact, VUSo accounted for 82.1% (994/1210) of the total non-WBC-matched somatic cfDNA mutations in hypermutated samples as compared with 35.4% (286/809) in non-hypermutated tumors (p=9.3e-103). Additionally, VUSo rarely constituted the mutation at the highest VAF in cancer patients (17.6%, 23.1% and 19.5% of MBCs, NSCLCs and CRPCs, respectively). These findings indicate that a large proportion of the VUSo likely originated from the tumor and may not have been detected in the biopsy sample taken, due to spatial tumor heterogeneity and sampling bias. To investigate the potential origins of the VUSo further, we evaluated the genes harboring variants classified as such in cancer patients (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). A subset of VUSo affected specific genes known to harbor somatic mutations occurring late in the evolution of the respective cancer type and commonly found altered at subclonal levels in metastatic cancers, including mutations in <italic>ESR1, RB1,</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> in MBC, the <italic>EGFR</italic> T790M mutation in NSCLC, and <italic>AR</italic> mutations in CRPC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Further, the VAF distribution for these mutations mostly mirrored that of biopsy-matched variants (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>–<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). In hypermutated cases, however, a significant correlation between the size of the sequenced coding region of a gene harboring VUSo and the number of VUSo affecting the given gene was observed (p=4.4e-16; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). To determine the accuracy of the cfDNA assay for detecting VUSo, we performed orthogonal validation of our results utilizing ddPCR assays targeting VUSo (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>) and found complete agreement between the two assays. Based on these results, we posit that these VUSo are for the most part tumor-derived and stem from increased mutational rates found in cancer cells from patients with tumors displaying a hypermutator phenotype. It should be noted that, in controls, the genes most frequently harboring VUSo also included canonical CH genes (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Consistent with the notion that at least a subset of VUSo arise from CH or other sources of somatic mosaicism not present in matched WBC samples, VUSo were weakly associated with age at sample collection (p=0.141; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), affected canonical CH genes in both cancer patients and controls (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>–<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), with some having similar allele frequencies as WBC-matched variants (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>–<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).</p>

              <p id="P32">Most clinical cfDNA assays in current use target a small panel of genes or hotspot mutations in key cancer genes, and do not incorporate matched WBC sequencing. Previous attempts at broadening the genomic area probed by cfDNA sequencing assays resulted in the identification of not only mutations known to be present in tumors but also a large number of variants absent in the respective tumor tissues and inferred to be somatic. Despite the use of multiple strategies to mitigate sequencing artifacts, it has been postulated that high-depth sequencing assays covering a large genomic region would inevitably result in the identification of a high number of false positive sequencing variants<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Here, we devised a high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay covering a large genomic region based on a joint analysis of cfDNA and WBC gDNA, utilizing UMIs to suppress technical assay errors and hierarchical Bayesian error correction models to mitigate mutation detection artifacts stemming from ultra-high sequencing depths. Our findings highlight the importance of having methods to mitigate sequencing errors coupled with matched WBC sequencing performed at similar depths to those employed for the cfDNA analysis. Without taking into account the results of WBC sequencing, cfDNA sequencing, as often currently performed in the clinical setting, might be misleading, given that some CH mutations affecting cancer genes may be interpreted as tumor-derived mutations (e.g. <italic>TP53</italic> mutations).</p>
              <p id="P33">The high-intensity cfDNA sequencing approach allowed for robust <italic>de novo</italic> detection of somatic mutations with a sensitivity similar to that of ddPCR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) and was comparable to previous high-depth targeted sequencing efforts<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, allowing for the detection in cfDNA of 77.4% of the repertoire of somatic mutations reported in the matched tumor biopsy samples from patients with advanced cancers. Given the large genomic footprint and the limited number of false positive variants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1d</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), this cfDNA assay also allowed for the <italic>de novo</italic> assessment of tumor mutational burden and mutational signatures, including MSI (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), in patients with advanced cancers.</p>
              <p id="P34">Our analyses revealed that the majority of non-tumor-matched nonsynonymous somatic mutations identified in cfDNA had supporting reads present in the respective WBC gDNA samples, which were present in the vast majority of non-cancer controls and cancer patients. These WBC-matched mutations preferentially affected genes previously implicated in CH<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and their presence was strongly associated with age at collection of the blood sample. The number of these probable CH variants per patient was on average higher than the number of tumor-matched variants in metastatic patients. The higher prevalence of CH found in WBCs in this study (93.6% of non-cancer controls and 99.1% of cancer patients) relative to that reported in prior studies<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> likely resulted from the high sensitivity of the assay employed to detect variants in the WBC samples<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and was consistent with the observation by Liu <italic>et al.</italic> in a non-cancer population<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In our study, however, both cfDNA and WBC samples were ultra-deep sequenced at comparable raw depths, allowing for the distinction between CH and tumor-derived mutations. Although the genes recurrently affected by these somatic genetic alterations were genes previously implicated in CH, the majority of the WBC-matched variants were private to individual patients, suggesting that accounting for them in cfDNA-based clinical assays requires the sequencing of cfDNA and matched WBC DNA in a patient-specific manner. Indeed, recent studies<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> have demonstrated in a limited number of patients that a large proportion of somatic variants in WBCs can also be identified in cfDNA, resulting in the detection of ‘false-positive’ tumor-derived mutations in cfDNA. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the inconsistent results between cfDNA and tumor tissue assays, which may be due to a subset of non-tumor origin (e.g. CH) cfDNA variants being interpreted as tumor-derived<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> and support the need for joint analysis of cfDNA and matched WBC, given that mutations related to CH may result in inaccurate tumor mutation burden and mutational signature quantification<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P35">We also demonstrated that VUSo could have multiple origins, including tumor heterogeneity, CH occurring at extremely low levels, other sources of somatic mosaicism, or a small amount of residual technical noise. The majority of the observed VUSo were found to be tumor-derived and arose from minor tumor subclones, and 77.7% of all VUSo in cancer patients were identified in 10 patients whose tumors harbored hypermutator mutational processes, such as APOBEC, known to amplify tumor heterogeneity and subclonal diversity. Hence, high-intensity cfDNA assays may offer a more comprehensive landscape of tumor mutational profile than tumor tissue sequencing alone.</p>
              <p id="P36">This study has several limitations. Colorectal carcinomas, another common form of cancer, were not included in this study; a recent study, however, has demonstrated the importance of cfDNA sequencing in defining the heterogeneity and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in advanced colorectal cancers<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The tumor assessment was limited to the analysis of a single tumor biopsy due to limitations in obtaining multiregional biopsies in the clinical setting. As such, the full scope of tumor heterogeneity may not have been entirely captured<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. This caveat, however, would remain regardless of the number of sites biopsied. Non-cancer controls were from a different source and were processed in different batches from the tumor samples, potentially affecting results. Given that the number of samples in each tumor subgroup was relatively small, the analysis performed here may not have captured the full clinical or genomic diversity of MBCs, NSCLCs, and CRPCs, and their respective subtypes. Additionally, &lt;50 baseline samples from healthy control were employed to train the hierarchical Bayesian model, which might be further improved through the analysis of additional samples from healthy donors followed longitudinally. Our findings also emphasize the importance of high-depth WBC sequencing, and even when this approach is employed, a subset of VUSo might still originate from CH not detected in the matched WBC sample, other sources of somatic mosaicism, benign neoplasms and/or other forms of occult cancers not detected in the extensive clinical work up performed on the patients included in this study. Finally, the cost of this high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay may preclude its broader adoption in the clinical context at present.</p>
              <p id="P37">Despite these limitations, the high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay described here represents an advancement in the development of approaches for <italic>de novo</italic> detection of the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations in cancer patients and provides further evidence that CH likely constitutes a biological phenomenon and a technical pitfall more prevalent than previously anticipated.</p>

                <p id="P64">The association of variant allele fractions between technical replicates was measured using the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> obtained from a linear regression. The difference in detection rate between the three cohorts was assessed using two-by-two Fisher’s exact tests, and the resulting p values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The association between the tumor mutation cancer cell fraction and the cfDNA detection rate (overall and stratified by cancer type) was assessed using a <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> trend test (Cochran-Armitage test for trend). Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the detection rate by cancer type. The difference in ctDNA fraction estimate between cancer types was assessed using a two-sided Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic>-test. The increase in ctDNA fraction estimate with increasing disease burden was assessed using a one-sided Jonckheere-Terpstra test and stratified by cancer type. We used zero-inflated Poisson regressions to assess the association between the number of cfDNA variants per subject from each biological source (i.e. biopsy-matched, biopsy-subthreshold, WBC-matched and VUSo) and age with cancer status and smoking history as covariates where appropriate. The corresponding p values were obtained using two-sided Wald tests on the coefficients of the count model. Similarly, the association between the number of CH-derived variants per subject through direct analysis of WBC and age was assessed using a zero-inflated Poisson regression with cancer status as covariate and the corresponding p value was obtained using a two-sided Wald test on the coefficient of the count model. The association of CH measured in WBC in each of the 15 canonical CH genes and cancer status and prior history of radio- or chemotherapy was assessed using a permutation-based likelihood ratio test from the coefficients of a logistic regression with age and smoking history as covariates where appropriate. Comparisons of the uncollapsed mean coverage between cfDNA and WBC were performed using two-sided paired Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests stratified by cohort. Pairwise comparisons of the collapsed mean coverage of cfDNA or WBC between the different cancer cohorts and non-cancer controls were performed using two-sided Mann-Whitney <italic>U-</italic>tests and adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. The association of input DNA for library preparation and mean collapsed coverage of cfDNA samples was assessed using the <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> obtained from a linear regression. The corresponding p value was obtained using a two-sided <italic>t-</italic>test. The pairwise differences of input DNA for library preparation between the different cancer cohorts and non-cancer controls were assessed using a two-sided Mann-Whitney <italic>U-</italic>tests and adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. Pairwise comparisons of the percentage of collapsed bases with SNVs or combined SNVs and indels of cfDNA or WBC between the different cancer cohorts and non-cancer controls were performed using two-sided Mann-Whitney <italic>U-</italic>tests and adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. The association of ctDNA fraction estimate or tumor purity and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient measuring the association in Log<sub>2</sub> ratio space between patient-matched cfDNA and tumor biopsy samples was assessed using one-sided Jonckheere-Terpstra tests for increasing ctDNA fraction or tumor purity with increasing Pearson’s correlation. Pairwise comparisons of AUCs for amplifications or homozygous deletions between the different cancer cohorts were carried out using two-sided DeLong tests. For each cfDNA variant category, a two-sided Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used to test whether the cancer cohort stratified by cancer type had a different mutation burden than the non-cancer controls. All statistical hypothesis tests were considered positive at α=0.05 and carried out in R/Bioconductor unless otherwise stated.</p>

                <p id="P79">(<bold>a</bold>) Tumor and cfDNA samples were collected from patients with metastatic breast (MBC), lung (NSCLC), and prostate (CRPC) cancers. Tumor and matched normal samples were sequenced using the MSK-IMPACT assay, while plasma and buffy coat samples from cancer patients and non-cancer controls from the San Diego Blood Bank underwent sequencing followed by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and mutation detection using the high-intensity targeted cfDNA assay by GRAIL, Inc (Menlo Park, CA) based on a bespoke joint-variant-calling pipeline. Tumor and cfDNA somatic variant detection results were unblinded for concordance analyses. (<bold>b</bold>) Analytical performance of the targeted DNA assay. The detection probability is shown as a function of increasing variant allele fraction in HD753 cell line DNA titrations. The curves correspond to the mean target coverage of 2,430X from 30 ng cell line DNA input and the mean target coverage of 4,577X obtained from simulated FASTQs. (<bold>c</bold>) Estimated variant calling specificity using non-cancer control samples and corresponding variant calling sensitivity using methods as described in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary methods</xref> (joint variant analysis using the machine learning error model). Non-cancer controls were not used to train the model here. (<bold>d</bold>) Comparison of allele fraction of variants detected using either of the two targeted DNA assay protocols in five patients. One MBC hypermutated patient, shown in (<bold>e</bold>), was excluded from this analysis to avoid biased regression. Concordant mutation detection between the two replicates (triangles indicate biopsy-matched, circles indicate biopsy-unmatched variants) is enriched in allele fraction above limit of detection. (<bold>f</bold>) Comparison of variant allele fraction (VAF) measured using the targeted DNA assay (y-axis) and ddPCR (x-axis). cfDNA extracted from five cancer patients with canonical hotspot mutations were subjected to ddPCR. An aliquot of the same cfDNA sample was employed for the targeted DNA assays using two versions of the protocol (V1 and V2). One sample lacking canonical hotspot mutation in the ddPCR measurements was excluded.</p>

(<bold>b</bold>) Frequency of genomic alterations by in cfDNA of the same patients with MBC, NSCLC, and CRPC. The genes were sorted by their frequency of alterations in the tumor tissue. (<bold>c</bold>) Plasma variant allele fractions (VAF) of somatic variants sorted by the maximum VAF in control individuals. (<bold>d</bold>) Upper panels depict plasma VAFs of somatic variants in MBC, NSCLC, and CRPC. The lower panels show the number of variants identified in each individual by MSK-IMPACT. Colors indicate whether alterations were biopsy-matched, biopsy-subthreshold, biopsy-only (detected in tumor only and not in cfDNA), or VUSo. (<bold>e</bold>) Increasing detection rate of tumor variants in cfDNA with clonality of mutations in the tumor biopsy. The midpoint of the interval plot shows the median proportion of tumor mutations from the MSK-IMPACT assay which were also detected in cfDNA of MBC, NSCLC, and CRPC patients, stratified by the cancer cell fraction (CCF) in the tumor, whilst the error bars indicate the 95% binomial confidence intervals. The CCF was strongly associated with detection rate in cfDNA (overall p= 5.33e-21). All p values are based on two-sided X<sup>2</sup> trend test. (<bold>f</bold>) Distribution of tumor derived cfDNA fraction estimates (i.e. ctDNA fraction) in MBC, NSCLC, and CRPC patients (n=105 patients with evaluable ctDNA fraction, two-sided Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic>-test p=0.0046). The midpoints indicate the median ctDNA fraction by cancer type and the violins extend to the full range of the data. (g) Distribution of ctDNA fraction estimates as a function of disease burden. In MBCs (n=34) and NSCLC (n=29), disease volume was obtained through volumetric measurements of pre-cfDNA collection CT scans. In CRPC (n=39), the automated bone scan index (aBSI) was used to estimate disease burden. The association between tertiles of disease burden for each cohort and the ctDNA fraction was estimated using a one-sided Jonckheere-Terpstra test for increasing ctDNA fraction. Triangles indicate patients from whom some distant metastases could not be measured and the estimates for these lesions were not included in the volumetric assessment. Note that as aBSI was employed for CRPC, not all sites of metastatic disease (e.g. visceral disease) were included in the disease burden in the CRPC patients. The horizontal bar indicates the median, while the boxes shows the interquartile range (IQR). The whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR on either side.</p>
