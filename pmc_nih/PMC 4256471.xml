                <p>A large fraction of human genes are regulated by genetic variation near the transcribed sequence (<italic>cis</italic>-eQTL, expression quantitative trait locus), and many <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs have implications for human disease. Less is known regarding the effects of genetic variation on expression of distant genes (<italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs) and their biological mechanisms. In this work, we use genome-wide data on SNPs and array-based expression measures from mononuclear cells obtained from a population-based cohort of 1,799 Bangladeshi individuals to characterize <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs and determine if observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations are mediated by expression of transcripts in <italic>cis</italic> with the SNPs showing <italic>trans</italic>-association, using Sobel tests of mediation. We observed 434 independent <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations at a false-discovery rate of 0.05, and 189 of these <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs were also <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs (enrichment P&lt;0.0001). Among these 189 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations, 39 were significantly attenuated after adjusting for a <italic>cis</italic>-mediator based on Sobel P&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>. We attempted to replicate 21 of these mediation signals in two European cohorts, and while only 7 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations were present in one or both cohorts, 6 showed evidence of cis-mediation. Analyses of simulated data show that complete mediation will be observed as partial mediation in the presence of mediator measurement error or imperfect LD between measured and causal variants. Our data demonstrates that <italic>trans</italic>-associations can become significantly stronger or switch directions after adjusting for a potential mediator. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is expected in the presence of strong <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> confounding and when the measured <italic>cis</italic>-transcript is correlated with the true (unmeasured) mediator. In conclusion, by applying mediation analysis to eQTL data, we show that a substantial fraction of observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations can be explained by <italic>cis</italic>-mediation. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying widespread <italic>cis</italic>-mediation and their relevance to disease biology, as well as using mediation analysis to improve eQTL discovery.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have demonstrated that human genes can be regulated by genetic variation residing close to the gene (<italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs) or in a distant region or on a different chromosome (<italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs). While <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL variants are likely to affect transcription factor binding or chromatin structure, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs is incomplete. We hypothesize that a substantial fraction of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs influence expression of distant genes through mediation by expression levels of a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript. In this paper, we use genome-wide SNPs and expression data for 1,799 South Asians to identify cis- and trans-eQTLs and to test our hypothesis using Sobel tests of mediation. Among 189 observed trans-eQTL associations, we provide evidence of <italic>cis</italic>-mediation for 39, 6 of which show mediation in an independent European cohort. We used simulated data to demonstrate that complete mediation will be observed as partial mediation in the presence of mediator measurement error or imperfect LD between measured and causal variants. We also demonstrate how unobserved confounding variables and incorrect mediator selection can bias mediation estimates. In conclusion, we have identified <italic>cis</italic>-mediators for many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs and described a mediation analysis approach that can be used to validate, characterize, and enhance discovery of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The development of technologies that enable high-throughput, genome-wide measurement of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mRNA transcripts have enabled researchers to comprehensively examine the effects of human genetic variation on gene expression. Genome-wide studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been conducted using a wide-array of RNA sources, including lymphoblastoid cells lines <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1004818-Veyrieras1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, whole blood <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, monocytes <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Zeller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fairfax1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, B-cells <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fairfax1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, liver cells <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Schadt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Innocenti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and breast cancer tumor cells <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These studies consistently demonstrate that a large fraction of human genes (perhaps all genes) are regulated by variants near the transcribed sequence, typically referred to as <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs (or <italic>cis</italic>-eSNPs).</p>
              <p>Less is known regarding the effects of genetic variation on expression of distant genes and genes residing on other chromosomes (i.e., <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs). Identifying <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs should provide insight into the mechanisms of gene regulation, including mechanisms relevant to disease-associated variants and human disease biology. <italic>Trans</italic>-eQTLs are more difficult to identify than <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs because <italic>trans</italic> effects are generally weaker than <italic>cis</italic> effects and because a huge number of tests must be conducted to comprehensively search the genome for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, resulting in the use of stringent significance thresholds. Thus, large studies are needed for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL identification. Several such studies (&gt;1,000 participants) have focused on identifying <italic>trans</italic>- eQTLs, and these have typically used white blood cells as an RNA source <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Zeller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Westra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In early <italic>trans-</italic>eQTL studies, the proportion of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs replicated across studies was quite low, much lower than <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Innocenti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but a recent study demonstrates that most <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs replicate when very large sample sizes are used. <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Westra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>
</p>
              <p>While the biological mechanisms underlying <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are largely unknown, it is likely that many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are also <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs, and it is the <italic>cis</italic>-transcript that affects the expression of a <italic>trans</italic>-gene; however, no prior <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL studies have systematically assessed evidence for <italic>cis</italic>-mediation among identified <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs. While replication in independent samples is the gold standard method for validating <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, we propose that documenting <italic>cis</italic>-mediation can provide additional evidence that an observed <italic>trans</italic>-association is a true <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL and a potential biological explanation/mechanism for the observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL.</p>
              <p>In this work, we describe <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations using data on genome-wide SNPs and genome-wide RNA transcripts (extracted from mononuclear cells) for 1,799 Bangladeshi adults. For SNPs observed to be <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, we use a mediation analysis approach to assess evidence that the observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations are mediated by measured transcripts that are in <italic>cis</italic> with the SNP showing a <italic>trans</italic>-association. We observe evidence of mediation for a substantial fraction of the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs observed in our data and replicate several of our mediation signals in an independent sample, suggesting that many observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are due to mediation by expression levels of <italic>cis</italic>-transcripts in the vicinity of the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL. These observations can be used to enhance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms and our ability to identify <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs.</p>

                <p>In the genome-wide <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL analysis using an FDR of 0.05 (P&lt;8.4×10<sup>−9</sup>), we observed 427 significant expression probes, corresponding to 414 unique genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004818-t001">Table 1</xref>). Among these probes, there were 434 unique eQTL associations (i.e., unique probe and unique <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL region), corresponding to 419 unique <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations at the gene-level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s012">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s001">Figure S1</xref>). There were 26 examples of a single variant (or variants in strong LD) showing association with multiple unique <italic>trans</italic> genes and 11 examples of a gene affect by multiple <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs located in different regions of the genome. We observe many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs reported in prior studies, including the monocyte-specific master regulator at the LYZ locus on chromosome 12 identified by Fairfax (rs10784774) <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fairfax1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the multiple <italic>trans</italic>-effects of variation type 1 diabetes region 12q13.2 described by Fehrmann and Fairfax <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fairfax1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and the lupus SNP rs7917014 (tagged by rs4917014 in our data) association with CLEC4C, CLEC10A, IFIT1, and other genes highlighted by Westra <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Westra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>

For these 189 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations we performed mediation analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>) and obtained Sobel P-values for mediation as well as an estimate of the proportion of the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL effect that is mediated by a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript (i.e., the proportion reduction in the magnitude of the beta coefficient after adjusting for the potential mediator: (β - β<sub>adj</sub>)/β). These are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, which shows an excess of “mediation proportion” estimates that are greater than zero. At a Sobel P threshold of 10<sup>−5</sup> (based on visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) 39 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations (21%) were significantly reduced in magnitude after adjusting for a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript, suggesting that the measured transcript is the primary mediator of the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s013">Table S2</xref>). Extending our analysis to the 592 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations that did not pass the FDR threshold, but had a P&lt;10<sup>−7</sup> and a potential <italic>cis</italic>-mediator, we observed evidence of mediation for seven additional <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs with Sobel P &lt;10<sup>−16</sup> and one <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL that changed direction after adjustment for the <italic>cis</italic>-transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s013">Table S2</xref>), suggesting that mediation analysis can be used to enhance <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL discovery.</p>

                <title>“Partial mediation” can be due to measurement error and low LD</title>
                <p>Evidence for mediation is often observed as “partial” mediation, as the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL association is not completely eliminated after adjustment for a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript. To aid our interpretation of partial mediation, we simulated <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL expression data based on real genotype data assuming complete mediation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Our simulations show that evidence for mediation (in terms of the “proportion mediated” and the Sobel P) decreases as LD between the causal variant and the measured variant decreases and as measurement error increases (measured as the correlation between the true mediator and our measurement of the mediator) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In other words, even when <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations are fully mediated by a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript, evidence for mediation will be detected as “partial mediation” when there is measurement error for the mediating probe and/or imperfect LD between the causal variant and the measured variant under analysis.</p>

                <p>In our mediation analysis, the estimate of the mediation proportion is less than zero, and occasionally greater than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), a somewhat counter-intuitive finding that suggests the presence of bias. One potential source of bias is “mediator-outcome” confounding <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Richiardi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which occurs when an unobserved variable (or set of variables) affects both the <italic>cis</italic>-mediator and the <italic>trans</italic>-transcript. In this scenario, the estimate of association between the SNP and the <italic>trans-</italic>gene when adjusting for the potential mediator (i.e., the “direct effect” of the SNP on the <italic>trans</italic>-gene, β<sub>adj</sub>) will be biased. When <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> confounding is absent, the direct effect under full mediation should be zero (β<sub>adj</sub> = 0; percent mediation  = 100%). Using simulated data, we demonstrate the effect of this bias on the estimate of proportion of the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL effect that is mediated (β - β<sub>adj</sub>)/β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This bias can go in either direction, depending on the directions of the effects of the confounder with the <italic>cis</italic>-mediator, the confounder on the <italic>trans</italic>-transcript, and the non-reference allele (in our case, the minor allele) on the <italic>cis</italic>-transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The magnitude of the bias depends on the strength of confounding and the effect of the <italic>cis</italic>-gene on the <italic>trans</italic>-gene. Thus, there is no expectation regarding the direction in which this bias should affect the estimate of β<sub>adj</sub>. Exceptionally strong bias has the potential to qualitatively change the results of mediation analysis, such large changes in the direction or substantial strengthening of a <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL association after adjustment for a potential <italic>cis</italic>-mediator, but we observe very few examples of these phenomena in our data (see below).</p>

When considering only <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs that lie &lt;30 kb from a TSS or TES, those that do not show mediation are more likely to lie near a gene for which we do not have expression data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s015">Table S4</xref>), suggesting that a substantial number of the true mediators for these <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are not represented by probes in our dataset. <italic>Trans</italic>-eSNPs showing no mediation were somewhat more likely to tag (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.7) non-synonymous SNPs than non-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs, indicating that coding changes may mediate the effects of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs for which we could not identify clear mediators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s015">Table S4</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this work, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-mediation underlying <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs using data from the first large genome-wide eQTL study of South Asian individuals. Approximately 44% of all <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs detected at an FDR of 0.05 also showed evidence of being a <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL, enabling analysis potential mediation by <italic>cis</italic>-transcripts. Among analyzed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, ∼21% showed strong evidence of mediation by a measured <italic>cis</italic>-transcript. Analysis of simulated data demonstrated that partial rather than complete mediation will be detected in the presence of (1) measurement error for mediating transcripts and (2) imperfect LD between measured SNPs and the causal variants. Simulations also demonstrate that <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> confounding can bias estimates obtained from mediation analysis, while correlations among neighboring <italic>cis</italic>-transcripts, can enable detection of mediation when the true mediator is unmeasured. Observing evidence of mediation was more likely for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs with smaller P-values and when the lead <italic>trans</italic>-eSNP was in strong LD with the lead <italic>cis</italic>-eSNP for the potentially-mediating transcript. Demonstration of <italic>cis</italic>-mediation for observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs provides a form of validation, a clear biological mechanism, and an approach for enhancing future <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL discovery.</p>
              <p>Among our 434 significant <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations, we lacked data on potential mediators for 245 <italic>trans</italic>-associations (i.e., the lead <italic>trans</italic>-eSNP was not identified as a <italic>cis</italic>-eSNP in genome-wide <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analyses). This lack of data on potential mediators could be due to several factors. First, many mediators may be unmeasured or excluded as a consequence of QC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s015">Table S4</xref>). Second, some <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL effects may not be mediated by expression of a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript. For example, a <italic>trans</italic> effect could be due to variation in the coding sequence of a regulatory factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s015">Table S4</xref>), physical inter-chromosomal interactions, non-coding RNA, or other mechanisms that do not entail mediation by <italic>cis</italic>-expression of a protein-coding gene. Third, some <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs may be false positives. This is likely the case for many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs of marginal significance (5×10<sup>−9</sup>&lt;P&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>), which are less likely to be <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs than FDR-significant <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs. However, even for highly-significant <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs (P&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>), ∼38% lack data on a potential <italic>cis</italic>-mediator (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004818-t002">Table 2</xref>). Fourth, it is possible that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs may be due to <italic>cis</italic> effects that are detectable as very weak associations in our dataset; however, our mediation analysis for <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs that were not identified as <italic>cis</italic>-eSNPs did not provide strong evidence for this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s006">Figure S6</xref>). All of these phenomena are possible explanations for the substantial number of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs for which we lack data on a potential cis-mediator.</p>
              <p>Our working hypothesis is that a substantial fraction of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are fully-mediated by a transcript that is regulated in <italic>cis</italic> by the causal <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). While we did not observe complete mediation for most observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, we demonstrate that full mediation will be observed as partial mediation in the presence of mediator measurement error and/or imperfect LD between the causal variant and the variant used for analysis. Measurement error and imperfect LD are typically present in eQTL studies; thus, full mediation will frequently be observed as partial mediation. Factors that contribute to measurement error include: experimental error, cell type-specific eQTLs in the presence of cell mixtures, stochastic or temporal variability in expression, and non-specific measurement of the mediating transcript(s) (i.e., some probes bind multiple isoforms). Observing partial mediation may also be due, in part, to the Winner's curse, as <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations that are overestimated may not be fully explainable by a <italic>cis</italic>-mediator. For the <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL that lacked clear evidence of mediation, potential explanations include: analyzing a <italic>cis</italic>-transcript that is not the true mediator (perhaps due to missing data), low power due to measurement error, or a false positive <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL.</p>
              <p>In this work, we observe a subset of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs that are clearly attenuated after adjustment for a <italic>cis</italic>-mediator (i.e., mediation proportion&gt;0 and Sobel P&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>), as expected based on the mediation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004818-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, for the remaining <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, the mediation proportion estimates are scattered around zero (i.e., the <italic>trans</italic> association often gets somewhat stronger after adjustment) and the Sobel P distribution is non-uniform. We hypothesize that many of these “significant” estimates are due to a mixture of true mediation and the various sources of potential bias we describe in this work, including <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> confounding and correlation between the true (unmeasured) mediator and the transcript selected for mediation analysis. These types of bias have no expectation regarding directionality, so a distribution of mediation proportions that includes zero is expected.</p>
              <p>Potential confounders of the <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> association include demographic and environmental factors, as well as a wide-array of biological phenomenon, some of which may be captured by measured expression features. Omitting such variables from the regression model can bias the estimates of the “direct effect” of the SNP on the <italic>trans</italic>-gene and the “mediation proportion”. The direction of this bias will depend on the direction of the effects for the omitted confounder(s). We attempted to control for potential confounding factors in this work using only principle components adjustment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>), but this limitation did not prevent us from detecting many examples of <italic>cis</italic>-mediation. However, confounding bias is likely to prevent detection of weaker mediation signals. Because genome-wide expression data contains very large numbers of correlated genes (too many to adjust for individually), additional research is needed to develop methods for comprehensive adjustment for <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> confounding in analyses of mediation in the genome-wide setting.</p>
              <p>Few prior studies have assessed <italic>cis</italic>-mediation for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations at the genome-wide level. Jian et al. described the use of mediation analysis in order to identify eQTLs for CYP2D6 activity <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Battle, et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Battle1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> used RNA sequencing data from whole blood on 922 genotyped individuals to characterize the effects of regulatory variation on transcriptome diversity. They observed 138 genes regulated by <italic>trans</italic>-variants and 76 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL SNPs that were associated with expression of a proximal gene. Using a likelihood-based approach <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Millstein1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Schadt2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, Battle et al. reported that 85% of identified <italic>trans</italic> effects were mediated by <italic>cis</italic> transcripts, but with only 4% showing evidence of “full mediation” and the remaining 81% showing evidence of partial mediation. However, the likelihood-based test for partial mediation used by Battle, et al. is also based on a regression the <italic>trans</italic>-gene on the SNP and the <italic>cis</italic>-mediator, and is therefore also prone to confounding biases caused by unobserved variables.</p>
              <p>The number of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs observed in this South Asian population is somewhat larger than prior studies of similar sample size <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Zeller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Westra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Prior studies have also noted low rates of replication for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs across studies, even for studies of similar ancestry <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Innocenti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For example, 46 of the 130 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs observed by Fehrmann et al. (in whole blood among 1,469 samples) could be replicated in an eQTL study of monocyte RNA at P&lt;10<sup>−5</sup> among 1,490 samples <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Zeller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Difficulties in replication have also been observed in <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL studies of mice <xref rid="pgen.1004818-vanNas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Replication was markedly better in a recent <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL meta-analysis, presumably due in part to large sample size (n&gt;5,000) and a focus on trait-associated SNPs <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Westra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Several factors may contribute to the low rates of replication of our observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs in prior studies. First, differences between population, both genetic and environmental may impact trans-eQTL patterns. Second, there are differences in RNA source, as prior <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL studies used whole blood or monocytes, while our source is PBMCs, consisting of monocytes (∼15%), T lymphocytes (∼65%), and B lymphocytes (∼20%), representing ∼35% of peripheral white blood cells. Third, we lack complete lists of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL for replications purposes, as we are limited to examining lists of only the strongest <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations provided by the authors of prior papers.</p>
              <p>Mediation analysis is an attractive method for characterizing observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations for several reasons. First, it provides putative regulatory mechanisms for observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, potentially enhancing our understanding of disease-associated variants and human disease biology. Second, evidence of mediation provides a form of validation for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs. Independent replication (using the same cell type and population) is the ideal form of validation, but such data sources are not always available. Third, detecting mediation is methodologically straightforward, requiring only conditional linear regression techniques and simple equations for estimating effects and significance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Baron1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Fourth, evidence of mediation could potentially be used as weights in integrative analyses or as priors in Bayesian analyses to enhance discovery of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs that have measured mediators. Mendelian randomization (i.e., instrumental variable (IV)) approaches could also be considered as a complimentary approach, in which <italic>cis</italic>-eSNPs are used as IVs for <italic>cis</italic>-transcripts and which are then screened, genome-wide, for effects on expression of <italic>trans</italic>-genes.</p>
              <p>Our ability to detect <italic>cis</italic>-mediation will be enhanced by using whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing data, which capture the vast majority of transcribed sequences, better reflecting the full complexity of the transcriptome. Array-based platforms capture only a fraction of transcribed sequences and probe-based measures often reflect multiple isoforms of a gene. RNA-sequencing can also provide enhance measurement precision for mediating transcripts, as would cell-type specific RNA sources. Very high-density genotype data will also enhance mediation analysis, as statistical evidence of mediation will be stronger when causal variants or strong tagging variant are directly measured.</p>
              <p>In terms of sample size, this is the largest <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL study of humans to date that analyzes genome-wide variants in an agnostic fashion. An additional strength of this study is the rapid time between the blood draw and the extraction and processing of RNA. While this is often not reported in eQTLs studies conducted in the epidemiological setting, our processing protocol is excellent for studies of this size, especially for a low-resource setting such as Bangladesh. In addition, this is the first eQTL study conducted in a South Asian population. A recent multi-population eQTL study included U.S. residents of Indian ancestry <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Stranger2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; however, the sample was relatively small, and RNA was obtained from lymphoblastoid cells lines and was thus prone to the effects of transformation with Epstein-Barr virus.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have described <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs in a large sample of South Asians and used mediation analysis to provide evidence that <italic>cis</italic>-mediation is often observed for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs in humans. In addition, using simulated data, we demonstrate how unobserved confounding variables and incorrect mediator selection can bias mediation estimates. Mediation analysis will be useful for validation and discovery of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs (especially when appropriate data for replication is not available) and is a valuable tool for enhancing our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanism underlying <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs.</p>

Genome-wide <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL analyses showed little evidence of inflation due to population structure of genotyping artifacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004818.s011">Figure S11</xref>), consistent with our prior work demonstrating little evidence of population structure among our study participants. Lead SNPs fear each eQTL were defined as the SNP with the smallest P-value for an expression trait, with <italic>trans</italic>-associations&gt;5Mb apart considered independent <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations.</p>

                <p>Among our observed <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations with P&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>, we sought to eliminate false positives due to loose, off-target binding of the expression probe near the correlated SNP. A localized high-sensitivity BLAST was performed (blastn -dust no -evalue 1000). For each instance of BLAST, the query was the sequence of the expression probe from our list of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, and the target was the genome sequence from a 4Mb window centered on the corresponding SNP (hg19, retrieved from UCSC). Note that our initial probe QC used a lower-sensitivity BLAST with a much larger query and target sets (i.e.: all HT-12 probes and all sequences UCSC's knownGeneMrna, knownGeneTxMrna). After identifying putative <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL associations, smaller query and target sets could be selected for a higher-sensitivity BLAST. This two-stage approach was also used by Fehrmann et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Fehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. From the BLAST results, we accepted alignments with: alignment length&gt; = 15bp; or alignment length&gt; = 20 and number of mismatches &lt; = 1; or alignment length&gt; = 30 and number of mismatches &lt; = 2; or alignment length&gt; = 50 and number of mismatches &lt; = 15.</p>

                <p>To identify <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs showing evidence of mediation, we restricted to those lead <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs (P&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>) which has at least one associated nearby (&lt;1 Mb) probe (<italic>cis</italic>-probe) with association (P&lt;2.2×10<sup>−3</sup>, the P threshold used for the <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analysis). For <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs associated with multiple <italic>cis</italic>-probes, we selected the associated <italic>cis</italic>-probe whose lead <italic>cis</italic>-eSNP was in strongest LD with the lead <italic>trans</italic>-SNP. Mediation analysis was conducted as follows: For lead <italic>trans</italic>-eSNPs that were associated with a <italic>cis</italic> probe, the <italic>trans</italic>-association was re-estimated, adjusting for expression of the local transcript measured by the probe. The difference between the beta coefficients for the <italic>trans</italic>-association before and after adjustment for the <italic>cis</italic> probe was expressed as the “proportion of the total effect that is mediated” (i.e., % mediation), calculated as (β<sub>unadj</sub> – β<sub>adj</sub>)/β<sub>unadj</sub>
<xref rid="pgen.1004818-Baron1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, with β<sub>unadj</sub> and β<sub>adj</sub> known as the <italic>total effect</italic> the <italic>direct effect</italic>, respectively. The Sobel P-value for mediation <xref rid="pgen.1004818-Sobel1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> was calculated by first estimating the <italic>cis</italic>-adjusted <italic>trans</italic>-association for the lead <italic>trans</italic>-eSNP:<disp-formula id="pgen.1004818.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004818.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

We first selected several SNPs near the selected causal variant for the primary <italic>cis</italic>-/<italic>trans</italic>-eQTL with a wide range of LD r<sup>2</sup> values, and we then treated these variants as causal variants for a second eQTL association for a different transcript that does not affect the <italic>trans</italic>-transcript.

We also introduced “negative confounding”, in which the effect of the unmeasured confounder was positive for one <italic>cis</italic>-transcript and negative for the other. Second, we introduced an effect of the true cis-mediator on the selected transcript, exploring both positive and negative effect (beta  = 0.25 and −0.25), as well as the reverse causal relationship where the selected transcript affects the true cis-mediator (beta  = 0.25 and −0.25).
