              <abstract>
                <p>We have previously reported that <italic>in vitro</italic> HCV infection of cells of hepatocyte origin attenuates complement system at multiple steps, and attenuation also occurs in chronically HCV infected liver, irrespective of the disease stage. However, none of these regulations alone completely impaired complement pathways. Modulation of the upstream proteins involved in proteolytic processing of the complement cascade prior to convertase formation is critical in promoting the function of the complement system in response to infection. Here, we examined the regulation of C2 complement expression in hepatoma cells infected <italic>in vitro</italic> with cell culture grown virus, and validated our observations using randomly selected chronically HCV infected patient liver biopsy specimens. C2 mRNA expression was significantly inhibited, and classical C3 convertase (C4b2a) decreased. In separate experiments for C3 convertase function, C3b deposition onto bacterial membrane was reduced using HCV infected patient sera as compared to uninfected control, suggesting impaired C3 convertase. Further, iC3b level, a proteolytically inactive form of C3b, was lower in HCV infected patient sera, reflecting impairment of both C3 convertase and Factor I activity. The expression level of Factor I was significantly reduced in HCV infected liver biopsy specimens, while Factor H level remained unchanged or enhanced. Together, these results suggested that inhibition of C3 convertase activity is an additional cumulative effect for attenuation of complement system adopted by HCV for weakening innate immune response.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>A significant number of people infected with HCV develop chronic infection <xref rid="pone.0101422-Klenerman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101422-Petrovic1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Hepatocytes are the primary host for HCV replication and serve as a main source for complement synthesis. We previously examined the relationship between HCV infection and complement regulation, and have shown that HCV infection attenuates complement system by modulating multiple components, such as C3, C4, and C9 <xref rid="pone.0101422-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0101422-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The complement system plays a central role in the innate immune system, as a first line of defense against pathogen infection. The complement system quickly detects antibody bound microbes for elimination. All three complement activation pathways (classical, lectin, and alternative), merge for the cleavage of C3 in to C3a and C3b by C3 convertase. Cleavage of C3 by C3 convertases results in the formation of C3b and the anaphylatoxin C3a. Further processing of C3b results in the formation of iC3b and C3f, and finally C3c and C3dg <xref rid="pone.0101422-Gros1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In this process, Factor I is a key serine protease that inactivates all complement pathways by degrading activated complement factors C4b and C3b. Factor I degrades C4b and C3b only in the presence of specific cofactors, such as Factor H, C4b binding protein (C4BP), membrane-cofactor protein (MCP), and complement receptor 1 (CR1) <xref rid="pone.0101422-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Deficiencies in complement predispose patients to infection via ineffective opsonization, and defects in membrane attack complex (MAC) mediated lysis activity <xref rid="pone.0101422-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101422-Zipfel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, insights into the mechanisms of complement regulation are crucial for understanding disease pathology and therapies.</p>
              <p>Complement component 2 (C2) is a 110 kDa serum glycoprotein that functions as part of the classical pathway of the complement system. The key function of C2 is the formation of the classical C3 convertase (C4b2a) together with C4b <xref rid="pone.0101422-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. C2 deficiency (C2D) is the most common of the complement component deficiency. Hereditary C2D is an important susceptibility factor for invasive infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, such as pneumococci and haemophilus influenza type b <xref rid="pone.0101422-Ricklin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0101422-Skattum1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. C2D may also be a risk factor for development of atherosclerosis. However, many persons with C2D are apparently healthy. Complement component 3 (C3) plays an essential role in the complement pathways, including mediating convertase activity, opsonization, anaphylotoxin production, B cell activation, immunoglobulin production, immune-complex clearance. C2 is one of the C3 convertase components. C3 deficiency, either genetically determined or caused by deficiencies in the regulatory proteins factor H or factor I, include increased susceptibility to infection and rheumatic disorders <xref rid="pone.0101422-Skattum1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101422-Mayilyan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In this study, we examined the effect of HCV upon C2 at the transcriptional level in HCV infected patient liver biopsies and in infected patient sera on the formation and activation of C3 convertase.</p>

                <p>Paired serum samples and liver biopsy specimens from 12 chronically HCV infected patients <xref rid="pone.0101422-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101422-Mazumdar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and 12 non-HCV liver disease patients were randomly selected for use in this study. Sera and liver samples were collected from subjects with their written consent, and the protocol was approved by the Saint Louis University Internal Review Board. The liver biopsy specimens were read by an experienced pathologist, and the severity of hepatitis was graded and staged according to a system described by Scheuer <xref rid="pone.0101422-Scheuer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Liver biopsy tissue specimens were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) formulation and preserved at â70Â°C. Sera were prepared after storing on ice within a short time (2â3 h) to retain complement activity, aliquoted, and stored at â70Â°C. Each aliquot was thawed and tested once for complement related activity. Commercially available control liver RNAs were procured (Clonetics, CA; Clonetech, CA; and Lonza, NJ).</p>

Cell culture grown HCV released in culture supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 Âµm cellulose acetate membrane (Nalgene, NY), aliquoted, and stored at â70Â°C for single use. RNA (IU/ml) was quantified by real-time PCR (Prism7500 real-time thermocycler; ABI) with the use of HCV analyte-specific reagents (ASR, Abbott) in the Pathology Clinical Laboratory at Saint Louis University. Infectious virus titer from cell culture supernatant was also measured by fluorescence-focus forming unit (FFU) using a NS5A specific monoclonal antibody. For virus infection, hepatocytes were incubated with 0.5 moi of cell culture grown HCV. After virus adsorption for â¼8 h, cells were washed, incubated with fresh medium for 4 days, and used in subsequent experiment.</p>

                <p>We examined the C3 convertase assembly of alternative pathway by analyzing C3b deposition on bacterial surface. After cleavage of C3, C3b is deposited on pathogen surface as an initial step in the formation of C3 convertase of alternative pathway or as part of the subsequent C5 convertase <xref rid="pone.0101422-Lambris1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0101422-RodrguezdeCrdoba1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We performed a C3b deposition assay using <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5Î±. The level of C3b deposition on bacteria membrane was higher in NHS as compared to HCV infected patient sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101422-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel B), indicating a low level of C3 convertase function in HCV infected patients. The limited C3 convertase formation from both pathways and impairment of C3b generation may additionally affect C5 convertase formation in HCV infected patients. When purified C3 protein was added to the reaction, NHS had a significantly increased C3b deposition, indicating the further potential for convertase activity. However, an increase in C3b deposition was not observed in the reaction using HCV infected patient sera with the addition of purified C3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101422-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel B). This result suggests that HCV infected patient sera has limited factors related to C3 processing, and convertase function is limited due to the cumulative reduction of complement components at the initial stage of convertase formation, limiting downstream protease function. C3b deposition is a critical step for the complement cascade, especially in the formation of C5 convertase, which leads to membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Thus, impairment of C3b deposition in HCV infected patient sera can affect MAC formation and pathogen killing activity.</p>
                <p>Further examination revealed that a panel of chronically HCV infected patient sera display significantly reduced ability to lyse antibody sensitized sheep RBC as compared to NHS as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101422-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel C). Initial convertase formation occurred using patient and control sera, with cell lysis from added guineapig complement treated with EDTA. This protocol allows for the analysis of upstream complement dysfunction, removing the effect prior noted with the modulation of complement C9 expression <xref rid="pone.0101422-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Lysis of amboreceptor sensitized sheep erythrocytes was significantly reduced when HCV patient sera were used to form initial convertase function. A neutralizing antibody to Factor B was utilized to inhibit RBC lysis derived from activity of the alternate pathway (2% serum concentration), and revealed that the majority of complement activity in these antibody sensitized erythrocytes occurred through the classical (antibody mediated) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101422-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel D) in NHS. A similar reduction of alternate pathway mediated lysis was also apparent in HCV infected patient sera with the use of Factor B antibody. In the final analysis, the data indicate that the classical pathway mediated lysis analyzed in this system was compromised by a nearly 10 fold reduction in activity of HCV patient sera as compared to NHS. These results indicate that the expression and proteolytic processing of the early components of the complement convertase are significantly inhibited in HCV infected patients, with the potential to impair normal immune functions.</p>

              <p>The complement system plays a central role in the innate and adaptive immune response. The production of anaphylotoxins during complement convertase function results in complement induced T cell activation, with APC activation driving T cell differentiation, expansion and survival <xref rid="pone.0101422-Kwan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the current study, we have shown impairment of C3 convertase in HCV infected patient sera. The effect of lower C3 convertase in the complement system leads to the impairment of downstream events including C5 convertase formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101422-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Previously, we have shown that HCV genotype 1a infected patients had a low level of C5b-9 in their sera, which resulted in impairment of MAC formation and bactericidal/virocidal activity <xref rid="pone.0101422-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Limited C3 convertase activity in HCV infected patients may affect C5 convertase generation and C5 cleavage. In the current study, we have shown C3b level was lower in HCV infected patient sera, suggesting that the formation of C5 convertase in classical pathway (C4b2a3b) is impaired. In addition, HCV inhibits C5 mRNA synthesis in hepatoma cells. These observations reinforce our previous results suggesting HCV impairs at multiple steps of the complement system to escape from complement mediated virocidal activity.</p>

              <p>Factor I is a key serine protease that inactivates all complement pathways by degrading activated complement factors C4b and C3b. Factor I does not cleave intact C4 or C3, and degrades C4b and C3b only in the presence of specific cofactors, such as Factor H, C4b binding protein (C4BP), membrane-cofactor protein (MCP), and complement receptor 1 (CR1) <xref rid="pone.0101422-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, C4 has been shown to a cellular substrate of HCV NS3/4A protease and may also contribute to HCV persistence <xref rid="pone.0101422-Mawatari1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> The physiological importance of Factor I is shown by the fact that patients lacking Factor I have increased susceptibility to recurrent infection with encapsulated microorganisms, glomerulonephritis, and rheumatologic diseases <xref rid="pone.0101422-Amadei1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101422-Nilsson2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In the absence of regulation by Factor I, the alternative pathway of complement leads to continuous generation of fluid-phase and cell-surface-deposited C3b by a self-amplification loop. Thus, lower level of iC3b from the current study suggests: (i) C3 cleavage occurs less in HCV infected patients because of limited C3 convertase activity, and (ii) increased iC3b level in NHS indicates the presence of activated factor I, while HCV infected patient sera has limited Factor I. Therefore, further knowledge on the mechanism of inhibition of Factor I expression by HCV may provide important information in understanding deregulation of complement activation. Factor H is a bifunctional and essential molecule for control of the alternative pathway of complement. Normal recognition of cell surface is required for effective protection. On the other hand, mutations and polymorphisms in Factor H gene may result in inadequate protection and disease. Abnormal recognition of host cell surfaces by Factor H has been associated with complement-mediated tissue damage and disease. In addition, unwanted recognition of pathogens and cancer cells by Factor H can be used as an immune evasion strategy <xref rid="pone.0101422-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. At least 50% of HCV infected patients showed abnormal increase of Factor H and this suggest that HCV may use factor H to help escape immune surveillance, but more detailed studies are required.</p>
              <p>Our current study suggests that HCV infection affects C3 convertase formation by modulating specific complement components and their activity. This results in an impairment of C3 processing and activation of complement dependent functions. In this manner, the effect HCV has on the innate immune system may carry over into further modulating host adaptive immune responses.</p>
