                <p>Initial studies of 88 transmission pairs in the Zambia Emory HIV Research Project cohort demonstrated that the number of transmitted HLA-B associated polymorphisms in Gag, but not Nef, was negatively correlated to set point viral load (VL) in the newly infected partners. These results suggested that accumulation of CTL escape mutations in Gag might attenuate viral replication and provide a clinical benefit during early stages of infection. Using a novel approach, we have cloned <italic>gag</italic> sequences isolated from the earliest seroconversion plasma sample from the acutely infected recipient of 149 epidemiologically linked Zambian transmission pairs into a primary isolate, subtype C proviral vector, MJ4. We determined the replicative capacity (RC) of these Gag-MJ4 chimeras by infecting the GXR25 cell line and quantifying virion production in supernatants via a radiolabeled reverse transcriptase assay. We observed a statistically significant positive correlation between RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence and set point VL in newly infected individuals (pâ=â0.02). Furthermore, the RC of Gag-MJ4 chimeras also correlated with the VL of chronically infected donors near the estimated date of infection (pâ=â0.01), demonstrating that virus replication contributes to VL in both acute and chronic infection. These studies also allowed for the elucidation of novel sites in Gag associated with changes in RC, where rare mutations had the greatest effect on fitness. Although we observed both advantageous and deleterious rare mutations, the latter could point to vulnerable targets in the HIV-1 genome. Importantly, RC correlated significantly (pâ=â0.029) with the rate of CD4+ T cell decline over the first 3 years of infection in a manner that is partially independent of VL, suggesting that the replication capacity of HIV-1 during the earliest stages of infection is a determinant of pathogenesis beyond what might be expected based on set point VL alone.</p>

                <p>In the majority of HIV-1 cases, a single virus establishes infection. However, mutations in the viral genome accumulate over time in order to avoid recognition by the host immune response. Certain mutations in the main structural protein, Gag, driven by cytotoxic T lymphocytes are detrimental to viral replication, and we showed previously that, upon transmission, viruses with higher numbers of escape mutations in Gag were associated with lower early set point viral loads. We hypothesized that this could be attributed to attenuation of the transmitted virus. Here, we have cloned the <italic>gag</italic> gene from 149 newly infected individuals from linked transmission pairs into a clade C proviral vector and determined the replicative capacity <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that the replicative capacity conferred by the transmitted Gag correlated with set point viral loads in newly infected individuals, as well as with the viral load of the transmitting partner, and we identified previously unrecognized residues associated with increasing and decreasing replicative capacity. Importantly, we demonstrate that transmitted viruses with high replicative capacity cause more rapid CD4+ decline over the first three years, independent of viral load. This suggests that the trajectory of pathogenesis may be affected very early in infection, before adaptive immunity can respond.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite a diverse HIV-1 quasispecies within chronically infected individuals, a single variant establishes infection in the majority of heterosexual transmission cases, resulting in a severe genetic bottleneck <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Keele1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Derdeyn1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A more profound understanding of the interaction between host and viral characteristics and how they shape early pathogenesis and disease progression will be integral for understanding the trajectory and impact of early events after heterosexual transmission. While it is well established that host factors such as HLA-class I alleles can play a major role in determining clinical progression in those individuals recently infected with HIV-1 <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Fellay1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Tang3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> the role of transmitted viral characteristics has been understudied due to the lack of suitable cohorts in which virus from both the donor and linked recipient are available. Accordingly, studies using epidemiologically linked heterosexual transmission pairs are essential for understanding how viral evolution, adaptation, and the characteristics of the transmitted variant influence HIV-1 pathogenesis.</p>
              <p>Previous studies in both heterosexual and homosexual transmission pairs have demonstrated that viral loads (VL) in the newly infected partners are correlated with VL in the transmitting partner <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Tang4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Hecht1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This finding is intriguing as the majority of the linked couples have disparate HLA-I alleles, and would therefore have varying immune responses to the incoming virus. Thus, the characteristics of the virus in the donor quasispecies that impact replication can similarly impact the replication of the newly infecting virus even in the context of what is frequently a distinct immunogenetic environment. Indeed, when host factors known to modulate VL such as the presence of protective or unfavorable HLA-I alleles, gender, age, and HLA-B sharing are taken into account in a multivariable analysis utilizing a general linearized model, the correlation between donor and recipient VL becomes highly significant (Yue <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in submission).</p>
              <p>It is clear that both humoral <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Rong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and cellular immune responses can drive virus evolution over the course of infection. In the case of the latter, escape mutations arise that abrogate the ability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to kill virus-infected cells <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Borrow1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Kawashima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. While the selection of CTL escape mutations provides an <italic>in vivo</italic> advantage for the virus, if a mutation occurs within a functionally constrained region of the genome such as Gag, it could reduce <italic>in vitro</italic> replicative fitness <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Leslie1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Dahirel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This phenomenon has been demonstrated for several CTL escape mutations associated with protective alleles such as HLA-B*57, B*5801, B*27, and B*81 <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Boutwell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The ability of protective alleles to target conserved regions of the genome that escape with difficulty, due to the fitness costs incurred by mutations at these epitopes, may partially explain the mechanism of enhanced protection from disease progression in individuals with these alleles <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Mothe1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Peyerl1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. While evasion from the CTL response may result in such deleterious mutations, the <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness benefit outweighs that of the replication cost <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crawford2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, and the ongoing selection of additional mutations may allow the virus to compensate for these defects <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Leslie1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Schneidewind1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Schneidewind2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Schneidewind3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The functional consequence of escape and compensatory mutations upon transmission to an HLA-mismatched individual has not been fully explored.</p>
              <p>Initial studies in the ZEHRP cohort of 88 transmission pairs demonstrated that the number of transmitted HLA-B associated polymorphisms in Gag, but not Nef, was negatively correlated to set point VL in the newly infected partners, suggesting that an accumulation of escape mutations might attenuate viral replication and provide a clinical benefit during early stages of infection <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Goepfert1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In addition, in a smaller study of nine newly infected individuals infected by viruses with fitness reducing HLA-B*5703 associated epitope-escape mutations in p24, a lower set point VL was observed <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Chopera1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Previous studies have also shown that elite controllers can harbor viruses with <italic>gag-pro</italic> sequences that confer reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> replicative capacities (RC) <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Miura3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In a series of studies, Brockman and colleagues have shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> RC conferred by <italic>gag-pro</italic> variants isolated from both subtype B and C chronically infected individuals correlates to VL, demonstrating the role of intrinsic viral characteristics in defining this marker of pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. However, in these studies the recombination of population-based PCR amplified sequences into the lab adapted NL4.3 provirus required the outgrowth of virus in a CEM-CCR5 based cell line, potentially skewing the nature of the virus recovered. In contrast, studies of HIV-1 fitness in acute infection did not yield a statistically significant correlation between RC and VL, potentially due to small sample sizes and the limitations of the methodologies used.</p>
              <p>The identification of 149 heterosexual epidemiologically linked transmission pairs from a discordant couple cohort in Lusaka, Zambia, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the role that HLA-mediated adaptation of Gag within a chronically infected individual plays in modulating the RC of the transmitted variant. We hypothesize that HLA-mediated adaptation of HIV-1 resulting in Gag variants conferring varying levels of RCs will be a major viral characteristic linking donor and recipient VLs, and that the <italic>in vitro</italic> RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence defines early clinical parameters of HIV-1 pathogenesis.</p>
              <p>To test this hypothesis and using a novel approach, we cloned <italic>gag</italic> sequences from the earliest seroconversion plasma sample from 149 newly infected recipients of epidemiologically linked Zambian transmission pairs into the MJ4 proviral backbone <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Ndungu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. The RC of each Gag-MJ4 chimera was then determined and used to investigate how the RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence defines clinical parameters, such as early set point VL and CD4+ T cell decline in the newly infected individuals. These studies allowed us to identify novel residues in Gag that influence RC, and demonstrate a strong correlation between RC and early set point VL, as well as between RC and CD4 decline during the first three years of infection, which was also found to be independent of VL. Thus, the RC of the transmitted virus as defined by its <italic>gag</italic> gene influences critical aspects of HIV-1 pathogenesis.</p>

                <p>All participants in the Zambia Emory HIV Research Project (ZEHRP) discordant couples cohort in Lusaka, Zambia were enrolled in human subjects protocols approved by both the University of Zambia Research Ethics Committee and the Emory University Institutional Review Board. Prior to enrollment, individuals received counseling and signed a written informed consent form agreeing to participate. The subjects selected from the cohort were initially HIV-1 serodiscordant partners in cohabiting heterosexual couples with subsequent intracouple (epidemiologically linked) HIV-1 transmission <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-McKenna1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Epidemiological linkage was defined by phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 <italic>gp41</italic> sequences from both partners <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Trask1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Viral isolates from each partner in the transmission pair were closely related, with median and maximum nucleotide substitution rates of 1.5 and 4.0%, respectively. In contrast, median nucleotide substitution rate for unlinked HIV-1 C viruses from the Zambian cohort and elsewhere was 8.8% <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Trask1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. The algorithm used to determine the estimated date of infection (EDI) was previously described by Haaland <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Haaland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. All patients in this cohort were antiretroviral therapy naÃ¯ve. Zambian linked recipients were identified 45.5 days (median, IQRâ=â41.5â50.5) after the estimated date of infection, at which time plasma samples were obtained from both the transmitting partner (donor) and the seroconvertor (recipient). The vast majority (95%) of HIV-1 sequences derived from ZEHRP transmission pairs belonged to HIV-1 subtype C with subtypes A, D, G, and J being detected only occasionally <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Trask1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. All of the transmission pairs utilized in this study are infected with subtype C HIV-1.</p>

Cells were split 1â¶2 to maintain confluency, replaced with an equal volume of fresh media, and viral supernatants were taken at days 2, 4, 6, and 8 as previously described <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Bhakta1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Virion production was quantified using a <sup>33</sup>P-labeled reverse transcriptase assay. Based on values obtained for days 2â8, the optimal window for logarithmic growth for all viruses was determined to be between days 2 and 6, as by day 8 many high replicating viruses had exhausted target cells causing a flattening or decline of the replication curve. Therefore, log<sub>10</sub>-transformed slopes were calculated based on days 2, 4, and 6 for all viruses. Replication scores were generated by dividing the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed slope of the replication curve for each Gag-MJ4 chimera by the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed slope of wild-type MJ4. Two independent Gag-MJ4 chimera clones per acutely infected linked recipient were run in duplicate to confirm cloning fidelity. After both independent clones were confirmed to have identical replicative capacities, one clone was subsequently run in triplicate in two independent experiments in order to generate consistent replicative capacity scores. GXR25 cells were maintained in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 Âµg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Gibco), and 10 mM HEPES buffer at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

                <p>Studying heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 within the context of discordant couples allows for full characterization of viruses from both donor and recipient. From a total of 294 epidemiologically linked transmission pairs identified from 1998â2010 in the Zambia Emory HIV Research Project (ZEHRP) discordant couple cohort <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Fideli1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, we selected 149 individuals that had been enrolled for at least 1 year and had at least 9 months of follow up post serconversion. The median time post estimated date of infection (EDI) for all 149 individuals was 45 days. Thus, this represents a unique early infection linked transmission pair cohort.</p>
                <p>The median log<sub>10</sub> VL for donors near the time of transmission and the median log<sub>10</sub> set point VL for linked recipients was 5.02 (IQRâ=â4.51â5.45) and 4.39 (IQRâ=â3.91â4.99) respectively for all participants included in this study. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003041.s001">Figure S1</xref> depicts the phylogenetic clustering of population sequences for the <italic>gag</italic> gene of the 149 epidemiologically linked transmission pairs and highlights the high degree of sequence similarity between donor and recipient viruses.</p>
                <p>The majority of population <italic>gag</italic> sequences isolated from acute/early time points of linked recipients were homogeneous and in most cases were identical to the donor population <italic>gag</italic> sequence isolated near the EDI.

Of the 149 pairs only 37 recipient sequences had evidence of potential early escape and a majority of these individuals (28/37) had only a single amino acid change. Therefore, we can conclude that the majority of the sequence polymorphisms present at the seroconversion time point are derived from the chronically infected donor.

                <p>Previous studies investigating the role of Gag viral fitness have employed a recombination approach in which sequences are PCR amplified as a bulk population, allowed to recombine into a <italic>gag-deleted</italic> NL4-3, and resulting viruses propagated in permissive cells <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Miura3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This method has three distinct disadvantages: there is no control over the sites of recombination, it requires the outgrowth of virus which may select for the most fit virus in the population and could also select for sequence changes, and the introduction of subtype C sequences into a lab adapted subtype B proviral backbone may introduce biases due to the interaction of subtype B proteins with subtype C Gag. In order to avoid these limitations and because we are studying individuals recently infected with HIV, where the population is generally homogeneous, we have employed a direct cloning method that allows for the introduction of the entire <italic>gag</italic> gene into a replication competent, CCR5 tropic, clade C provirus, MJ4 <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Ndungu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
                <p>A splice-overlap-extension PCR was employed to fuse the MJ4-LTR-U5 sequence with the transmitted <italic>gag</italic> sequence. This ensures that the cis-acting sequences upstream of Gag, which may influence expression levels, are constant throughout all constructs. The resulting chimeras include the entire transmitted <italic>gag</italic> sequence from the initiation codon to the end of Gag and extend into conserved region of protease by 47 amino acids. For each newly infected individual, at least two independent Gag-MJ4 chimeras were sequence confirmed and assayed for replicative capacity (RC). An analysis of variation of RC between the two independent clones derived from each newly infected linked recipient was 8.5%. Testing two independent clones, therefore, ensures that the observed RC is not due to the confounding effect of backbone mutations that might have arisen during the cloning process and provides an estimate of experimentally induced variation.</p>
                <p>Overall, a low amount of heterogeneity was detected in <italic>gag</italic> population sequences isolated from linked recipients, with only 28% having one or more mixed bases resulting in amino acid changes in the sequences from which the Gag-MJ4 chimeras were generated. When this was the case, the <italic>gag</italic> clone with the sequence closest to the donor <italic>gag</italic> sequence was chosen in order to avoid sampling <italic>gags</italic> containing <italic>de novo</italic> escape or reversion. In some cases in which multiple variants appeared to be transmitted, several <italic>gag</italic> variants were assayed for RC as described in the materials and methods section. In each case, these minor variants were found to have similar or identical RC values (data not shown).</p>

This finding indicates that the RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence clearly plays a role in defining early set point VL of newly infected Zambian linked recipients.</p>

                <p>An expanded data set of 1899 subtype C <italic>gag</italic> sequences from Zambia and South Africa (Carlson, Schaefer et. al., manuscript in preparation) was utilized to identify residues that affected RC and were also HLA-associated. Within this data set, HLA-associated polymorphisms are classified as being either adapted or non-adapted. An adapted residue is one that is escaped relative to the HLA-allele in question. In contrast, a residue that is non-adapted is the susceptible form and may render the virus vulnerable to immunological targeting by the HLA-allele in question. This new dataset has identified a total of 199 HLA-linked polymorphisms (q&lt;0.2, p&lt;0.0007) vs. 59 associations utilized previously from a smaller subset of <italic>gag</italic> sequences <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Goepfert1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Within the 49 residues associated with changes in RC, 7 polymorphisms were found to be adapted to specific HLA class I alleles, clearly demonstrating the impact of the cellular immune response in affecting viral fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003041-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, * denotes q&lt;0.2). Six polymorphisms were found to be non-adapted to specific HLA class I alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003041-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, * denotes q&lt;0.2). Since these are non-consensus polymorphisms, it is possible that consensus at these residues is escaped relative to these HLAs, potentially explaining why an adapted consensus residue at this position is the less fit variant. Indeed, 5 consensus residues (62K, 451S, 488S, 85L, and 309A) with p&lt;0.05 were found to be adapted to HLA-I alleles, demonstrating that the cellular immune response can drive selection for consensus residues.</p>

                <title>The cumulative and qualitative effect of HLA associated polymorphisms in Gag on replicative capacity</title>
                <p>In order to investigate whether there is a cumulative effect of viral escape from cellular immune pressure in Gag on RC, the expanded dataset of HLA-associated polymorphisms generated from an analysis of 1899 <italic>gag</italic> sequences from Zambia and South Africa (Carlson, Schaefer <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation), described above, was employed. The number of non-consensus polymorphisms located at HLA-associated positions was determined for each MJ4 chimera and then correlated with the RC defined by those Gag sequences. Surprisingly, we found a positive association between the number of HLA-associated polymorphisms and RC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003041-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>; râ=â0.14, pâ=â0.05). Although counterintuitive, this is consistent with the fact that not all HLA-associated polymorphisms within a particular Gag sequence will necessarily reduce fitness. We have shown in the previous sections that several non-adapted (or âsusceptibleâ to HLA pressure) HLA-associated polymorphisms increase fitness relative to the median of all sequences. Indeed, we observe a highly statistically significant positive correlation between the number of non-adapted HLA-associated polymorphisms and RC (Spearman correlation, râ=â0.23, pâ=â0.003; data not shown). Thus, the inclusion of both adapted (or escaped with respect to specific HLA alleles) and non-adapted polymorphisms within this expanded HLA-associated dataset may explain the observed positive association between numbers of HLA-associated polymorphisms and RC. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is the balance and interaction of both fitness increasing and fitness decreasing polymorphisms within a particular sequence that ultimately determines the RC of the virus.</p>

                <p>In order to more accurately determine how the number and quality of HLA-associated polymorphisms affects RC and to correct for the opposing influence of both increasing and decreasing polymorphisms within a particular sequence, a summed polymorphism score was calculated by assigning fitness increasing polymorphisms a score of +1, fitness decreasing polymorphisms a score of â1, and neutral polymorphisms a score of 0. HLA-associated polymorphisms were defined as being positive, negative, or neutral based on the previously described univariate analysis that correlated specific residues within our 149 sequences with changes in RC.

                <p>In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, in which we defined the endpoint as having a CD4+ T cell count &gt;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (WHO recommendation for initiation of anti-retroviral therapy <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crowley1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>), we observed a statistically significant difference in the number of individuals that maintain CD4+ counts &gt;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> between those infected with viruses that replicate very poorly (RC&lt;1) and those infected with highly replicating viruses (RC&gt;2), within the first 3 years of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003041-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, Mantel-Cox test pâ=â0.029). This disparity in disease progression was even more pronounced when the endpoint was defined as having CD4+ T cell counts &gt;300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, demonstrating a median difference of 896 days before falling below the CD4+ count cut off between individuals infected with low and high replicating viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003041-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, Mantel-Cox test pâ=â0.014). Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we demonstrate a significantly increased risk of CD4+ T cell counts falling below 350 (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.36; pâ=â0.034) or 300 (HR 3.80; pâ=â0.021) over the first three years of infection for individuals whose Gag conferred an RC&gt;2 vs. RC&lt;1.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the benefit conferred by low replicating viruses could not be wholly explained by differences in set point VL within this smaller data set. Although there was a trend towards higher VLs between the two most disparate groups, with a 2.5 fold difference in median VLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003041-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), we observed no statistically significant differences in median set point VLs between individuals infected with low (RC&lt;1), medium (RCâ=â1â2), and highly (RC&gt;2) replicating viruses. Further, in Cox proportional hazard models that take into account VL, the HR remained high (2.18 and 3.12 respectively) and p values continued to trend or remain borderline significant (pâ=â0.093 and 0.051) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003041-t002">Table 2</xref>), indicating that both VL and RC can independently affect CD4 loss. Moreover, the HR associated with log10 increases in set point VL alone was lower than that for RC alone (HRâ=â1.75 versus 2.62, and 2.09 versus 3.80; CD4 &lt;350 and 300 respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003041-t002">Table 2</xref>). These results suggest that infection with a low replicating virus confers clinical benefit outside of the effect of RC on set point VL, and that the kinetics of viral replication early in infection can ultimately dictate long-term pathogenesis.</p>

              <p>In this study of 149 linked Zambian heterosexual transmission pairs from the ZEHRP discordant couple cohort we have more fully characterized the role that HIV-1 viral characteristics, in particular the replicative capacity (RC) conferred by the transmitted <italic>gag</italic> sequence, plays in defining parameters of early HIV-1 pathogenesis. Identification and comparison of both donor and recipient <italic>gag</italic> sequences for all 149 transmission pairs revealed a high degree of similarity (97.6%) within each linked pair, allowing us to conclude that the majority of polymorphisms in Gag present at the seroconversion time point were transmitted from the chronically infected donor.</p>

                <title>Transmitted <italic>gag</italic> sequences from newly infected individuals engineered into MJ4 drastically alters replicative capacity</title>
                <p>Since all of the transmission pairs in this study were infected with subtype C viruses, our approach of precisely cloning <italic>gag</italic> genes from acutely-infected recipients into a primary isolate (MJ4) provirus has many important advantages over previously employed methods. MJ4 is a CCR5 tropic infectious molecular clone derived from a subtype C clinical isolate from Botswana, providing greater homology to viruses circulating within the Zambian population than other previously used subtype B lab-adapted strains <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Additionally, this cloning method for generating Gag-MJ4 chimeric viruses does not rely on recombination based technologies that require the outgrowth of viral quasispecies, which may select for the most fit virus, and in some cases, amino acid changes in the viral stocks that are not present in the individual from which they were derived <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Miura3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The use of a common BclI restriction site located 137 nucleotides after the <italic>gag</italic> stop codon in MJ4 does result in a chimeric protease, however, this region is 96.5% conserved in this cohort and we did not observe a high prevalence of dead or inactive Gag-MJ4 chimeras.</p>
                <p>The impact of engineering foreign <italic>gag</italic> sequences into MJ4 on virus replication was highly significant, with many of the chimeras exhibiting RC values greater than a hundred-fold higher than wild-type MJ4, which in this assay is one of the poorer replicators. This indicates that substitution of Gag can drastically alter the <italic>in vitro</italic> RC of the virus when all other viral components are constant. Multiple intra-molecular contacts as well as host protein interactions in Gag are necessary for effective intracellular Gag trafficking <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Freed1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Spearman1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, particle formation <xref rid="ppat.1003041-GanserPornillos1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, budding <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Gottlinger1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, maturation <xref rid="ppat.1003041-vonSchwedler1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref> and disassembly <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Forshey1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Therefore, immune mediated adaptation of this functionally constrained protein could have clear consequences for viral replication through disruption of these many interactions.</p>

                <title>Correlation between the replicative capacities conferred by transmitted <italic>gag</italic> sequences and viral loads in newly infected individuals and their transmitting partners</title>
                <p>It has been well established that the set point VL in those recently infected with HIV-1 is correlated to disease progression and clinical outcome <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Saag1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Mellors1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Previous data from our group demonstrated that transmission of sequences with increasing numbers of CTL escape mutations in Gag resulted in lower set point VLs in newly infected individuals, a finding that suggested that transmitted HLA-associated polymorphisms in Gag might negatively affect viral replication <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Goepfert1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We have confirmed this association in the current study after increasing the number of transmission pairs analyzed from 88 to 149. This result is consistent with studies by Brockman <italic>et al.</italic>, which have demonstrated a statistically significant link between the RC conferred by <italic>gag-pro</italic> genes in subtype B and C chronically infected individuals to VL <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. However, a statistically significant correlation between Gag RC derived from acutely infected individuals and set point VL has not previously been definitively reported in a subtype C cohort.</p>
                <p>In contrast, in this large group of very early ZEHRP seroconvertors (with samples drawn a median of 45 days post-EDI) we observed a clear statistically significant correlation (pâ=â0.02) between the RC conferred by the transmitted <italic>gag</italic> sequence and the early set point VL in newly infected individuals. This result implies that RC plays a role in defining the overall level of virus replication during the first year of infection. Moreover, in multivariable analyses that take into account the early viral control imposed by the B*57 allele and by gender, the impact of RC on set point VL was found to be independent of these two host factors (pâ=â0.009). Other factors such as NK cells and restriction factors such as TRIM or APOBEC may potentially affect RC and VL, however little is currently known regarding these potential effects, and future efforts should evaluate the role of such factors. While we observed a statistically significant positive correlation between RC and set point VL, outliers in the data exist that do not fit the trend, and in some cases can be explained by the presence of protective HLA-alleles or by a large number of escape mutations present in the transmitted sequence that are relevant to the HLA background of the newly infected individual. Set point VL is clearly determined by a combination of both host factors, including HLA-alleles, and viral factors such as RC, and this may explain the differences in the absolute correlation for each individual.</p>
                <p>The RC of Gag-MJ4 chimeras also correlated with VLs near the estimated date of infection in chronically infected donors, consistent with the previously reported observation that donor and recipient VLs are correlated within epidemiologically linked transmission pairs <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Tang4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Hecht1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The data presented here would suggest that the RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence is a contributing viral characteristic of that donor virus responsible for influencing early set point VL in the newly infected partner.</p>

                <title>Several amino acids in Gag significantly correlate to changes in replicative capacity</title>
                <p>In a pair-wise analysis, a large number of residues were associated with changes in fitness (p&lt;0.05, q&lt;0.51), with 4 residues at 3 unique positions at q&lt;0.2. These residues included the polymorphisms 30R and 31I in p17 (MA), and 309S in p24 (CA). However, in an exploratory analysis of those residues associated with changes in RC with a p value&lt;0.05, it was clear that associated polymorphisms were noticeably enriched on a per residue basis in p17 and p2 (Fisher's exact test, p&lt;0.001). The former plays critical roles in intracellular trafficking, and membrane association of Gag <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Spearman1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Dorfman1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Freed2" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, while the latter is an important structural element involved in formation of the immature protein shell <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Krausslich1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright4" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> and a target of the novel drug Bevirimat during maturational cleavage of the Gag precursor <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Surprisingly, only one third of the associated mutations negatively affected virus replication, while nearly two-thirds of the associations increased fitness. Some of these fitness-increasing mutations represent adapted polymorphisms (i.e. selected as immune escape) and in terms of vaccine design it may be important to avoid the inclusion of such epitopes.</p>
                <p>Polymorphisms positively or negatively affecting replication in the p24 region of Gag were limited to just six residues (4 positive, 2 negative), in accordance with the conserved nature of this protein. Surprisingly, none of the canonical B*57/B*5801 associated escape mutations within p24, whose fitness defects have been well documented <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Chopera1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Boutwell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003041-MartinezPicado1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, were found to be significantly associated with decreases in RC in our present study. This may be due to the high prevalence of B*57/B*5801 positive individuals within this cohort (25%), which could promote viral adaptation to these alleles over time through compensatory mutations <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Kawashima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is also possible that some fitness defects such as those associated with T242N within the TW10 epitope might be missed in the current study, as a previous study has shown that it is cell-type dependent <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The most deleterious HLA-associated mutation that we observed was K12E, which reduced RC by almost 10-fold relative to the median RC of the cohort. This polymorphism is found quite rarely in the population (3 out of 149), and is statistically associated with HLA-A*74, an allele found to be highly protective in both this Zambian subtype C cohort as well as others <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Tang2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Lazaryan1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. The protective effect of A*74 has recently been demonstrated to be independent of HLA-B*57 <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Matthews2" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. The negative <italic>in vitro</italic> impact of mutations at residue 12 on replication is supported by a longitudinal study of a subset of this seroconvertor cohort (nâ=â81), in whom polymorphisms at residue 12 were found to revert at a high rate (25%/yr), over the first two years of infection (Schaefer <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, in this same study, escape at position 12 occurred only once and at 24 months post-infection in a total of ten A*74 positive individuals, confirming the high fitness cost associated with CTL-induced escape mutations at this position. We hypothesize that the targeting of this putative epitope, KR9 <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Matthews2" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, may account for part of the protective effect conferred by A*74 and indicates that protective immune responses can target regions of Gag outside of p24. While the nature of the replication defect in viruses encoding K12E remains to be determined, this residue does lie in the highly basic region at the N-terminus of p17 (MA), which is involved in membrane targeting and membrane association of Gag <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Freed2" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Fledderman1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Rare polymorphisms have the greatest effect on replicative capacity</title>
                <p>Rare mutations, such as K12E, which occur in a small subset of the population studied here (less than 10 individuals of the 149), affected fitness to a statistically greater degree than more common polymorphisms. Rare fitness decreasing mutations are likely unique to specific circumstances such as those where a considerable decrease in RC is warranted in the face of a very effective cellular immune response that is largely abrogated upon mutation. Such mutations have been found to subsequently revert after transmission to individuals lacking the selecting HLA-allele <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Leslie1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crawford2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Navis1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref> and in whom they now confer a fitness deficit for the virus. These sites of rare fitness reducing polymorphisms may emphasize vulnerable epitopes at which HIV-1 escapes from immune pressure with great difficulty. Alternatively, it is possible that, when escape occurs, it is consistently associated with a decrease in RC that cannot be completely compensated.</p>
                <p>A similar observation was made for rare mutations that greatly increase RC. Global compensatory mutations do exist that can compensate multiple deleterious mutations, such as those within the cyclophilin binding loop <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crawford2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Crawford3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Some of the rare fitness increasing mutations may be of this type, although those reported previously have generally been quite common in the population. Compensatory mutations can also be secondary site-suppressors of deleterious mutations <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Poon1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Frequently, such mutations are only conditionally beneficial and can be deleterious in a different context, which could explain why some fitness increasing mutations are rare. It is also possible that these mutations do carry some unrecognized <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness cost that cannot be captured in the <italic>in vitro</italic> replication system used here. Due to the fact that these mutations are rare, they are difficult to statistically link to HLA alleles or to link to other residues with which they may covary, making the potential fitness defects that these mutations mitigate difficult to elucidate.</p>

                <title>The cumulative and qualitative effect of HLA associated polymorphisms in Gag on replicative capacity and VL</title>
                <p>A key goal of this study was to understand how the cellular immune response might select for mutations in Gag that reduce viral RC, and while identification of specific amino acid polymorphisms that either increase or decrease fitness can be informative, it is equally important to elucidate how the accumulation of specific HLA-associated polymorphisms in Gag affects both RC of the virus and VL in the newly infected person. Previous efforts to correlate the total number of HLA-associated polymorphisms in Gag to RC have yielded inconclusive results <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Brockman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, perhaps because the quality of the polymorphisms in question was not considered. Using an expanded list of HLA-associated polymorphisms (Carlson, Schaefer <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation) we report a weak positive correlation between the total number of HLA-associated polymorphisms in Gag and RC. The fact that this correlation was positive is consistent with our observation that a large fraction of the non-consensus HLA-associated polymorphisms increased RC. In particular, in the expanded data set of HLA-associated polymorphisms, we observed that non-adapted residues, which would be predicted to render the virus susceptible to the linked HLA allele, were statistically associated with increased fitness.</p>
                <p>These findings suggest that CTL escape mutations, which decrease the overall RC of the virus, are being driven to consensus as a result of population level immune pressure. In the absence of immune pressure, the non-escaped (non-adapted) residues would be expected to predominate, but if they render the virus susceptible to a large portion of the population, then the consensus residue will be escaped rather than susceptible, despite reducing <italic>in vitro</italic> fitness. This is consistent with the findings of Kawashima <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Kawashima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that the frequency of certain HLA-class I alleles within a particular population can influence the fixation of escape mutations in the overall population. Moreover, Wright <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003041-Wright3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> showed that Gag-NL43 recombinant viruses encoding <italic>gag-pro</italic> sequences most disparate from the subtype C consensus <italic>gag-pro</italic> sequence had statistically higher replicative capacities than their more consensus-like counterparts, and this finding has been recapitulated in this current study. Taken together, these data suggest that overall, HLA-mediated adaptation is driving the fixation of consensus residues that are less fit than their susceptible counter-parts.</p>
                <p>When we account for this ability of HLA-associated polymorphisms to either increase or decrease fitness by assigning a summed polymorphism score, which subtracts the number of fitness decreasing polymorphisms from the number of fitness increasing polymorphisms in a particular sequence, we find a highly statistically significant correlation between RC and the summed polymorphism score (p&lt;0.0001). Although this p-value should be interpreted cautiously, since it reflects the summation of features previously identified to be correlated with RC, the data do suggest that the effect of polymorphisms is cumulative, and that as a Gag sequence accumulates an excess of fitness-reducing polymorphisms, the RC decreases proportionally. Similarly, utilization of a summed polymorphism score improved previously reported correlations between the total number of HLA-associated polymorphisms in Gag and set point VL in newly infected individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Goepfert1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We observed a highly statistically significantly correlation (pâ=â0.006) between the summed polymorphism score and set point VL in newly infected individuals. Just as this balance of fitness increasing and decreasing polymorphisms impacts RC, it simultaneously influences the set point VL of the newly infected individual.</p>

                <title>Transmission of viruses with low RCs provides recipients with a longer-term clinical benefit</title>
                <p>While VL has been demonstrated to influence the rate of disease progression in HIV-1 infected individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Mellors1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, it is possible that, during the very earliest stages of infection and before host immune control, the replication rate of the virus may affect the rate of future damage to the immune system. Indeed, we observed a statistically significant negative correlation between RC and average CD4 counts for the first year post infection, suggesting a role for RC in defining this important parameter of pathogenesis at early stages after infection. However, it is possible that this early benefit could be quickly lost due to further adaptation of the virus to the new host's immunogenetic background and further compensation for <italic>de novo</italic> escape mutations. Consequently, we analyzed individuals with longitudinal CD4 counts out to three-years post infection in order to determine if the observed early benefit was sustained in early chronic stages of infection. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to examine the relative time for individuals infected with viruses encoding <italic>gag</italic> genes conferring RC values of &lt;1 and &gt;2 to reach CD4 T cell counts of 350 after 3 years of infection, we observed a clear and statistically significant difference. This was even more striking when CD4 counts less than 300 were used as the endpoint. Moreover a Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated a significantly increased risk of CD4 counts falling below both 350 (HR 2.36) or 300 (HR 3.80) over the first three years of infection for individuals whose <italic>gag</italic> gene conferred an RC&gt;2 vs. RC&lt;1. These findings indicate that the RC conferred by the transmitted Gag sequence may have profound and prolonged effects on HIV-1 pathogenesis from acute to early chronic stages of infection.</p>
                <p>While RC and VL are correlated in the full data set, set point VL does not fully explain the effect of RC on CD4, because we did not observe any statistically significant differences in set point VL between the two groups (RC&lt;1 and RC&gt;2) for the subset of individuals with CD4+T cell counts (nâ=â63). Moreover, in Cox proportional hazard models which take into account VL, the HR remained high (2.17 and 3.11 respectively) and p values continued to trend or remain borderline significant (pâ=â0.093 and 0.051). This suggests that both VL and RC have independent effects on CD4 decline, however, because this analysis was conducted on a subset of less than half of our initial cohort, additional work is underway to further confirm and extend these results.</p>
                <p>It seems possible, therefore, that the RC of the transmitted variant may initiate crucial events, early in infection and dissemination, that dictate both acute and later stage pathogenesis regardless of the ability of the immune system to control viral replication down to set point. Infection with highly replicating variants could lead to a more complete depletion of central memory CD4+ T cell pools at this early time that could predispose an individual to more rapid CD4+ T cell loss, irrespective of adequate control of viral replication. This is evidenced in a few individuals infected with highly replicating Gag variants (RC&gt;2), who go on to control VL to a low set point, but whose CD4+ T cells counts rapidly drop below 300 (data not shown). Additionally, a high level of peak viremia or initial high antigen loads could establish an inflammatory environment that leads to sustained immune activation, which has been implicated as a more reliable marker for disease progression <xref rid="ppat.1003041-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. These possibilities are the focus of ongoing work.</p>
                <p>In summary, using an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach to define the impact of polymorphisms in Gag on transmitted virus RC has clearly shown that this property of the virus is a significant contributor to early set point VL in a newly infected individual. More importantly, however, these studies suggest a critical role for RC in defining the trajectory of immune depletion and pathogenesis, beyond simply its impact on VL, and highlight the importance of the very earliest events in virus-host interactions. It also raises the possibility that a vaccine that can attenuate early virus replication would have a positive impact both on vaccinated individuals, as well as non-vaccinated individuals by weakening the transmitted/founder virus and increasing the likelihood of transmission of low replicating variants.</p>
