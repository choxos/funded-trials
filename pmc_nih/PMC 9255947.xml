                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>There is an unmet need for COVID-19 prevention in patient populations who have not mounted or are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to complete COVID-19 vaccination. We previously reported that a single subcutaneous 1200 mg dose of the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab and imdevimab (CAS + IMD) prevented symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections by 81·4% in generally healthy household contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals over a 1-month efficacy assessment period. Here we present additional results, including the 7-month follow-up period (months 2–8), providing additional insights about the potential for efficacy in pre-exposure prophylaxis settings.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done in the USA, Romania, and Moldova in 2020–2021, before the emergence of omicron (B.1.1.529) and omicron-lineage variants. Uninfected and unvaccinated household contacts of infected individuals, judged by the investigator to be in good health, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 1200 mg CAS + IMD or placebo by subcutaneous injection according to a central randomisation scheme provided by an interactive web response system; randomisation was stratified per site by the test results of a local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 and age group at baseline. COVID-19 vaccines were prohibited before randomisation, but participants were allowed to receive COVID-19 vaccination during the follow-up period. Participants who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the follow-up period underwent RT-PCR testing. Prespecified endpoints included the proportion of previously uninfected and baseline-seronegative participants (seronegative-modified full analysis set) who had RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in the follow-up period (post-hoc for the timepoints of months 2–5 and 6–8 only) and underwent seroconversion (ie, became seropositive, considered a proxy for any SARS-CoV-2 infections [symptomatic and asymptomatic]; prespecified up to day 57, post-hoc for all timepoints thereafter). We also assessed the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>From July 13, 2020, to Oct 4, 2021, 2317 participants who were RT-PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2 were randomly assigned, of whom 1683 (841 assigned to CAS + IMD and 842 assigned to placebo) were seronegative at baseline. During the entirety of the 8-month study, CAS + IMD reduced the risk of COVID-19 by 81·2% (nominal p&lt;0·0001) versus placebo (prespecified analysis). During the 7-month follow-up period, protection was greatest during months 2–5, with a 100% relative risk reduction in COVID-19 (nominal p&lt;0·0001; post-hoc analysis). Efficacy waned during months 6–8 (post-hoc analysis). Seroconversion occurred in 38 (4·5%) of 841 participants in the CAS + IMD group and in 181 (21·5%) of 842 in the placebo group during the 8-month study (79·0% relative risk reduction <italic>vs</italic> placebo; nominal p&lt;0·0001). Six participants in the placebo group were hospitalised due to COVID-19 versus none who received CAS + IMD. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events (including COVID-19) were reported in 24 (1·7%) of 1439 participants receiving CAS + IMD and in 23 (1·6%) of 1428 receiving placebo. Five deaths were reported, none of which were due to COVID-19 or related to the study drugs.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>CAS + IMD is not authorised in any US region as of Jan 24, 2022, because data show that CAS + IMD is not active against omicron-lineage variants. In this study, done before the emergence of omicron-lineage variants, a single subcutaneous 1200 mg dose of CAS + IMD protected against COVID-19 for up to 5 months of community exposure to susceptible strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, in addition to the post-exposure prophylaxis setting that was previously shown.</p>

                <p id="para30">Monoclonal antibodies are being developed for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. In patient populations who have not mounted or are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, monoclonal antibodies can offer an important alternate or complementary prevention strategy. Casirivimab and imdevimab (CAS + IMD) is a combination of two neutralising monoclonal antibodies, administered together, that bind non-overlapping epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain. We searched PubMed for clinical trials of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies used for the prevention of COVID-19 published between study initiation (July 13, 2020) and study completion (Oct 4, 2021) using various combinations of the terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “monoclonal antibody”, “prophylaxis”, and “prevention.” We then filtered for the article type “clinical trial.” No language restrictions were applied. Two published trials were identified. The first trial (BLAZE-2) reported the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab for COVID-19 prevention in residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities over an 8-week period. The second, the report of the primary analysis of this trial, showed that a single 1200 mg dose of CAS + IMD administered subcutaneously was effective in preventing both symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and any SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic), in household contacts of individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high-risk transmission setting over a 1-month efficacy assessment period. After the primary analysis of the study, a question remained as to the duration of protection provided by a single 1200 mg dose of CAS + IMD.</p>

                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">Herein, we address and further extend the findings of the previous report by assessing the rates of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection through months 2–8 of the follow-up period, after the risks of household transmission had subsided. In post-hoc analyses, the data reveal compelling efficacy in prevention (100% relative risk reduction in COVID-19) for months 2–5, the 4-month period following the initial efficacy assessment during which study participants had ongoing community exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Efficacy waned during months 6–8. Overall, we observed an 81·2% relative risk reduction in developing COVID-19 over the entirety of the 8-month study, after receiving a single dose of CAS + IMD, compared with placebo. Additionally, because regularly scheduled surveillance RT-PCR testing was not done after week 4 of the study, we used seroconversion as a proxy for the occurrence of any SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seroconversion occurred in 38 (4·5%) of 841 participants in the CAS + IMD group and in 181 (21·5%) of 842 in the placebo group (79·0% relative risk reduction <italic>vs</italic> placebo). Furthermore, we estimated antibody concentrations and neutralising titres in serum throughout the follow-up period, providing insights about the concentrations of CAS + IMD associated with efficacy in prevention. During the entire study, none of the individuals in the CAS + IMD group were hospitalised due to COVID-19, versus six individuals in the placebo group. Of the five deaths reported during 8-month study, none were due to COVID-19 or the study drugs. These study results are applicable to SARS-CoV-2 strains that are susceptible to CAS + IMD.</p>

                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">This 8-month study, done in 2020–21, showed the ability of a single 1200-mg subcutaneous dose of CAS + IMD to provide extended protection (approximately 5 months after a single dose) against susceptible strains of SARS-CoV-2. Estimated drug concentrations and neutralising titres in serum during the follow-up period provide initial insights about potential correlates of antibody-related immunity. This study, combined with the large database of exposure, shows that CAS + IMD is generally well tolerated. These data could be relevant to highly vulnerable populations that are immunocompromised and cannot mount an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection or by vaccination, provided that strains of SARS-CoV-2 susceptible to the combination used are in circulation.</p>

Recruitment was done through several approaches, including the use of social media and websites, physician-to-physician letters, flyers, and participant-to-participant referrals. Participants were randomly assigned within 96 h of collection of the index case's positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test sample. Individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the analysis. Although COVID-19 vaccines were prohibited before randomisation, participants were allowed to receive COVID-19 vaccination during the follow-up period (after the 28-day EAP), and they were recommended to follow US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance at the time of study conduct, which was to receive the vaccine 90 or more days after receipt of monoclonal antibodies. All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the trial.</p>

                <p id="para150">On day 1, during the screening–baseline period, study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive a single dose of CAS + IMD 1200 mg or placebo according to Parexel International's proprietary central randomisation scheme provided by an interactive web response system. On site, an unmasked pharmacist or qualified designee entered the participant's information in the interactive web response system. This system was programmed to assign treatment allocation and provide the kit numbers assigned to the unmasked team. The unmasked site team, including the pharmacist or qualified designee, had no other involvement in the trial. At the time of randomisation, participants were stratified per site according to results of the local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 (positive, negative, or undetermined), if available, and according to age group (≥12 to &lt;18 years, ≥18 to &lt;50 years, or ≥50 years) at baseline. The investigators, site personnel, COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were masked to treatment-group assignments. The study drug preparation was done by the unmasked pharmacist or qualified designee. The syringes were wrapped with orange, transparent cellophane and labelled in a blinded manner before being provided to the study team for drug administration. Participants and investigators remained fully masked until the final clinical study report was published.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para160">At baseline (day 1), participants received 1200 mg CAS + IMD (600 mg each of casirivimab and imdevimab) or placebo through subcutaneous injection. After the 28-day EAP with weekly assessments, participants were assessed monthly during the follow-up period (days 30–225). At each scheduled visit during the follow-up period, the investigator assessed the participant's general health, adverse events, and signs and symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection since the last contact. If a participant had a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test during the EAP, they could enter the follow-up period but continued to have weekly nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing until two confirmed negative results were obtained 24 h or more apart. During the follow-up period, participants who were symptomatic were instructed to contact the investigator if symptoms occurred between visits, at which time they underwent assessment and central laboratory RT-PCR testing; if the participant was unable to have a central laboratory RT-PCR, local laboratory molecular testing was used. No scheduled surveillance SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was done during the follow-up period.</p>
                <p id="para170">Samples for serology were collected at baseline to assess previous infection and immunity to SARS-CoV-2; serological testing included anti-spike S1 IgA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), anti-spike S1 IgG (Euroimmun), and anti-nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott, Des Plaines, IL, USA) as previously described.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A participant was categorised as seronegative at baseline if all available serological tests were negative and was categorised as seropositive at baseline if any serological test was positive. On days 29, 57, 225 (end of study), and at the study discontinuation visit, anti-nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott) serological testing was done. Seroconversion was defined as a post-baseline positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG test one or more times during the study among participants who were initially seronegative. The presence or absence of anti-spike antibodies was not assessed post-baseline, as anti-spike serological assays would be confounded by COVID-19 vaccines and CAS + IMD administration.</p>
                <p id="para180">Blood samples for drug concentration were collected for the first 400 participants, with more frequent (dense) sampling in the first 30 participants and less frequent (sparse) sampling in participants 31 through 400.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para390">Despite the changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants showing differing characteristics with regards to transmissibility and severity of illness, widespread prevention is crucial to control the pandemic and to allow for a return to relative normalcy. Although vaccination has resulted in a decreased incidence of severe COVID-19, many individuals,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> especially those who are immunocompromised without appropriate B-cell function, remain unprotected despite vaccination. Findings from our study show that CAS + IMD might be useful as pre-exposure prophylaxis against susceptible variants, with a single subcutaneous administration of 1200 mg providing protection against COVID-19, in a variant-dependent manner, for approximately 5 months.</p>
              <p id="para400">We previously reported primary analysis data over a 1-month period showing that a single subcutaneous 1200 mg dose of CAS + IMD reduced the relative risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19) in a high-risk household contact setting.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Data were consistent with efficacy both in a post-exposure prophylaxis setting (acutely during the first week after exposure to an infected household member) and during weeks 2–4 when community exposure was also the source of infection. We now support these findings of pre-exposure prophylaxis by assessing prevention of COVID-19 in the subsequent 7 months of follow-up when the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was presumably primarily through community exposure.</p>
              <p id="para410">In the prespecified analysis looking at the entire 8-month study, efficacy in prevention was observed, with an 81·2% relative risk reduction of developing COVID-19 after receipt of a single dose of CAS + IMD. However, when evaluated month by month, efficacy waned after month 5. Protection against COVID-19 was most compelling during months 2–5 of the follow-up, with a 100% relative risk reduction of developing COVID-19, suggesting that this was driving the observed efficacy during the follow-up period. The 5-month duration of protection observed in this study was an unexpected finding and suggests that only a very low serum concentration of CAS + IMD was required to effectively neutralise SARS-CoV-2 and protect against symptomatic infection. The neutralisation titre is a consequence of the potency of the antibodies against the spike protein and absolute drug concentrations over time, which is informed by both the half-life of the antibodies and the dose administered. These data suggest that despite half-lives of only approximately 30 days,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> a single 1200 mg dose provided sufficient drug exposure concentrations, above those required to effectively neutralise the virus in target tissues for 5 months. This observation is consistent with a 2022 meta-analysis,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> which also suggests that many SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been administered at doses much higher than needed to achieve sufficient neutralisation for efficacy in prevention or treatment settings.</p>
              <p id="para420">Additionally, although scheduled surveillance RT-PCR testing was not done after the first 4 weeks of the study, seroconversion used as a proxy to identify any SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic infections) supported the sustained benefit of CAS + IMD. During the entirety of the 8-month study, none of the individuals in the CAS + IMD group were hospitalised due to COVID-19, compared with six individuals in the placebo group. Although five deaths occurred during the study, none were attributed to the study drugs, and none were due to COVID-19. Taken together with the primary analysis that was previously reported,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> these data provide additional support for the efficacy of CAS + IMD in pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis settings.</p>
              <p id="para430">This study was done before vaccines were widely available. 35% of participants were vaccinated during the follow-up period, allowing us to explore extended protection with a single dose of CAS + IMD in this population where a minority had vaccine-related immunity to SARS-CoV-2. However, only three participants developed symptomatic infection after vaccination. Therefore, we had insufficient data to quantify risk reduction in those who were vaccinated.</p>
              <p id="para440">No new or serious safety signals were observed in the follow-up period of the study. Overall, CAS + IMD was associated with a lower incidence of TEAEs versus placebo, driven by fewer COVID-19-associated TEAEs with CAS + IMD than with placebo. Consistent with previous findings,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> injection site reactions were reported more frequently in the CAS + IMD group, but these reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity.</p>
              <p id="para450">These data provide some insights about correlates of antibody-mediated immunity when the concentrations of CAS + IMD are expressed as SARS-CoV-2 viral neutralisation capability, the 50% neutralising titre. Although, at the time of the study, the viral landscape was dominated by the pre-variant of concern lineages (collectively referred to as Asp614Gly) and not the delta (B.1.617.2) variant,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> the in-vitro neutralisation IC<sub>50s</sub> for CAS + IMD against delta and Asp614Gly are nearly identical,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> suggesting similar estimated 50% neutralising titres over time against these two SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
              <p id="para460">This study has several limitations. It was done from July, 2020, to October, 2021, with the delta variant becoming dominant in the summer of 2021 and before the emergence of omicron-lineage variants. Although CAS + IMD is not expected to be effective against omicron-lineage variants,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> it retains viral neutralisation activity against all other historical variants of concern before omicron. Furthermore, the study enrolled a generally healthy population before the widespread availability of vaccines; therefore, most participants did not have SARS-CoV-2 antibody response (ie, were seronegative). Future use of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for prevention is likely to be focused on the immunocompromised, particularly individuals without B-cell function who cannot mount an appropriate antibody response. Because the efficacy analysis was done in the seronegative population, results might be applicable to immunocompromised populations. Supportive evidence of CAS + IMD efficacy in patients with B-cell deficiency and dysfunction was previously reported.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Additionally, regarding the seroconversion data presented in this analysis, we recognise that anti-nucleocapsid IgG response wanes, and that some participants who were infected might not have developed an antibody response. To compensate, we collected serology samples at multiple timepoints during the study to capture even a transient anti-nucleocapsid IgG response. Nevertheless, it is important to interpret the serology results as a supportive analysis to the RT-PCR results, each of which capture different aspects of infection, with a consistent trend of prevention regardless of the assay used.</p>
              <p id="para470">The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is challenging to predict. Proactive epidemiological surveillance to assess the predominant circulating strains in different regions combined with assessment of neutralisation activity against emerging variants—and with safe and active SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at our disposal, in addition to CAS + IMD—will probably guide decisions on which monoclonal antibodies should be chosen for prophylaxis and treatment in the future.</p>
              <p id="para480">As a whole, this 8-month prevention study showed the benefit of CAS + IMD as post-exposure prophylaxis in a high-risk household transmission setting and as pre-exposure prophylaxis in a broader community setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when susceptible variants were circulating. These data are important for the many individuals who might not mount an effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2, whether by active vaccination or natural infection. Providing protective levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies passively through administration of CAS + IMD might be an effective option for the prevention of COVID-19 in these vulnerable populations when circulating variants are susceptible to CAS + IMD.</p>
