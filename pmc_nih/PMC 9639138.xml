                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The role and sequencing of combination immuno-oncology (IO) therapy following progression on or after first-line IO therapy has not been well-established. The Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in Immuno-ONcology (FRACTION) program is an open-label, phase 2 platform trial designed to evaluate multiple IO combinations in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) who progressed during or after prior IO therapy. Here, we describe the results for patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. For enrollment in track 2 (reported here), patients with histologically confirmed clear cell aRCC, Karnofsky performance status ≥70%, and life expectancy ≥3 months who had previously progressed after IO (anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)) therapy were eligible. Previous treatment with anti-CTLA-4 therapy plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy precluded eligibility for enrollment in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. Patients were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 2 years or until progression, toxicity, or protocol-specified discontinuation. The primary outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were safety and tolerability up to 2 years. Overall survival (OS) was a tertiary/exploratory endpoint. Overall, 46 patients were included with a median follow-up of 33.8 months. The ORR was 17.4% (95% CI, 7.8 to 31.4) with eight (17.4%) patients achieving partial response. Stable disease was achieved in 19 (41.3%) patients, while 14 (30.4%) had progressive disease. Median DOR (range) was 16.4 (2.1+ to 27.0+) months. The PFS rate at 24 weeks was 43.2%, and median OS was 23.8 (95% CI, 13.2 to not reached) months. Grade 3–4 immune-mediated adverse events were reported in seven (15.2%) patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Patients with aRCC treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab may derive durable clinical benefit after progression on previous IO therapies, including heavily pretreated patients, with a manageable safety profile that was consistent with previously published safety outcomes. These outcomes contribute to the knowledge of optimal sequencing of IO therapies for patients with aRCC with high unmet needs.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Since the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in the early 2000s, the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) has progressed into an era where combination immuno-oncology (IO) treatment has become the standard of care.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–8</xref> Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in particular have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for aRCC, reflecting a fundamental shift in the approach to treating aRCC by leveraging the immune system to attack cancer cells, rather than targeting pathways underlying tumor pathogenesis, as with TKIs or mTOR inhibitors.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 9 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Nivolumab was the first-in-class ICI, targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint in aRCC.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was granted on the basis of results from the CheckMate 025 phase 3 clinical trial in 2015, which compared nivolumab and everolimus in the second-line and third-line settings, in which nivolumab demonstrated superiority.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 11 12</xref>
</p>
              <p>After the successes of IO therapy in patients with disease progression on conventional targeted therapies, the randomized phase 3 pivotal CheckMate 214 trial evaluated combination immune checkpoint blockade in treatment-naïve patients with advanced clear cell RCC, resulting in FDA approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate or poor risk.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 13 14</xref> Thereafter, approaches incorporating dual immune checkpoint blockade with a PD-1 or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor along with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibition, or immune checkpoint blockade plus a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy, has become an accepted standard of care for treatment-naïve aRCC on the basis of unprecedented response rates and improved survival.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–10</xref> Nivolumab is now widely used in monotherapy or in combination for the treatment of aRCC, and the clinical benefit of IOs and their combination with antiangiogenic agents is evident in both untreated and treated patients with aRCC.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11 15</xref> IO options currently constitute the backbone of both first-line and second-line treatments.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite the promising efficacy of these combination treatments, disease progression is inevitable for many patients, and no standard of care exists for those who did not respond to an ICI combination in the first-line setting.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 9 15 16</xref> In clinical practice, the potential benefits of ICIs or ICI combinations when given beyond the first-line and second-line setting have not been fully elucidated.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 13</xref> When patients develop resistance or toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in the first-line treatment of aRCC, a new challenge has emerged regarding how to optimally treat patients in the second-line and beyond in patients who have received prior IO therapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 13</xref> Several studies investigated the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab in a sequential manner and showed that this approach was not always feasible and of limited benefit, with efficacy appearing to be less than that of concomitant nivolumab plus ipilimumab in untreated patients with intermediate/poor-risk disease (CheckMate 214 trial).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 17–21</xref> Data from OMNIVORE, TITAN-RCC, and HCRN GU16-260-cohort A did not support a response-adaptive strategy for PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors in metastatic RCC.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref>
</p>
              <p>Ongoing efforts are focused on the sequencing of subsequent-line options after progression on IO monotherapy or combination therapies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 9 16 22</xref> A small number of recent retrospective analyses have suggested that patients whose disease progressed after IO therapy may derive substantial benefit from single-agent ICI and ICI combinations in later treatment lines as well.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 9 16 22</xref>
</p>
              <p>Thus far, although the optimal sequencing of ICI treatment across different lines of treatment is neither supported by high-level prospective evidence nor by treatment guidelines, real-world evidence suggests that heavily pretreated patients may benefit from treatment with ICI or ICI combinations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 9 16 22</xref> This underscores the unmet need for patients in the IO therapy pretreated setting, and ongoing clinical trials will provide insights on which to base future best practice and guideline recommendations.</p>
              <p>The Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in Immuno-ONcology Study in Patients With aRCC (FRACTION-RCC) is a signal-seeking randomized phase 2 trial with an adaptive-platform design that enables evaluation of IO combinations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> FRACTION-RCC assesses efficacy and safety outcomes with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with aRCC who are either IO-treatment naïve (track 1) or whose disease previously progressed during or after IO (track 2); we focus here on track 2. To our knowledge, FRACTION-RCC is the first and only adaptive platform study to prospectively evaluate IO combination regimens in patients with aRCC progressing after previous IO therapy.</p>

Track 1 enrolled patients with aRCC who were naïve to IO treatment (anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4) and were stratified according to whether the patient had prior TKI treatment, and track 2 enrolled patients with previous IO treatment experience. Patients in both tracks were randomized to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab or other treatment combinations, all of which included nivolumab (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figures 1 and 2</xref>). Patients whose disease progressed were eligible for enrollment in another track 2 FRACTION regimen that differed from what the patient previously received.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The results from FRACTION-RCC track 2 contribute to the knowledge on optimal sequencing of IO therapies for patients with aRCC. Given the evolution of the use of front-line combinations of oral multikinase inhibitors with a single-agent IO, the appreciation that a subset of patients who progress on front-line therapy including a single anti-PD-1 agent may still achieve durable remissions with combination IO is important.</p>
              <p>Several studies have evaluated a sequential approach in which nivolumab monotherapy is administered first, and then a response-adaptive strategy is used to determine which patients are eligible for combination treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref> In OMNIVORE (included all IMDC risk patients), HCRN GU16-260 (included all IMDC risk patients), and TITAN-RCC (included only intermediate/poor-risk patients), all patients initiated nivolumab monotherapy; those who progressed on monotherapy were then eligible for treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref> In aggregate, the studies generally suggest that the sequential approach was not always feasible, and though the ORR was improved with combination therapy, efficacy overall may be limited compared with initial combination therapy with PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite the lower response rate (17.4%) observed in the IO-pretreated patients in FRACTION-RCC versus the response rate (39%) reported in the treatment-naïve patients in CheckMate 214, the outcomes are encouraging.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In FRACTION-RCC, the results showed that patients who had already progressed on IO therapy still derived clinical benefit, some with durable responses (median DOR 16.4 months), suggesting that this combination is an option in patients whose tumors progress on prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Of note, it is not possible to discern the individual contribution of each drug, and it is possible that most of the efficacy could come from the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab as the patients were not exposed to it previously.</p>
              <p>In the full cohort of 46 patients, of those who achieved a partial response (n=8), three received treatment with nivolumab plus an anti-LAG-3 agent before enrollment in track 2. Of the 46 patients who did not achieve a response (n=38), 7 were treated with nivolumab plus an anti-LAG-3 drug in a prior line of therapy. Of these seven patients, two maintained stable disease and one was not evaluable (due to early discontinuation) after switching to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and four had progressive disease.</p>
              <p>The FRACTION-RCC adaptive approach allowed for an efficient method for optimizing treatment sequencing in previously treated patients with a high unmet need.</p>
              <p>The findings show ongoing clinical benefits among some patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab after progression on previous IO therapies, with a manageable safety profile that was consistent with previously published safety outcomes.</p>
              <p>The FRACTION study platform is expected to support future translational research by contributing to the understanding of key pathways and biomarkers associated with treatment resistance and mechanisms of action of therapies. Biomarkers such as PD-L1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 will inform future studies and clinical practice about the expression of checkpoints in the immune pathway and their implications on response to treatment and treatment sequencing. Additionally, immune markers such as Ki-67, CD8+, MPO, and FOXP3 may provide insights into mechanisms of action of and resistance to therapies.</p>
