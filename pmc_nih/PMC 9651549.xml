                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>While prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in high-grade prostate cancers, it is also expressed in tumor neovasculature and other malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, no functional imaging for HCC is clinically available, making diagnosis and surveillance following local therapies particularly challenging. <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL binds with high affinity to PSMA yet clears rapidly from the blood pool. PET imaging with <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL may represent a new tool for staging, surveillance and assessment of treatment response in HCC. The purpose of this Functional Imaging Liver Cancer (FLIC) trial is to assess the ability of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT to detect sites of HCC.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This is a phase II multi-site prospective imaging trial with a plan to enroll 50 subjects with suspected HCC on standard of care CT or MRI and eligible for standard local treatment. Participants will undergo a baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT, prior to therapy. Subjects will also be scanned with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT within 2 weeks of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT. Participants will undergo histopathologic assessment and standard of care local treatment for HCC within a multidisciplinary team context. Participants with histopathologic confirmation of HCC and a positive baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will undergo a post-treatment <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT during the first routine follow-up, typically within 4–8 weeks. Subjects with negative baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will not be re-scanned after treatment but will remain in follow-up. Participants will be followed for 5-years to assess for progression-free-survival. The primary endpoint is the positive predictive value of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET for HCC as confirmed by histopathology. Secondary endpoints include comparison of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT with CT, MRI, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT, and evaluation of the value of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT in assessing treatment response following local treatment. Exploratory endpoints include next generation sequencing of tumors, and analysis of extracellular vesicles to identify biomarkers associated with response to therapy.</p>

                  <title>PSMA in hepatocellular carcinoma</title>
                  <p>Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), also known as folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1) or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein extensively studied in prostate cancers. PSMA is overexpressed in high-grade prostate tumors, and increases when de-differentiation, metastatic or hormone-refractory disease occur, making PSMA prognostically significant for this disease [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, PSMA is not entirely prostate-specific, and it is known to be expressed in normal tissues such as the lacrimal and salivary glands, in several other neoplasms, as well as in tumor-associated neovasculature [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for about 80% of all primary liver cancers [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is the fifth most common cancer world-wide and the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Current guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommend HCC surveillance with abdominal ultrasound every 6 months in participants at high risk of developing the disease. Patients diagnosed in early stages of HCC are eligible for potentially curative therapy; therefore, early diagnosis and accurate staging are critical for patient outcomes. Curative-intent therapies for HCC include surgical resection, liver transplantation, microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), respectively—in case of small tumors [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent level 1 data for ablative stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) demonstrated non-inferiority compared to radiofrequency ablation for small HCC lesions, suggesting an emerging curative role for this modality [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Imaging of HCC at diagnosis is challenging and exacerbated after local treatment because it can be confounded by coagulative necrosis, hematomas, abscesses, and fluid or bile collections [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Standard of care imaging modalities used routinely in the diagnosis of HCC are ultrasound (with or without contrast), multiphasic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each method has its shortcomings, the major one being the lack of correlation between radiologic appearance and biologic activity. Furthermore, imaging of liver lesions in patients with concomitant liver cirrhosis is complex and challenging. The cirrhotic liver acquires a nodular architecture with altered vascularity, making it difficult to differentiate regenerative nodules from early HCC or metastases from other primary tumors. The challenge is exacerbated in patients who undergo ablative (RFA, MWA, SBRT) or transarterial radio-, chemo-, or bland embolization (TARE, TACE, TAE) therapies for known HCC lesions.</p>
                  <p>Hence, there is a need for an imaging modality that can be used to localize and characterize HCC tumors more accurately. To date, functional imaging with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has not played a major role in the diagnosis or surveillance of HCC. The most commonly used PET tracer, F-18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG), is not routinely used in HCC because only a minority of tumors show FDG avidity [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and its sensitivity (&lt; 50%) for detection of HCC tumors is inferior to CT alone [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other PET tracers have been tested in HCC, however, results have been mixed and none have been routinely used clinically [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

                <sec id="sec008">
                  <title>Value of PSMA PET/CT in staging and therapy monitoring of HCC</title>
                  <p>Several PET radiotracers, including small molecule inhibitors targeting the PSMA receptor have been developed to facilitate the diagnosis of prostate cancer in humans [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PSMA PET/CT imaging with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 and <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL are such tracers approved for imaging patients with prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Notably, PSMA expression has been demonstrated on other malignant cell lines and tumor-associated neovasculature. According to two reports, more than 90% of hepatocellular cancers stain positive for PSMA in the tumor vasculature [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Zhu et al. suggested that the process of endothelial cell recruitment to HCC occurs early and throughout the process of hepatic tumorigenesis, making an endothelial cell tracer an ideal marker for early disease detection [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In another study assessing 103 HCC tissue samples using immunohistochemical staining, Jiao and collaborators reported PSMA expression in more than 74% of tumor vasculature [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Authors found that high vascular PSMA expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC, which could serve as an independent prognostic marker for HCC [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Tolkach et al. found that the majority of hepatocellular carcinomas show high levels of PSMA expression on the tumor neovasculature (89.9% of tumors) and on canalicular membrane of the tumor cells (41.1% of the tumors) [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
                  <p>To date, most publications involving PSMA-targeted PET radiotracers in HCC have been of case reports and small cohort studies [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In a small cohort study (n = 7), Kesler et al. showed superiority of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA PET over <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET-CT in imaging newly diagnosed HCC [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; all tumors, except for one lesion showed abnormal <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA uptake higher than that of the surrounding liver parenchyma, with a mean uptake 3.6 times higher than the normal surrounding liver background. The increased <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA uptake in HCC was corroborated by the results of immunohistochemistry analysis showing PSMA staining of the endothelial cell lining of vessels that are penetrated by tumor. Furthermore, <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA PET appeared to differentiate necrotic from viable tumor, which could dramatically improve detection of HCC recurrence following local ablative therapies [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In another study, Kuyumcu et al. were able to visualize advanced HCC using <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in 16 out of 19 cases with high tumor-to-background ratio [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hirmas et al. compared <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 PET and CT accuracy for HCC lesion detection and assessed the impact of PSMA PET on management and prognosis in 40 patients. Investigations found comparable accuracy between <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 PET and CT for staging at the liver level, with superior performance for <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 PET at the extrahepatic level. PSMA PET/CT accuracy was associated with change in management, particularly in patients with advanced disease, leading to a shift toward systemic therapy [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A recent prospective study on 15 patients with HCC reported improved lesion detection with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT compared with conventional imaging and a subsequent impact on treatment strategies [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The largest prospective study to date was performed by Thompson et al., which first assessed PSMA staining of both cholangiocarcinoma and HCC specimens and PET imaging with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This study showed that 91% of HCC exhibited positive PSMA staining, and 64% of suspected HCC lesions exhibited <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 tracer uptake (39 lesions in 31 patients). Because only 7 patients underwent both pathologic confirmation and PSMA imaging, the discrepant results may reflect differences of PSMA expression, non-HCC diagnoses, or both.</p>
                  <p>Few direct comparisons between <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL and <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET have been reported in prostate cancer populations. Dietlein et al. reported comparable biodistributions for both tracers, but slightly higher sensitivity for <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL compared to <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 (88% vs 66%) in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Although we live in the era of precision oncology, currently, there are no tumor- or tumor microenvironment-targeted therapeutic agents for HCC. <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL could be the functional imaging agent urgently needed in the clinic and it is being evaluated in our Functional Imaging of Liver Cancer (FLIC) National Cancer Institute study (NCT05009979), at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota (NCT04310540 and <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04762888" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04762888</ext-link>), at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia (NCT05095519) and at Wuhan Union Hospital, China (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05006326" ext-link-type="uri">NCT05006326</ext-link>).</p>
                  <p>Notably, if PSMA PET imaging, indeed, serves as useful for HCC, we could deploy therapeutic PSMA-specific ligands either intravenously, or perhaps trans-arterially, in line with the “theranostics” approach, which employs molecular imaging to guide molecularly directed radiopharmaceutical therapy.</p>

                <title>Rationale for study design and hypothesis</title>
                <p>The overall study design is shown in <xref rid="pone.0277407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. While PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancers, it is also present on the tumor neovasculature, and in other malignancies, including up to 95% of HCC [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, high PSMA expression was detected in HCC tissue whereas PSMA expression in normal liver tissue ranged from negative to weak (<xref rid="pone.0277407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Functional imaging of HCC would be incredibly valuable, not only for diagnosis of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> disease, but also for identifying recurrences. <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL, a second generation PSMA imaging agent, has been approved by the FDA for use in men with prostate cancer, and we posit that it may serve as a useful functional imaging agent for patients with HCC [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>This is an open-label multi-site imaging study recruiting participants with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (at least one detectable liver lesion visible on standard of care CT and/or MRI), who are eligible to undergo local treatment (e.g., surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, transarterial embolization (TAE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)). Participants will be consented and enroll through the NIH Clinical Center. The protocol and its amendments have been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA. Clinical Trial registration: NIH IND#133631; NIH IRB #00080. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05009979. IRB committee approval: 02/15/2022 (see full protocol and letter confirming funding in the supporting documents).</p>
                <p>All participants will undergo a baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT. Each PET/CT scan will be performed approximately within 2 weeks, with minimum of a day apart from each other. A CT and/or MRI will be performed within 2 months of the <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan. Clinical scans performed in that time frame by local providers will also be acceptable.</p>
                <p>Participants will undergo a biopsy prior to local therapy. For patients undergoing resection, the surgical specimen will suffice. The procedure may be performed at the NIH Clinical Center or at other participating sites.</p>
                <p>Additional <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging will be performed during the first routine follow-up (2–3 months post local therapy) for participants with a positive baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT (i.e. the presence of DCFPyL-avid tumor/s) and with a biopsy confirming HCC diagnosis. Subjects with negative tumor uptake at the baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT, and with a histopathology confirming HCC, will not undergo post-treatment imaging, but will remain in follow-up. Subjects with biopsies negative for HCC will be taken off protocol. Subjects with a histopathologically confirmed HCC will be followed by clinical chart review, phone-call, email follow-up or any other NIH-approved remote platform for tumor markers and radiologic evidence of recurrence over a 5-years period from the last <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging. A set of imaging (<sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT, CT/MRI) may be performed at the time of tumor recurrence per PI discretion. If participants undergo another treatment during the follow up period, a biopsy may be performed per PI discretion.</p>

                  <p><sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT will be used to identify positive suspected sites, which will be correlated with histopathology results. For lesions within the liver, a focal abnormal area of increased <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL activity higher than the surrounding liver uptake, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) greater than 1.2 times the normal liver SUV mean will be considered positive. For lesions outside the liver, a positive lesion will be defined as focal abnormal uptake higher than the blood pool, or the surrounding soft tissue or normal organ background. Pathological anatomic imaging lacking DCFPyL uptake would indicate a type of tumor that fails to express PSMA. The performance of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT is assessed by the positive predictive value, which is defined as the proportion of histopathology positive lesions.</p>
                  <p>Images will be analyzed by identifying, recording, and measuring measurable target lesions. A segmentation tool will be applied to generate a semi-automated volume of interest (VOI) within the target lesion(s). SUV<sub>max</sub> and tumor volumes will be extracted from the generated target lesion(s) VOIs. All the other lesions or sites of disease including any measurable lesions will be identified as non-target lesions and will be recorded.</p>
                  <p>To determine whether uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL correlates with response to therapy, target tumor(s) imaging PET parameters, including SUV<sub>max</sub> and tumor volume will be compared between responders and non-responders.

                  <title>Analysis of extracellular vesicles and particles</title>
                  <p>Blood and urine samples will be used for analysis of extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs). Specifically, we are most interested in measuring the concentration and composition of the EVPs that are PSMA<sup>+</sup> across the samples, as related to PSMA detection on imaging and in response to treatment. We have identified robust methods for detecting and isolating PSMA<sup>+</sup> EVPs, and then evaluating co-expressed proteins and nucleic acids associated with those EVPs. EVPs in general will be processed and evaluated according to our published protocols (<ext-link xlink:href="https://nano.ccr.cancer.gov" ext-link-type="uri">nano.ccr.cancer.gov</ext-link>), with PSMA<sup>+</sup> EVPs enriched by immunoaffinity from cell-free blood and urine samples. Our hypothesis is that the molecular cargo and composition of the PSMA+ EVPs in liquid biopsies (i.e., accessible in blood and urine samples) may correlate with 1) imaging extent of PSMA detection, 2) additional histopathologic features identified in the targeted biopsies in the study, and 3) the biological/clinical course of PSMA<sup>+</sup> foci, followed over time.</p>

Vital signs will be taken prior to injection of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL and following completion of the final PET/CT scan (+ 15 minutes). 3. Acute care panel: sodium, potassium, chloride, total CO2, creatinine, glucose, urea nitrogen, eGFR 4. For female participants of childbearing age (in the absence of prior hysterectomy). Pregnancy tests may be performed as clinically indicated prior to each scan. 5. CT (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis) and/or MRI (Abdomen) will be performed within 2 months of each <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Imaging may be performed at certified outside facility and provided to study team. 6. Subjects will undergo <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL injection and a dynamic PET/CT. Approximately 1 hour (+/- 10 minutes) post <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL injection, a static PET/CT imaging performed. Refer to section 3.2.2 for additional information regarding the scanning procedure. 7. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT will be performed within approximately 2 weeks before or after each <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL scan. Each PET/CT imaging must be approximately a day apart. The order obtained for <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT does not matter. 8. Event monitoring will be done at the time of injection, and 1 hour post injection. All subjects will be contacted by phone at ~1–3 business days post-injection and will be asked non-leading questions regarding symptoms. At the investigator’s discretion, subjects with safety concerns noted during the post injection period may remain at the site or be asked to return to the site to undergo further safety assessments at the 1–3 business day follow-up time point. 9. Tumor markers include Alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) and liver function tests (Alkaline Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin). Refer to section 5.1 for more details. 10. Only participants with a positive baseline <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL-PET/CT scan (i.e. with the presence of DCFPyL-avid tumor/s) and a biopsy confirming HCC diagnosis will undergo visit 2 for a second <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT (during routine treatment follow up, typically within 4–8 weeks). 11.

              <p>While conventional imaging and the use of LIRADS represents the gold standard for the initial diagnosis of HCC, challenges remain in the recurrent setting. A functional imaging agent that can be used in patients who have received local treatments could significantly help in clinical decision-making (e.g. surveillance, treatment planning). Furthermore, such an agent could provide additional utility for <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> disease, potentially differentiating between high risk versus low risk LR3 or LR4 lesions. While bespoke tumor-selective functional imaging agents for HCC remain years away, repurposing existing agents is immediately evaluable.</p>
              <p>PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancers, yet is also present on the tumor neovasculature, and in other malignancies, including HCC. <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL, a second generation <sup>18</sup>F-labeled PSMA imaging agent, has been approved for use in men with prostate cancer by the FDA, and we posit that it may serve as a useful functional imaging agent for patients with HCC.</p>
              <p>Our phase II prospective multisite trial designed to determine whether PSMA PET/CT imaging can detect tumor sites and assess treatment response in patients with histopathologically-confirmed HCC receiving local therapy. In conjunction, we will explore several correlative studies to help identify biomarkers associated with response and recurrence.</p>
              <p>If successful, results from our trial may yield a strategy to identify, characterize, and monitor treatment response for HCC with higher fidelity than conventional methods in the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> and recurrent settings. Furthermore, findings could open the possibility of tumor-selective therapy with PSMA-directed therapeutics, including the beta and alpha emitting radiopharmaceuticals administered intravenously or transarterially [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Notably, transarterial administration of radiopharmaceuticals with <sup>90</sup>Y-labeled microspheres is FDA-approved for patients with unresectable HCC ≤ 8 cm [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and personalized dosimetry with this modality appears to augment treatment response [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. PSMA-selective radiopharmaceuticals could be similarly implemented in locally advanced HCC, and, unlike other liver directed therapies could also be administered intravenously in the metastatic setting as well. There is a precedent for systemic radiopharmaceutical therapy for HCC with the CD147-targeting <sup>131</sup>I-metuximab that has shown promising efficacy in a phase II study, warranting confirmatory definitive phase III studies [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Similarly, <sup>131</sup>I-metuximab has been successfully used combined with TACE for unresectable HCC with improved overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This approach may complement existing systemic therapy options [<xref rid="pone.0277407.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277407.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>In summary, functional imaging could facilitate diagnosis and surveillance of HCC for clinical decision-making. Given PSMA-expression in HCC and its vasculature, <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL could help fill this unmet need and our trial (NCT05009979), which is now recruiting, along with others in Mayo Clinic <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04310540" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04310540</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04762888" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04762888</ext-link>), in Australia (NCT05095519) and China (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05006326" ext-link-type="uri">NCT05006326</ext-link>), aims to answer this question.</p>
