                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Women with HIV face an increased risk of preterm birth. 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) has been shown in some trials to reduce early delivery among women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth. We investigated whether 17P would reduce this risk among women with HIV.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pregnant women with HIV at the University Teaching Hospital and Kamwala District Health Centre in Lusaka, Zambia. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older with confirmed HIV-1 infection, viable intrauterine singleton pregnancy at less than 24 weeks of gestation, and were receiving or intending to commence antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were major uterine or fetal anomaly; planned or in situ cervical cerclage; evidence of threatened miscarriage, preterm labour, or ruptured membranes at screening; medical contraindication to 17P; previous participation in the trial; or history of spontaneous preterm birth. Eligible participants provided written informed consent and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 250 mg intramuscular 17P or placebo once per week, starting between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation until delivery, stillbirth, or reaching term (37 weeks). Participants and study staff were masked to assignment, except for pharmacy staff who did random assignment and prepared injections but did not interact with participants. The primary outcome was a composite of delivery before 37 weeks or stillbirth at any gestational age. Patients attended weekly visits for study drug injections and antenatal care. We estimated the absolute and relative difference in risk of the primary outcome and safety events between treatment groups by intention to treat. This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03297216" id="interrefs20">NCT03297216</ext-link>, and is complete.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 7, 2018 and Jan 13, 2020, we assessed 1042 women for inclusion into the study. 242 women were excluded after additional assessments, and 800 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intramuscular 17P (n=399) or placebo (n=401). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Adherence to study drug injections was 98% in both groups, no patients were lost to follow-up, and the final post-partum visit was on Aug 6, 2020. 36 (9%) of 399 participants assigned to 17P had preterm birth or stillbirth, compared with 36 (9%) of 401 patients assigned to placebo (risk difference 0·1, 95% CI −3·9 to 4·0; relative risk 1·0, 95% CI 0·6 to 1·6; p=0·98). Intervention-related adverse events were reported by 140 (18%) of 800 participants and occurred in similar proportions in both randomisation groups. No serious adverse events were reported.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Although 17P seems to be safe and acceptable to participants, available data do not support the use of the drug to prevent preterm birth among women whose risk derives solely from HIV infection. The low risk of preterm birth in both randomisation groups warrants further investigation.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">Maternal HIV infection is strongly associated with preterm birth. A 2013 Cochrane Review reported that antenatal 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) reduces the risk of recurrent preterm birth among women who had a previous spontaneous preterm birth of a singleton infant. 17P is often prescribed in North America and parts of Europe for this indication. However, in a nine-country confirmatory trial mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration, 17P was not effective for prevention of recurrent preterm birth. We did a search of the published literature in PubMed and MEDLINE using the terms “HIV”, “preterm”, “prematurity”, and “17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate” or “17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate” or “17P” or “progesterone”. The search was limited to randomised trials published between database inception and May 7, 2016. We found no trials of 17P in pregnant women living with HIV. The search was updated on Dec 30, 2020, and no additional trials were identified.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, ours is the first phase 3 randomised trial of antenatal progesterone supplementation to prevent preterm birth among women living with HIV, and the second largest trial of 17P for any indication. In this study, weekly 17P did not reduce the composite risk of preterm birth or stillbirth in women with confirmed HIV infection and no history of preterm birth. Very high adherence to study product and complete ascertainment of the primary outcome underscore the reliability of these conclusions.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Although 17P seems to be safe and acceptable to participants, available data do not support the use of the drug to prevent preterm birth among women whose risk derives solely from HIV infection. Whether 17P is effective among women with HIV and previous spontaneous preterm birth remains unknown. As new preventive interventions are introduced, efficacy trials among women with HIV and those living in sub-Saharan Africa are crucial.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="para110">The Improving Pregnancy Outcomes with Progesterone (IPOP) study is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at the University Teaching Hospital and Kamwala District Health Centre in Lusaka, Zambia. This study protocol<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> was approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board (reference 17-1173), the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (reference 015-06-17), the Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority (reference CT-070), and the Zambia National Health Research Authority (reference MH/101/23/10/1) before initiation. An external monitor did quarterly visits to trial sites to ensure that the study was done, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice, and US 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46 requirements. This study was designed and implemented following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement and the Standards for Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials. Participants were reimbursed for their time and transportation costs.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="para120">Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older with confirmed HIV-1 infection, viable intrauterine singleton pregnancy at less than 24 weeks of gestation, were receiving or intending to commence ART in pregnancy, were able to provide written informed consent, intended to remain in Lusaka for the duration of the study, and were willing to adhere to the study visit schedule. We excluded women with known uterine anomaly; planned or in situ cervical cerclage; known major fetal anomaly; indication for planned delivery at less than 37 weeks; evidence of threatened miscarriage, preterm labour, or ruptured membranes; contraindication to 17P as listed in the prescribing information; previous participation in the trial; and any other condition that would make trial participation unsafe or complicate data interpretation. We also excluded women with a previous spontaneous preterm delivery because, at the time of study planning, these women would have been eligible to receive 17P for that indication. Recruitment activity included community sensitisation to encourage interest in the trial and early antenatal care presentation, and antenatal health talks at the recruitment clinics. Study staff identified potential participants attending antenatal care before 24 weeks of gestation. Patients completed written informed consent in English, Nyanja, or Bemba.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para130">Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 17P or placebo manufactured to be indistinguishable from the active drug but containing only the excipients castor oil, benzyl benzoate, and benzyl alcohol. A statistician from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research not otherwise associated with the study created the randomisation scheme using random permuted blocks. Participants and study staff were masked to randomisation group, except for pharmacy staff, who did the random assignments using a web-based tool and prepared injections but did not interact with participants. Electronic records of random assignment were kept on this password-protected, web-based tool. Paper documentation of random assignment and allocation of study product were kept in locked filing cabinets within the locked pharmacy, accessible only to unmasked pharmacy staff.</p>

                <p id="para140">Detailed study procedures have been published previously.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Potentially eligible women received ultrasonography for gestational age determination and, for women between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation, cervical length by transvaginal ultrasound. Study staff then verified antenatal and HIV history data by baseline questionnaire and did a review of medical records, physical examination, and point of care screening procedures. We tested all participants for HIV at the screening visit and confirmed all positive cases with the SD Bioline 3.0 test (SD Biostandard Diagnostics, Gurgaon, India). We drew maternal venous samples to assess HIV plasma viral load (Gene Xpert HIV-1 assay; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and CD4 cell count (Cytomics FC500 Flow Cytometer; Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Brea, CA, USA). Eligible participants returned to the research clinic between 16 and 24 gestational weeks for random assignment and initiation of study drug (intramuscular 17P 250 mg [1 mL] once per week) or placebo. Thereafter, participants attended weekly visits for study drug injections and antenatal care. Study drug was discontinued once the participant reached 37 weeks or had the primary outcome. Both 17P and placebo were donated by AMAG Pharmaceuticals (Waltham, MA, USA) who had no other role in the study.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para150">The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth (delivery occurring after random assignment and before 37 gestational weeks) or stillbirth (fetal death diagnosed before delivery or delivery of a neonate without signs of life). Secondary outcomes were spontaneous delivery before 37 gestational weeks, delivery before 34 weeks or 28 weeks, infant birthweight below the 10th percentile or below the 3rd percentile for gestational age, mother-to-child HIV transmission, neonatal and perinatal mortality rates, and infant Apgar scores. Safety outcomes were assessed and documented at each participant contact. These outcomes included death (maternal, fetal, or neonatal), drug-related reactions, birthweight less than 2500 g or 1500 g, maternal inflammation or immune activation, alterations of the vaginal microbiome, infant morbidity, and serious adverse events or events that resulted in study discontinuation. Study staff obtained interval information about the maternal and neonatal clinical course through medical record review, direct assessment, and participant self-report at delivery and again at a clinic visit 6 weeks after delivery. Infant HIV infection was assessed by viral load assay (Gene Xpert HIV-1 Qual assay; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) of heel-prick dried blood spot specimens obtained at 6 weeks of life.</p>

                <p id="para160">We estimated<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> that 17P would reduce the primary outcome by 38%<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> (from 24% to 15%) with up to 15% loss to follow-up. We therefore intended to recruit 400 women per group to provide 80% statistical power based on a two-sided Fisher's exact test with significance of 0·05.</p>
                <p id="para170">All participants were analysed according to their randomised group (ie, intention to treat). For primary and secondary analyses, we estimated the absolute risk, difference in risk, and relative risk (RR) of each outcome, with Wald-type 95% CIs. We planned to use the Kaplan-Meier method to account for right censoring, but this was not required because of complete follow-up. We report the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome by randomised group as a function of time from random assignment; term livebirths remained in the risk set for this analysis and were treated as competing events. Reported p values are from two-sided χ<sup>2</sup> tests (Gray's test when comparing cumulative incidence curves).</p>

              <p id="para210">Between Feb 7, 2018, and Jan 13, 2020, we identified 1042 women as potentially eligible for the study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). 800 eligible patients (429 from University Teaching Hospital and 371 from Kamwala District Health Centre) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intramuscular 17P (n=399) or placebo (n=401). No patients were lost to follow-up, and the final post-partum visit was on Aug 6, 2020. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Of 594 participants who entered antenatal care with a known HIV diagnosis, 584 (98%) had initiated ART before conception. The remaining 216 participants started ART during pregnancy. 365 (46%) of 800 participants had detectable virus at baseline. In these patients, mean viral load was 1270 copies per mL (IQR 188–21 900). 405 (69%) of 584 women who had started treatment before pregnancy had undetectable viral load at baseline. Median CD4 count among all participants was 568 cells per μL (IQR 367–765), and 50 (6%) had CD4 counts less than 200 cells per μL. Most participants received tenofovir, emtricitabine, and either efavirenz (n=759; 95%) or nevirapine (n=11; 1%). 24 (3%) received a protease inhibitor-containing regimen, and the remaining 1% were on another regimen.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>17P=17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="left"><bold>17P (n=399)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Placebo (n=401)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Median age, years</td><td align="left">29 (25–33)</td><td align="left">30 (25–34)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Body-mass index, kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td align="left">25·4 (22·7–28·4)</td><td align="left">25·3 (22·9–29·0)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&lt;18·5</td><td align="left">6 (2%)</td><td align="left">6 (2%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">18·5–30</td><td align="left">321 (80%)</td><td align="left">322 (80%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&gt;30</td><td align="left">72 (18%)</td><td align="left">73 (18%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Parous</td><td align="left">323 (81%)</td><td align="left">320 (80%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Previous stillbirth</td><td align="left">14 (4%)</td><td align="left">8 (3%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Gestational age at screening, weeks</td><td align="left">18·7 (15·6–21·1)</td><td align="left">17·9 (15·3–20·7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Gestational age at random assignment, weeks</td><td align="left">19·3 (16·9–21·6)</td><td align="left">18·7 (16·7–21·3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Transvaginal cervical length, cm</td><td align="left">4·1 (3·5–4·6)</td><td align="left">4·0 (3·6–4·6)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Short cervix (&lt;2·5 cm)</td><td align="left">1 (&lt;1%)</td><td align="left">3 (1%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">ART initiation</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Before pregnancy</td><td align="left">295 (74%)</td><td align="left">289 (72%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">During pregnancy</td><td align="left">104 (26%)</td><td align="left">112 (28%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Viral load undetectable</td><td align="left">218 (55%)</td><td align="left">217 (54%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Viral load among detectable, copies per mL</td><td align="left">1470 (188–27 000), n=181</td><td align="left">905 (191–20 850), n=184</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">CD4 count, cells per μL</td><td align="left">582 (364–750)</td><td align="left">550 (370–778)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&lt;200</td><td align="left">23 (6%)</td><td align="left">27 (7%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Syphilis in pregnancy</td><td align="left">60 (15%)</td><td align="left">61 (15%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Bacteriuria<xref rid="tbl1fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></td><td align="left">48 (12%)</td><td align="left">46 (11%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Haemoglobin, g/dL</td><td align="left">12·2 (11·1–13·3)</td><td align="left">12·1 (11·0–13·1)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&lt;11</td><td align="left">39 (10%)</td><td align="left">44 (11%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Education, years</td><td align="left">9 (7–12)</td><td align="left">9 (7–12)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Did not complete primary</td><td align="left">138 (35%)</td><td align="left">149 (37%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Marital status</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Neither married nor cohabiting with partner</td><td align="left">60 (15%)</td><td align="left">66 (16%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Married or cohabiting with partner</td><td align="left">339 (85%)</td><td align="left">335 (84%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Alcohol use during pregnancy<xref rid="tbl1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td><td align="left">43/398 (11%)</td><td align="left">35/401 (9%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Tobacco use during pregnancy</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are n (%), median (IQR), or n/N (%). 17P=17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para270">In this trial, weekly injections of 17P initiated between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation did not reduce the risk of preterm delivery or stillbirth in women with HIV and no history of spontaneous preterm birth. We observed no effect on more severe definitions of prematurity, no effect among nulliparous women, and no effect among women who began weekly injections before 20 weeks of gestation. By contrast with some reports,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> women who started ART before pregnancy had a risk of preterm birth or stillbirth similar to that of women who initiated treatment during pregnancy, and no effect of 17P was observed in either of these subgroups. Adverse events, including drug-related reactions, were similar between randomisation groups, except for a reduced risk of infants very small for gestational age at birth in patients who received 17P.</p>
              <p id="para280">The biological mechanisms that drive the elevated risk of adverse birth outcomes in women living with HIV have not been definitively established, but growing evidence implicates inflammation, immune activation, and altered placental angiogenesis.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We hypothesised that HIV-related preterm birth and stillbirth might be ameliorated by the broad anti-inflammatory effects of progestogen supplementation,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> but instead found a remarkably similar frequency of these outcomes between treatment groups. We also did not observe a benefit of 17P in a secondary analysis limited to preterm deliveries that occurred spontaneously (the phenotype that is frequently associated with inflammation<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>).</p>
              <p id="para290">In a 2003 trial by Meis and colleagues in the USA,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> weekly 17P injections reduced the risk of recurrent preterm delivery, a finding supported by a subsequent meta-analysis that included additional smaller trials.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Since then, 17P has been used routinely for this indication in North America and parts of Europe. However, the PROLONG trial<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> (which was larger than Meis and colleagues' trial and of similar design but enrolled women at markedly lower risk of preterm delivery) found no benefit of 17P. In response to the findings of PROLONG, a mandated confirmatory trial, a US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recommended approval of 17P be withdrawn for prevention of recurrent preterm birth.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Despite this recommendation, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine continue to support the use of 17P to prevent recurrent preterm birth, particularly among patients at very high risk in the USA.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
              <p id="para300">The overall frequency of preterm birth or stillbirth in the current study was substantially lower than regional estimates<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and among the lowest ever reported among women living with HIV.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> One reason for this is the exclusion of women with previous spontaneous preterm delivery, and the resultant high proportion of parous women with previous term deliveries. The low overall risk of preterm birth and stillbirth in our trial might also be partly attributed to differences in HIV disease severity, immune suppression, or ART use compared with earlier reports. However, two contemporaneous cohorts drawn from the same patient population in Lusaka reported substantially higher rates of this composite outcome,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> a finding that persisted even after applying the IPOP trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria (data not shown). One important way that the IPOP trial differs from these studies is in its weekly visit schedule. Each participant's appointments occurred on the same day each week, such that an inadvertent group care model arose in which women assembled and underwent group counselling with the same cohort throughout their pregnancy. Some trials of group-based antenatal care have reported improved perinatal outcomes in high-income settings,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and increased antenatal attendance, facility delivery, and postnatal service use in sub-Saharan Africa.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para310">This trial supports the safety of 17P administration during pregnancy. Adverse drug reactions occurred equally between women randomly assigned to active and placebo study product, and overall incidence was consistent with previous trials of 17P in pregnancy.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The finding of a reduction in risk of small for gestational age among infants born to women randomly assigned to 17P warrants further investigation, particularly when taken in the context of findings from mouse models, in which progesterone improved ART-related placental vascular abnormalities.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Finally, only two infants in the trial were diagnosed with HIV at the final 6-week visit (one in each randomisation group), which supports the efficacy of ART to prevent perinatal transmission and provides reassurance that 17P does not promote it.</p>
              <p id="para320">We acknowledge several limitations of this trial. First, almost all our participants received tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz for treatment of their HIV infection. This combination remains the most common treatment prescribed to Zambian adults but is likely to be replaced over time by dolutegravir-containing regimens. The IMPAACT 2010 trial<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> found a lower composite risk of early pregnancy loss, stillbirth, preterm delivery, or small for gestational age among women newly starting a combination of dolutegravir, tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, and efavirenz in pregnancy compared with those newly starting the regimen used in our trial (24·1% <italic>vs</italic> 32·7%, p=0·047). Therefore, our findings might not be generalisable if dolutegravir replaces efavirenz as first line treatment. Second, we designed this study to be relevant to our local context, where women present to care later in pregnancy. Thus, some women began the 17P intervention later in gestation than in other trials.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We note that restricting the analysis to women who were randomly assigned before 20 weeks did not affect our results (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Third, our sample size was based on an event rate higher than observed, such that the estimated difference between treatment groups is less precise than planned. However, the risk of the primary outcome was similar in both groups, and the 95% CI suggests a difference larger than 4% is unlikely.</p>
              <p id="para330">Administration of weekly 17P did not reduce the risk of preterm birth or stillbirth among Zambian women with HIV and no previous spontaneous preterm birth. A low risk of preterm birth in both randomisation groups could have resulted from other participant characteristics or trial procedures unrelated to the intervention.</p>
