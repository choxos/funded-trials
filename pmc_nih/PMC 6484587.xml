Follow-up analysis of a single-blind randomized trial conducted in community settings of
7 urban and suburban cities in Oregon from February 20, 2015, to September 15, 2018,
compared a therapeutic <italic>tai ji quan</italic> intervention with multimodal
exercise and stretching exercise. Eligible participants were community-dwelling adults
aged at least 70 years who were considered by a clinician to be at high risk of falling
because they had fallen during the preceding year or who had impaired mobility with
scores higher than 13.5 seconds on the Timed Up &amp; Go test. Participants were
randomized to 1 of the 3 interventions and were assessed monthly after randomization for
12 months, encompassing a 6-month active intervention phase and a 6-month after
intervention follow-up phase.</p>

for moderate injurious falls was lower in the TJQMBB (IRR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35-0.74;
<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and multimodal exercise (IRR, 0.62; 95% CI,

exercise group. There was no difference between TJQMBB and multimodal exercise groups
(IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.58-1.25; <italic>P</italic> = .42). Both TJQMBB and
multimodal exercise significantly reduced serious injurious falls (TJQMBB: IRR, 0.25

[95% CI, 0.33-0.94; <italic>P</italic> = .03]) compared with stretching
exercise. Use of TJQMBB was more effective than multimodal exercise (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI,

falls.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Falls among older adults are a major cause of injury morbidity that can require medical
treatment or lead to death.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The
significance of the problem is exemplified by the 30% increase in the mortality rate between
2007 and 2016 for older adults who fell.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Treatment for fall-related injuries among older adults is
costly.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In
2015, the total medical costs for falls in this population in the United States was more
than $50 billion.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Therefore,
preventing injurious falls has become a public health priority and is of critical importance
for health care systems contending with the financial burden associated with fall-related
injuries among older adults.</p>
              <p>Many falls resulting in medical treatment can be prevented and the associated costs averted
through community-based balance-training interventions.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Increasing evidence suggests that exercise
interventions reduce the incidence of falls and injurious falls among older adults<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and are, therefore, recommended for older adults with
a high risk of falling.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, it is less clear which
interventions are most effective in reducing injurious falls without exacerbating the risk
in some individuals.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Evidence is
also scarce as to whether interventions with intermediate effects can reduce the long-term
(postintervention) risk of injurious falls.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> All of these issues can impede the prescribing of exercise-based fall
prevention interventions in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>A recent 6-month randomized clinical trial<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (trial protocol is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI180338-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>) showed that both a therapeutically based
<italic>tai ji quan</italic> program and a multimodal exercise intervention significantly
reduced the incidence of falls among older adults at high risk of falling. The study,
however, did not examine whether the incidence of injurious falls was affected. Using data
from the 6-month intervention and a 6-month follow-up of this clinical trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> we aimed to determine the longer-term
postintervention effect of 2 exercise interventions, <italic>Tai Ji Quan</italic>: Moving
for Better Balance (TJQMBB) and a multimodal exercise program compared with a stretching
exercise intervention with the incidence of injurious falls in older adults at high risk of
falling. Our predefined hypotheses were that, at follow-up, we would find sustained effects
of TJQMBB and multimodal exercise with reductions in injurious falls, with a stronger effect
anticipated from TJQMBB.</p>

                <p>This study was a follow-up analysis of a single-blind, 6-month randomized clinical trial
in which participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 active arms: TJQMBB, multimodal
exercise, or a stretching exercise control. After completing the 6-month active
intervention, participants were followed up for 6 months after intervention, during which
no structured activities were prescribed. Details of the trial design, eligibility
requirements, randomization procedures, and exercise training protocols have been
described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Written
informed consent was received from all participants, and the trial was approved by the
institutional review board of the Oregon Research Institute, Eugene, Oregon, and overseen
by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board appointed by the National Institute of Aging. Study
recruitment lasted from February 20, 2015, to August 29, 2017, with the final study
follow-up completed on September 15, 2018. The current study was conducted in community
settings across 7 urban and suburban cities in Oregon and followed the Consolidated

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p><italic>Tai Ji Quan</italic>: Moving for Better Balance involved practice of a core of 8
modified <italic>tai ji quan</italic> exercise forms with built-in variations and a
subroutine of integrated therapeutic movement exercises.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The practice emphasized synchronized breathing and
exercise forms performed with weight shifting, unilateral weight bearing,
head-shoulder-trunk alignment and rotation, and coordinated eye-head-hand movements with
integration of self-initiated (proactive) and self-induced (reactive) movement
perturbations. The multimodal exercise intervention, modified from a previous
study,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> involved a mix of
aerobic conditioning and strength, balance, and flexibility activities. Strength exercises
included the use of hand weights, resistance tubing, and ankle weights; balance exercises
included balance foams. All equipment was added in the past 3 months of the multimodal
intervention. Modifications were made on an individual basis in both TJQMBB and multimodal
exercise to accommodate the specific needs and performance capabilities of the
participants. The stretching exercise, serving as an exercise control, consisted primarily
of breathing, stretching, and relaxation activities, with most performed in a seated
position. The full protocol for each of the 3 interventions is described
elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>

of 10 to 15 minutes of warm-up exercises, 40 to 45 minutes of core exercises, and 5
minutes of cool-down activities. No additional in-home or between-session exercises were

                <p>After completing the active intervention, participants were followed up for 6 months,
during which they were given no specific instructions about exercise but were encouraged
to continue to exercise in any form. Participant levels of weekly physical activity were
monitored using a home-exercise log,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> in which participants were asked to record the type, frequency, and

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome measures were the number of moderate and serious injurious falls
during the 12 months. Falls were recorded using a daily “fall
calendar”<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> in which participants were asked to
report any <italic>fall incident</italic> (defined as “when you land on the floor or
the ground or fall and hit objects like stairs or pieces of furniture by accident”).
If a fall was reported, participants were also asked to indicate whether they sought
medical attention.</p>
                <p>In this study, moderate injurious falls were defined as those that resulted in sprains,
strains, contusions, or abrasions requiring no medical care. Serious injurious falls were
those that resulted in admission to an emergency department or hospital. The initial
sources of any injurious falls ascertainment were the fall calendar completed by the study
participants and monthly phone contacts by study assessors. Information about each type of
medical visit (hospital or emergency department) was verified, when possible, by
health-related utilization expenses and/or medical records obtained from participants
collected at 4, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the number of fall-related
emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Data on injurious falls were collected
starting from the date of the first intervention class and continuing until 12 months
later (ie, the last day of the study enrollment) or until a participant withdrew, died, or
was lost to follow-up.</p>
                <p>Baseline demographic measures, including age, sex, educational level, race/ethnicity,
number of falls in the 6 months before intervention, resting blood pressure, and health
status were collected.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The original study<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> was
powered with a sample size of 666 (including a planned 15% attrition rate) to detect a 35%
reduction in fall incidence rate across a 6-month active intervention period between
either of the 2 interventions (TJQMBB or multimodal exercise) compared with stretching
exercise. Although no a priori sample size calculations for this follow-up study were
conducted, on the basis of preliminary estimates obtained from a previous trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> we conservatively estimated a 30%
reduction in moderate injurious falls and a 20% reduction in serious injurious falls for
TJQMBB and multimodal exercise compared with stretching exercise. No specific prediction
on reducing injurious falls was made between TJQMBB and multimodal exercise.</p>
                <p>Descriptive analyses were performed among participant characteristics at baseline across
interventions. Comparisons of group characteristics at baseline were undertaken using a
χ<sup>2</sup> test for differences in proportions and analysis of variance for
differences in means. Analysis of variance was conducted to examine between-group
differences in mean change from baseline to 12 months in primary and secondary outcomes.
We also determined the rate of both moderate and serious injurious falls during 12 months,
calculated using the number of falls observed from each participant as the numerator and
their follow-up time as the denominator. In our primary analyses comparing the number of
injurious falls with both primary and secondary outcomes, we used a priori specified
negative binomial regression models to estimate absolute differences in incidence rate
ratios (IRRs) from baseline to 12 months with their corresponding 95% CIs to compare
TJQMBB and multimodal exercise with stretching exercise and TJQMBB and multimodal
exercise. As part of planned group comparisons, we conducted additional analyses to test
whether there was a difference between the injurious fall rates at the end of the 6-month
active intervention and at the 6-month postintervention follow-up between the groups.</p>
                <p>The IRRs were adjusted for important covariates (age, sex, number of falls 6 months
before the start of intervention, health status, and levels of weekly physical activity at
home ascertained at 12 months) and without these covariates. All analyses were based on
intent-to-treat and adjusted for the variable follow-up times of participants. The
significance level for the primary and secondary outcomes was
<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 (2-tailed), without adjustment for multiple
comparisons. Analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corp).</p>

statistically significant difference between the TJQMBB group and the multimodal exercise
group (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.58-1.25; <italic>P</italic> = .42). The TJQMBB and
multimodal exercise group had a lower incidence rate of serious injurious falls compared
with the stretching exercise group (TJMBB group: IRR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13-0.48;
<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001]; multimodal exercise group: 0.56 [95% CI,

in reducing serious injurious falls than multimodal exercise (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI,
0.24-0.92; <italic>P</italic> = .03). The results on serious injurious falls
were consistent across comparisons when 12 participants with no objective medical data
were removed (4 in the TJQMBB group, 3 in the multimodal exercise group, and 5 in the
stretching exercise group).</p>

              <p>Previous study findings<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> showed
that, compared with stretching exercise, a 6-month TJQMBB intervention and a multimodal
exercise intervention significantly reduced the incidence of falls among community-dwelling
older adults who were at high risk of falls. In this 12-month follow-up study, the results
showed that, although both exercise interventions were associated with a reduced incidence
of moderate and serious injurious falls compared with stretching exercise, TJQMBB was shown
to be more effective (by 53.0%) compared with the multimodal exercise intervention. The
effect of TJQMBB with reduced incidence of falls was consistent and robust, as evidenced by
the sustained reduction observed during the 6-month postintervention follow-up.</p>
              <p>Results from this study were congruent with findings from recent systematic reviews and
meta-analyses about fall prevention.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
These review studies showed that, among various common interventions, exercise compared with
usual care or controls was associated with reductions in falls and injury-related falls in
older adults who were at increased risk for falls. However, lack of a tailored exercise
approach has produced conflicting findings that have made it difficult to recommend the type
of exercise best suited for reducing injurious falls.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> To address this problem, this study provided
information regarding the comparative effectiveness of 2 different but increasingly common
types of exercise interventions (equipment nondependent vs equipment dependent or
balance-tailored vs general exercises) for reducing injurious falls among older adults who
were at high risk of falling.</p>
              <p>Few fall prevention interventions are specifically tailored toward enhancing balance and
reducing injurious falls.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> As one
of the few interventions, TJQMBB targets modifiable fall risk factors (eg, impaired balance,
reduced lower-extremity strength, diminished limits of stability, and gait abnormalities).
From an implementation perspective, as a group-based instructor-led program, TJQMBB uses a
manual-driven, progressive approach that walks participants through fundamental motor skills
related to the performance of various <italic>tai ji quan</italic> forms and
mini-therapeutic exercises.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The
program is readily implementable and scalable and easily disseminated in community
settings<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and clinical practice through patient referrals to community-based
classes,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> features that
facilitate program outreach and uptake among clinicians who provide primary care to
populations who are at high risk of falling.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Findings from this study have implications for primary care and geriatric clinicians and
individuals planning programs for improving community care of older adults at high risk of
falling by reducing their fall-related injuries. First, all study participants were
medically cleared through their clinicians, which indicates that patients who are at high
risk of falling can be recruited from health care delivery systems into community-based fall
prevention programs.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Second,
instead of exercising at a standard recommendation of 3 hours each week,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> findings from this study suggest that
referring community-dwelling older adults who have a history of falling or who have
clinically identifiable balance issues or impaired mobility (ie, Timed Up &amp; Go &gt;13.5
seconds) for participation in this non-equipment-based, therapeutically tailored, 2 hours
per week <italic>tai ji quan</italic> exercise program may have considerable influence for
preventing or reducing injurious falls. Finally, our study also suggests that although both
TJQMBB and multimodal exercise are associated with reduced incidence of injurious falls, the
former has the additional advantage of requiring few resources for program implementation
(eg, no equipment required, low costs,<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and minimal space needed), thereby enhancing return on
investment<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and
cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
              <sec id="H2-16-ZOI180338">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The study has limitations. First, moderate injurious falls were self-reported, and
although we were able to identify serious injurious falls using medical records, not all
serious falls were objectively verified. Therefore, some self-report bias likely exists in
our data. Second, the 6-month postintervention follow-up data may not be indicative of the
longer-term impact of TJQMBB or multimodal exercise with preventing injurious falls.
Because our intervention was conducted with people living in the general community, our
findings may not generalize beyond community-dwelling older adults to at-risk individuals
in residential care settings or those having specific clinical conditions.<sup><xref rid="zoi180338r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180338r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Also, our primary analysis on reducing injurious falls was not powered
a priori, which may reduce the sensitivity of the results. These findings should be
confirmed in future studies.</p>

              <p>Among community-dwelling older adults at high risk of falls, during a 1-year period, TJQMBB
compared with multimodal exercise and stretching exercise was associated with a reduced
incidence of injurious falls, including those that resulted in adults seeking medical care.
The findings strengthen the clinical utility of TJQMBB as a single exercise intervention to
prevent injurious falls in this population.</p>
