                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Real-world evaluation of the safety profile of vaccines after licensure is crucial to accurately characterise safety beyond clinical trials, support continued use, and thereby improve public confidence. The Sisonke study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine among healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Africa. Here, we present the safety data.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>In this open-label phase 3b implementation study among all eligible HCWs in South Africa registered in the national Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS), we monitored adverse events (AEs) at vaccination sites through self-reporting triggered by text messages after vaccination, healthcare provider reports, and active case finding. The frequency and incidence rate of non-serious and serious AEs were evaluated from the day of first vaccination (17 February 2021) until 28 days after the final vaccination in the study (15 June 2021). COVID-19 breakthrough infections, hospitalisations, and deaths were ascertained via linkage of the electronic vaccination register with existing national databases. Among 477,234 participants, 10,279 AEs were reported, of which 138 (1.3%) were serious AEs (SAEs) or AEs of special interest. Women reported more AEs than men (2.3% versus 1.6%). AE reports decreased with increasing age (3.2% for age 18–30 years, 2.1% for age 31–45 years, 1.8% for age 46–55 years, and 1.5% for age &gt; 55 years). Participants with previous COVID-19 infection reported slightly more AEs (2.6% versus 2.1%). The most common reactogenicity events were headache (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 4,923) and body aches (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 4,483), followed by injection site pain (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2,767) and fever (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2,731), and most occurred within 48 hours of vaccination. Two cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and 4 cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome were reported post-vaccination. Most SAEs and AEs of special interest (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 138) occurred at lower than the expected population rates. Vascular (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 37; 39.1/100,000 person-years) and nervous system disorders (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 31; 31.7/100,000 person-years), immune system disorders (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 24; 24.3/100,000 person-years), and infections and infestations (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 19; 20.1/100,000 person-years) were the most common reported SAE categories. A limitation of the study was the single-arm design, with limited routinely collected morbidity comparator data in the study setting.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We observed similar patterns of AEs as in phase 3 trials. AEs were mostly expected reactogenicity signs and symptoms. Furthermore, most SAEs occurred below expected rates. The single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, supporting the continued use of this vaccine in this setting.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>South Africa is among the countries most affected globally by COVID-19, with over 266,000 excess natural deaths occurring between May 2020 and October 2021 (approximately 448 per 100,000 individuals) [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine showed efficacy in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 disease in the ENSEMBLE study including in South Africa, where initially the beta variant and then the delta variant were the predominant circulating strains [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Here, an estimated 1,300 healthcare workers (HCWs) have died from COVID-19 as of September 2021 [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Sisonke study, an open-label, single arm phase 3b implementation study of the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, was conducted as an emergency intervention to protect HCWs in the face of an anticipated third COVID-19 wave, at a time when no vaccines were available through the national rollout. The study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine among HCWs in South Africa.</p>
              <p>The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is compatible with standard vaccine storage and distribution channels and is therefore a practical vaccine for low- and middle-income countries or remote populations [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To date, approximately 30 million persons in the United States (US) and the European Union have received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Vaccine adverse event (AE) surveillance systems demonstrate that billions of people have safely received COVID-19 vaccines [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. AEs following COVID-19 vaccination are generally mild, and include local reactions, such as injection site pain, redness, swelling, and systemic reactions, like fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>As reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, severe or potentially life-threatening AEs are rare, and after 12.6 million doses of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, 38 cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and 98 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) were reported, while after 141 million second mRNA vaccine doses, 497 cases of myocarditis were reported [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Following the precautionary pause instituted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2021, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority recommended a similar 2-week pause for the Sisonke study [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The study recommenced with additional safeguards including screening and monitoring of participants at high risk of thrombosis and implementing measures to safely manage participants with TTS. Participant information sheets and informed consent forms were updated to include the newly identified AEs. Identification of such rare events illustrated that continued evaluation of the safety profile of vaccines post-licensure is crucial to accurately characterise safety and to identify very rare AEs that may not be reported in clinical trials.</p>
              <p>The Sisonke study enrolled almost half a million HCWs, providing an opportunity to further evaluate the safety of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in an expanded population. Here we present the safety data.</p>

                <title>Study participants</title>
                <p>The Sisonke study is a multi-centre, open-label, single-arm phase 3b implementation study among HCWs (≥18 years) in South Africa, which is conducted in collaboration with the National Department of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04838795; Pan African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR202102855526180). All 1,250,000 HCWs targeted by phase 1 of the national COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout Strategy were invited for vaccination. To participate, HCWs were required to register on the national Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS) and provide electronic consent if they were age 18 or older. All eligible HCWs who registered on the EVDS and provided electronic consent for the study were eligible for enrolment. Known pregnant women and breastfeeding women were excluded due to a lack of sufficient safety data at that time. Details of the eligibility criteria are provided in the study protocol (<xref rid="pmed.1004024.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). A total of 477,234 HCWs received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine between 17 February 2021 and 17 May 2021.</p>
                <p>The institutional health research ethics committees of participating clinical research sites approved the study, which was overseen by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Ref: 20200465). This study is reported as per the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (<xref rid="pmed.1004024.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Appendix</xref>).</p>

                <title>Vaccination procedures</title>
                <p>Participants received appointments for vaccination through the EVDS or were invited via employer lists. Vaccinations were conducted in collaboration with the National Department of Health public or private vaccination centres across all 9 South African provinces and overseen by Good Clinical Practice–trained personnel linked to one of the ENSEMBLE trial research sites. Participants received a single intramuscular injection of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles and were observed for AEs for 15 minutes post-vaccination, or for 30 minutes if they had a previous history of allergic reactions to vaccinations.</p>

              <sec id="sec012">
                <title>AE reporting</title>
                <p>AEs were reported into the study database via multiple streams using a hybrid surveillance system that combined passive with active reporting [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. First, we designed an electronic case report form (CRF) (<xref rid="pmed.1004024.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>). After vaccination, every participant received a text message with COVID-19 infection prevention measures that also listed common signs and symptoms of reactogenicity and provided an AE reporting web link, which allowed participants access to the form for AE reporting. Reactogenicity events are pre-specified common AEs expected soon after vaccination and include systemic events such as headache, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, nausea, and chills, and local events such as pain, erythema, and induration. Second, healthcare providers were able to complete paper-based CRFs that were available at healthcare and vaccination facilities, which were then submitted to the Sisonke study safety desk and captured in the AE database. Third, the study team set up a safety desk call centre staffed by pharmacovigilance nurses, pharmacists, and safety physicians to assess and advise on AE reports. Contact details were advertised on the vaccination cards, shared on social media, and included in the text messages. Finally, spontaneous case reports via unsolicited communication by HCWs were captured and verified by safety desk staff. Telephone follow-up with the participant and attending healthcare provider was established as part of case investigation. Case reports for safety events of concern were collated from these telephone interviews, medical records, and results from laboratory and imaging investigations.</p>
                <p>In addition, we actively linked EVDS data via national identification numbers with national patient-level disease databases, COVID-19 case notifications, and the national population registry to identify vaccine recipients with COVID-19 infections, COVID-19-related hospitalisations, and deaths. COVID-19 is a notifiable medical condition in South Africa, and tests conducted across laboratories are reported to the National Health Laboratory Service data system, which was used to identify seropositive Sisonke study participants via active linkage. A death notification form must be submitted to the Department of Home Affairs to obtain a death certificate. Therefore, in addition to case reports and active tracing, mortality was ascertained via linkage with the national population registry. After identification of deaths, the safety staff contacted next of kin and primary healthcare providers and solicited medical records to ascertain cause of death.</p>

              <sec id="sec013">
                <title>Safety monitoring</title>
                <p>AE reports were processed daily and screened for serious AEs (SAEs); SAEs were defined by the investigators as any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs of special interest (AESIs) were defined per the Brighton Collaboration list [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (hereafter SAEs and AESIs are referred to collectively as SAEs). Anaphylaxis was adjudicated using the Brighton Collaboration and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases case definition, with cases needing to meet both definitions to be considered confirmed cases [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Seven days after reporting an AE, participants received a follow-up text message with a link to the electronic CRF. Participants reporting worsening or non-resolving symptoms were followed up by safety desk staff. After the FDA lifted the cautionary 2-week pause in vaccinations, 2 additional follow-up text messages were sent to all participants 7 and 14 days after vaccination. The texts highlighted signs/symptoms associated with TTS and provided a link to the electronic CRF. Safety staff made attempts to obtain medical records and supporting information from healthcare providers for all reported SAEs.</p>
                <p>The protocol safety review team comprising principal investigators, safety physicians, and subject matter experts (haematologists, neurologist, allergy expert, and infectious disease specialists) provided oversight by weekly safety data review. An independent safety monitoring committee provided additional safety oversight.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>A prospective analysis plan was used in designing the study (see <xref rid="pmed.1004024.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Appendix</xref>). For descriptive statistics, counts and proportions were used for categorical variables, and medians and interquartile ranges for quantitative variables. The baseline characteristics sex, age, previous COVID-19 status, and presence of comorbidities were compared between participants reporting AEs and those not reporting AEs using descriptive statistics. SAEs were summarised by MedDRA system organ class and adverse event preferred term. For selected SAEs, disproportionality analysis was conducted: The observed (O) number of reported cases was compared to the expected (E) number based on background incidence rates, and the O/E ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated. The 95% confidence intervals for the O/E ratio were calculated as follows: (i) the 95% confidence interval of the observed number of events was calculated assuming a chi-squared distribution, and (ii) each of the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval in (i) were divided by the number of expected events to produce the 95% confidence interval for the O/E ratio. Available background incidence rates were used including a medically insured population in South Africa (see <xref rid="pmed.1004024.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Appendix</xref>) for pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, a Tanzanian population-based cohort study for neurological events such as stroke, the Brighton Collaboration, and European population databases [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Person-time was accrued from the date of vaccination until death or dataset closure on 15 June 2021 (28 days after the last vaccination in the study). The incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated using a Poisson model with person-years as an offset. Comparison of age-standardised mortality rates in the Sisonke study was with projected background population mortality rates in South Africa as per the 2018 Medical Research Council Rapid Mortality Surveillance Report [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and pre-COVID-19 local employee group life assurance data for a similar age-structured working population. Deaths were excluded from the SAE analysis and examined as a separate entity. COVID-19-related deaths are published in a separate effectiveness report [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There were no formal statistical methods that were used to handle missing data. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, US). See <xref rid="pmed.1004024.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Appendix</xref> for the analytical code.</p>

                <p>A total of 10,279 AEs were reported, of which 138 (1.4%) were classified as SAEs. Most AE reports (81%) were electronic self-reports. Women reported more AEs than men (2.3% versus 1.6%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), AE reporting decreased with increasing age (3.2% for 18- to 30-year-olds versus 1.5% for &gt;55-year-olds; <italic toggle="yes">p &lt;</italic> 0.001), and participants with previous COVID-19 infection reported more AEs (2.6% versus 2.1%; <italic toggle="yes">p &lt;</italic> 0.001).

Proportions reporting AEs among those with other comorbidities were similar (<xref rid="pmed.1004024.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Most reported AEs (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 9,021, 81%) were reactogenicity events; the most common were headaches and body aches (including arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue) that occurred within the first 7 days of vaccination, followed by mild injection site pain and fever (<xref rid="pmed.1004024.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). These events occurred predominately on the day of vaccination, reducing in frequency by day 2. A total of 2,109 AEs were not classified as reactogenicity events. Self-reported severity was mild to moderate in 67% of participants (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 7,157), i.e., the event did not result in loss of ability to perform usual social and functional activities, while 32% of participants (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3,375) reported being unable to perform usual activities and 2% (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 213) reported that they needed to visit the emergency room or were hospitalised. Follow-up at day 7 post-vaccination indicated that of the 3,831 who had responded by dataset closure, 92% (3,524) of participants reporting AEs had either completely recovered or were recovering. The remaining 8% (324) of participants were contacted by the safety team. Attempts were made by the safety team to contact all of these participants individually (3 telephone calls at least 1 day apart). Those who were contactable were interviewed via phone and, if clinically indicated, referred for further care.</p>

SAE outcomes were as follows: 48 (34.8%) recovered, 36 (26.1%) recovering, and 9 (6.5%) deceased. All SAEs were followed until resolution. However, at the time of dataset closure on 15 June 2021 (28 days after the last vaccination), 45 SAEs (32.6%) were still ongoing.</p>

Three participants had both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. There were 2 cases classified as TTS. The first case was a woman in the age group 46–50 years presenting with pulmonary embolism, thrombocytopenia, and positive anti-platelet factor 4 antibody assay 9 days after vaccination. She had a history of contraceptive injection use and underlying chronic respiratory and neurological conditions, and was being investigated for an autoimmune disorder. The second case was a woman in the age group 18–30 years who was admitted to hospital unconscious after experiencing a severe headache, restlessness, and confusion from 33 days after vaccination. A CT brain scan with venogram was in keeping with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Anti-platelet factor 4 antibody assay was negative, and she had marginally low platelets. She was a current smoker but had no other significant medical history. Both participants recovered.</p>
                <p>Most events affecting the nervous system were complaints of headaches or migraines resulting in hospital admissions (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 8). Five cases of Bell palsy (5.3 per 100,000 person-years, 95% CI 2.2–12.7) were reported between 1 and 42 days after vaccination; 2 men (age group 31–45 years) developed GBS about 2 weeks after vaccination, and 2 women (age group 46–55 years) developed GBS 16 and 17 days after vaccination (4.2 per 100,000 person-years, 95% CI 1.6–11.3). All participants were recovering at study end. Four cases were adjudicated as anaphylaxis by 2 physicians. All anaphylaxis cases had previous occurrence of drug- or vaccine-associated anaphylaxis and recovered fully. There was 1 case of myocarditis in a woman with previous myocarditis, which had settled prior to vaccination. She was receiving care at study end.</p>
                <p><xref rid="pmed.1004024.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarises the disproportionality analysis that compares the occurred versus expected incidence ratio for SAEs of concern. Out of the SAEs examined, TTS seemed to occur at a rate greater than the baseline comparison, although the 95% confidence interval was wide and crossed 1 (O/E ratio 2.4, 95% CI 0.3–8.7), and GBS occurred at a rate greater than the baseline comparison population (O/E ratio 5.1, 95% CI 1.4–13.0). For the other SAEs, namely, ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism (non-TTS), deep vein thrombosis, acute coronary syndrome, Bell palsy, transverse myelitis, seizures, and myocarditis, the O/E ratio was less than 1. <xref rid="pmed.1004024.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> presents the disproportionality analysis for SAEs occurring within 28 days of vaccination, and <xref rid="pmed.1004024.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> illustrates the frequency of SAE reporting from day of vaccination. As expected, there was a drop off in events when the analysis was restricted to 28 days post-vaccination, but there was not a significant change in the observed versus expected ratios of SAEs.</p>

Thirty-eight percent (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 60) were male, median age was 48 years (IQR 40–57), 42 deaths (26.8%) were reported as having non-natural causes, 57% (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 90) had at least 1 comorbidity; comorbidities reported were as follows: hypertension (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 48, 30.6%), diabetes (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 32, 20.4%), HIV (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 20, 12.7%), heart disease (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 9, 5.7%), and cancer (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 1, 1.7%). Adjudicated causes of death included metastatic cancer (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 18), HIV/AIDS-related deaths (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 15), motor vehicle accidents (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 11), homicide (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 7), pulmonary embolism (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 5), myocardial infarction (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 4), cerebrovascular accident/stroke (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3), non-COVID-19 pneumonia (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3), intracerebral bleeding (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3), bleeding peptic ulcer/upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3), suicide (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2), and status epilepticus (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2).

                <p>Nineteen deaths occurred within 28 days after vaccination. Causes were motor vehicle accident (3), upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (3), homicide (2), HIV/AIDS-related deaths (2), and 1 each of pulmonary embolism, metastatic pancreatic cancer, drowning, dilated cardiomyopathy, renal failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, status epilepticus, suicide, and death after aortic valve and bypass surgery. A woman (age group 18–30 years) with a history of hypertension post-delivery presented 20 days after vaccination to her physician with jaundice and anuria. She then developed confusion, renal failure, and haemolysis requiring dialysis and fresh frozen plasma transfusion. She died after transfer to an intensive care unit. Investigations were in keeping thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). She was HIV negative, and no other triggers could be identified. Assessment of the event using the World Health Organization causality assessment tool classified this as an indeterminate temporal relationship with insufficient evidence for attribution to the vaccine [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the absence of a clear alternative cause, the safety team deemed it plausible that the vaccine could have exacerbated this event in a patient with a predisposition to TTP.</p>

The mortality rate in the Sisonke study was similar to the working population mortality data with similar ages, and well below that of the overall population mortality rate (<xref rid="pmed.1004024.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The Sisonke study, a large single-arm, open-label phase 3b implementation study, aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine among almost half a million HCWs in South Africa. A previous study of this vaccine supported its effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-related death after vaccination, and against both the beta and delta variants [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. With over 10,000 AE reports, to our knowledge, this was the largest safety analysis of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from a low- or middle-income country. As observed in phase 3 trials, similar patterns of AEs were found and were mostly expected reactogenicity signs and symptoms. Furthermore, most SAEs were rare and occurred below expected rates. However, we did observe very rare events of TTS and GBS in this study at apparently higher than expected rates, though confidence intervals for these estimates were wide. Nevertheless, overall, this study provides additional real-world evidence that the vaccine is safe and well tolerated, supporting its continued use in this setting.</p>
              <p>AEs were more often reported by women than men. While this observation may illustrate a stronger immune response in females compared to males as seen for other vaccines [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], behavioural factors such as reduced reporting among men may have also played a role, though these factors were not measured. The prevalence of reported AEs decreased with increasing age. A number of studies show that vaccine-related AEs and reactogenicity are less prevalent in older people due to the waning of innate immune defence mechanisms; lower systemic levels of IL-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein; and lower neutralising antibody titres after vaccination as compared to younger individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Individuals reporting previous COVID-19 infection seemed to have higher AE reporting rates. Some studies suggest that there is increased immunogenicity in the setting of past infection, leading to higher antibody titres and therefore higher reactogenicity rates [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>TTS and GBS occurred at very low rates in this study; however, the disproportionality analysis showed a higher event rate than expected in the population. After 12.6 million doses of the Ad26.CoV.2 vaccine were administered in the US, 38 confirmed TTS cases and 98 GBS cases were reported [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on these data, estimates illustrate a clear advantage of vaccination despite these rare AE occurrences. For example, among women aged 30–49 years in the US, for every 6–7 cases of GBS or 8–10 cases of TTS, 10,100 COVID-19 cases, 900 hospitalisations, 140 intensive care unit admissions, and 20 deaths were prevented [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>While the risk–benefit balance clearly favours vaccination, this study highlights the importance of ongoing safety monitoring in population-based vaccination programmes to enable continued risk–benefit assessment. The Sisonke study shows that additional surveillance, heightened awareness, and development of protocols for the management of potential clinical complications after vaccination help identify and manage possible cases early and appropriately. For example, the 2 cases of TTS were successfully managed with the support of the protocol safety review team, and both participants recovered. It is crucial that such cases are identified promptly to enable successful management. Local clinical recommendations for management of TTS were developed and implemented [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>The Sisonke study had some limitations. First, the surveillance system was primarily passive, relying on self-reporting; thus, some AEs may have gone unreported. It is likely that the system was better suited to detect SAEs than milder AEs, which participants may have ignored rather than reported. Second, as active contact with participants was continued up to 2 weeks post-vaccination, it is probable that SAEs other than deaths and COVID-19 events were more likely to be reported during this period, and there may have been some underestimation of SAEs that occurred later. The active linkage of the unique identifier in the EVDS with deaths in the national population registry and with COVID-19 events in the COVID-19 laboratory system ensured identification of nearly all possible deaths and COVID-19 events in the study. Third, considering the large number of participants in the study, not all self-reported AEs could be verified, and only SAEs and AEs of medical concern were investigated further. Fourth, the disproportionality analysis should be interpreted with caution given the uncertainties in both the observed and expected event rates, variable follow-up time, non–South African reference data for some groups, and potential differences in age–sex distributions between the Sisonke study and reference data. However, while disproportionality analysis in the context of safety signal detection is mainly exploratory, it has the utility of identifying potentially important associations between AEs and vaccines. In this study, the analysis confirmed current reports of the safety risk of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine with respect to TTS and GBS [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Lastly, it is also important to note that without a placebo group, open-label, single-arm studies are subject to measurement bias with the potential of overreporting of AEs, and hence some caution is needed in interpreting safety data. No other safety concerns were found in this study [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Overall, the Sisonke study did not identify excess deaths in the vaccinated population compared to the general population. Mortality rates were comparable to a similar adult working population from 2018. This report illustrates the importance of accurate national mortality surveillance, especially in settings where vaccine hesitancy is driven by non-scientific and inaccurate reports in communities and through social media. The Sisonke study results are also a strong reminder that South Africa faces a large burden of disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While cancer was the most common cause of death during the study period, highlighting the urgent need for specialist oncology services, it is concerning that among HCWs advanced HIV and tuberculosis remain common causes of death. It shows that despite gains in access to HIV testing and treatment, HIV and tuberculosis care require further improvement. Local data highlight that the COVID-19 epidemic heavily impacted HIV testing and treatment initiations [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Motor vehicle accidents and homicides were also common causes of death, a reflection of the injury and trauma burden in South Africa. One death was related to TTP, which has previously been reported after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and warrants further evaluation in other studies [<xref rid="pmed.1004024.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study affirms that the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is safe and well tolerated when administered to adults in South Africa. Few SAEs were observed, and they were successfully managed with prompt identification. The Sisonke study underscores the value of setting up robust pharmacovigilance systems for prompt identification, evaluation, and reporting of AEs to enable continued assessment of the risk–benefit profiles of COVID-19 vaccines. This has the potential to improve public confidence in vaccine safety and reduce vaccine hesitancy.</p>

Please mention/provide numbers to inform if there were eligible individuals who were contacted but declined to participate. Please include a participant flow diagram.</p>
              <p>15. Methods: Please include the study protocol document and the analysis plan, with any amendments, as Supporting Information to be published with the manuscript if accepted.</p>
              <p>16. Methods: Please include a copy of the electronic case report form designed for the study as a supporting information document. Please provide additional information for the verification of SAEs and AEs of medical concern, and for spontaneous reports via unsolicited HCW communication.</p>
              <p>17. Methods: Please provide a list of those events considered as serious AEs/AEs of special interest.</p>
              <p>18. Methods: Missing data have the potential to introduce bias in your study. Please explain how you have dealt with missing data.</p>
              <p>19. Methods: Please describe how individual SAEs were selected for this analysis: “For selected SAEs, disproportionality analysis was conducted…”</p>
              <p>20. Methods: Statistical analysis: “Participants reporting and not</p>
              <p>reporting AEs were compared by baseline characteristics.” Please describe the collection of baseline characteristic data, and please describe how these data were incorporated into analyses. Please explain the categorization for age.</p>
              <p>21. Methods: Statistical analysis: “Available background incidence rates were used including a medically insured population in South Africa (pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis), Tanzanian population-based cohort study (neurological events such as stroke)</p>
              <p>and European population databases.(10, 15–18).” Please provide more information, including how expected count/incidence were obtained for Table 3.</p>
              <p>22. Results: Please clarify here if all post-vaccination follow up contacts provided additional data (on whether AEs resolved or not), and if not, please mention numbers lost to follow up. “Follow up at day seven post vaccination indicated that 92% of participants reporting AEs had either completely recovered or were recovering. The remaining 8% of participants were contacted by the safety team and, if required, referred for care.”</p>
              <p>23. Results: Please present numerators and denominators for percentages, at least in the Tables if not in the main text of the Results [not necessarily each time they're mentioned].</p>
              <p>24. Results: “One in five (19%) AEs were not consistent classified as reactogenicity events (Supplementary Table 1).” Please clarify in the text what is meant here (for example, if these were classified as serious adverse events).</p>
              <p>25. Results/ Figure 2: Please provide additional details regarding the comparison with the local employee group life assurance data.</p>
              <p>26. Discussion: Please be sure to present and organize the Discussion as follows: a short, clear summary of the article's findings; what the study adds to existing research and where and why the results may differ from previous research; strengths and limitations of the study; implications and next steps for research, clinical practice, and/or public policy; one-paragraph conclusion.</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: See attachment</p>
              <p>Michael Dewey</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: S. Takuva et al., reported here the results of an open label implementation study that assess the safety (and the effectiveness) of one shot of Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine of janssen among Healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Africa. This manuscript is focused on the presentattion of safety data.only. </p>
              <p>It is a very impresssive implementation study that included in real life conditions an half of a million of HCWs.</p>
              <p>The manuscript is well written and easy to read. </p>
              <p>The introduction is concise and presented well the situation.</p>
              <p>I have few comments:</p>
              <p>-in the methods section, (p 5) please provide details about the exclusion of pregnant women ( there is a pregnancy test performed? what could be challenging in study of this size; if not just precise that women with a known pregnancy were excluded).</p>
              <p>-in the results section, since the numerators are not notified in the text, please propose to the reader to see in the table 1, as it is only the percentage is available ("the majority were women (74.9%)"). In the section "SAE" of the results section page 8, it is written "114 reported by women and 25 by men" 114+25= 139 , only 138 SAE s excluding death were reported, please change. In this same paragraph, please specify at which time after vaccination the SAEs outcome were evaluated?. For the 9 death (6.5%), I suggest to precise that it represented 9/10,279 (0.09%) of people that declared an AE.</p>
              <p>-references in the reference list are sometime not completed</p>
              <p>This work is very interesting and indeed shows that, including in low and middle income countries, surveillance at large scale is possible, what is crucial to achieve confidence in vaccines.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I thoroughly enjoyed reading the "Safety of the single-dose Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine among healthcare workers in the phase 3b Sisonke study in South Africa" by Takuva et al. It was clearly written in excellent English, with a format and logic that was cohesive and easy to follow. Their sampling and selection criteria is clear, and their analysis follows standard methods. The reporting of their results is clear, and in their discussion and limitations they follow a logical expansion of the topic. The only suggestions that I have to improve the quality of their excellent work are as follows:</p>
              <p>1- Given the high percentage of females in the study, a brief explanation of whether they over sampled for females would be clarifying.</p>
              <p>2- In Tables 2 and 3, if there could be an additional column which indicates the incidence of adverse events in other large studies of the safety Ad26.CoV2.S (perhaps Ref. 7 &amp; 8) it would allow for rapid comparison of results.</p>
              <p>3- Several minor typo mistakes, which fall under the editorial corrections.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Takuva,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Safety evaluation of the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine among healthcare workers in the Sisonke study in South Africa: a phase 3b implementation trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-04884R2) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by two reviewers. Provided that the remaining reviewer comments, and editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by May 12 2022 11:59PM.   </p>

              </p>
              <p>4. Abstract: Methods and Findings: Please provide the trial registration information in the Abstract.</p>
              <p>5. Abstract: Methods and Findings: Please clarify “...among all eligible HCWs in South Africa registered in the national Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS)…” or similar.</p>
              <p>6. Abstract: Methods and Findings: At line 77, the number of serious AEs is reported as 139, and at line 85, this is reported as 138.</p>
              <p>7. Abstract: Conclusions: Line 91-93: Given the finding in Table 3 for TTS and GBS, it may be more accurate to phrase this as “most SAEs occurred below expected rates.”</p>
              <p>8. Author summary: Line 108-111: Please revise to: “The majority of adverse events reported…” and please revise the following sentence to “ Most serious adverse events…”</p>
              <p>9. Methods: Please add the following statement, or similar, to the Methods: "This study is reported as per the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (S1 Checklist)."</p>
              <p>10. Methods: Line 173-174: Please reference the copy of the study protocol included as a supporting information file, and refer to it here (Supplementary Appendix 2). Please cite the online version of the protocol in the reference list, rather than including a web link here.</p>
              <p>11. Methods: Statistical analysis: Line 239: Please mention If a prospective analysis plan was used in designing the study, for example, Supplementary Appendix 3, and please reference that file here. Please describe in the text if any changes to the analysis plan were made, and when.</p>
              <p>12. Methods: Line 241-242: “Participants reporting and not reporting AEs were compared by baseline characteristics.” Please provide more details of this analysis.</p>
              <p>13. Methods: Line 257-258: “COVID-related deaths were excluded in this report and published in a separate effectiveness report.” Please provide a reference to the publication if these data have been published.</p>
              <p>14. Results: Line 266-268: We suggest rephrasing to: “...(all 1 250 000 HCWs in the country were invited to participate).” or similar.</p>
              <p>15. Results: Line 279: Please change “less” to “fewer” AEs.</p>
              <p>16. Results: Line 292-296: “Follow up at day seven post vaccination indicated that 92% of participants reporting AEs had either completely recovered or were recovering. The remaining 8% of participants were contacted by the safety team. Attempts were made to contact all these participants individually by the safety team (three telephonic calls at least one day apart). Those that were contactable were captured and if indicated, referred for further care.” Please include numbers in addition to reporting percentages here. Please clarify what is meant by “Those that were contactable were captured…” and please re-phrase this if possible.</p>
              <p>17. Results: Line 296-297: “One in five (19%) AEs were not consistent classified as reactogenicity events” Please provide the actual number of AEs not classified as reactogenicity events.</p>
              <p>18. Results: Line 307-308: “SAE outcomes were: 48 (34.8%) recovered, 36 (26.1%) recovering, 45 (32.6%) ongoing and 9 (6.5%) deceased.” Please mention the duration of follow up here, in light of the 32% of reports classified as ongoing and the following sentence mentioning events were followed up until resolution.</p>
              <p>19. Discussion: Line 392-394: We suggest phrasing this as: “A previous study of this vaccine supported its effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-related death after vaccination, and against both beta and delta variants [20].</p>
              <p>20. Discussion: Line 397-398: We suggest revising to: “Furthermore, most SAEs were rare and occurred below expected rates. However, we did observe very rare events of TTS and GBS in this study at apparently higher than expected rates, though confidence intervals for these estimates were wide.” or similar.</p>
              <p>21. Discussion: Line 405: We suggest “ was lower with increasing age” instead of “reduced” here.</p>

              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed my points but there remains one minor issue outstanding. I asked for Supplementary Table 1 to give us more details about these other adverse events broken down by the effect on the participant (unable to perform usual activities, hospitalised). I perhaps was not clear enough as the authors' response just outlines what response the clinical and research team made to the events. This is valuable to know but not what I was asking for.</p>
              <p>Michael Dewey</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Authors correctly addressed the comments of reviewers</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Takuva,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Safety evaluation of the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine among healthcare workers in the Sisonke study in South Africa: A phase 3b implementation trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-04884R3) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by May 18 2022 11:59PM.   </p>
