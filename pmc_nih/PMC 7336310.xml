                <p>Immune and molecular profiling of CD8 T cells of patients receiving DC vaccines expressing three full-length melanoma antigens (MAs) was performed. Antigen expression levels in DCs had no significant impact on T cell or clinical responses. Patients who received checkpoint blockade before DC vaccination had higher baseline MA-specific CD8 T cell responses but no evidence for improved functional responses to the vaccine. Patients who showed the best clinical responses had low PD-1 expression on MA-specific T cells before and after DC vaccination; however, blockade of PD-1 during antigen presentation by DC had minimal functional impact on PD-1<sup>high</sup> MA-specific T cells. Gene and protein expression analyses in lymphocytes and tumor samples identified critical immunoregulatory pathways, including CTLA-4 and PD-1. High immune checkpoint gene expression networks correlated with inferior clinical outcomes. Soluble serum PD-L2 showed suggestive positive association with improved outcome. These findings show that checkpoint molecular pathways are critical for vaccine outcomes and suggest specific sequencing of vaccine combinations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Melanoma represents &lt;1% of skin cancers but is the most lethal. Over 96,000 new cases of melanoma were expected in 2019, a continued increase in incidence for the past 30 yr (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2019</xref>). Checkpoint blockade therapy using monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 has shown durable responses as monotherapy, and as CTLA-4<sup>+</sup>PD-1 combination blockade, responses are seen in more than half of patients treated (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Larkin, et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is still a significant proportion of patients who do not respond to checkpoint blockade or acquire resistance to these therapies (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the need to develop and promote effective antitumor immunity and rationally design combination approaches is a critical issue.</p>
              <p>The aim of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is to induce or expand functional and long-lived tumor-specific T cell responses. Numerous studies have shown the safety and immunogenicity of DC vaccines in melanoma and other cancers (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Santos and Butterfield, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gross et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">van der Burg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Carreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Palucka and Banchereau, 2013</xref>). Despite these findings, objective clinical response rates remain low at &lt;15% (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anguille et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, there is a need to optimize vaccine design to improve clinical responses by promoting more effective long-term antitumor immunity and to define where vaccination could be fruitfully combined with complementary approaches such as checkpoint blockade.</p>
              <p>In this study, CD8 T cells specific for melanoma antigens (MAs) were analyzed from patients who received autologous DCs engineered to express three full-length MAs (tyrosinase, MART-1, and MAGE-A6; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Butterfield et al., 2019</xref>). The immunological and clinical impacts of key checkpoint molecule expression by the T cells were examined. Differential expression analyses in circulating lymphocytes and tumor samples, performed using a defined subset of cancer and immune-related gene and protein panels, suggest important molecular pathways for modulation and optimal sequencing of future combination trials with vaccines.</p>

                <p>To test the hypothesis that antigen expression levels are important for induction of T cell responses, the vaccines were engineered by a single adenovirus (AdV) to express high levels of tyrosinase, intermediate levels of MART-1, and low levels of MAGE-A6. Tyrosinase and MART-1 mRNAs were driven by the CMV promoter, and their expression was significantly correlated (P = 0.00013). MAGE-A6 mRNA was driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and did not show a statistically significant correlation with the other two antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1 A</xref>). Each patient’s vaccine cells were transduced with differing efficiency; hence, there were individualized levels of each antigen. Cox regression analysis did not reveal significant associations between antigen expression dose in the vaccines and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1 B</xref>).</p>

Overall, three patients showed increases to three of three peptides, six to two of three peptides, and five to one of three peptides, and two (both progressive disease [PD]) had no frequency increases. Testing CD4 T cells for reactivity to full-length antigens showed a transient increase in postvaccine MA-specific activation of CD4 T cells; MART-1 and AdV-specific responses had the strongest evidence for a difference between baseline and day 43 (d43) measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

                <p>The importance of vaccine antigen-specific responses has been unclear across trials due in part to patient and assay heterogeneity. As shown above, individual antigen responses did not significantly impact OS or PFS. In contrast, when bulk PBMC, purified CD8 or CD4 T cells, or CD8+CD4 T cell responses to all three shared antigens were combined, significant associations with survival could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Kaplan-Meier curves comparing patients whose T cells did or did not exhibit antigen-specific responses (to any of the MAs) showed that having a CD8 T cell response was associated with longer OS and PFS, and this association was also apparent when considering the combined CD8 and CD4 T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This provides evidence that total vaccine-induced T cell responses are important in determining patient outcome.</p>

                <p>Because this trial allowed enrollment of late-stage disease, 26/35 patients enrolled in the trial had received one or more prior systemic treatments. 15 patients had received CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade, seven of whom also received PD-1 blockade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S1</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Butterfield et al., 2019</xref>). ELISPOT counts and dextramer-positive T cell frequencies used to measure MA-specific T cell responses at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) appeared to be higher overall in patients who had received previous α–CTLA-4 and/or α–PD-1 therapies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Table S2</xref>). To evaluate this effect along with changes in MA-specific T cell responses over time after vaccination, we used a linear mixed effect model with fixed effects for time and previous checkpoint inhibitor therapy and random intercepts per patient to account for correlation of measurements within individuals. For these 16 HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients, ELISPOT counts representing IFN-γ response were higher by ∼6 per 10<sup>5</sup> T cells in patients who had received previous checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and the dextramer frequencies showed a small but significant difference based on previous therapy for MART1<sub>27–35</sub>. These data suggest that blockade of CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 can slightly amplify MA-specific T cells, and this difference can persist through the vaccine time course (day 0–89 [d0–d89]). However, these responses are not amplified by subsequent vaccination. The only antigen-specific T cell response that showed a clear increase over time was the MAGE-A6<sub>271–27</sub><sub>9</sub> dextramer frequency, but not its corresponding functional ELISPOT responses.</p>

                <title>Patients with tumor regression have vaccine antigen-specific CD8 T cells with low levels of PD-1 expression</title>
                <p>To address the role of activation and exhaustion phenotypes on MA-specific CD8 T cells, surface expression of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2 A</xref>). Two partial responders (PRs; patients 10 and 20) had strikingly low frequencies of PD-1–positive total and MA-specific CD8 T cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A, B</xref>). Patient 34 with stable disease (SD) also exhibited low PD-1 expression. Patient 21, a patient who had no evidence of disease (NED) at enrollment and who then progressed at 7 mo, also exhibited low PD-1 expression at baseline but showed 25%–41% positive PD-1 expression by d89. Only patient 34 had received α–PD-1 therapy (the other three patients were treatment naive or had previous CTLA-4 blockade or previous IFN-α). Expression of CTLA-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) was less frequent than PD-1, and there were no significant correlations observed between clinical outcome and expression of CTLA-4 and/or TIM3 on MA-specific CD8 T cells (TIM3 data not shown). Because PD-1 is also an activation marker, the IFN-γ ELISPOT results for these four patients were examined to evaluate whether there was evidence of MA-specific T cell activation. Three of four had CD8 T cell responses to one to three MAs, but at just over the limit of detection, while the fourth had a total PBMC (CD4 or CD8) response. Thus, the lack of PD-1 protein detection on total and MA-specific CD8 T cells may be due to low activated MA T cell frequency.</p>

                <p>Of the 35 patients, 14 (40%) were alive at follow-up assessment. Post-trial PBMC samples were available for HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients 10 and 18 from 1.5 and 2 yr after DC vaccination, respectively, which were tested for long-term MA-specific CD8 T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2 A</xref>). Patient 10 (partial response [PR]) subsequently received pembrolizumab for 5 mo. At 1.5 yr after vaccination, this patient had 166- and 40-fold increases in the frequency of MAGE and MART-1 circulating CD8 T cells (0.50% MAGE-A6<sub>271–27</sub><sub>9</sub><sup>+</sup> and 1.00% MART1<sub>27–35</sub><sup>+</sup>) compared with d43. There was also higher PD-1 expression on total CD8 and MA-specific T cells (0%–5% vs. 22%–26%). LAG3 was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2 A</xref>). 4.5 yr after DC vaccination, this patient has multiple soft tissue and muscle metastases.</p>
                <p>Patient 18 had NED on initial assessment following the protocol intervention, then progressed within 5 mo and received ipilimumab for 3 mo followed by pembrolizumab. 2 yr after vaccination, this patient had 100-fold higher MART1<sub>27–35</sub><sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells in the periphery. There was 13%–16% PD-1 expression on CD8 and MART1<sub>27–35</sub>–specific T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2 A</xref>), similar to d43 (13.5%–17% PD-1<sup>+</sup>). There was also minimal LAG3 expression detected. At 4.75 yr from vaccination, this patient has measurable disease and is now in a different clinical trial. These data suggest that postvaccine checkpoint blockade, particularly anti–PD-1, may amplify vaccine-induced T cell responses.</p>

                <title>Protein profiling of circulating lymphocytes</title>
                <p>To more broadly examine key immune mechanisms, targeted protein levels in circulating lymphocytes were analyzed using a 30-plex NanoString panel, and differential protein expression was compared between clinical outcomes and functional T cell responses. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> depicts differentially expressed proteins between outcome groups in both baseline and postvaccine samples. With a focus on checkpoint expression, we observed significantly higher PD-1 protein counts in the unfavorable (bad) patient outcome group at d43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). CTLA-4 levels showed similar elevation in the bad outcome groups for both d0 and d43, although these comparisons were not significant at α = 0.05 (d0 mean count difference = 316; d43 mean count difference = 117; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Comparing checkpoint expression levels from all time points across the PD, SD, and PR outcome groups shows incrementally higher checkpoint expression in worse outcomes (PR &lt; SD &lt; PD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2 C</xref>). To further evaluate the differential checkpoint expression between outcome groups over the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>), we used a linear mixed effect model with fixed effects for time and outcome and random intercepts per patient to account for correlation of measurements within individuals. The outcome terms in these models did not show P &lt; 0.05 by a likelihood ratio test, but the data nevertheless appear consistent with higher expression levels in the unfavorable outcome group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Furthermore, Cox regression analysis revealed significant inverse associations between baseline CTLA-4 expression and OS and PFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). In postvaccine measurements, higher CTLA-4 levels were associated with lower OS (hazard ratio [HR] of 2.2 based on standardized expression levels; P = 0.03), while higher expression of PD-1 appeared to be associated with worse PFS (HR of 2; P = 0.06; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Next, we compared checkpoint expression based on patient-derived MA-specific T cell responses. Significantly higher CTLA-4 protein expression was observed for patients who showed an IFN-γ response in bulk PBMCs, but not in purified T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3 A</xref>). We did not observe significant differences in PD-1 levels for bulk PBMC or purified T cell subsets.</p>

                <p>In addition to differences between outcome groups, we examined immune checkpoint pathway changes between vaccine trial sample time points at d43 versus d0 and d89 versus d43. For these analyses, we used circulating lymphocytes from patients with good clinical outcome, as there were no available samples from d89 for poor outcome group patients. Here, we show that the CTLA-4 inhibitory signaling pathway was significantly down-regulated following vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). We also surveyed checkpoint pathway changes between d43 and d89 and saw that the PD-1 signaling pathway was primarily down-regulated during this later part of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). The analogous pathway results for PD-1 and CTLA-4 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4, B and C</xref>, respectively. With a focus on immune checkpoint signaling, we used the linear combination method within the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software to determine pathway enrichment based on correlation with PD-1 or CTLA-4 protein expression as a continuous phenotype. With an interest in postvaccine–induced changes, we combined the d43 and d89 (omitting baseline samples) circulating lymphocyte expression sets for this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4 D</xref>). Interestingly, B cell receptor pathways negatively correlated with elevated PD-1 protein expression, while gene signatures downstream of T cell receptor activation and IL2 signaling showed negative correlations with high CTLA-4 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Furthermore, increased CTLA-4 protein levels showed strong associations with numerous IFN type I response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). As a positive validation, we observed that elevated PD-1 levels correlated well with genes in the PD-1 signaling gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>).

              <p>Here, we have tested multiple key aspects of the T cell response to cancer vaccination to identify the critical parameters for future success of vaccine approaches. We find that the amount of antigen expressed by the DC does not define the subsequent T cell response to that antigen or the clinical outcome of vaccinated patients. We observed reduced PD-1 on CD8 T cells in the best clinical responders, and we found that blocking PD-1 in the presence of DC T cell stimulation reduces PD-1 surface expression but does not increase antigen-specific T cell activity. These results contrast with those of Hobo et al. (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hobo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Van den Bergh et al., 2017</xref>), who found that reducing PD-L1/L2 by siRNA ± IL-15 trans-presentation in DC did improve expansion of MAGE-A3–specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro from healthy donors (HDs). One key difference may be that we tested PD-1–high T cells from cancer patients.</p>
              <p>Previous checkpoint blockade therapy did amplify vaccine antigen T cell responses, which persisted throughout the course of vaccination. However, our functional IFN-γ ELISPOT results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) suggest that previous checkpoint blockade did not prime these patients for higher functional T cell responses. A clear increase in MAGE-A6<sub>271–27</sub><sub>9</sub> dextramer<sup>+</sup> frequency over time suggests that expansion of a subset of MA-specific cells was enhanced, which is under further investigation. Two patients who received postvaccine checkpoint therapy had highly amplified MA-specific T cell frequencies, suggesting that the schedule of vaccination and checkpoint therapy is important for optimizing T cell responses. Whether the postvaccine checkpoint therapy triggered functional memory T cell responses in these patients is also under investigation. Protein expression profiling also confirmed increased levels of the checkpoint molecules PD-1 and CTLA-4 in circulating lymphocytes from patients with worse clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2 C</xref>). Along with the inhibitory action on T cell activation, increased expression of these immunosuppressive molecules, primarily CTLA-4 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), is associated with inferior clinical responses, both PFS and OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Despite this, differences in expression levels for PD-1 and CTLA-4 in circulating lymphocytes did not associate with IFN-γ responses from bulk PBMC or purified T cell subsets. The only significant difference found was higher CTLA-4 protein expression in the group showing an IFN-γ response in bulk PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3 A</xref>).</p>
              <p>While soluble PD-L1 has been used as a prognostic biomarker in melanoma patients treated with checkpoint blockade therapy (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), the pathophysiological significance of soluble forms of checkpoint molecules including PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in serum from cancer patients is not yet fully elucidated (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Lang, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Appleman et al., 2018</xref>), but it is beginning to be reported. Our multiplex serum analyses revealed that patients in more favorable outcome groups (PR/SD) exhibited increased levels of sPD-L2. Here, we report for the first time a suggestive association between higher sPD-L2 levels and longer OS in melanoma patients (P = 0.08; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Table S5</xref>). A recent phase 2 study in hepatocellular carcinoma surveyed PD-L2 as a circulating biomarker but did not find significant correlations with clinical responses (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Feun et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed that sPD-L2 correlates negatively with soluble LAG3 and positively with soluble TIM3, but the biological significance of these relationships remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). In this study, we quantified total T cell populations by whole blood PBMC FACS, and we further showed that the amount of regulatory T cells (T reg cells) inversely correlates with sPD-L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3 C</xref>). While the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup> T reg cells did not correlate with sPD-L2 levels, this T cell subtype, known to exhibit anti-proliferative effects on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>), was significantly elevated in melanoma patients compared with heathy controls at baseline and post–IFN-α treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3 D</xref>). This suggests that sPD-L2 may be an important biomarker in antitumor immune responses, and it will be further explored for use in predicting vaccination efficacy in melanoma patients.</p>
              <p>We used gene expression analysis to better define the changes associated with disease outcome and to identify possible vaccine-induced changes in circulating lymphocyte populations. Differential gene expression analysis in baseline lymphocytes showed higher expression of the IL-1 cytokine family member <italic>IL36G</italic> in favorable outcome patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). <italic>IL36G</italic>, <italic>CXCL19</italic>, and <italic>CXCL5</italic> were part of the leading gene sets in GSEA for the IL-22 and IL-17 signaling pathways, and in a recent report by <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2015)</xref>, it was demonstrated that IL36γ synergizes with IL12/TCR signaling to promote CD8 T cell function and induce antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, IL36γ promoted the development of tertiary lymphoid organs and increased the efficacy of a DC vaccine to inhibit tumor progression of melanoma tumorigenesis in vivo (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Weinstein et al., 2017</xref>). Additional gene sets associated with T cell differentiation, tissue chemotaxis, and immunosurveillance and good clinical response are the IL-2 and CXCR3/4 signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ross and Cantrell, 2018</xref>). Chemokine receptors play a critical role in lymphocyte-mediated tumor infiltration/regression, and reduced expression of CXCR3/4 chemokine receptors on peripheral CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes was correlated with increased metastatic properties and widespread dissemination of tumors in melanoma patients (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jacquelot et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>In this study, we used the NanoString PanCancer Immune Profiling and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–T Characterization gene expression panels, which share 276 genes in common and include 478 and 494 nonshared genes, respectively. The genes <italic>CD22</italic>, <italic>CD200</italic>, <italic>CD19</italic>, <italic>CD8B</italic>, <italic>CD40</italic>, and <italic>CXCR5</italic> were shown to be up-regulated in the favorable clinical outcome groups in the postvaccine samples using both gene expression panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5 A</xref>). Higher CD40 and CD19 expression in the good response groups was also found at the protein expression level (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition to T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules, elevated expression of CD22, CD19, and CD40 denotes the likely presence of B cells in our circulating lymphocyte population. In fact, using GSEA pathway analysis, we found numerous B cell receptor (BCR) signaling gene signatures that were enriched in lymphocytes from patients with favorable outcome groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). In addition, BCR signaling pathways were inversely associated with elevated PD-1 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). This result supports previous studies arguing for the importance of B cells in antigen-driven humoral immune responses against malignant melanoma (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chiaruttini et al., 2017</xref>). As part of the T cell characterization in this report, <italic>CD8B</italic> and CXCR5 were shown to mark a subset of memory CD4 T cells, which specialize in supporting antibody-mediated immune responses (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chevalier, et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a multi-parametric FACS analysis of melanoma-reactive CD4 T cells from stage III malignant melanoma patients revealed elevated CXCR5 expression in a subset of CD4 T cells with enhanced responsiveness to melanoma cell antigen reexposure (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to its role as a receptor for T cell priming and B cell activation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Elgueta, et al., 2009</xref>), functional expression of CD40 was shown in a recent study by <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Levin et al.

Here, we show that CTLA-4 inhibitory signaling pathway genes were primarily down-regulated after vaccination (d43), while PD-1 signaling was primarily down-regulated later (d89; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>).</p>
              <p>The CTLA-4 inhibitory signaling gene set showed the same direction of enrichment as gene sets related to CD28 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Expression levels of both of the B-7 family ligands of CD28, <italic>CD80</italic>, and <italic>CD86</italic> were greater in the poor outcome groups (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Rudd et al., 2009</xref>). Additional genes that, along with <italic>CTLA4</italic>, showed higher expression in the PD response groups were <italic>SRC</italic>, <italic>FYN</italic>, and <italic>LCK</italic>, which have been shown to modulate cellular trafficking and CTLA-4 receptor signal transduction (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Miyatake et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2001</xref>). Our gene enrichment pathway analyses and protein profiling suggest that elevated inhibitory signaling from CTLA-4 in poor outcome patients likely plays a significant role in suppressing MA-specific T cell responses to the MA-engineered DC vaccine. A combination of ipilimumab with a DC vaccine has provided encouraging and durable antitumor responses in a phase 2 study in pretreated advanced melanoma (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wilgenhof et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, these data collectively suggest that a future combination approach using CTLA-4 blockade during earlier phases of vaccine administration may facilitate early stages of MA-specific T cell activation and therefore improve patient immune responses.</p>
              <p>A clear hallmark of a poor outcome lymphocyte profile included numerous genes associated with the IFN response and TRAF6/3–mediated IRF7 activation pathways (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Konno et al., 2009</xref>). Down-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes has been previously described in patients with metastatic melanoma (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Critchley-Thorne et al., 2007</xref>), and importantly, changes in type I/II IFN signaling were shown to be involved in CD8 and CD4 T cell exhaustion (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>), which is a dysfunctional state of chronic antigen exposure in the setting of a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment or protracted viral infection (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baitsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wherry and Kurachi, 2015</xref>). T cell exhaustion gene signatures in the context of chronic viral exposure were well defined in distinct subsets of CD8 and CD4 effector and memory T cell populations (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wherry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Doering et al., 2012</xref>). We have also observed that IFN-related pathways are enriched for positive association with CTLA-4 protein expression in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). While the exact nature of the relationship between IFN pathway genes and bad outcomes in our trial is unclear, we hypothesize that the IFN/TRAF6-IRF7 gene sets up-regulated in the bad clinical outcome groups may be related to the molecular signatures of the T cell exhaustion phenotype. Relevant to these gene expression results, the complexity associated with type I/II IFN signaling in the context of checkpoint therapy resistance and immunosuppression in metastatic melanoma has been recently demonstrated (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Benci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Diaz et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to the exhaustion associated with prolonged antigen exposure, chronic IFN signaling contributes to epigenetic reprograming of tumor cells, leading to up-regulation of inhibitory T cell ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumor and immune cells, which leads to suppression of immune surveillance and tumor progression after anti–PD-1 therapy (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Benci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Diaz et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we further surveyed our gene expression data for differences in T cell exhaustion signatures in baseline and postvaccine lymphocyte samples using the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) C7 immunological gene database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5, B and C</xref>). We found that differentially expressed genes between the two outcome groups showed enrichments in several gene sets defined by contrasting exhausted CD8 T cells with other T cell subsets. The good outcome group showed enrichments for genes that are highly expressed in effector and memory CD8 T cells in contrast to exhausted T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5, B–D</xref>). While it is difficult to attribute a clear exhaustion phenotype to either outcome category, it is important to ask whether the increased expression of effector/memory genes in lymphocytes may correlate with better MA responses and better clinical outcomes in patients. We also note that our analyses considered virally induced T cell exhaustion signatures, which may not fully represent changes associated with tumor-induced exhaustion and that the gene panels used here do not include a comprehensive probe set of exhaustion molecules. Future studies using FACS-based single-cell targeted technology may more precisely characterize the relationships between T cell activation and exhaustion profiles in the MA-specific T cells from distinct patient outcome groups.</p>
              <p>In summary, our examination of lymphocyte and tumor gene and protein expression changes from baseline to 1 mo after vaccine confirmed that both immune checkpoint signaling pathways and IFN response gene networks play important roles in the response to cancer vaccines. These data, combined with the checkpoint blockade schedule effects, suggest potential future combination trials.</p>

                <p>A phase 1 single-site study was performed to evaluate the immunological effects of autologous monocyte-derived DCs transduced with tyrosinase, MART-1, and MAGE-A6 genes (by replication-defective AdV AdVTMM2) in 35 subjects with recurrent, unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Butterfield et al., 2019</xref>). The clinical trial reported was fully approved by the University of Pittsburgh protocol review committee and institutional review board (PRO12010416, #UPCI09–021) and had Food and Drug Administration investigational new drug #15044 and NCT01622933 (clinical data finalized April 2018). All patients and donors provided informed consent (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Butterfield et al., 2019</xref>). Monocytes and lymphocytes were isolated by elutriation of the leukapheresis from each patient. The monocyte fraction was plated and differentiated into DCs with GM-CSF+IL-4 for 5 d, then matured by the addition of IFN-γ+LPS overnight. Patient vaccines were prepared by harvesting matured DCs and transducing them with AdVTMM2. Cells from baseline and after DC vaccination at d43 and after observation or 1 mo of high-dose IFN-α (d89 or 101, hereafter “89”) were cryopreserved in 50% RPMI (Gibco), 40% human AB serum, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). HD blood samples were used as controls and obtained by venipuncture under informed consent (UPCI #04-001). HD PBMCs were purified by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and either used immediately or cryopreserved as above until use. All thawed specimens were &gt;80% viable upon thaw. Peripheral blood flow cytometry was described previously (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Butterfield et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
                <p>Of the 35 patients who were vaccinated, 31 had ELISPOT data for PBMCs from both d0 and d43 (this testing of total PBMCs was used to check for balance in T cell responses between the observation and IFN-α trial arms); four patients progressed before collection of the d43 blood sample. 28 patients had data available from the second ELISPOT assay (testing purified CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets), which was performed using samples from all three time points, but only 20 of 28 had d89 specimens due to progression (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Butterfield et al., 2019</xref>). Patients were only excluded from a particular analysis if there were no specimens available or if they were not able to be tested in the assay (the MHC dextramer analysis used a reagent based on the HLA-A*0201 allele and was only performed for HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients).</p>

Additional ELISPOT assays were performed on purified CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and included responses in HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients to immunodominant peptides on T2 cells. To quantify specific responses to the melanoma-associated antigens (MA), the AdVLacZ response was subtracted from the AdV-MA response, and positivity was defined as &gt;10 spots counted per well and at least a twofold increase over baseline.</p>

The NanoString nCounter platform was used for targeted mRNA and protein expression analyses. The NanoString PanCancer Immune Profiling (770 genes) and CAR-T Characterization (780 genes) panels were used to profile gene expression in circulating lymphocytes, and the NanoString PanCancer Progression panel (770 genes plus 30 custom targets) was used for profiling of optimal cutting temperature–embedded melanoma tumor samples. The expression of 30 target proteins was analyzed using the Vantage 3D Protein Solid Tumor Panel. Raw protein count data were preprocessed by applying background thresholding and content normalization in NanoString nSolver 4.0. For gene expression analysis, the R package NanoStringNorm (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Waggott et al., 2012</xref>; version 1.2.1) was used for preprocessing of the raw count data (background subtraction and normalization to housekeeping genes).

A log<sub>2</sub> fold change of two and P value threshold of 0.05 were used to determine statistical significance. For outcome-based comparisons, samples were grouped into two clinical outcome categories: good (SD, NED1 [recurrence &gt;18 mo], PR) and bad (PD, NED2 [recurrence &lt;18 mo]). GSEA was conducted using gene sets from the MSigDB (version 6.2) in the C2 curated gene category (2005, PNAS 102, 15545–15550). Plots were generated using the R package ggplot2 (version 3.1.1) and the javaGSEA application (version 3.0; all NanoString panels are for research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures). Patients’ banked specimens were prioritized for this analysis based on tumor specimen availability and the availability of multiple blood samples that were matched to tumor time points and obtained from elutriated leukapheresis (and not processed as Ficolled PBMCs from patients who may have refused the second or third requested leukapheresis procedure) to avoid any impact of sample processing methods on the analysis.</p>
