                <p>To identify molecular alterations in prostate cancers associating with relapse following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical prostatectomy patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer were enrolled into a phase I-II clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and mitoxantrone followed by prostatectomy. Pre-treatment prostate tissue was acquired by needle biopsy and post-treatment tissue was acquired by prostatectomy. Prostate cancer gene expression measurements were determined in 31 patients who completed 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We identified 141 genes with significant transcript level alterations following chemotherapy that associated with subsequent biochemical relapse. This group included the transcript encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). <italic>In vitro</italic>, cytotoxic chemotherapy induced the expression of MAOA and elevated MAOA levels enhanced cell survival following docetaxel exposure. MAOA activity increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and increased the expression and nuclear translocation of HIF1α. The suppression of MAOA activity using the irreversible inhibitor clorgyline augmented the apoptotic responses induced by docetaxel. In summary, we determined that the expression of MAOA is induced by exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy, increases HIF1α, and contributes to docetaxel resistance. As MAOA inhibitors have been approved for human use, regimens combining MAOA inhibitors with docetaxel may improve clinical outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite numerous clinical trials conducted over a span of more than four decades, few interventions have extended survival in patients with advanced castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Among these are the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel which results in a median life-span extension of about 2 months, though few patients sustain durable complete remissions <xref rid="pone.0104271-Tannock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104271-Petrylak1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For several types of solid tumors, notably neoplasms of the breast <xref rid="pone.0104271-Shannon1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and colon <xref rid="pone.0104271-OConnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, cytotoxic drugs administered in conjunction with surgery or radiation have demonstrated survival benefits for those clinically-localized tumors with features indicating a predilection for early micrometastasis, or those with only documented local or regional spread. However, to date no studies have demonstrated a benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to primary surgical or radiotherapy approaches for prostate cancer as determined by outcomes of disease relapse or survival rates. Further, of five clinical studies evaluating neoadjuvant docetaxel alone or combined with other agents prior to prostatectomy, pathological complete responses are extremely rare <xref rid="pone.0104271-Dreicer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0104271-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These results indicate that prostate cancers either exhibit a high degree of intrinsic resistance to taxanes and other cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs, and/or rapidly acquire refractory phenotypes. Defining mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance is critical for selecting patients who may optimally benefit from specific regimens, and for designing new therapeutic strategies that either avoid – or specifically target resistance pathways.</p>
              <p>To identify molecular changes associated with tumor cell exposure to chemotherapy agents commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer, we conducted a prospective phase I-II clinical trial of neoadjuvant docetaxel and mitoxantrone in patients with high-risk localized prostate adenocarcinoma <xref rid="pone.0104271-Garzotto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. There were no complete pathological responses identified at the time of prostatectomy, and thus tumors analyzed after docetaxel and mitoxantrone exposure are presumably enriched for cells with molecular features contributing to therapy resistance. Although residual viable tumor cells were identified in each case, chemotherapy effects were evident <xref rid="pone.0104271-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We previously reported the results of profiling gene expression changes in microdissected tumors acquired in the context of this study and found that post-therapy gene expression varied substantially between individuals <xref rid="pone.0104271-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the short follow-up interval post-therapy precluded analyses to determine if gene expression changes were associated with tumor recurrence, a situation expected to occur through the survival and subsequent proliferation of subclinical micrometastasis present at the time of initial treatment.</p>
              <p>In the present study we sought to test the hypothesis that gene expression changes in prostate cancer cells following exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy would associate with clinical outcomes. The median follow-up of the cohort of prostate cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel and mitoxantrone was 40 months at the time of this analysis. Molecular changes associating with relapse included increases in transcripts encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). MAOA is a key enzyme involved in the degradation of the biogenic and dietary monoamine neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, or serotonin) and norepinephrine. Amine metabolism is linked to essential cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation, and the catalytic byproducts of MAOA, such as hydrogen peroxide, are known to cause oxidative damage with implications for cancer, aging and neurodegenerative processes. We previously found that MAOA expression was upregulated in prostate cancers in association with higher Gleason grades <xref rid="pone.0104271-True1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but mechanisms modulating cytotoxic drug effects have not been established. Two features of MAOA provided additional rationale for studies of this enzyme in the context of therapy resistance: approved inhibitors of MAOA are currently in routine clinical use for psychiatric illness and the safety and toxicity profiles are established. Second, MAOA enzymatic properties have been exploited to develop positron-emission tomography (PET)-based imaging reagents for localizing MAOA activity in humans. These features provide a clear path for the rapid clinical evaluation of MAOA as a therapeutic target in the context of advanced prostate cancer once sufficient preclinical evidence of roles in therapy resistance are established.</p>

Significant gene lists were determined by a threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. The association of expression change of MAOA and time to PSA relapse was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model (Stata 8.0, Texus). Multivariate models included age, clinical stage, pathology Gleason grade, baseline PSA level, and post-chemotherapy MAOA expression change. The final model only included factors meeting a significance threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.1. The statistical significance of assays of MAOA activity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis was evaluated using a Student's t test for 2-group comparisons. A value of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered to be significant. The Statistical Analysis of Microarray (SAM) program was used to analyze expression differences between control and MAOA transcript profiles using unpaired, two-sample t tests and controlled for multiple testing by estimation of q-values using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. To determine the association between MAOA and HIF1 changes following chemotherapy Pearson correlations were utilized. Finally, the statistical significance of data generated in the xenograft experiments were evaluated with the Proc GLM (General Linear Model) procedure in SAS (Cary, NC) utilizing a significance threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>

At a median follow-up time of 40 months, using an intermediate end-point of serum PSA≥0.4 ng/ml and rising as a surrogate indicator of ultimate progression to metastasis <xref rid="pone.0104271-Stephenson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 11 out of 31 patients were determined to have biochemical progression. Of the chemotherapy-associated gene expression changes, 141 were significantly associated with PSA relapse-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104271-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104271.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>). Several of these differentially-altered genes have previously been shown to influence chemotherapy resistance in other malignancies. For example, we found that down regulation of topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) associated with a higher rate of biochemical recurrence following chemotherapy. Low TOP2A levels have been associated with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> resistance to chemotherapeutics including the TOP2A poison doxorubicin <xref rid="pone.0104271-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104271-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104271-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>Of those transcripts upregulated in neoplastic epithelial cells following chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104271-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>), we focused further on monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), as we previously found MAOA to be upregulated in localized prostate cancers, with higher expression in poorly-differentiated relative to well-differentiated tumors <xref rid="pone.0104271-True1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To confirm the microarray findings, we used qRT-PCR to assess MAOA transcripts in microdissected prostate cancers from the same patient before and after chemotherapy. In 18 of the 31 cases (58%) MAOA expression increased following treatment, and corresponding increases in MAOA protein levels were observed in three of three cases with elevated MAOA transcripts and sufficient tumor material in both pre- and post-treatment samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104271-g001"><bold>Figure 1C,D</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>We incorporated the magnitude of MAOA mRNA alterations in a univariate Cox Proportional Hazard Model to estimate hazard ratios of several risk factors including age, baseline serum PSA before chemotherapy, pathologic stage, and histological Gleason grade, using time to PSA relapse as the clinical outcome. Of these variables, only greater MAOA transcript change and higher Gleason grade were significantly associated with biochemical failure after chemotherapy and prostatectomy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104271-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). In order to measure the net effect of MAOA expression change associated with time to PSA relapse, we further fit MAOA expression change and prostatectomy Gleason grade into a multivariate Cox Proportional Hazard Model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104271-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). After adjusting for Gleason grade, the expression change of MAOA was marginally associated with time to PSA relapse (hazard ratio = 1.55, <italic>p</italic> = 0.068): the reduction in hazard ratio suggests that MAOA expression and status of tumor differentiation are associated.</p>

                <p>To determine if chemotherapy directly influenced MAOA expression and to evaluate the influence of MAOA on cellular phenotypes, we measured steady-state MAOA expression in several androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive prostate epithelial cell lines.

VCaP cells also expressed relatively high amounts of MAOA compared BPH-1 and 22RV1 prostate epithelial cells while androgen-insensitive DU145 and PC-3 showed limited, but detectable MAOA protein expression. None of the prostate cancer cell lines expressed appreciable levels of MAOB (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104271.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). We treated the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line with increasing concentrations of docetaxel ranging from 1 to 100 nM.

                <p>We next sought to determine mechanisms by which MAOA could influence cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Monoamine oxidase enzymatic activity regulates oxidative deamination reactions of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Byproducts of this reaction include reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104271-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>).

ROS have been shown to activate several signaling programs including NFκB, MAP-kinase, and HIF1A. We determined that relative to control PC3 cells, PC3-MAOA cells expressed elevated levels of nuclear HIF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104271-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>For reasons that remain unclear, adenocarcinomas arising in the prostate appear to be particularly resistant to the cytotoxic effects of commonly used anti-neoplastic drugs <xref rid="pone.0104271-Tannock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104271-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104271-MagiGalluzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To identify resistance mechanisms, we designed a clinical trial to assess molecular features of tumor cells that associate with effects of chemotherapy exposure <italic>in situ</italic>. Among the gene expression changes we found to be altered by treatment, transcript levels of the gene encoding MAOA correlated with clinical relapse as defined by a rising PSA following radical prostatectomy. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies confirmed that docetaxel exposure increased the expression of MAOA in multiple prostate cancer cell lines, and inhibition of MAOA enzymatic activity using MAOA inhibitors enhanced the cytotoxicity of docetaxel.</p>
              <p>Monoamine oxidase enzymes function to catalyze oxidative deamination reactions of neurotransmitters. Inhibition of MAO activity results in elevated levels of these amines in the central nervous system, a property responsible for antidepressant effects. Monoamine oxidase is encoded by two isozymes, MAOA and MAOB arranged in opposite orientation on the X chromosome, and expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane in many diverse tissues throughout the body. MAOB preferentially metabolizes phenylethylamine and dopamine. MAOA metabolizes dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine, though the dietary sympathomimetic tyramine is also a clinically-relevant substrate. Studies of MAO expression or activity in the context of cell growth, stress responses, apoptosis and neoplasia have primarily focused on cells derived from the central nervous system. Most of the available data indicate that biogenic amines serve as antiapoptotic factors and protect mitochondria against pro-apoptotic events by permitting closure of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and preventing the initiation or propagation of the pro-apoptotic cascade <xref rid="pone.0104271-Toninello1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In studies of neuronal cells, MAO inhibitors, leading to higher intracellular concentrations of monoamines and reduced production of reaction products such as H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub>, function to protect cells from pro-apoptotic stimuli <xref rid="pone.0104271-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0104271-Maragos2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A similar protective effect of MAO inhibitors toward melanoma cells has also been observed <xref rid="pone.0104271-Toninello1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Further, studies of prostate cancer cells have demonstrated that serotonin, an MAO substrate, and serotonin receptor activity, associate with enhanced prostate cancer cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0104271-Dizeyi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104271-Siddiqui1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In contrast to reports indicating that inhibiting MAO activity exerts effects that restrain tumor growth, several lines of evidence support a role for MAO in cancer promotion or progression. We previously found that MAOA expression correlated with prostate tumor cell differentiation status, with higher MAOA levels associated with higher Gleason patterns <xref rid="pone.0104271-True1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Subsequent studies demonstrated that MAOA inhibits prostate cell differentiation <xref rid="pone.0104271-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and the MAOA inhibitor clorgyline is capable of suppressing pro-oncogenic programs in prostate cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0104271-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The expression of several other amine oxidases are increased in various cancer types such as those arising in the lung, breast, liver, and cervix <xref rid="pone.0104271-Toninello1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Of interest, the administration of L-deprenyl, an inhibitor of MAOB, resulted in significant reductions in tumor incidence in a rodent model of carcinogen-induced breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0104271-ThyagaRajan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. While a component of the anti-tumor effects were hypothesized to result from indirect activity toward prolactin production as well as neural-immune responses, direct effects of L-deprenyl on tumor cells were not ruled out.</p>
              <p>An important area of inquiry centers on defining the mechanism(s) by which monoamine oxidases modulate tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance, and the corollary studies to determine how inhibitors of MAOA enhance chemotherapy sensitivity. The physiological functions of amine oxidases remain to be completely established, but known byproducts of amine metabolism include H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and hydroxyl radicals that have the ability to promote MAP-kinase signaling through redox-sensitive pathways <xref rid="pone.0104271-Toninello1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our data indicate that one mechanism of therapy resistance links MAOA with the generation of ROS and activation of HIF1α. HIF1α expression – both protein stabilization and transcription, is promoted by elevated cellular ROS <xref rid="pone.0104271-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Several studies have demonstrated that elevated HIF1α enhances cell survival in the context of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation <xref rid="pone.0104271-Patiar1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0104271-Dewhirst1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, further investigations into MAOA-mediated therapy resistance mechanisms should seek to determine if the primary effects of MAOA inhibition on prostate cancer treatment responses operate through HIF1α versus other ROS-dependent or ROS-independent pathways.</p>
              <p>Two additional attributes of MAOA provide further impetus for studies involving therapy for prostate carcinoma. First, tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of MAOA activity have been developed. For example, [11C] clorgyline and L-[11C] deprenyl have been used to image MAOA and MAOB, respectively, in studies of CNS enzyme activity <xref rid="pone.0104271-Fowler1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The MAOA ligand Harmine has also been labeled with [11C] and used to image a subset of neuroendocrine carcinoid and pancreatic tumors <xref rid="pone.0104271-Orlefors1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. These tracers offer the opportunity to quantitate the on-target effectiveness of inhibitors, as well as overall tumor responses. A second notable feature of MAO involves a recent finding that MAO blockade appears to exhibit differential cytoprotective effects toward benign versus malignant tissues <xref rid="pone.0104271-Seymour1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Nontumorigenic and tumorigenic human cells were treated with MAOA and MAOB inhibitors, and exposed to gamma irradiation or cisplatin chemotherapy. The MAO inhibitors reduced radiation effects in the benign, but not the malignant cells, and MAO inhibition further suppressed the growth of malignant cells relative to those exposed only to radiation. MAO inhibitors also reduced cell death due to chemotherapy exposure in the benign but not malignant cells. Though the selective and irreversible MAOA inhibitor clorgyline is not available for clinical use due to adverse side-effect profiles, compounds that inhibit both MAOA and MAOB such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine, or reversible competitive inhibitors with excellent selectivity toward MAOA such as moclobemide, are approved for use as antidepressants in several countries. Exploiting their potential to enhance the effectiveness of therapies for prostate cancer could be evaluated rapidly.</p>
