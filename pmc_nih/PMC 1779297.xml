                <p>In the prevailing model of HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection, dendritic cells (DCs) capture and internalize intact virions and transfer these virions to interacting T cells at the virological synapse. Here, we show that HIV-1 virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> from in vitro derived DCs to T cells principally originate from the surface of DCs. Selective neutralization of surface-bound virions abrogated <italic>trans</italic>-infection by monocyte-derived DCs and CD34-derived Langerhans cells. Under conditions mimicking antigen recognition by the interacting T cells, most transferred virions still derived from the cell surface, although a few were transferred from an internal compartment. Our findings suggest that attachment inhibitors could neutralize <italic>trans</italic>-infection of T cells by DCs in vivo.</p>

                <p>Dendritic cells (DCs) patrol peripheral mucosal sites, capturing and processing potential pathogens into antigenic peptides for presentation to T cells of lymphoid organs, and thereby initiating an immune response. HIV-1 had been proposed to use DCs as “Trojan horses,” hiding inside the DCs and surviving the degradation pathway to gain access to the lymph nodes and spread to the T cells. Our study challenges this “Trojan horse” model by showing that only HIV-1 virions bound to the surface of DCs, and not internalized virions, are transmitted to T cells. Even when T cells specifically recognized the antigen presented by DCs, the infection of T cells was principally mediated by virions remaining at the surface of the DCs. Interestingly, in this context of antigen-specific recognition, which increases the trafficking toward the immunological synapse of DC internal vesicles, where HIV-1 virions seem to hide, a few internal virions could infect T cells. Our findings suggest that in vivo transmission to T cells of HIV-1 virions captured by DCs should be more sensitive to neutralization than previously expected.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>To ensure their survival, microbial pathogens have evolved strategies to subvert the action of cellular components of the host immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs). DCs patrol peripheral mucosal sites, capturing and processing potential pathogens into antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II to CD4 T cells in lymphoid organs, initiating an immune response (for a review, see [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). HIV-1 has been proposed to usurp this natural function of DCs to spread efficiently. HIV-1 entering the body via the mucosa and other peripheral sites may be transported by DCs to CD4 T cells deeper in the mucosa or in lymphoid organs [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. HIV-1 that reaches lymphoid organs can also take advantage of the formation of DC–T-cell conjugates to promote its replication and spread [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>DCs can transmit HIV-1 to T cells via two pathways. In the de novo pathway, DCs are actively infected with HIV, leading to the budding and spread of new virions to neighboring CD4 T cells. In the prevailing model of the <italic>trans</italic> pathway, intact HIV-1 virions are captured by alternative HIV-1 receptors, which bind virions without triggering fusion, and internalized into clustered compartments resembling late endosome/multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. After interacting with a CD4 T cell, HIV-1–loaded DCs redistribute the virion-containing vesicles to the virological synapse [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 receptors on T cells are recruited to this region, facilitating <italic>trans</italic>-infection [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>How HIV-1 virions survive the uptake pathway designed to capture and cleave pathogens into peptides for antigen presentation remains unknown. HIV-1 could divert the intracellular trafficking of immunological synapse components to avoid degradation and thus survive until later transmitted to T cells. Alternatively, external virions could be transmitted to CD4 T cells since some HIV-1 virions remain deeply tangled in membrane protrusions and microvilli of the plasma membrane [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Using functional assays that detect virion fusion and productive infection of CD4 T cells, we investigated whether <italic>trans</italic>-infection is mediated through internalized or external HIV-1 virions in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) and CD34-derived Langerhans cells (LCs).</p>

                <title>Mature MDDCs Transmit HIV-1 to T Cells Primarily via the <italic>trans</italic> Pathway while Immature MDDCs Preferentially Transmit R5-Tropic HIV-1 via the De Novo Pathway</title>
                <p>The potential effects of the state of DC maturation and coreceptor utilization by HIV virions in the <italic>trans</italic> and the de novo pathways in HIV-1 transmission from DCs to T cells were evaluated. These studies were performed with immature MDDCs or MDDCs matured with tumor necrosis factor α and poly(I:C) [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and with two laboratory-adapted viral strains, CXCR4-tropic NL4–3 and CCR5-tropic 81A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>). MDDCs were incubated with virions at 4 °C to promote viral binding and were then either added to autologous activated T cells immediately or incubated for 1 to 5 d at 37 °C before mixing the autologous T cells. The MDDCs were then incubated with T cells for 24 h to allow virion transfer to T cells. After an additional 2 d of incubation in the presence of azidothymidine (AZT), productive infection of T cells was measured by immunostaining with anti-p24<sup>Gag</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Transmission of 81A (R5-tropic) virions from immature MDDCs to T cells was biphasic, as reported [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The early phase (0 to 1 d) involved the <italic>trans</italic> pathway; the later phase (1 to 5 d) involved the de novo pathway and was sensitive to the HIV protease inhibitor amprenavir (not shown). During the first day, 25% of R5-tropic 81A virions were transmitted by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway; 75% were transmitted by the de novo pathway over the ensuing 4 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In mature MDDCs, however, approximately 93% of virions were transmitted by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway during the first day. X4-tropic NL4–3 virions were transmitted by both immature and mature MDDCs principally by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Similar results were obtained when MDDCs were analyzed from nine different normal donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>

                <p>In vivo, DCs may not immediately interact with T cells after virion capture. Accordingly, we investigated how a delay in T-cell contact might affect transmission through the <italic>trans</italic> pathway with a virion-based HIV-1 fusion assay [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. MDDCs loaded with HIV-1 virions containing β-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) were incubated with autologous T cells, and fusion to CD4 T cells was monitored by the changes in fluorescence of CCF2, a BlaM substrate loaded into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). When NL4–3 virions were presented immediately after binding to mature MDDCs, up to 24% of CD4 T cells displayed BlaM activity, indicating virion fusion. Transmission was less efficient when virions were presented by immature MDDCs. Fewer 81A than NL4–3 virions were transmitted, likely because there were fewer CCR5- than CXCR4-expressing cells in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). When virions were presented by MDDCs after incubation at 37 °C for up to 120 min, transmission efficiency decreased sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) in both immature and mature MDDCs. This rapid decrease was not due to a relative lack of sensitivity of the fusion assay in the context of <italic>trans</italic>-infection. As in our previous studies of T-cell infection with free virions, the fusion assay proved to be both sensitive and quantitative over a broad range of viral inputs in these DC–T-cell mixing experiments [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030004-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection from MDDCs to autologous CD4 T cells is efficient only for a limited time after virion capture.</p>
                <p>Our results show that immature DCs preferentially transmit R5-tropic HIV-1 by the de novo pathway, as described [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and X4-tropic HIV-1 by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Mature DCs transmit both R5- and X4-tropic virions mainly by the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Since immature DCs are present at mucosal sites of viral entry, while mature DCs reside in lymph nodes and in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), HIV-1 may exploit different transmission strategies at different anatomic sites in vivo. In healthy mucosa, immature DCs are likely to transmit R5-tropic HIV-1 principally via the de novo pathway, especially since the efficiency of the <italic>trans</italic> pathway declines rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]); the <italic>trans</italic> pathway might contribute to the local spread of virus from mucosal immature DCs to macrophages and CD4 T cells. However, in inflamed mucosal epithelium, which contains a greater proportion of mature DCs, HIV-1 transmission might preferentially involve the <italic>trans</italic> pathway, as in human cervical explants [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In lymph nodes and GALT, the proximity of mature DCs to T cells would further favor the <italic>trans</italic> pathway. Since DC–T-cell conjugates are major sites of HIV-1 production [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], <italic>trans-</italic>infection could be critical in the intense viral replication that characterizes the acute and chronic phases of untreated HIV-1 infection.</p>

                <title>Neutralizing Surface-Bound Virions on DCs Abrogates <italic>trans</italic>-Infection</title>
                <p>To identify the cellular compartment from which HIV-1 is transmitted <italic>in trans,</italic> we selectively neutralized surface-bound HIV-1 virions with truncated recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4; AIDS Reagent Program [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), which binds the HIV-1 envelope gp120 protein and prevents engagement of CD4 on T cells. Cells were treated at 4 °C to protect internalized virions from sCD4 exposure. NL4–3 virions containing BlaM-Vpr were bound to MDDCs and allowed to internalize, and cell-surface virions were neutralized with sCD4. In the absence of an internalization step, surface-bound virions on immature and mature MDDCs effectively fused to CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; bars 1 and 3); this fusion was effectively blocked by sCD4 (bars 2 and 4). However, when HIV-1 virions were internalized at 37 °C for 30 min before treatment (bars 5 to 8), sCD4 still inhibited virion fusion (bars 6 and 8). To confirm that sCD4 neutralized surface-bound virions without impairing subsequent virion transfer, two sets of HIV-1 virions were successively bound to immature MDDCs, but only the first was neutralized with sCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Similar amounts of HIV-1 fused to T cells regardless of the presence of previously neutralized cell-surface virions on the DCs (bars 3 and 5). Thus, sCD4 does not interfere with virological synapse formation or the transfer of virions bound after sCD4 treatment.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>To further confirm the absence of virion transfer from internal cellular compartments, we performed sequential loading of HIV-1 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP-HIV) and then HIV-1 expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (CFP-HIV) [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). GFP-HIV was bound to MDDCs and incubated at 37 °C to allow virion internalization. Some residual GFP-HIV virions remained at the surface. Next, CFP-HIV was bound but kept at 4 °C to prevent virion internalization. MDDCs were then incubated with autologous T cells for 48 h. sCD4 treatment after binding and internalization of GFP-HIV but before CFP-HIV binding fully blocked transmission of GFP-HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, middle panel), indicating that residual surface-bound GFP-HIV was the source of virus for transmission to T cells (left panel). Under these conditions, CFP-HIV was still transferred to T cells, confirming that sCD4 treatment did not affect subsequent transfer of virions and was not inherently harmful. In the absence of treatment, many double-positive GFP<sup>+</sup>CFP<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed, indicating that more than one virion can be transmitted to each T cell (left panel).</p>
                <p>Thus, the neutralization studies showed that only surface-bound, but not internalized, HIV virions mediated <italic>trans</italic>-infection from MDDCs to T cells. sCD4 likely neutralizes HIV-1 virions by competing for viral binding to the CD4 receptor on T cells, as intact HIV-1 virions, including gp120, remained associated with the MDDCs after treatment (unpublished data). Although sCD4 has been reported to allow HIV-1 fusion to cells that do not express CD4 [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], sCD4 did not induce fusion to CD4<sup>–</sup> cells in our experiments, as demonstrated by the absence of BlaM transfer to CD8 T cells or B cells (not shown).</p>
                <p>Next, we stripped surface HIV virions from MDDCs by proteolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). GFP-HIV was again allowed to bind and internalize. CFP-HIV was restricted to the surface of MDDCs and served as a control for neutralization by the proteolytic enzymes. MDDCs loaded with GFP-HIV and CFP-HIV were then treated with trypsin as described [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or pronase and incubated for 2 d with T cells. Trypsin treatment did not effectively remove externally bound CFP-HIV virions (unpublished data). However, in the presence of increasing amounts of pronase, fewer surface-bound CFP-HIV virions were transmitted to T cells, indicating increasingly effective removal the surface-bound HIV-1 by this protease cocktail. However, pronase had the same effect on the transfer of GFP-HIV, whether it had been internalized or not. Thus, successfully transmitted GFP-HIV virions appear to originate from the cell surface rather than from an internal, pronase-resistant compartment in MDDCs.</p>
                <p>We considered the possibility that the low levels of transmission in the presence of sCD4 could correspond to transmission events from internalized HIV-1, masked under our experimental conditions. However, changes in viral input, internalization time, and viral strains failed to reveal significant transfer from internal compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). We also studied a second type of DC, LCs derived from CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood cells (MatTek; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mattek.com">http://www.mattek.com</ext-link>). As observed in MDDCs, the transfer of HIV virions from LCs to allogenic T cells again was mediated by virions bound at the surface of the LCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030004-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Since MDDCs and LCs derived from CD34 progenitors are excellent surrogates of in vivo DCs, we conclude that most virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> in vivo likely originate from the cell surface.</p>
                <p>These results in MDDCs and LCs sharply contrast with the report that formed the basis for the prevailing model of <italic>trans</italic>-infection [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In that report, surface-bound virions were neutralized by proteolytic digestion with trypsin. Although in our hands trypsin did not digest surface-bound virions as potently as pronase, the discordance of results likely lies in the use of different reporter systems. Kwon et al. [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] used a luciferase reporter that does not allow the distinction between infection of T cells or MDDCs. Since the immature MDDCs used in that study are highly susceptible to fusion with the R5-tropic BaL envelopes [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and efficiently replicate CCR5-tropic HIV-1 [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the luciferase activity may have derived from infected immature MDDCs, not T cells, in the coculture. Our flow-based assays, which permit a clear distinction between infection of T cells and MDDCs in coculture, reveal that HIV-1 virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> are sensitive to pronase treatment.</p>
                <p>Our results also differ from three later studies, further supporting the notion that HIV infection of T cells by DCs involves the transfer of internalized virions from DCs to interacting CD4 T cells [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. McDonald et al. [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed the recruitment of “trypsin-resistant” HIV-1 virions to the immunological synapse; however, functional assays were not performed to confirm that the interacting CD4 T cells were actually infected by the recruited virions. We suspect that, while virions may be transported to the synapse, these virions are not successfully transmitted. Wiley et al. [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed the release of infectious virions from HIV-1–loaded MDDCs, even after surface-bound virions were removed with trypsin. However, the efficacy of the trypsin treatment was only controlled in the experiments measuring the release of p24<sup>Gag</sup> in the supernatant, not in studies measuring the infectivity of these virions. Finally, Ganesh et al. [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed the transfer of some virions from MDDCs to T cells in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, a surprising result in light of our findings with sCD4. In their study, the efficacy of the antibody neutralization was measured with free virions but not with MDDCs bearing only surface-bound HIV-1 virions. The amount of antibody required to neutralize free virions might be lower than the amount needed to neutralize surface-bound virions on MDDCs, a possibility that would explain our divergent results. Of note, our findings are supported by a recent study showing that, in Raji cells expressing DC-SIGN (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin), surface-bound rather than internalized virions are transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> to 293T cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

                <title><italic>trans</italic>-Infection in the Context of Superantigen Stimulation</title>
                <p>Several reports have suggested that captured HIV-1 virions are stored in MVBs, raising the possibility that HIV-1 mediates <italic>trans</italic>-infection of T cells by highjacking a pathway involved in the trafficking of internal vesicles to the immunological synapse. In DCs, the transport of MHC class II from the MVB to the immunological synapse requires a T-cell–mediated signal [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Only T cells of the appropriate antigen specificity trigger this transport. Since antigen recognition could mobilize the release of HIV-1 virions from the MVB, we investigated <italic>trans</italic>-infection in the context of stimulation with a superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

                <p>NL4–3 virions containing BlaM-Vpr were bound at 4 °C to SEB-pulsed MDDCs. Viral transfer to autologous purified CD4 T cells was measured after allowing virion internalization, or not, by MDDCs. Again, sCD4 completely blocked HIV-1 transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). However, since the fusion assay does not require T-cell activation to generate a positive signal, <italic>trans</italic>-infection could be detected in the absence of engagement of the T-cell receptor and MHC class II. To further ensure that transfer was analyzed only when the MDDCs and T cells were effectively engaged, we measured productive infection of resting T cells by immunostaining for p24<sup>Gag</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Only T cells stimulated by SEB-loaded MDDCs are rendered permissive by releasing a postentry restriction block created by APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Again, the vast majority of transmission events were neutralized by sCD4. However, under these experimental conditions, a few virions were transmitted from an sCD4-resistant compartment, as evidenced by the slight increase in transfer when SEB-loaded MDDCs were allowed to internalize HIV-1 virions at 37 °C. These transmission events were not due to new virion production by MDDCs since similar results were observed when AZT was added after 24 h of coincubation of MDDCs and T cells. When SEB-pulsed MDDCs were allowed to internalize HIV-1 virions for a longer period, HIV-1 virion transfer slightly increased peaking at 1 h of internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030004-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Subsequently, the efficiency of transfer from internal compartments decreased, likely as a consequence of degradation or inactivation of the internalized virions.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, HIV-1 virions transmitted <italic>in trans</italic> from DCs to T cells principally originate from the surface of DCs, except during antigen recognition, when a few internalized virions may also be transmitted to the antigen-specific T cells. Whether these rare events contribute to the preferential infection and elimination of HIV-specific T cells in vivo [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is not known. Nevertheless, even within this context, the vast majority of transmitted virions are derived from the surface of DCs. Our results do not challenge the prevailing view that HIV-1 virions are internalized in the DCs. Indeed, we detected large amounts of internalized HIV-1 virions by microscopy. However, unless HIV-1–loaded DCs encounter T cells of the appropriate specificity, virion internalization appears to be a dead end for HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic>-infection. Since the C-type lectin receptors involved in <italic>trans</italic>-infection are localized in lipid rafts [<xref rid="ppat-0030004-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], surface-bound HIV-1 likely exploits the clustering of lipid rafts at the immunological synapse to enhance <italic>trans</italic>-infection of CD4 T cells. Because <italic>trans</italic>-infection principally involves surface-bound virions, our findings suggest that attachment inhibitors could be used to limit <italic>trans</italic>-infection of T cells by DCs, in vivo.</p>

NL4–3 virions containing BlaM-Vpr (500 ng of p24<sup>Gag</sup>) were allowed to bind at 4 °C to the MDDCs; as indicated, cells were incubated for 30 min to 4 h at 37 °C to allow internalization. Surface-bound virions were then neutralized or not with sCD4. The HIV-loaded MDDCs were added to autologous purified resting CD4 T cells, and <italic>trans</italic>-infection was measured with the fusion assay at 2 h or by measuring productive infection after 3 d of coculture. Productively infected T cells were identified by intracellular immunostaining for p24<sup>Gag</sup> combined with antibodies against CD3, CD4, and CD1a. We then measured the percentage of p24<sup>Gag+</sup>CD4<sup>–</sup> cells in the CD3<sup>+</sup>CD1a<sup>–</sup> population.</p>

                  <p>Serial dilutions (A) or 500 ng (B and C) of virions containing BlaM-Vpr was bound to MDDCs. Where indicated, viral strains other than NL4–3 were used (C). Virions were then internalized (or not) at 37 °C for 30 min (A and C) or for increasing amounts of time (B). After sCD4 treatment at 4 °C to inactivate surface virions, the loaded DCs were incubated with PBLs. Curves represent the transfer of HIV-1 from immature or mature MDDCs to T cells in the presence or absence of sCD4 treatment.</p>
