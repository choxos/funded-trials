                  <p>This phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted at two hospitals in Bangladesh assessed effects on renal function, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of acetaminophen.

                  <p>Between 2012 and 2014, 62 patients were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (n = 31) or no acetaminophen (n = 31). Median (interquartile range) reduction in creatinine after 72 hours was 23% (37% to 18%) in patients assigned to acetaminophen, versus 14% (29% to 0%) in patients assigned to no acetaminophen (<italic>P</italic> = .043). This difference in reduction was 37% (48% to 22%) versus 14% (30% to −71%) in patients with hemoglobin ≥45000 ng/mL (<italic>P</italic> = .010). The proportion with progressing kidney injury was higher among controls (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.5; <italic>P</italic> = .034). PK–PD analyses showed that higher exposure to acetaminophen increased the probability of creatinine improvement. No patient fulfilled Hy’s law for hepatotoxicity.</p>

            <p>Kidney dysfunction complicating severe falciparum malaria is common and independently predicts mortality in all age groups [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mortality in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) is approximately 75% without and 26% with renal replacement therapy [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but this therapy is frequently unavailable in malaria-endemic areas.</p>
            <p>Intravascular hemolysis that results in high levels of plasma cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) contributes to AKI in several conditions, including post-cardiopulmonary bypass [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and massive transfusion [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. After haptoglobin depletion, CFH causes oxidative renal tubular damage through redox cycling between heme-ferric and ferryl states, which results in lipid peroxidation generating F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostanes (F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs) and isofurans (IsoFs) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs are potent renal vasoconstrictors that act via thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptors [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Intravascular hemolysis is an intrinsic component of severe falciparum malaria pathophysiology [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently it was shown that increased levels of CFH, F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs, and IsoFs are strongly associated with kidney dysfunction and hemodialysis requirement in adults with severe malaria [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Acetaminophen inhibits hemoprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation by reducing heme-ferryl radicals [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In an experimental rhabdomyolysis model, acetaminophen decreased oxidative stress markers and attenuated AKI [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
            <p>We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of acetaminophen vs no acetaminophen in patients with severe and moderately severe malaria to assess acetaminophen as a renoprotective adjunctive therapy. We hypothesized that adjunctive therapy with acetaminophen would improve kidney function, particularly in patients with prominent intravascular hemolysis.</p>

                <title>Trial Design</title>
                <p>The study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial among patients admitted at 2 hospitals in southeastern Bangladesh, Thailand: Ramu Upazilla Health Complex (primary subdistrict hospital) and Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH; tertiary referral hospital).</p>

                <p>Eligible patients were aged &gt;12 years with microscopy-confirmed <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> severe or moderately severe malaria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and fever (&gt;38°C on admission or fever during preceding 24 hours). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient or a legally acceptable representative if the patient was unconscious. Severe malaria was defined as presence of asexual parasitemia plus 1 or more severity criteria [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moderate disease was defined as the need for parenteral therapy without a severity criterion. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, history of chronic liver disease or alcohol abuse, and contraindications for acetaminophen or nasogastric (NG) tube insertion.</p>

                <title>Randomization, Masking, and Intervention</title>
                <p>Randomization to acetaminophen or control was stratified by severity of malaria using a computerized binary sequence number generator in a 1:1 ratio (blocks of 20), generated by a statistician unrelated to the study. Opaque, sealed envelopes that contained treatment allocations were opened by a research physician after enrollment. Laboratory staff performed quantification of the primary endpoint. All biochemical tests were masked to the treatment allocation; research physicians and study participants were not. Study codes on samples were nonidentifiable for drug allocation. The study data manager was responsible for data entry, cleaning, and extraction.</p>
                <p>Acetaminophen was given as observed therapy at a 6-hourly dose of 1 g (patient weight ≥50 kg) or 12.5–15.0 mg/kg/dose (&lt;50 kg) for 72 hours, as tablets (500 mg, Bristol Laboratories Ltd., UK) to conscious patients or as syrup (250 mg/5 mL, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., UK) via NG tube to comatose patients. This is the standard recommended dosage [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to achieve therapeutic levels for antipyresis [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and renoprotection [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. If patients vomited within 1 hour, the dose was repeated. In the control arm, patients with fever &gt;40°C were given oral ibuprofen 400 mg (or diclofenac suppository 50 mg) or 500 mg acetaminophen in case of renal impairment, dehydration, or dengue infection. Antimalarial treatment was with intravenous artesunate (Guilin Pharmaceuticals, China), followed by artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem, Novartis, Switzerland) once oral medication was tolerated. Supportive management was according to World Health Organization guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Patients without shock, anuria, or severe dehydration received intravenous normal saline at a rate of 250 mL/h for 6 hours followed by 100 mL/hour until oral fluids were tolerated. In case of severe dehydration with oliguria, the rate was increased to 1000 mL/hour for 2 hours followed by 500 mL/hour for 2 hours if oliguria persisted without signs of fluid overload. Patients in Ramu who required hemodialysis were transferred to CMCH. Hemodialysis was initiated by attending nephrologists not involved in data collection or analysis.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the relative change in serum creatinine at 72 hours from enrollment stratified by enrollment CFH concentration. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients developing AKI according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria (creatinine increase ≥26.5 µmol/L within 48 hours) [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; fever clearance time (time until temperature &lt;37.5°C [FCT–A] and time until temperature was &lt;37.5°C for 24 hours [FCT–B]); parasite clearance (time to first of 2 consecutive negative slides and parasite half–life) [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; and safety (in particular, hepatological parameters at 72 hours). Population pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on parasitemia, temperature, and creatinine were characterized using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, outlined in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>. AKI was staged at enrollment by KDIGO criteria [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], using an estimated baseline creatinine obtained from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula if aged ≥19 years (glomerular filtration rate [GFR], 75 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and the bedside Schwartz formula if &lt;19 years (GFR, 100 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

                <title>Laboratory Methods</title>
                <p>Screening venous blood samples were analyzed for parasitemia and biochemistry (point-of-care iSTAT analyzer [CG4+, Chem8+], Abbott Laboratories, USA). After enrollment, vital signs, urine output, development of complications, and parasitemia were assessed every 6 hours until discharge or death. For the first 72 hours, serum creatinine was assessed every 12 hours (Olympus AU400 chemistry analyzer, performed in Bangkok), CFH in twice-centrifuged citrated plasma was assessed every 24 hours (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Bethyl Laboratories, performed in Darwin) [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs and IsoFs in lithium heparin plasma were assessed every 24 hours (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at Vanderbilt University) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were assessed on enrollment and at 72 hours. To determine the PK–PD of acetaminophen on creatinine, parasitemia, and fever, plasma EDTA samples for acetaminophen concentration were collected prior to each dose plus dense sampling in the treatment arm after both the first (0 hour) and last (72 hour) dose. Patients in the control arm had samples collected every 6 hour for 72 hours to assess unplanned acetaminophen intake. Detailed procedures are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>Inclusion of 62 patients allowed demonstration of a difference in proportional change in serum creatinine at 72 hours of 10% with 5% significance and 90% power, assuming a mean (standard deviation) admission creatinine value of 150 μmol/L (90 μmol/L). The primary endpoint analysis was modified intention-to-treat (ITT) principle including all patients who were randomly assigned. Modified ITT was applied because it was challenging to impute and analyze missing 72-hour creatinine data since most of those with missing data died. Between-group differences were compared with Student <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for continuous and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Primary endpoint comparison adjusted by enrollment CFH was analyzed by linear regression. Temporal data were analyzed using mixed effects models, with the maximum likelihood method of estimation. Stratification was by enrollment median CFH, F<sub>2</sub>-IsoP, and IsoF concentrations. Where interaction terms were significant, the lincom command was used to obtain overall treatment effects. Time-to-event outcome subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) were estimated by competing-risks regression to account for death as a competing event for the event of interest (AKI). All patients with a creatinine rise of ≥26.5 µmol/L after enrollment were included. Parasite and fever clearance times were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. For missing creatinine values in the longitudinal series, totaling 35 of 434 (8%) values, multiple imputation using chained equations with 5 rounds was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the mixed effects analyses, it was assumed that in patients on hemodialysis, a creatinine rise of 132.6 µmol/L per day was averted, which is the rise proposed for anephric states [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>The Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee and Chittagong Medical College Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. Trial sites were monitored by the Clinical Trials Support Group from Mahidol Oxford Research Unit, Bangkok, Thailand, and study outcomes followed by a data and safety monitoring committee.</p>

                <p>Recruitment was from 10 July 2012 until 11 September 2014. Of the 346 patients assessed, 62 were eligible for randomization to receive acetaminophen (n = 31) or no acetaminophen (n = 31). The trial profile is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Baseline characteristics were well matched between treatment arms (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At enrollment, 42% (13/31) and 58% (18/31) had a CFH concentration above the median (45000 ng/mL) in the acetaminophen and control groups, respectively.</p>

                <p>The median (interquartile range [IQR]) proportional reduction in serum creatinine at 72 hours compared to baseline was 23% (IQR, 37% to 18%) in patients receiving acetaminophen compared to 14% (IQR, 29% to 0%) in control patients (<italic>P</italic> = .043), which was more prominent when adjusted for enrollment CFH (<italic>P</italic> = .026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In patients with high CFH at enrollment (≥45000 ng/mL), the median (IQR) reduction in creatinine at 72 hours was 37% (IQR, 48% to 22%) with acetaminophen vs 14% (IQR, 30 to −71%) in control patients (<italic>P</italic> = .010).

                <p>The population PK properties of acetaminophen were best described by a covariate-free 1-compartment disposition model with 3 transit absorption compartments. The predicted median (IQR) C<sub>MAX</sub> reached was 16.1 mg/L (14.0 to 20.9 mg/L) and the estimated median (IQR) terminal elimination half-life was 2.79 hours (2.57 to 2.93 hours). Median (IQR) acetaminophen area under the curve (AUC<sub>0</sub><sub>-72h</sub>) in the treatment arm was 386 mg × h × L<sup>-1</sup> (269 to 496 mg × h × L<sup>-1</sup>) compared to 7 mg × h × L<sup>-1</sup> (0 to 45 mg × h × L<sup>-1</sup>) in the control arm. Dosing simulations showed that a 6-hourly dose of 1000 mg or 1500 mg resulted in a steady-state mean plasma acetaminophen concentration of 9.21 mg/L and 13.8 mg/L, respectively. A PD mixture model of observed creatinine data, including enrollment creatinine and acetaminophen exposure (AUC<sub>0-72h</sub>) as covariates, best described the data. Higher enrollment creatinine gave a higher probability of a subsequent further deterioration in renal function. The prediction of creatinine change over time was dependent on total acetaminophen exposure where a higher AUC<sub>0-72h</sub> increased the probability of an improvement in creatinine over the first 72 hours. For example, an enrollment creatinine of 265 μmol/L confers an 83% probability of further deterioration without receiving acetaminophen vs probabilities of 0.02%, 1.2%, or 8.1% with acetaminophen exposures (AUC<sub>0-72h</sub>) of 500, 300, or 200 mg × h × L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Modeling results showed a positive correlation between acetaminophen exposure and fever clearance time but no correlation with parasite clearance rate.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This randomized, open-label, controlled trial showed that patients with severe and moderately severe malaria receiving acetaminophen had a larger reduction in serum creatinine and a lower risk of developing AKI compared to control patients not receiving acetaminophen. The beneficial effect of acetaminophen on kidney function was distinctly more pronounced in patients with significant intravascular hemolysis and high concentrations of oxidative stress markers (F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs and IsoFs). PK–PD modeling showed an acetaminophen exposure–dependent relationship with the improvement in creatinine, which was within the therapeutic dose range. There was a trend toward reduced hemodialysis requirement in the acetaminophen group compared to controls, but the study was not powered to detect an effect toward this endpoint.</p>
              <p>The findings support the hypothesis that acetaminophen reduces CFH-mediated oxidative kidney damage and thus would be most beneficial in patients with significant intravascular hemolysis. The results are consistent with recent studies on a heme-mediated oxidative mechanism of AKI and the renoprotective effect of acetaminophen interfering with this mechanism. We recently showed that elevated plasma CFH, F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs, and IsoFs are associated with in-hospital creatinine rise, hemodialysis requirement, and mortality in patients with severe malaria [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Acetaminophen has been shown to reduce toxic ferryl heme to ferric heme in vitro and to decrease plasma F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs and improve kidney function in a rat model of rhabdomyolysis [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A recent randomized trial in septic patients with detectable CFH showed reduced oxidative injury and improved kidney function in patients receiving acetaminophen [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the current study was conducted in patients aged &gt;12 years, these findings may have important implications for the treatment of severe malaria in African children who carry the major burden of this disease and in whom the importance of AKI, hemoglobinuria, and increased plasma CFH is increasingly recognized [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>]. Further, acetaminophen may also be beneficial in severe <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic> malaria, in which high levels of CFH [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a high incidence of AKI have been reported [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as well as in other diseases characterized by a combination of high CFH and incidence of AKI [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Studies of acetaminophen in uncomplicated malaria lacking PK–PD analyses have questioned its antipyretic efficacy [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and suggested deceleration in parasite clearance [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PK–PD analysis in the current study shows a dose-dependent effect of acetaminophen on fever clearance time, whereas acetaminophen concentrations were not associated with parasite clearance rates in these artemisinin-sensitive infections. Studies that evaluated acetaminophen in uncomplicated malaria have not reported serious adverse events or hepatotoxicity attributable to acetaminophen [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The current study shows that administering the maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen results in a moderate increase in aminotransferases, but no patient met criteria for Hy’s law for hepatotoxicity [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The maximum peak acetaminophen concentration of 31.6 mg/L observed in our study is well below the acute toxicity threshold of 150 mg/L used in guidelines as indication for N-acetylcysteine treatment [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PK dosing simulations showed that 6-hourly dosing of 1500 mg (6 g/day) achieved therapeutic steady-state acetaminophen concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/L in this patient population, but this exceeds the maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen in adults (4 g/day). The conventional 6-hourly dose of 1000 mg used in this trial yielded a simulated average steady-state concentration of 9.21 mg/L and median AUC<sub>0-72h</sub> of 644 mg × h × L<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). Comparing this cumulative exposure to that generated from the PK–PD model suggests that this conventional regimen has an important renoprotective effect (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
              <p>The study had some limitations. The sample size was relatively small; a larger study is planned. A total of 35/434 (8%) creatinine values were assigned by multiple imputation because of missing samples. However, no imputation was used for the primary endpoint analysis. Patients who received hemodialysis had artificially lowered creatinine values and, according to accepted practice, were assigned an anephric rate of creatinine rise in the analysis [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>This proof-of-principle study provides evidence that acetaminophen improves kidney function and reduces the risk of developing AKI in severe and moderately severe malaria, particularly in patients with elevated plasma CFH, F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs, and IsoFs. Since acetaminophen reduces highly oxidative ferryl heme that can be generated with intravascular hemolysis, the findings support the pathophysiological mechanism that CFH-mediated oxidative stress causes kidney injury in severe malaria, a mechanism also relevant for other disease states characterized by intravascular hemolysis. Acetaminophen is inexpensive and widely used, which would facilitate rapid implementation for malaria treatment. A larger trial to evaluate acetaminophen to reduce renal dysfunction in African children with severe malaria is now warranted.</p>
