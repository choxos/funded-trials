                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Women in regions with high HIV prevalence are at high risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum, and acute maternal HIV contributes a substantial proportion of infant HIV infections. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could prevent HIV during pregnancy/postpartum; however, identifying women who would most benefit from PrEP in this period is challenging. Women may not perceive risk, may not know partner HIV status and partners may have external partners during this period. PrEP offer in pregnancy could be universal or risk guided.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The PrEP Implementation for Mothers in Antenatal Care (PrIMA) study is a cluster randomised trial that aims to determine the best model for PrEP implementation in pregnancy, among women attending public sector maternal child health clinics in Western Kenya (HIV prevalence &gt;25%). Twenty clinics are randomised to either universal PrEP offer following standardised counselling (‘Universal arm’ 10 clinics) or risk screening with partner self-test option (‘Targeted arm’ 10 clinics). Four thousand women will be enrolled and followed through 9-month postpartum. The primary analysis will be intention to treat. Outcomes reflect the balance between HIV preventive effectiveness and avoiding unnecessary PrEP exposure to women at low risk and include: maternal HIV incidence, PrEP uptake, PrEP adherence, PrEP duration, ‘appropriate’ PrEP use (among women with objective evidence of potential risk), infant birth outcomes, infant growth and partner self-testing uptake. To better understand the feasibility and acceptability of the provision of PrEP in these settings, qualitative interviews and cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted.</p>

                  <p>The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Kenyatta National Hospital and the University of Washington. An external advisory panel monitors adverse and social harm events. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, presentations at local and international conferences to national and global policy makers, community and participants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In high HIV prevalence settings, women have high risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum. A meta-analysis of 19 studies found high HIV incidence in pregnant and postpartum.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A 2015 study in Western Kenya found an HIV incidence rate of 2.31 infections/1000 person years among pregnant and postpartum women.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A recent analysis among women in HIV serodiscordant partnerships, in seven African countries including Kenya, demonstrated that the risk of HIV acquisition per coital act was higher in late pregnancy and postpartum compared with non-pregnant women.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Among mothers acutely infected with HIV, there is a twofold increase in the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) compared with chronic HIV maternal infection due to higher viral load and absent HIV immune responses.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) programmes effectively identify women with chronic HIV infections and implement antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, current PMTCT programmes may miss acute HIV infections occurring in pregnancy or postpartum. As a result, acute HIV infections during pregnancy contribute an increasing proportion of infant HIV infections. Over 40% of new infant HIV infections worldwide are estimated to be due to maternal HIV acquisition in pregnancy and postpartum.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Given the high HIV incidence in pregnancy/postpartum and the risk of transmission to the infant, there is need for effective HIV prevention in this critical period.</p>
              <p>Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine-triphosphate (FTC) is a highly effective intervention for HIV prevention.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> TDF and FTC have been evaluated for safety among both women receiving PrEP and HIV-positive women receiving ART for PMTCT.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> A systematic review concluded that there is no safety-related rationale for prohibiting PrEP during pregnancy and/or breast feeding.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The review found no statistically significant differences in stillbirth/pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for gestational age, birth defects and infant or maternal mortality among women using TDF versus those not on TDF.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Additionally, there is minimal penetration of tenofovir (the metabolite of TDF) into breastmilk.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Finally, PrEP programmes into pregnant and postpartum populations include frequent HIV testing, facilitating early identification of incident HIV infections and subsequent ART initiation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Based on these data, the WHO recommends TDF/FTC-based oral PrEP for pregnant and breastfeeding women at high risk for HIV as a female-controlled prevention strategy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>While safety data are generally reassuring, determining which pregnant women are most likely to benefit from PrEP and prioritising them for PrEP delivery would have multiple benefits, including reducing unnecessary PrEP exposure among women who are not at risk for acquiring HIV and maximising cost-effectiveness. A universal offer of PrEP would allow women to choose whether they wanted to use PrEP. Universal access to PrEP has shown high uptake among men who have sex with men in high-income settings, with evidence that those who elect to start PrEP are at particularly high risk.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> However, some have suggested that risk-scoring tools could increase efficiency by helping clinicians identify those at high risk, limiting PrEP offer to the subset with objective markers of risk.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition, for individuals who may be unaware of their risk, which is often the case for pregnant women, risk evaluation approaches may reveal previously unperceived risk. For pregnant women, the WHO recommends using risk-guided approaches for HIV prevention as part of a comprehensive PMTCT package.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A risk scoring tool to identify high HIV risk pregnant women and using a simple set of easily accessible variables (partner HIV status unknown, number of lifetime sexual partners and history of syphilis) was developed and validated using data from 1304 Kenyan women.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Women with a score &gt;6 made up 16% of the population but accounted for 56% of HIV acquisition events. This or a similar tool may be specifically useful for optimising PrEP delivery for pregnant and postpartum women.</p>
              <p>In Western Kenya, with &gt;15% HIV prevalence, there is an urgent need to identify effective strategies for preventing acute HIV infections in pregnancy and postpartum.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This cluster randomised trial will compare two models for PrEP delivery within antenatal care (ANC) clinics in Kenya. One model is universal offer of PrEP to all pregnant women, and the other is targeted offer (using risk tool and offering partner HIV self-test services to refine risk guidance). We hypothesise that because of better matching of PrEP use to HIV risk, targeted PrEP approaches will result in lower HIV incidence and optimised proportion of women on PrEP. We predict that this targeted PrEP approach will result in more ‘appropriate’ PrEP use, better adherence, shorter PrEP duration (stop after partner viral suppression), more partners on ART and similar infant outcomes.</p>

                <p>Two PrEP implementation models will be compared. In clinics randomised to universal PrEP counselling arm (universal arm), all enrolled women receive standardised PrEP counselling and self-select whether they want to initiate PrEP.

High risk is defined as either a risk score greater than 6 or any of the risk factors outlined by the Kenya National AIDS and STI Control Programme (NASCOP), including: transactional sex, recent STI, sex against their will, intimate partner violence, intravenous drug use and recurrent use of postexposure prophylaxis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 15</xref> In addition, targeted arm participants receive HIV self-test kits to take to partners for partner HIV testing to further enhance estimation of potential HIV risk.</p>

                  <p>Facilities were selected based on discussions with Kenya NASCOP and the local county governments of Homa Bay and Siaya. Facilities were considered for inclusion if they were located in a county with greater than 20% HIV seroprevalence, have &gt;350 HIV-negative clients attending ANC per year and offer postnatal care services including infant immunisations. Forty-five facilities were evaluated for inclusion in the PrIMA study, of which 30 met the inclusion criteria. Among the 30 eligible facilities, 20 were selected, with input from the County Ministry of Health, to ensure geographic distribution such that at least one facility per subcounty was included in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). This geographic distribution also ensured that facilities were dispersed over wide distances to avoid contamination between study sites. The 20 sites are dispersed over 300 km (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>

                    <p><italic>Partner HIV self-testing</italic>: women in targeted arm facilities are also offered HIV self-test kits to take to their partner for HIV testing. This is used to provide further information on partner HIV status and further define the participant’s risk. At follow-up visits, participants report the results of partner self-test results. These results inform the decision to either initiate women in previously unidentified serodiscordant couples on PrEP or to recommend women discontinue PrEP if their partner is HIV negative.</p>
                    <p>Trained programme staff counsel study participants in the use of self-testing kits including that the use of the test kits is voluntary and they can change their mind at any time. PrIMA nurses first assess whether the women believe violence could occur when providing the self-testing kit to their partner. Women who are comfortable providing a self-test to their sexual partner(s) are instructed by study staff on the use of an oral fluid-based rapid HIV test (OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 antibody test, OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA). All women are offered at least two self-tests so that they can take the test at the same time as their partner. Study staff demonstrate how to use the oral self-test. Women report on the results of their partner’s self-test at their next study visit. These activities follow the same procedures as other partner HIV self-test kit distribution studies in the region, which have been shown to have low rates of adverse events.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>

                    <p>Women who elect to start PrEP and are clinically eligible at any point in the study receive point of care hepatitis B (HBsAg) using HBsAg One Step Hepatitis Surface Antigen Test Strip and creatinine (Cr) testing using Nova StatSensor Xpress Creatinine point-of-care handheld analyser.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Women who are HBsAg positive are referred for comanagement of hepatitis B and allowed to initiate PrEP use. Women who have estimated CrCl ≤50 mL/min are identified as clinically ineligible to initiate PrEP. Maternal Cr among PrEP users is obtained annually, and CrCl is estimated. PrEP is discontinued if (1): participant seroconverts during the study; (2) participant’s risk status changes (eg, a partner who previously refused or was unable to take the self-test tests negative); (3) renal dysfunction with CrCl &lt;50 mL/min; (4) participant requests to stop; (5) sustained non-adherence; or (6) participant reports their HIV-positive partner has achieved sustained viral suppression. Women who seroconvert are managed according to NASCOP guidelines including collection of dried blood spots (DBS) for resistance testing and referral for follow-up care including prompt provision of ART for PMTCT.</p>

DBS is collected, using a finger stick protocol, from all women on PrEP at all follow-up visits. A subset of DBS specimens from all women on PrEP will be randomly selected for testing. DBS testing will be conducted using validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assays.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> The presence of detectable FTC-TP is a proxy for recent adherence in the preceding 48 hours.

                <p>Two Community Advisory Boards (CABs) have been engaged to review the study aims, procedures and activities. The CABs include community leaders, educators, local ministry of health representatives, women and adolescents from the community. One CAB was established in Siaya County and one in Homa Bay County to ensure local acceptability of the study questions and procedures. The CABs meet at least two times per year to review study progress to date. Results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, presentations at relevant local and international conferences, to MOH representative including County and national HIV divisions, to the CABs engaged for support of the study and to participating partners and facility staff through facility-based meetings.</p>
                <p>An EAP was convened to review recruitment, enrolment and potential social harms annually during the course of the study. The EAP reviews the study protocol, data collection schedule, recruitment, enrolment and retention data to ensure the study is achieving its objectives. The EAP is also responsible for reviewing any social harm events to ensure the safety of study participants. The EAP can recommend suspension or termination of the study due to serious concerns about subject’s safety, inadequate performance, scientific or policy developments that impact the study or inadequate enrolment rates.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>Sample size was calculated based on a twofold difference in HIV incidence between study arms. Assuming a coefficient of variation (k) of 0.2, the study has 80% power to detect a twofold difference in annual HIV incidence (between 4% and 2%) with 10 clinics per cluster and 200 women per cluster (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). If targeted PrEP resulted in much better performance (67% decrease rather than 50%), six clinics per cluster would be sufficient. Deriving our sample size from HIV incidence difference is conservative and enables ample statistical power to detect effects on other outcomes (such as proportion on PrEP and partner characteristics). <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> outlines implications of potential RCT outcomes illustrating the value of data regarding the two PrEP delivery models in scenarios with or without a significant difference in HIV incidence. Estimates suggest the targeted arm may have 20% of women receiving PrEP, while the universal PrEP arm may have 5%–25% of women requesting PrEP; however, these are speculative estimates.</p>

                <p>If PrEP uptake is high, or high among women with greatest HIV risk, the study may not detect a difference in HIV incidence between PrEP delivery models. However, as outlined in the contingency table (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>), for all scenarios, the study would yield important data on viable approaches for delivering PrEP in pregnancy and likely reveal a superior model in terms of the balance of effectiveness, safety, acceptability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness.</p>

The proportion of all women enrolled in the study who use PrEP (proportion of women exposed to PrEP and duration of PrEP exposure) will be compared between trial arms using GEE with a binomial link. The proportion with ‘appropriate’ use will be compared between arms using GEE with a binomial link.

                <p>PrEP adherence will be measured among women on PrEP using DBS TFV drug levels. For each trial arm (10 clinic-cluster), a random subset of 220 DBS will be assessed. TFV drug levels will be compared by trial arm using GEE with a Gaussian link. PrEP duration will be computed for each woman based on self-report and pharmacy records and average duration compared between arms using GEE with a Gaussian link. Reported and confirmed partner with HIV status, proportions of partner HIV positive, unknown and HIV negative status and reported and confirmed partner ART use will be compared between arms using GEE with a binomial link.</p>

The proportion preterm will be compared by PrEP exposure using GEE with a binomial link. PrEP-exposed infants will be compared with PrEP-unexposed infants for mean birth weight, WAZ and HAZ using GEE with a Gaussian link.</p>

                <p>To evaluate the economic impact of providing PrEP in MCH settings, the incremental cost-effectiveness of the two approaches of PrEP delivery will be calculated per incident HIV infection and disability-adjusted life year averted. The base case costs of facility-based care will be estimated, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted. Cost data will be collected from a variety of sources including study records, publicly available data and in collaboration with the ministry of health. Cost data will include: (1) costs of all commodities used in the intervention; (2) labour costs for intervention workers; (3) average time clients spent with intervention including transportation/staff time/time for referrals; (4) local wages of target population; (5) rent; (6) maintenance; (7) volunteer activities; (8) user fees; (9) conversion rate of local currency (Kenyan shilling) to US dollars; (10) value of donated goods and services; and (11) other relevant costs, including training of providers and mobile van and fuel costs for community-based delivery. A discount rate of 3% will be used with sensitivity analysis of 0%–5%.</p>
                <p>Time and motion studies will be conducted to determine the time and resources necessary to provide PrEP counselling in pregnancy, monitoring and resupply. A single research assistant will collect time and motion data from at least three facilities in both the universal and targeted arm; time and motion observation may be done at additional facilities as needed until a typical time for PrEP counselling, initiation and dispensation can be estimated. Additionally, at each facility, a survey will be conducted, asking staff to estimate the amount of time it takes to conduct each step of the PrEP screening, counselling and dispensation processes and separating out any time for research procedures (such as informed consent). Discrepancies between the observed and self-reported time periods for activities will be discussed with staff. Observing multiple visits will allow estimation of the average time taken for each step; the time taken for research purposes (eg, data collection) will be noted separately from the estimated time needed for clinical services. Through time and motion studies, the number of participants who could be supported by a clinic will be estimated.</p>
                <p>For analysis taking, the societal perspective, costs to clients in terms of lost time, wages, childcare and other relevant opportunity costs will be collected. Participants will be asked what expenses and opportunity costs they incurred to receive the interventions in the surveys already planned for the project. Information on the average cost of medical care in Kenya associated with pregnancy, postpartum, HIV infection and AIDS will be collected through literature review.</p>
                <p>Cost data will be used with study results and mathematical models of HIV transmission to estimate the population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The models will use deidentified study data.</p>

                <p>The PrIMA study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov. Changes to the protocol will be reviewed by both the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Kenyatta National Hospital Ethics and Research Committe (ERC) prior to implementation. Any changes to the protocol will be communicated to coinvestigators and study staff through change memos, and the protocol at clinicaltrials.gov will be updated.</p>
