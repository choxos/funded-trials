                  <title>BACKGROUND:</title>
                  <p>Behavioral pain treatments may improve postsurgical analgesia and recovery; however, effective and scalable options are not widely available. This study tested a digital perioperative behavioral medicine intervention in orthopedic trauma surgery patients for feasibility and efficacy for reducing pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and opioid cessation up to 3 months after surgery.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS:</title>
                  <p>A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at an orthopedic trauma surgery unit at a major academic hospital to compare a digital behavioral pain management intervention (“My Surgical Success” [MSS]) to a digital general health education (HE) intervention (HE; no pain management skills). The enrolled sample included 133 patients; 84 patients were randomized (MSS, n = 37; HE, n = 47) and completed study procedures. Most patients received their assigned intervention within 3 days of surgery (85%). The sample was predominantly male (61.5%), White (61.9%), and partnered (65.5%), with at least a bachelor’s degree (69.0%). Outcomes were collected at 1–3 months after intervention through self-report e-surveys and electronic medical record review; an intention-to-treat analytic framework was applied. Feasibility was dually determined by the proportion of patients engaging in their assigned treatment and an application of an 80% threshold for patient-reported acceptability. We hypothesized that MSS would result in greater reductions in pain intensity and pain catastrophizing after surgery and earlier opioid cessation compared to the digital HE control group.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS:</title>
                  <p>The engagement rate with assigned interventions was 63% and exceeded commonly reported rates for fully automated Internet-based e-health interventions. Feasibility was demonstrated for the MSS engagers, with &gt;80% reporting treatment acceptability. Overall, both groups improved in the postsurgical months across all study variables. A significant interaction effect was found for treatment group over time on pain intensity, such that the MSS group evidenced greater absolute reductions in pain intensity after surgery and up to 3 months later (treatment × time fixed effects; <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>[215] = 5.23; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .024). No statistically significant between-group differences were observed for time to opioid cessation or for reductions in pain catastrophizing (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>[215] = 0.20; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .653), although the study sample notably had subclinical baseline pain catastrophizing scores (M = 14.10; 95% confidence interval, 11.70–16.49).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSIONS:</title>
                  <p>Study findings revealed that a fully automated behavioral pain management skills intervention (MSS) may be useful for motivated orthopedic trauma surgery patients and reduce postsurgical pain up to 3 months. MSS was not associated with reduced time to opioid cessation compared to the HE control intervention.</p>

            <p>US annual estimates suggest that 16.2% of the roughly 7 million orthopedic injuries result in an urgent surgical procedure.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A fraction of patients will have poor surgical recovery and persistent pain. Up to 1 in 10 patients report moderate to severe pain 2 years after fracture surgery,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and those taking prescription opioids 2 years later are 4 times more likely to report moderate to severe pain.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Greater pain after surgery predicts the persistence of pain and prolonged opioid use.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Thus, effective postsurgical analgesia appears to improve long-term outcomes.</p>
            <p>Perioperative behavioral pain treatments offer an analgesic adjunct to medical care. Two recent reviews of perioperative behavioral treatments reported promising evidence for pain reduction after orthopedic surgery.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A brief perioperative behavioral intervention was associated with reduced opioid use after breast cancer surgery.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For chronic pain, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that a single-session pain-relief skills intervention (“empowered relief”) significantly reduced pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, pain interference, and a range of secondary outcomes 3 months after treatment.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Empowered relief was tailored to the surgical context and digitalized to create an on-demand treatment called “My Surgical Success” (MSS). MSS provides on-demand expert-led pain education and evidence-based cognition, emotion, and physiological self-regulatory skills.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Our RCT of MSS versus digital health education (HE) in women undergoing breast cancer surgery revealed that women who engaged with MSS had 6.5 fewer days of postoperative opioid use without increased pain.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We aimed to test MSS in orthopedic trauma surgery patients due to their substantial need for analgesia after surgery.</p>
            <p>Our primary aim was to test the feasibility of MSS in orthopedic trauma surgery inpatients after fracture surgery. Our secondary aims were to evaluate the impact of MSS on postsurgical pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and opioid cessation up to 3 months after surgery. While others have examined digital behavioral treatments for acute postoperative pain during hospitalization<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> or in the early weeks after surgery,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined their impacts on outcomes 3 months after surgery.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Oversight</title>
                <p>This clinical trial was performed at an academic hospital setting in the San Francisco Bay area. The trial tested for acceptability and feasibility of MSS in orthopedic trauma surgery patients, as well as preliminary efficacy for pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and time to opioid cessation after surgery. The study protocol was approved by the Stanford University institutional review board (IRB 42569), and written consent was obtained from all patients participating in the trial. The trial was registered before patient enrollment with <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT03764839; <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03764839?cond=orthopedic+trauma+surgery&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1" ext-link-type="uri">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03764839?cond=orthopedic+trauma+surgery&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1</ext-link>; principal investigator: Beth Darnall, PhD; date of registration: May 12, 2018). The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (CONSORT) guidelines on clinical trials.</p>

                <p>Eligible hospital patients were enrolled in the study after informed consent, and they were provided an iPad to complete the study procedures. Participants completed their baseline survey and immediately were e-randomized and assigned to 1 of 2 digital treatment groups.

                <p>Participants were randomly assigned to a study treatment group through the Research Data Capture (REDCap) system with a 1:1 ratio to ensure an equal number of patients in each group. Data were deidentified for analyses, and outcome assessors were blinded to study group assignment. Participants in both intervention groups received their treatment online, and all participant-reported data were collected online. There was no in-person or live online contact with a study therapist. In-person research staff contact was limited to enrollment. After hospital discharge, study staff contact with participants was limited to telephone and online communications regarding data collection and participant payment.</p>

A pretreatment baseline assessment included demographic variables (age, sex, race, ethnicity, relationship status, education, occupation, and annual household income) and the outcome measures listed below. Clinical variables (surgery status and duration of surgery) and prescribed opioid medications were extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) by medically trained study staff. For MSS participants, a brief treatment satisfaction and acceptability e-survey was administered immediately after treatment was received. Brief surveys were deployed every 3 days to assess postsurgical opioid use until opioid cessation was achieved or until the study period was complete at the 3-month time point. Posttreatment monthly assessments (months 1–3) mirrored the pretreatment baseline survey (minus demographics).</p>

                  <p>Feasibility was assessed in 2 ways. First, feasibility and acceptability of the MSS digital intervention replicated published methods<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and were determined by participant ratings for treatment acceptability, satisfaction, usefulness of information presented, ease of understanding, and likelihood to use the pain management skills learned. The rating scale ranged from 0 to 6; thus, a score of 4.8 or greater on each item would indicate exceeding the 80% threshold of acceptability. The second feasibility index was the percentage of patients who agreed to participate after being approached and invited to enroll in the study.</p>

                <title>Power Calculation</title>
                <p>To detect a feasibility of 80% assuming a null feasibility of 50%, power of 0.8, and alpha of 0.05, 14 participants were needed in the treatment group to assess the primary study aim. While our preregistered primary aim was feasibility, the study was powered to test for opioid cessation as a more conservative estimate of sample size needed to test the secondary aims. The study was designed to detect a hazard ratio of 1.89 and a mean cessation time of 13 days in controls, as observed in opioid cessation for MSS in our previous study of breast cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We set a power threshold of 0.8 and a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05. We used the PS Power and Sample Size Program<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to calculate our needed sample size of 41 events in the treatment group and 41 events in the control group. Our target enrollment was 50 for each treatment group. Our final sample consisted of 37 in MSS and 47 in HE. Note that an additional 13 patients were enrolled in the study (for a total sample size of N = 97) the month before CT.gov approval, and thus, these 13 participants were omitted from the primary analysis to remain in strict compliance with reporting data only for participants enrolled after trial registration is approved. These additional 13 participants followed all study procedures.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>All analyses were conducted using SAS Studio 3.8 enterprise edition and a modified intent-to-treat analysis. All randomized participants were included in the analysis as long as they participated in at least 1 follow-up measure. All confidence intervals (CIs) reported are 95% CIs as reported by SAS. We used an alpha of 0.05 for statistical significance.</p>
                <p>Acceptability and feasibility were verified by calculating proportions. Group differences for continuous variables were determined through the appropriate <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test (PROC TTEST) or Wilcoxon-rank sum (PROC NPAR1WAY) if the data were skewed. Assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were examined by plotting the residuals from the mixed-effects linear models, which were then visually inspected and found to be acceptably distributed. Group differences for categorical variables were evaluated using χ<sup>2</sup> analysis (PROC FREQ).</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes were evaluated at the 0-, 30-, 60-, and 90-day time points, for which day 0 was defined as surgery day. Monthly pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and opioid use were assessed using mixed linear modeling. As this method is robust against missing data, there was no need for imputation. To ensure no bias related to missing data, analyses were run using the last value varied forward. Mixed linear modeling (PROC MIXED) fits fixed and random effects to the data. Random effects are the adjustments for within-person variations across time. Fixed effects, reported in this article, are the parameters that apply across individuals in the cohort, including the treatment-time interaction effect. We excluded a baseline interaction effect, as these measures were collected before treatment. A significant negative difference between the MSS and HE groups suggests that the MSS treatment is effective for decreasing that outcome at that time point. Exploratory analyses on pain-related outcomes (pain interference, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and physical function) were also conducted using the above methods.</p>
                <p>Opioid cessation was assessed by survival analysis using the brief surveys that were completed every 3 days. If a patient did not have 3 opioid-free surveys by the most recent follow-up, they were considered censored in regard to opioid cessation. Meier survival estimates and a log-rank test were performed comparing the MSS and HE groups (PROC LIFETEST). A Cox proportional hazards model was also fit to the data (PROC PHREG). The proportional hazards assumption was verified using a log-log plot and by finding a nonsignificant time-group interaction effect in the Cox model. Both methods are robust to missing data and have no need for imputation.</p>
                <p>Finally, as an index of clinical meaningfulness, responder analyses were conducted by calculating the proportion of participants with 15% (minimal), 30% (moderate), and 50% (substantial) improvement<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> from baseline to 3-month follow-up. We applied a minimal clinical important change (MCID) threshold of 1.5 for pain intensity.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> For these analyses, we first excluded patients with missing 3-month values. We then performed sensitivity analyses using the last value carried forward and multiple imputations.</p>

                <p>Using intention-to-treat analyses, we found that MSS was superior to HE for pain intensity reductions across all time points after treatment (treatment × time fixed effects interaction, F[215] = 5.23; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .024) (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> displays the between-group pain intensity differences from an additional mixed linear model treating the monthly surveys as categorical allowing for the elucidation of expected additional benefit of MSS at each time point. Our analysis found group differences of –1.37 (95% CI, –2.30 to –0.44), –0.97 (95% CI, –1.84 to –0.09), and –1.14 (95% CI, –2.02 to –0.27) at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months, respectively, which were statistically significant. Clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity were found for both groups (MSS = –3.28, 46.3%; HE = –2.21, 31.3%). As much as 69% (25/36) of MSS and 49% (22/45) of HE participants achieved a 30% or more reduction in pain intensity, considered a moderately clinically important reduction in pain. For MSS, 47% (17/36) achieved the substantially clinically important reduction in pain of <italic toggle="yes">&gt;</italic>50%, while for HE, 27% (12/45) reached that threshold.

                <p>Six patients were censored in the adjusted models (MSS, n = 3; HE, n = 3), either because they were not prescribed opioids (n = 5) or did not take opioids beyond their procedure day (n = 1).

The difference in curves shows directionality, but it is not statistically significant (Wilcoxon <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .239).

                <p>Importantly, as noted earlier, the first 13 participants were enrolled in the month before final trial registration approval, and thus were excluded from current analyses. All study procedures were followed by all 13 participants; as such, we have replicated and attached all analyses, including data from the 13 participants, as they provide additional information and context that is relevant for future research, in addition to improved study power (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/AA/D966" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/AA/D966</ext-link>). Results showed a robust and consistent statistically significant interaction effect on pain intensity, whereby patients in the MSS group evidenced greater reductions in pain intensity up to 3 months after surgery.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The primary aim of our RCT was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a single-session behavioral pain intervention (MSS) in patients undergoing orthopedic trauma surgery. Indeed, the MSS engagement rate was 63%, which exceeds 20% to 60% Internet-based behavioral health engagement rates for the nonsurgical extant literature.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> MSS ratings exceeded thresholds for being acceptable, perceived as useful, and having high treatment satisfaction ratings, thus suggesting feasibility for future research and clinical care. Nonengagers (37%) did not complete baseline surveys; therefore, we are unable to characterize this subgroup. Lack of engagement and attrition may be due to specific sample characteristics, perceived intervention burden, or other factors.</p>
              <p>Digital health interventions are promising and increasing in demand, despite often having lower engagement rates than control or in-person interventions. Increased uptake has been partly driven by recent coronavirus disease-related restrictions that prevented receipt of in-person care,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and is supported by on-demand treatment availability. The current study included several enhancements to optimize patient engagement in MSS. First, MSS involved a modular and brief format (three 15-minute video segments) that is well-suited to an inpatient population. Second, the medical rationale and pain treatment philosophy were enhanced with a video welcome message from the chief of orthopedic trauma surgery. Third, the orthopedic trauma surgery team supported patient enrollment and understanding of behavioral pain treatment.</p>
              <p>The secondary aims of this study were to test the between-group differences for pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and time to opioid cessation after surgery. The MSS group reported reduced pain intensity after surgery compared to the HE control group, with enduring effects demonstrated at 3 months after surgery. Enhanced longitudinal analgesia for MSS recipients is a crucial finding in light of evidence showing that poorly managed acute postsurgical pain predicts pain persistence and prolonged need for opioids after surgery.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Viewed through this lens, postoperative pain management is crucial for optimized surgical recovery.</p>
              <p>Patients in both treatment groups reported pain reduction over time after surgery, and this aligns with the natural history of surgical recovery. However, 3 months after surgery, the full study sample was still reporting moderate pain intensity. This finding underscores the importance of long-term pain management after orthopedic trauma surgery, and integration of adjunctive analgesic options such as MSS may play a role. Specifically, 3 months after orthopedic trauma surgery, pain intensity was improved by an additional 1.14 points for MSS patients compared to HE patients. In terms of clinical meaningfulness, this difference falls below the 2-point threshold for an MCID established by Farrar et al.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, other studies have established that the MCID is closer to a 13% change from baseline (approximately 1.4 points on a 0–10 scale),<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> which approximates the difference observed in the current study. Surgical duration and surgery type did not vary at baseline and were not included as covariates in further analyses. Results provide preliminary evidence for MSS benefits in orthopedic trauma surgery patients and stand in contrast to other research reporting negative findings for different behavioral perioperative interventions applied in disparate surgical populations.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In regard to our secondary aim for time to opioid cessation, we did not observe a between-group difference despite showing reduced pain intensity for the MSS group. This finding contrasts our previous study in breast cancer surgery patients, in which MSS was associated with significantly reduced time to opioid cessation.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Orthopedic trauma surgery is associated with greater pain intensity over a longer period of time, and postsurgical pain and the need for analgesic medication may be further amplified as patients engage in physical rehabilitation and daily exercise regimens. We studied patient-reported use of opioids as a more granular and precise index than prescriptions.</p>
              <p>For our final secondary aim, we examined group changes for pain catastrophizing scores, as pain catastrophizing improved substantially after surgery for both treatment groups, again supporting the natural history of improvement after surgery. However, similar to findings from our previous MSS trial,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> we cannot rule out a potential floor effect as baseline levels of pain catastrophizing were below the published ranges for clinically moderate or high levels in surgical populations.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Strengths of the study include a longitudinal design to 3 months after surgery, randomization with an active control group, inclusion of a range of surgery types, frequent sampling of opioid use to minimize recall bias, intention-to-treat analysis, and largely inpatient receipt of treatment to quantify the impact of early receipt of perioperative behavioral pain treatment.</p>

            <sec>
              <title>LIMITATIONS</title>
              <p>Findings should be qualified within several study limitations. First, no satisfaction data were collected for the HE group. However, we found a low attrition rate for HE participants after receipt of the intervention and study engagement that was comparable to the MSS group. Second, results may not generalize to: (1) populations with greater baseline pain-related distress, (2) different surgical types or populations, or (3) lower socioeconomic populations. Third, a large number of screened patients were ineligible to participate due to study criteria. Finally, regular logging of opioid use may serve as an intervention or possibly lead to observer bias, both of which move our observations toward the null.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Results suggest that a low-cost, efficient, fully automated behavioral pain medicine treatment may be a useful pain management adjunct for motivated orthopedic trauma surgery patients and may reduce postsurgical pain up to 3 months after surgery. MSS offers significant advantages for increasing access to behavioral pain medicine with low/no risks and low/no implementation costs, and may support enhanced recovery after orthopedic trauma surgery.</p>
