                  <title>PURPOSE</title>
                  <p>Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are at risk of relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The utility of ultra-deep genomic testing to predict and the impact of conditioning intensity to prevent MDS relapse are unknown.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>Targeted error-corrected DNA sequencing was performed on preconditioning blood samples from patients with MDS (n = 48) from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 0901 phase III randomized clinical trial, which compared outcomes by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioning intensity in adult patients with &lt; 5% marrow myeloblasts and no leukemic myeloblasts in blood on morphological analysis at the time of pretransplant assessment. Clinical end points (53-month median follow-up) included transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Of the 48 patients examined, 14 experienced TRM, 23 are relapse-free, and 11 relapsed, of which 7 died.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Using a previously described set of 10 gene regions, 42% of patients (n = 20) had mutations detectable before random assignment to reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) or myeloablative conditioning (MAC). Testing positive was associated with increased rates of relapse (3-year relapse, 40% <italic>v</italic> 11%; <italic>P</italic> = .022) and decreased OS (3-year OS, 55% <italic>v</italic> 79%, <italic>P</italic> = .045). In those testing positive, relapse rates were higher (3-year relapse, 75% <italic>v</italic> 17%; <italic>P</italic> = .003) and RFS was lower (3-year RFS, 13% <italic>v</italic> 49%; <italic>P</italic> = .003) in RIC versus MAC arms. Testing additional genes, including those associated with MDS, did not improve prognostication.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>This study provides evidence that targeted DNA sequencing in patients with MDS before transplant can identify those with highest post-transplant relapse rates. In those testing positive, random assignment to MAC lowered but did not eliminate relapse risk.</p>

              <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), one of the most common hematologic disorders, is a collection of clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is currently the only curative treatment for MDS, but its usage is limited, in part, by the risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM).<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have helped to decrease toxicity although multiple retrospective studies found that the decreased TRM is counterbalanced by increased risk of relapse compared with more intense myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Two randomized phase III trials comparing outcomes following RIC and MAC conditioning regimens in patients with MDS are yet to provide a definitive answer regarding which regimen should be used when a patient is eligible for either approach.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Presence of Mutations Pretransplant Predicts Post-Transplant Clinical Outcome</title>
                <p>Previously, we demonstrated that detection of mutations within 10 gene regions (<italic>FLT3</italic>, <italic>IDH1</italic>, <italic>IDH2</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, <italic>KIT</italic>, <italic>NPM1</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>RUNX1</italic>, <italic>SF3B1</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic>) before alloHCT in patients with AML in remission was associated with higher relapse and lower survival in those randomly assigned to RIC.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Evaluating the same gene regions in this MDS cohort, a total of 54 mutations with a median variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.7% were detected in the blood of 42% (n = 20) of patients before conditioning treatment (Data Supplement). In samples with mutations detected, the median number of variants was 2 (range, 1-11).</p>
                <p>The presence of a mutation in the 10-gene panel (next-generation sequencing [NGS<sub>g10</sub>]) in the blood of patients with MDS before conditioning was found to be prognostic. NGS<sub>g10</sub>-positive patients experienced significantly higher rates of relapse (3-year relapse, 40% <italic>v</italic> 11%; <italic>P</italic> = .022) and decreased RFS (3-year RFS, 34% <italic>v</italic> 71%, <italic>P</italic> = .006) and OS (3-year OS, 55% <italic>v</italic> 79%, <italic>P</italic> = .045) compared with NGS<sub>g10</sub>-negative patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). NGS<sub>g10</sub> mutational status served as a strong predictor of relapse in this cohort of patients with MDS, predicting 73% of relapses at 24 months (100% for those receiving MAC), with a specificity of 78% (100% for those receiving RIC) (Data Supplement).</p>

                <p>Next, the impact of conditioning intensity and NGS<sub>g10</sub> mutational status was examined (Data Supplement). Mutations were detected in the preconditioning blood samples of 48% of MAC and 35% of RIC patients. Patients testing positive experienced higher rates of relapse (3-year relapse, 75% RIC <italic>v</italic> 17% MAC; <italic>P</italic> = .003) and lower RFS (3-year RFS, 13% RIC <italic>v</italic> 49% MAC; <italic>P</italic> = .003) when randomly assigned to RIC rather than MAC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>A-B and Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Neither of the two relapses observed after MAC occurred in the first 12 months after transplant, and the median time to relapse in those randomly assigned to RIC was 4 months (range, 2-24 months). No significant difference was observed in rates of TRM or OS when stratifying patients by both NGS<sub>g10</sub> status and conditioning intensity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>C and Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

                <title>Screening for Additional Genes Does Not Improve Test Performance</title>
                <p>The mutational spectrum of MDS is complex, with many additional genes recurrently mutated beyond the 10 AML-associated genes described above.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Therefore, we expanded our testing to also cover regions in an additional 19 genes including those commonly found in MDS at diagnosis (<italic>ASXL1</italic>, <italic>BCOR</italic>, <italic>CBL</italic>, <italic>CUX1</italic>, <italic>DNMT3A</italic>, <italic>ETV6</italic>, <italic>EZH2</italic>, <italic>GATA2</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>PHF6</italic>, <italic>PPM1D</italic>, <italic>PTPN11</italic>, <italic>SETBP1</italic>, <italic>SRSF2</italic>, <italic>STAG2</italic>, <italic>TET2</italic>, <italic>U2AF1</italic>, <italic>WT1</italic>, and <italic>ZRSR2</italic>). This resulted in the detection of an additional 82 mutations (136 in total), with a median VAF of 0.9% and a median of 2.5 variants (range, 1-12) per patient (Data Supplement). Expanding testing (total of 29 genes) resulted in the majority of patients having a mutation detectable before conditioning (80% MAC and 78% RIC).</p>
                <p>We examined if testing for mutations in a larger number of genes would help better risk stratify patients classified as NGS<sub>g10</sub>-negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, Data Supplement). The inclusion of <italic>DTA</italic> (<italic>DNMT3A</italic>, <italic>TET2</italic>, and <italic>ASXL1</italic>) genes, known to be associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis,<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> resulted in reclassification of 21% (n = 6) of NGS<sub>g10</sub>-negative patients to positive. Similar to what we observed in patients with AML,<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> samples testing positive for only <italic>DTA</italic> mutations showed no difference in relapse rates or OS compared with those testing negative. Furthermore, although inclusion of <italic>DTA</italic> variants marginally improved the sensitivity of NGS mutational status for predicting relapse at 24 months (from 73% to 82%), it had a detrimental impact on specificity (78%-35%, Data Supplement).</p>

                <title>Variant Allele Frequency and Mutation Number Do Not Provide Prognostic Significance</title>
                <p>Since expanding testing to include all 29 gene regions resulted in the majority of patients having a mutation detected, we examined the impact of defining as positive only those patients with at least one mutation detectable at a higher level (VAF ≥ 2.5%). This resulted in reclassification of seven NGS<sub>g10</sub>-negative and five NGS<sub>g10</sub>-positive patients, resulting in 46% of patients (n = 22) being high VAF NGS-positive. However, unlike NGS<sub>g10</sub>-positive patients, no significant difference was observed for rates of relapse, RFS, or OS in high VAF NGS-positive versus NGS-negative patients (Data Supplement). Further stratification of patients by conditioning intensity revealed that 48% of MAC (n = 12) and 43% of RIC (n = 10) patients were high VAF NGS-positive. Higher rates of relapse were observed in high VAF NGS-positive patients randomly assigned to RIC versus MAC (3-year relapse, 60% <italic>v</italic> 8%; <italic>P</italic> = .010), but this effect was driven exclusively by NGS<sub>g10</sub> mutation status, whereas no difference was observed in TRM, RFS, or OS (Data Supplement). Limiting analysis to those testing positive for an NGS<sub>g10</sub> mutation at or above 2.5% VAF reduced the sensitivity at 24 months from 73% to 45% (Data Supplement). Similarly, we examined the impact of mutation load on patient outcomes and found no significant difference in OS based on the mutation number (Data Supplement) or number of mutated genes (Data Supplement).</p>

The median time from diagnosis to alloHCT in these patients was 6 months (range, 3-129 months). These patients accounted for 19 (40%) of the available blood samples from before conditioning (nine MAC and 10 RIC). Survival for the 19 RAEB patients with samples available was 74%. Seven of these samples tested positive for NGS<sub>10g</sub>, for which survival was 0% for RIC (n = 2, relapse) and 60% for MAC-treated patients (with one death from each relapse and transplant-related mortality). NGS<sub>10g</sub>-positive patients accounted for four of six relapses observed in the RAEB cohort, and the other two patients had high-risk cytogenetics with a monosomal karyotype that would not be detectable using this NGS assay.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Here, we present the impact of genetic mutations detected before random assignment to RIC or MAC, identified without knowledge of the mutations originally present at diagnosis, on transplant outcomes in patients with MDS. Detection of mutations using a DNA-sequencing panel covering regions of 10 genes, previously shown to have utility at the same timepoint in patients with AML,<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> was associated with increased rates of relapse and decreased RFS and OS. Many of these genes (including <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>RUNX1</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, and RAS pathway genes) have shown prognostic significance in other MDS studies<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> or are indicative of potential leukemic progression (<italic>FLT3</italic> and <italic>NPM1</italic>). However, it should be noted that mutations in <italic>IDH1</italic>, <italic>IDH2</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, and <italic>NRAS</italic> were not seen in relapsing patients in this cohort. The prognostic significance of the remaining mutations on relapse was dependent on conditioning intensity, with higher rates of relapse and lower RFS observed in patients randomly assigned to receive RIC compared with MAC.</p>
              <p>This study provides evidence that the benefit of MAC versus RIC in reducing relapse is found in patients with MDS with detectable mutations using a 10-gene region DNA-sequencing panel before alloHCT. In 58% of patients with MDS testing negative, no difference between conditioning arms was seen for relapse, RFS, or OS. It was already well-established that detection of mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> before alloHCT in patients with MDS was associated with increased relapse and decreased survival<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and that MAC was unable to overcome these risks.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In our series, 12 of 48 subjects had a <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, although nine (75%) of these were below the cutoff (VAF &lt; 2.5%) used in previous studies (mean VAF 1.3%, range, 0.1%-19.74%). Four of these subjects relapsed (one of eight in MAC group and three of four in RIC group), five died of transplant-related complications (four of eight in MAC group and one of four in RIC group), and three survived without relapse (all in the MAC group). All three <italic>TP53</italic>-mutated survivors who did not relapse had a pre-alloHCT VAF of &lt; 5% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Although the size of this cohort limits extrapolation, it is possible that the prognostic implications of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation detection in patients with MDS before alloHCT and the impact of conditioning intensity differ from those reported previously when those variants are found at a level below the limit of detection of routinely used NGS assays. In addition to VAF, other factors such as persistence since initial diagnosis, development during therapy, mutation type, functional classification, and zygosity are likely to be important for determining the relapse risk associated with detecting a <italic>TP53</italic> mutation.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although mutation detection by targeted DNA sequencing before alloHCT was strongly associated with increased relapse and decreased RFS and these outcomes could be improved with MAC, unlike in patients<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> with AML, we did not detect an OS advantage for conditioning intensification in those testing positive. This might have been due to limited sample size, predominately nonrelapse causes of death in this MDS cohort (67% of deaths, compared with 39% in the previously reported AML cohort), or other factors.</p>
              <p>MDS is a genetically heterogenous disease.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> As was observed previously,<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we found that inclusion of a large number of genes resulted in the majority of patients having mutations present before transplant. Furthermore, mutations in genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis (<italic>DTA</italic>) or 16 other MDS-associated genes outside of 10-gene mutational status did not improve test performance. Reanalysis of pretransplant mutational status using only the 10 genes reported here, from another study of patients with MDS with &lt; 5% myeloblasts before alloHCT,<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> confirms our finding of significantly increased relapse rates in patients testing positive and receiving RIC versus MAC. Analysis of larger MDS cohorts using broad NGS panels will have to be performed to define the mutations with greatest prognostic significance at the pre-alloHCT timepoint.</p>
              <p>There are several limitations to this work. The modest sample size here offers only a partial sampling of the heterogenous genetics associated with MDS, whereas differences in pretransplantation disease burden, biology, and prior treatment history further limit exact comparisons. The significance of mutation detection before alloHCT might be influenced by history of prior treatment, and previous work using the same testing in patients with AML included only those treated to cytomorphological remission before transplant. Without knowledge of genomics at initial MDS diagnosis, we cannot comment on the optimal clinical timepoint or sequencing breadth for testing. Without single-cell sequencing, we cannot determine clonal architecture to distinguish if detected mutations are present in clonal hematopoiesis rather than MDS clones.<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Nevertheless, we show here a clear association of pretransplant genomics with post-transplant relapse and a significant impact of conditioning intensity in reducing that relapse risk.</p>
              <p>Unlike in AML, relapse does not account for the clear majority of mortality in patients with MDS undergoing alloHCT.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Two randomized studies of conditioning intensity in MDS have failed to show a difference in survival between MAC and RIC,<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> although we show here a trend toward improved survival with increased conditioning intensity for those with detectable mutations particularly in the RAEB group (ie, biology and treatment history most analogous to AML). Prior work had shown a benefit for increased conditioning intensity in patients with MDS with RAS pathway mutations (<italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>PTPN11</italic>, <italic>CBL</italic>, <italic>NF1</italic>, <italic>RIT1</italic>, <italic>FLT3</italic>, and <italic>KIT</italic>) undergoing alloHCT.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> As relapse is not the primary cause of death in patients with MDS undergoing alloHCT, the choice of conditioning intensity is currently dependent on the estimated ability of a patient to tolerate transplant-related toxicity.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> AlloHCT remains the only curative therapy for MDS; however, given the median age at diagnosis, many patients will not be eligible for myeloablative approaches.<sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> As it is now possible to determine the genomic basis of disease before and after transplantation, personalized approaches for alloHCT of patients with MDS are now conceivable with targeted strategies for those with detectable <italic>TP53</italic>, RAS pathway (including <italic>FLT3</italic>), <italic>IDH</italic> and <italic>JAK2</italic> mutations, immune augmentation, or other therapies potentially able to supplement the impact of chosen conditioning intensity to minimize relapse risk.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In conclusion, we show that in adult patients with MDS with &lt; 5% marrow myeloblasts and no leukemic myeloblasts in blood before alloHCT, ultra-deep DNA sequencing for mutations in 10 gene regions previously shown to be high risk in patients with AML could identify a subset of 42% of patients who experienced the majority of post-transplant relapses. In those patients with MDS testing positive, MAC rather than RIC could dramatically lower the relapse rate, but this benefit was counterbalanced by increased transplant-related mortality. This study provides the rationale for clinical trials of personalized post-transplant maintenance for patients with MDS based on genetic assessment before transplant.</p>
