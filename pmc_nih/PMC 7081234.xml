                <p id="Par1">Combined PARP and immune checkpoint inhibition has yielded encouraging results in ovarian cancer, but predictive biomarkers are lacking. We performed immunogenomic profiling and highly multiplexed single-cell imaging on tumor samples from patients enrolled in a Phase I/II trial of niraparib and pembrolizumab in ovarian cancer (NCT02657889). We identify two determinants of response; mutational signature 3 reflecting defective homologous recombination DNA repair, and positive immune score as a surrogate of interferon-primed exhausted CD8 + T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Presence of one or both features associates with an improved outcome while concurrent absence yields no responses. Single-cell spatial analysis reveals prominent interactions of exhausted CD8 + T-cells and PD-L1 + macrophages and PD-L1 + tumor cells as mechanistic determinants of response. Furthermore, spatial analysis of two extreme responders shows differential clustering of exhausted CD8 + T-cells with PD-L1 + macrophages in the first, and exhausted CD8 + T-cells with cancer cells harboring genomic <italic>PD-L1</italic> and <italic>PD-L2</italic> amplification in the second.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in women in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While chemotherapy, Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) therapy, and antiangiogenic therapy have demonstrated excellent activity in this disease, ovarian cancer is one of the few malignancies where immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade exhibits only modest activity [objective response rate (ORR) of ~8–9%] with infrequent durable responses, and currently has no FDA approved indication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The development of new strategies for improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade is therefore a high priority for treatment of ovarian cancer.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Preclinical work in murine ovarian cancer models by us and others has demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity for combinations of PARP inhibitors and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Specifically, in a syngeneic genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer driven via concurrent loss of p53 and Brca1 and overexpression of c-Myc, PARP inhibitor olaparib induced activation of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway accompanied by increased expression of Interferon-beta, PD-L1 and CXCL10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the same model, combination therapy with olaparib and PD-1 blockade augmented the activity of olaparib while anti-PD-1 alone did not have any effect. Similar results, but using a homologous recombination proficient ID8 model, were reported by Shen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which showed that the PARP inhibitor talazoparib induced STING activation, increased PD-L1, CCL5, and CXCL10 expression and exhibited synergistic activity with an anti-PD-L1 antibody.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Based on this, we conducted a phase I/II clinical trial of the PARPi niraparib in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in recurrent ovarian cancer (TOPACIO trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>); the trial enrolled 62 patients with a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range 1–5). The majority (76%) of patients had acquired platinum resistant or refractory disease while the remaining 24% of patients were ineligible to receive platinum therapy due to prior toxicity or allergic reaction. The niraparib/pembrolizumab combination was well tolerated and exhibited a confirmed ORR of 18% [5% complete responses (CRs) and 13% partial responses (PRs)] and a clinical benefit rate of 65%, clearly exceeding the expected activity of niraparib or pembrolizumab as monotherapies in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Responses were durable and median duration of response was not reached (range 4.2–14.5+) months.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Despite this promising activity, many patients did not respond, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers to identify ovarian cancer patients prospectively who would benefit from the niraparib/pembrolizumab combination. This is particularly relevant for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who have poor prognosis and therefore require careful selection of their next treatment regimen. In the context of the TOPACIO trial, known biomarkers of response to PARPi and immune checkpoint blockade were not associated with response to the niraparib/pembrolizumab combination; these biomarkers include tumor BRCA mutation status, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status (assessed by the Myriad HRD test), and PD-L1 status. Here, using advanced genomic analyses and single-cell imaging, we show that mutational signature 3 and interferon signaling in the CD8 + T-cell compartment of the tumor microenvironment determine responses to niraparib plus pembrolizumab in patients enrolled in the TOPACIO trial.</p>

                <title>Mutational signature 3 correlates with clinical benefit</title>
                <p id="Par7">As earlier analyses had failed to identify an association between the <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation status and HRD status as assessed by the Myriad HRD and clinical response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, we explored alternative determinants of HRD. The clinical characteristics and correlative analyses are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. First, we performed BROCA targeted sequencing using a panel of 84 DNA repair genes complimented by methylation analysis for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>RAD51C</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). BROCA sequencing identified 21/52 (40%) of the patients as HRD. Fourteen of the patients had tumors that were positive for BROCA but negative for <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations. Eleven of these tumors had <italic>BRCA1</italic> hypermethylation, two had mutations in <italic>CDK12</italic>, and one had <italic>RAD51C</italic> hypermethylation. Similar to our prior results with other biomarkers of HRD, BROCA status did not associate with response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). We also evaluated RAD51 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a functional marker for HR deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In total, 11/38 (29%) of the tumors lacked RAD51 foci, and therefore predicted to be HRD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). However, RAD51 status did not, significantly correlate with response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> B).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of clinical data (A) and patient numbers in correlative analyses (B).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>(A)</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Clinical details</td><td><italic>N</italic> (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Age (years)<sup>a</sup></td><td>60 (46–83)<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ECOG<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td>   1</td><td>44 (71)</td></tr><tr><td>   2</td><td>18 (29)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Platinum response<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td> Sensitive/ineligible</td><td>16 (25)</td></tr><tr><td> Resistant/refractory</td><td>46 (74)</td></tr><tr><td> Prior lines of therapy<sup>b</sup></td><td>3 (1–5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Confirmed BOR</td></tr><tr><td>   CR</td><td>3 (5)</td></tr><tr><td>   PR</td><td>8 (13)</td></tr><tr><td>   SD</td><td>28 (45)</td></tr><tr><td>   PD</td><td>20 (32)</td></tr><tr><td>   ND</td><td>3 (5)</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of response (days)</td><td>190 (123–441)<sup>b</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>(B)</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Correlative analyses</td><td><italic>N</italic> (%)</td></tr><tr><td>HRD test</td><td>55 (89)</td></tr><tr><td>BRCAmut</td><td>60 (97)</td></tr><tr><td>PD-L1 IHC</td><td>44 (71)</td></tr><tr><td>RAD51 IHC</td><td>38 (61)</td></tr><tr><td>BROCA</td><td>52 (84)</td></tr><tr><td>Oncopanel</td><td>39 (63)</td></tr><tr><td>Nanostring</td><td>44 (71)</td></tr><tr><td>CycIF</td><td>26 (37)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>ECOG</italic> Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status, <italic>BOR</italic> best objective response, <italic>CR</italic> complete response, <italic>PR</italic> partial response, <italic>SD</italic> stable disease, <italic>PD</italic> progressive disease, <italic>ND</italic> not defined.</p><p><sup>a</sup>At screening.</p><p><sup>b</sup>Median (range).</p><p><sup>c</sup>Response to last platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>ECOG; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status, BOR; Best objective response, CR; Complete response, PR; Partial response, SD; Stable disease, PD; Progressive disease, ND; Not defined.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Tumor mutational signature 3 positivity associates with prolonged progression-free survival with the combination of niraparib and pembrolizumab.</title><p><bold>a</bold> SigMA identified a larger proportion of tumors positive for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).

                <p id="Par8">To look for additional genomic markers for HRD and response, we performed OncoPanel targeted sequencing for 447 cancer-related genes (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). All tumors were mutated for <italic>TP53</italic>, and the results of the mutational and copy number variation analyses are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Of note, tumor mutational burden previously reported to correlate with response to immune checkpoint blockade, was not associated with response to niraparib/pembrolizumab or the other determinants of HRD (data provided in Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Furthermore, none of the tumors were polymerase epsilon (<italic>POLE</italic>)-mutated or mismatch repair deficient (MMRD); both are DNA repair defects known to associate with excellent response to immune checkpoint blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Using a recently developed computational tool called SigMA (Signature Multivariate Analysis), which is capable of determining mutational signatures even when tumor mutational burden is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> we were able to test for the presence of a specific mutational signature, which has been shown to be associated with HRD, called signature 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Using SigMA on the OncoPanel sequencing data, we identified the presence of signature 3 in 51% (20/39) of the patients, thereafter denoted as Sig3 positive. SigMA thus identified a larger proportion of tumors as HRD compared to other markers of HRD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of the six tumors with a BRCA mutation, SigMA was positive in four (i.e., consistent with the false-positive rate of 2%; see methods); of note, the two BRCA mutated tumors that were SigMA negative were also BROCA negative. Furthermore, among the 15 patients with loss-of-function of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> (nine tumors with BRCA1 hypermethylation, five tumors with BRCA1 mutation and one tumor with BRCA2 mutation), SigMA identified ten to be Sig3 positive, again consistent with the reported sensitivity of the SigMA algorithm (see methods).</p>
                <p id="Par10">We found that Sig3 positivity was indicative of clinical benefit; significantly more Sig3-positive patients had stable disease or partial response (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02, Fisher’s exact test), compared to patients who had progressive disease (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). Additionally, Sig3 was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>): the median PFS in Sig3-positive patients was 5.0 months (range 2.1–22.7) compared to 2.2 months (range 0.5–8.6) in the Sig3-negative patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005, Log-rank test), with a hazard ratio for progression of 0.37 in the Sig3-positive patients (95%CI 0.17–0.80).</p>

                <title>Immune score and Sig3 identify all objective responders</title>
                <p id="Par11">To profile the immune microenvironment, we performed NanoString gene expression profiling using the PanCancer IO 360 Gene Expression Panel plus 30 DNA repair genes (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We observed notable differences in the immune microenvironment gene expression patterns between samples obtained from tumors at diagnosis (chemo-naive samples) versus the samples obtained from tumors previously exposed to platinum-based chemotherapy (chemo-exposed samples; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A, B</xref>; see methods). Specifically, chemo-exposed samples exhibited higher scores for immune-related pathways (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2B</xref>) and immune cell-type scores (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2C</xref>) and had a positive correlation to PD-L1 positivity by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2D</xref>). Given these differences between the chemo-naive and chemo-exposed samples, we evaluated the associations to clinical response separately within the chemo-naive or the chemo-exposed samples.</p>
                <p id="Par12">In chemo-naive samples, pathway analysis revealed six pathways significantly enriched among tumors with objective response to niraparib/pembrolizumab (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Of these pathways, three were related to Type-I interferon signaling and these were also significantly associated with objective response rate (ORR; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Of note, all responders had a high score (the highest 25% as being positive) for at least one of the 3 Type-I interferon pathways (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2E</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Immune signatures associate with tumor regression and objective response to niraparib and pembrolizumab.</title><p><bold>a</bold> In the chemo-naive samples, pathway scores for six biological pathways were higher in the responders.

We generated single-cell resolution data on samples for 30 different antigens (see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref> for a list of antibodies and their targets), which made it possible to identify immune cell types and assay functional cell states. In total, we analyzed 6.6 million successfully segmented single cells (average 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> per tumor sample, range 1.6 × 10<sup>3</sup>–7.1 × 10<sup>5</sup>). The mean levels of markers across all cells in the samples did not associate with treatment response or other clinical features (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

Macrophages were the most abundant immune cell-type in the tumor microenvironment followed by CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3F</xref>) and both antigen presenting cells and neutrophils were more abundant in chemo-exposed samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3D, E</xref>). However, differences in tumor microenvironment composition did not associate with response (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3F</xref>). At single-cell resolution, PD-L1 expression was the highest in cells corresponding to the macrophage—dendritic cell cluster (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>), and the expression of PD-L1 was higher only in the stromal cells of chemo-exposed as compared to chemo-naive samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par17">In light of our expression profiling findings showing that Type-I interferon signaling was enriched in samples from patients with responses to niraparib/pembrolizumab, we assessed the cell-type context for interferon pathway activation in the tumor microenvironment using phospho-STAT1 (pSTAT1) expression as a marker for interferon activation. In this regard, increased mean pSTAT1 protein expression levels in exhausted, PD-1 high expressing, CD8 + T-cells significantly associated with OR (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04, Mann–Whitney <italic>U-</italic>test, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) and clinical benefit (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).

Higher pSTAT1 and Ki67 was also verified in visualizing the markers in representative immunofluorescence images of a responder compared to a non-responder (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Interestingly, tumors that were Sig3 positive had higher mean levels of PD-L1 specifically in tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C</xref>), and in IBA1 + CD11b + macrophages (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4D</xref>), compared to Sig3-negative tumors. These differences in the tumor microenvironment associated with HRD as measured by Sig3, could potentially contribute to the clinical benefit associated with a Sig3-positive status. This association was not detected with the other measures for HRD, including tumor BRCA, Myriad HRD, BROCA, and RAD51 (data provided in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

Since exhausted CD8 + T-cells were identified as the key cell-type associated with response, we next focused on the spatial interactions of other cell types towards the exhausted CD8 + T-cells.

              <p id="Par22">We report two previously unrecognized candidate predictive biomarkers to the combination of PARPi niraparib and PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab therapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer: the presence of mutational signature 3 as a surrogate of HRD and a positive immune score (IS) as a surrogate of interferon-primed, CD8-exhausted effector T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Presence of one or both tumor features was associated with significantly prolonged PFS (HR = 0.32) while absence of both was associated with absence of response to niraparib/pembrolizumab (ORR 0%). These results are clinically relevant and suggest that Sig3 and immune score may aid in selection of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who would benefit from niraparib/pembrolizumab. These findings also underscore the translational relevance, given that several previously reported biomarkers of response to PARPi and immune checkpoint inhibitors were unable to predict responses to the niraparib/pembrolizumab combination.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In addition to the assessment of mutations in specific homologous recombination repair genes, such as <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>, several genomic approaches have been utilized to detect HRD in clinical samples. These approaches include detection of hypermethylation of key DNA repair genes such as <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>RAD51C</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and detection of specific genomic aberrations or genomic “scars” that are characteristic of HRD such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and large-scale state transitions (LST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, all of which are captured by the Myriad HRD test (which was evaluated in the TOPACIO trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). Functional biomarkers of HRD have also been developed, such as the assessment of RAD51 foci assembly in cancer cells, which is known to correlate with proficient homologous recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Unlike other markers for HRD, Sig3 is a specific mutational signature characterized by a high number of larger deletions (up to 50 bp) with overlapping microhomology at breakpoint junctions, and commonly detected in ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Its presence reflects the fact that HRD leads to dependence on alternative error-prone repair mechanisms such as alternative non-homologous end joining (alt-NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining, which utilize microhomology at rearrangement junctions to rejoin and repair DNA double strand breaks. Using a machine-learning-based algorithm (SigMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> applied on panel-based sequencing data from our institutional targeted sequencing assay (OncoPanel), we found that Sig3 positivity was significantly associated with clinical benefit and prolonged PFS to the combination of niraparib and pembrolizumab. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Sig3 positivity has been associated with a response to PARPi therapy (either alone or in combination) in ovarian cancer or any other malignancy. Of note, our approach using SigMA facilitated the detection of Sig3 on panel-based sequencing, which is routinely performed on patient samples in clinical practice nowadays, without the requirement for genome-wide sequencing or fresh sample material. Furthermore, Sig3 positivity was identified in a larger proportion of tumors (51% of samples) than positivity for other markers of HRD, suggesting that Sig3 may identify HRD tumors that are missed by other HRD assays. Importantly, no assay is currently considered “gold standard” for assessing HRD in the clinical setting. Consistently, data from two large randomized phase III trials of PARPi maintenance in ovarian cancer, which incorporated either LOH, or the combination of LOH, TAI, and LST as biomarkers of HRD, showed that these measures did not capture all responders to PARPi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In fact, PARPi responses occurred even if tumors were negative for any of the HRD biomarkers thereby prompting the FDA to approve PARPis regardless of the status of the explored biomarkers of HRD.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In the context of the TOPACIO study, Sig3-positive status in patients with acquired platinum-resistant ovarian cancer may indicate either non-restored or incompletely restored homologous recombination and ongoing reliance on error-prone DNA repair mechanisms, thus leading to retained sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Additionally, tCycIF single-cell imaging showed that Sig3-positive tumors exhibited higher PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and in macrophages, suggesting that Sig3 positivity may also be a surrogate of enhanced immunogenicity and thus response to immune checkpoint blockade. This is consistent with the literature linking HRD with enhanced immunogenicity and increased PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Despite being an independent predictor for PFS and a surrogate for both HRD and enhanced immunogenicity, Sig3 positivity did not capture all responders to niraparib/pembrolizumab. Rather, we show that the combination of Sig3 positivity with a positive immune score determined the responses by increased interferon activation and exhausted CD8 + T-cells at the mRNA level. Consistently, using single-cell imaging we revealed an interferon-activated state of exhausted and effector CD8 + T-cells to be significantly associated with response, further highlighting the role of exhausted CD8 + T-cells and the response to this niraparib/pembrolizumab combination.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In the analysis of the two extreme responders, the response in the first patient was attributed to the high proportions and spatial clustering of the PD-L1-positive macrophages and exhausted CD8 + T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. By contrast, the response in the second patient was driven by genomic <italic>PD-L1</italic> and <italic>PD-L2</italic> amplification in the tumor cells, and their spatial interaction towards CD8 + T-cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that <italic>PD-L1/PD-L2</italic> amplification has been identified in an extreme responder to immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. Besides the two extreme responders, advanced single-cell spatial analyses in the whole dataset revealed prominent spatial interactions of exhausted CD8 + T-cells with macrophages and tumor cells in the responders, suggesting the that both interactions potentially contribute to the CD8 + T-cell exhaustion in the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment. The finding that tumor cell PD-L1/exhausted CD8 + T-cell interaction occurred particularly in Sig3-positive tumors provides evidence on the spatially divergent tumor microenvironment of HR-deficient tumors, potentially contributing to the enhanced responses seen in Sig3-positive tumors. In this study, the t-CyCIF single-cell imaging provided valuable insights into mechanisms of response to niraparib/pembrolizumab. Overall, our data support the premise that both molecular and spatial features in the tumor microenvironment, including spatial interactions of immune cell subpopulations at different functional states are potentially linked to response to immunotherapy, further underscoring the power of multiplexed imaging in biomarker discovery over conventional methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">We acknowledge certain limitations of this study. The two candidate predictive biomarkers we identified in this Phase 1/2 trial of niraparib/pembrolizumab in ovarian cancer are exploratory and require independent validation in subsequent studies of this or analogous PARPi/PD-1 inhibitor combinations. Samples were collected from patients enrolled in 34 different study sites in the United States, and, despite our best efforts, insufficient tumor material was available for all patients for completion of all aforementioned studies. These limitations notwithstanding, our findings are clinically and translationally-relevant given that combined PARP and immune checkpoint inhibition is an area of active clinical investigation with several ongoing clinical trials in ovarian cancer (in both first-line and recurrent settings), as well as in multiple other cancer types. Our study highlights that careful analysis of genomic information and single-cell spatially resolved data from clinical samples can provide valuable information on the determinants of response to therapy, and accelerate the development of predictive biomarkers to aid in patient stratification.</p>

In addition, OncoPanel sequencing was performed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> on samples from 35 patients, which had &gt;20% tumor purity as assessed by H&amp;E staining. Briefly, the pooled sample reads were deconvoluted and sorted using the Picard tools, and the reads were aligned to the reference sequence b37 edition from the Human Genome Reference Consortium, using bwa (version0.7.17). Duplicate reads were identified and removed using Picard (version 1.90). The alignments were further refined using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 1.6-5-g557da77) for localized realignment around indel sites and recalibration of the quality scores. Mutation analysis for single-nucleotide variants was performed using MuTect v. 1.1.4 and annotated by Oncotator, and insertions and deletions were called using Indelocator. For each sequencing run, non-neoplastic FFPE and blood samples were included to identify and filter batch-specific sequencing artefacts. To filter out potential germline variants, the standard pipeline removes SNPs present at &gt;0.1% in Exome Variant Server, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link> accessed 30 May, 2013), present in dbSNP, or present in an in-house panel of normals (<italic>n</italic> = 141), but rescues those also present in the COSMIC database. We further filtered this data by removing variants present at &gt;0.1% in the gnomAD v.2.1.1 database or were annotated as Benign or Likely Benign in the ClinVar database. Any filtered variants that were reported in COSMIC more than twice were rescued and presented for manual review. All remaining mutations were used for the mutational signature calls with SigMA, including mutations that do not have a consequence such as synonymous and intronic mutations. Mutational signatures were called using SigMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For this study, SigMA was optimized for OncoPanel using simulations generated specifically for its library using whole genome sequenced ovarian cancer datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.
