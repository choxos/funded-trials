                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Propionic acid (PA) is a common food preservative generally recognized as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration; however, exogenous PA has effects on glucose metabolism that are not fully understood. Our preclinical studies demonstrated exogenous PA increases glucagon, norepinephrine, and endogenous glucose production (EGP).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Research design and methods</title>
                  <p>We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 28 healthy men and women to determine the effect of PA (1500 mg calcium propionate) on these factors. Subjects had two study visits, each preceded by a 1 week, PA-free diet. During each visit, glucose, insulin, glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and EGP were assessed for 2 hours after oral administration of PA/placebo under resting conditions (protocol 1) and during either a euglycemic (~85–90 mg/dL) or hypoglycemic (~65–70 mg/dL) hyperinsulinemic clamp (protocol 2).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>PA, as compared with placebo, significantly increased: (1) glucagon and norepinephrine during protocol 1; (2) glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine under euglycemic conditions in protocol 2; and (3) norepinephrine, epinephrine, and EGP under hypoglycemic conditions in protocol 2.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Oral consumption of PA leads to inappropriate activation of the insulin counterregulatory hormonal network. This inappropriate stimulation highlights PA as a potential metabolic disruptor.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are serious health problems that are influenced significantly by environmental factors such as diet.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Over the past 30 years, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of obesity in the USA (from 22% to 40% of adults between 1988 and 2016). By 2016, 72% of US adults were overweight or obese and 16% had diabetes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These rapid increases in obesity and diabetes are likely driven by environmental factors, not genetic drift. The increasing use of processed and ultra-processed foods in modern nutrition involves the utilization of several chemicals in the processing, preservation, and packaging of foods. Some of these chemicals have been suspected to exert adverse metabolic health effects, but there is an absence of studies evaluating these effects.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The use of food preservatives, such as propionic acid (PA), has also increased substantially in recent decades.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> PA is a naturally occurring short-chain fatty acid that is commonly used as an antimicrobial agent in packaged foods such as bread and cheese. It is ‘generally recognized as safe’ by the FDA and is widely used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The metabolic consequences of consuming PA are not fully understood in humans.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>PA increases hepatic pyruvate cycling through its conversion into succinate, thus increasing gluconeogenesis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> As early as 1912, it was noted that administration of PA to dogs increased glucose levels by more than could be accounted for by gluconeogenic conversion of PA alone.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Later studies similarly demonstrated PA as a potent stimulator of endogenous glucose production (EGP) in various mammals.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7 10</xref> Given this unique property of PA, it is widely used in feeds for dairy cows and sheep to increase glucose concentration in milk.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> More recently, it became apparent that direct conversion of propionate to glucose accounts for only 5% of the total increase in PA-induced increase in glucose production, with the remainder attributed to activation of pyruvate carboxylase by mechanisms that remain elusive.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Data regarding the effects of propionate as a food preservative in humans are limited. In healthy human subjects, consumption of bread supplemented with PA resulted in mild postprandial hyperinsulinemia at 60 min and attenuated suppression of postmeal FFA, which is suggestive of increased adipose tissue insulin resistance as expected with increased catecholamine concentration.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Preclinical studies in mice by us and others suggested that acute administration of PA induced a marked glycogenolysis. Along with increasing glucose production and insulin secretion, PA administration stimulated the release of glucagon, fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), and norepinephrine, which likely mediated the hyperglycemic effects of PA.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref> Furthermore, chronic oral administration of PA for 20 weeks in mice resulted in gradual weight gain, insulin resistance, increased fat mass, and increased EGP relative to placebo.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>In our pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study involving 14 participants, consumption of a mixed meal containing a low dose of PA (1 g of calcium propionate) led to significant postprandial increases in glucagon, norepinephrine, FABP4, and insulin resistance (assessed by Matsuda Index<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) as compared with a control meal.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These results raise the possibility that PA in food could contribute to impaired metabolic function in humans. However, this was a small study, and the impact of PA on EGP was not studied.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the goal of the current study was to determine the effect of low dose PA, as compared with placebo, on glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and EGP under basal conditions and in the presence of hyperinsulinemic euglycemic and hypoglycemic clamps in healthy individuals. We performed both euglycemic and mildly hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps; hypoglycemia is a known stimulator of insulin counterregulatory hormones and could potentially amplify the effects of PA on these outcomes.</p>

                <p>Healthy men and women, aged 18–55 years with body mass index 20–35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited using online postings and physical flyers. Eligible participants provided written informed consent during a screening visit, which included a complete medical history, physical examination, blood analysis (complete blood count, lipid panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), complete metabolic panel), urine pregnancy test (if applicable), and ECG. Exclusion criteria included any acute or chronic illness, current or ongoing use of prescription medications, systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg, abnormal ECG, pregnancy or breast feeding, history of current smoking, alcohol or drug abuse, and abnormal laboratory values (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;45 mL/min, impaired hepatic function (aspartate amino transaminase and/or alanine amino transaminase &gt;2.0×upper limit of normal range), hematocrit &lt;36% for females and &lt;41% for males, and abnormal TSH). Sample size was determined using a power calculation described below under ‘Statistics’ section.</p>

                <p>Each participant completed two study visits (oral PA administration visit and oral placebo administration visit, in random order) with a minimum of a 7-day between visits wash-out period (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). Prior to each visit, participants were provided with a PA-free diet for 7 days prepared by the BWH Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) Nutrition Core. Participants, study staff, and nursing staff were blinded to drug treatment. Participants were randomized with equal probability to one of two sequence groups (PA then placebo, or placebo then PA) using a permutated block method. Randomization was done by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Investigational Drug Service using the website randomization.com. The research pharmacists did not have contact with study participants and did not communicate with study staff regarding assigned treatments. Study staff were blinded to assigned treatments until after the last participant completed study procedures.</p>

Vital signs were measured, and urine pregnancy testing was done (if applicable) on arrival. An intravenous line was placed in a hand or wrist and then the hand was placed in a heated (66°C (150°F)) acrylic ‘Hot Box’ to facilitate frequent blood draws throughout the procedure. A second, antecubital intravenous line was placed to be used for infusions of deuterated glucose, dextrose, and insulin. Blood was drawn (T=−10 min) and an infusion of deuterated glucose (0.03 mg/kg/min [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, Massachusetts, USA) was then initiated at approximately 08:00 hours (T=0 min) and continued throughout the 7-hour study.</p>

                <title>Protocol 1</title>
                <p>Participants received their first dose of either four 500 mg calcium propionate capsules (796 mg PA) (Niacet, Niagara Falls, New York, USA) or four 269 mg calcium carbonate capsules (Roxane Laboratories/Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Columbus, Ohio, USA) orally over the course of 15 min starting 2 hours after deuterated glucose infusion was initiated (T=120 min). Both treatments contained the same mass of calcium. After the first five subjects, the dose was decreased by 25% from four to three 500 mg calcium propionate capsules (597 mg PA) or three 269 mg calcium carbonate capsules, and the first pill of each administration was given with 4 oz sugar-free jell-O to reduce incidence of nausea. PA is typically found in processed food at a concentration of 0.15–0.30% w/w.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> At this concentration, 270–530 g of PA-containing foods (eg, cheese sandwich) contains an equivalent mass of PA to what was administered in this protocol.</p>
                <p>Blood samples for measurement of glucose, insulin, glucagon, plasma catecholamines, and enrichment of deuterated glucose were drawn periodically (see study visit timeline, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>). Blood draws at T=−10 and 120 min were used for calculating baseline EGP.</p>

Insulin (Humulin R, Lilly USA, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA or Novolin R, Novo Nordisk, Plainsboro, New Jersey, USA) was infused at 100 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min for 5 min and 50 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min for 5 min (priming doses) followed by an infusion of 25 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min. Twenty per cent dextrose infusion containing 0.455% deuterated glucose was infused at a variable rate in order to achieve the desired blood glucose targets.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Blood glucose was measured every 5 min using a Hemocue (HemoCue, Angelholm, Sweden) and/or YSI bedside glucose analyzer (YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose &amp; Lactate Analyzer; YSI, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). A second dose of calcium carbonate or calcium propionate was administered 1 hour into the hyperinsulinemic clamp (T=300 min). Participants underwent either euglycemic (85–90 mg/dL) or hypoglycemic (65–70 mg/dL) hyperinsulinemic clamp at both study visits. Hyperinsulinemic clamps were terminated 3 hours after initiation (T=420 min).</p>

During euglycemic clamp, PA as compared with placebo significantly increased glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine but had no significant effect on EGP. During hypoglycemic clamp, PA as compared to placebo increased norepinephrine, epinephrine, and EGP, but had no significant effect on glucagon. Glucose is reported as observed means ± standard deviation and the mixed model analysis controls for time to determine the effect of PA vs placebo. Insulin, glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and EGP are reported as least squares means ± least squares standard error, and the mixed model analysis controls for sex, BMI, age, time, average blood glucose, and baseline value at T=300 minutes to determine the effect of PA vs placebo. Post-hoc, pairwise Wilcoxon test was used to compare responses between PA and placebo at individual timepoints. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01. N=12 for panels A–J and L, N=11 for panel K. Gray bar indicates time of PA or placebo consumption.</p>

              <p>This placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluates the acute effects of PA versus placebo on glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and EGP under three conditions: fasted resting conditions, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, and hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Under euglycemic conditions in the presence or absence of infused insulin, consumption of PA as compared with placebo leads to an activation of a significant insulin counterregulatory response, namely an increase in glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Under mild hypoglycemic conditions in the presence of infused insulin, when glucagon levels were already elevated, PA consumption, as compared with placebo, further increased catecholamine levels with a subsequent rise in EGP. Thus, PA consumption provokes an inappropriate stimulation of the insulin counterregulatory network under euglycemic conditions, and an exaggerated response under mild hypoglycemic conditions, leading to reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity (ie, increased EGP).</p>
              <p>The current findings that PA increases glucagon and norepinephrine are consistent with our prior preclinical studies demonstrating acute effects of PA on glucagon and norepinephrine and our studies in humans showing that consumption of PA in a mixed meal increases glucagon and norepinephrine.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In this study, we extended these published results to show that PA increases epinephrine under conditions of euglycemic and hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemia. With mild hypoglycemia, PA increased EGP, likely secondary to PA-induced increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The ability of PA to reduce hepatic insulin sensitivity (ie, blunt the insulin-induced decrease in EGP) under mildly hypoglycemic conditions is consistent with our preclinical data that PA consumption reduces insulin sensitivity.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>PA consumption resulted in a significant increase in insulin counterregulatory hormones under fasting euglycemic conditions, although EGP was not significantly different than placebo. There could be several reasons for our inability to observe a change in EGP under these conditions. First, in this study, healthy individuals were enrolled. Potentially, studying individuals with obesity or impaired insulin sensitivity could allow for detection of an effect of PA on EGP under euglycemic conditions. Second, it is possible that by studying individuals under fasting conditions, there was insufficient glycogen to produce significant glucose via glycogenolysis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Indeed, the hyperglycemic response induced by PA in various mouse models was attributed to marked glycogenolysis and was significantly attenuated in the fasting conditions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Third, the increases in glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were mild, and had relatively minimal effects on EGP. Yet, human exposure to oral PA is in the context of prandial conditions, usually with the consumption of processed food-based meal. In this setting, the expected postmeal inhibition of EGP and the increase in glycogen synthesis may be disrupted by an inappropriate PA-induced increase in glucagon and catecholamines. However, further studies will be needed to confirm these effects.</p>
              <p>The observed effect of PA versus placebo on norepinephrine precedes that on glucagon by 30 min. This timing is consistent with preclinical studies demonstrating that blocking norepinephrine release with hexamethonium, an inhibitor of sympathetic nervous system activation, blunts the effect of PA on glucagon, suggesting that sympathetic activation is upstream to the effect of PA on glucagon.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Indeed, PA has been demonstrated to directly regulate norepinephrine release by sympathetic neurons via activation of G-Protein Receptor 41.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 9</xref></p>
              <p>Hypoglycemia is a known stimulator of glucagon and catecholamines.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In our studies, glucagon levels were increased with hypoglycemia relative to euglycemia prior to the second administration of PA or placebo. Under these conditions of higher glucagon levels during the hypoglycemic clamp, the further increase in epinephrine is robust, increasing by ~twofold with PA as compared with placebo and ~fourfold over the levels observed in the euglycemic clamp (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). So, if we were to estimate the cumulative ‘EGP driving force’, it is significantly higher in the hypoglycemic clamp conditions, which is likely the driving force for why we observed an increase in EGP with PA versus placebo under hypoglycemic conditions. Mild hypoglycemia was able to uncover the disrupting effects of PA that were not otherwise revealed. Thus, in the setting of processed foods-based diet, exposure to exogenous PA may lead to metabolically inappropriate activation of the integrated insulin counterregulatory hormonal network.</p>
              <p>The chronic effects of repeated exposure to PA are uncertain in humans but could contribute to insulin resistance, impaired glycemic control, and gradual weight gain. This study reveals statistically significant effects of acute PA administration on the insulin counterregulatory network that, although small in magnitude, suggest that further research into the chronic effects of this food preservative in humans is warranted. Chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance may be the cause, and not only the consequence, of weight gain and obesity.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Inappropriate sympathetic nervous system activation and increases in counterregulatory hormones may be particularly important for patients with diabetes since reduced suppression of EGP in the postprandial state is a concern in diabetes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, inappropriate changes in glucagon and catecholamines could have adverse effects other than those relating to glucose metabolism. The hormone perturbations we observed in this physiological study with acute oral administration of PA highlight the need for further investigation into the chronic effects of this common food preservative.</p>
              <p>There are potential limitations to this study. First, the study included a PA-free diet prior to each study visit, but some participants may not have complied, thus beginning the study procedures with PA already in their system. Their blood PA levels were not measured. Second, while all participants fasted for at least 8 hours, it is possible that some fasted for much longer and this affected their ability to regulate EGP. Third, the EGP calculation assumes a blood glucose steady state, but it is possible that administration of PA disrupts this steady state. Fourth, we assessed the impact of PA versus placebo under mildly hypoglycemic conditions; it is possible that the depth of hypoglycemia could impact our outcomes. Fifth, this healthy population included a wide range of BMIs, which could have introduced some metabolic heterogeneity and obscured treatment effects. Sixth, we did not collect data on the menstrual cycle, and this could have influenced some outcomes. Seventh, it is possible that performing protocols 1 and 2 sequentially on the same day could have blunted our ability to detect the full effects of PA on glucose metabolism. Lastly, this study had a small sample size, so more significant differences and correlations may have been uncovered with a larger sample size.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, consumption of PA as compared with placebo leads to an activation of the insulin counterregulatory response, that is, increases in glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and in the presence of mild hypoglycemia this is sufficient to increase EGP. The amount of PA administered in this study is similar to what is commonly consumed in processed foods. Future studies are needed to determine whether chronic consumption of processed foods with PA could have long-term, adverse metabolic effects.</p>
