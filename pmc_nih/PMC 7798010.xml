                  <p id="Par1">Female Mexican Immigrants (FMIs) experience high rates of depression compared with other populations. For this population, depression is often exacerbated by social isolation associated with the experience of immigration.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Aim 1. To measure whether a culturally situated peer group intervention will reduce depression and stress associated with the experience of immigration.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Aim 2. To test whether an intervention using a “women’s funds of knowledge” approach results in improved resilience, knowledge and empowerment.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Aim 3. To investigate whether a culturally situated peer group intervention using a women’s funds of knowledge approach can give participants a sense and experience of social and physical connection (“emplacement”) that is lost in the process of immigration.</p>

                  <p id="Par5">This mixed-methods study will implement “<italic>Tertulias</italic>” (“conversational gatherings” in Spanish), a peer support group intervention designed to improve health outcomes for FMI participants in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We will document results of the intervention on our primary hypotheses of a decrease in depression, and increases in resilience and social support, as well as on our secondary hypotheses of decreased stress (including testing of hair cortisol as a biomarker for chronic stress), and an increase in social connectedness and positive assessment of knowledge and empowerment.</p>

                  <p id="Par6">This project will address mental health disparities in an underserved population that experiences high rates of social isolation. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that health challenges that may appear too complex and too hard to address can be using a multi-level, holistic approach. Our use of hair samples to test for the 3-month average levels of systemic cortisol will contribute to the literature on an emerging biomarker for analyzing chronic stress.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Social Isolation is a critical health risk factor affecting millions of people in the U.S. and, disturbingly, has been shown to have an even larger social impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While most people would not think of social isolation as a “health” issue per se, as a chronic stressor, it is a well-established health risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] associated with the experience of depression, loneliness, and other mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], increased risk for the development of chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and even mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Despite evidence that social isolation is both a major health risk factor and that it is increasing, it continues to be under-assessed and under-addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There is a lack of consensus on how to screen for risk of social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and few studies have attempted to document prevalence beyond narrow populations (such as older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or individuals with a chronic health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>])<bold>.</bold> Most reviews of social isolation as a health risk suggest that actual prevalence in the U.S. is much higher than has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Because social isolation is caused by a complex concatenation of individual, family, social, and structural factors, any solution must go beyond individual treatment. Therefore, it is difficult to design an intervention that is functionally viable or economically sustainable in a clinic setting. The need, then, is determining what type of intervention can be developed given that few successful or sustainable examples have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">Cacioppo &amp; colleagues describe how a lack of social relationships can become “toxic” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], with severe, negative, cascading impacts on individual health and family wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the challenge of dealing with “toxic” social isolation is disproportionately greater for immigrants and contributes to mental and physical health disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Immigrants leave behind meaningful social, emotional, and cultural connections in their home country. In the new setting, it is often difficult to create social relationships, feel socially, emotionally, and culturally connected to other people, or have knowledge regarding access to essential resources. Language barriers, social stigma, discrimination, and poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]—the structural circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] of immigrants’ lives—exacerbate this dynamic. Increasingly, the migration experience itself is understood as a risk factor for clinically significant mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For Mexican immigrants, despite a protective effect of immigration on health discussed as the “Hispanic paradox” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in which many first generation immigrants demonstrate better health than their U.S.-born counterparts, further cross-border research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that controls for demographic variables has revealed that Mexican immigrants have twice the risk (odds ratio of 1.8) for first onset of any depressive disorder than those in Mexico who do not immigrate. As such, recognizing social isolation and related depression as health disparities requires that we consider both the complex, multifactorial nature of how social isolation operates in the lives of immigrants through multiple “social determinant” pathways, as well as the multilevel impact on individuals, families, and the immigrant community. Merrill Singer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] conceptualized how multiple streams of influence can come together to form a “syndemic” in which the synergistic interaction of social, environmental, economic, and political factors produce disease—often disproportionately affecting a particular group. The syndemic framework was explored in a recent special edition of The Lancet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] as a comprehensive approach for addressing health disparities. A syndemic framework is useful for thinking about how social isolation creates toxic health problems in immigrant communities and highlights the need for holistic solutions.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Women immigrants, in particular, are at high risk for social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. For many first generation female Mexican immigrants (FMIs) from low-income households, the elements that have been identified as key protective factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] (culture and family) are eviscerated by social isolation. For FMIs, social isolation from the loss of extended family networks is often experienced as a form of cultural bereavement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] that is emotionally traumatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], leading to disproportionately high rates of depression. As a group, Latinas (Hispanic women) have higher rates of depression (14%) compared with non-Hispanic white women (7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Yet troublingly, Latinas are less likely to receive mental health treatment (56% vs 72%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, research has shown that for FMIs, while many recent immigrants report less depressive symptomology the closer they are to arrival in the U.S., the longer a FMI lives here, her risk for depression increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Moreover, the rate of depressive disorders among FMIs is twice that for male Mexican immigrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. While it is challenging to find statistical data to describe an immigrant subgroup such as FMIs, a number of studies that disaggregate data or that have focused specifically on FMIs reveal alarming insights. A study with Latinas in South Florida, 95% of whom were immigrants including many FMIs, found that 38% of participants screened positive for depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In a study of a nursing intervention with FMIs and their children, 36% of participants reported depression at or above cut-off for referral—higher than the national average of 10% for all Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. And in a study of Mexican immigrant patients at a health center in San Antonio, FMIs were three times more likely (32%) than non-Hispanic white women (10%) to present with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">In two of our prior community-engaged, NIH-funded research projects, we revealed the key nature of group interaction in the lives of Latina women, including FMIs. One of our projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] focused on women’s social networks and food insecurity in a historic Latino community, and our intervention involved project events (“fiestas”) where women learned to lead meetings and interacted with each other in a way that resulted in increased participant ability to adapt to new circumstances (resilience), increased recognition of personal assets (empowerment) and more social connectivity. Social interaction helped participants to see their own reality reflected in the lives of other women. Information presented and discussed at project events improved critical understanding of the things that influence people’s lives and increased women’s desire to become involved in the community.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In our other study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], we worked with a FMI social isolation support group. For immigrant women, the realities of the immigration experience mean that the process of building relationships and creating or finding a social network of support is often extremely challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We found that 100% of the FMI participants reported that their experience in the support group had been helpful or even transformational in their lives in relation to forming social relationships and friendships, and increasing their sense of social connectedness by making them feel as if they are not alone. Listening to others, and sharing experiences, feelings, ideas, and information helped them understand their own problems and the problems of others with a new lens. Participation in the group also reduced depression and relieved stress and anxiety. And, participants reported that participation in the group was empowering to them as women. For FMIs then, social interaction plays a critical role in assisting them to rebuild their lives, redefine or reclaim their identity(s), and maintain health through shared knowledge and access to resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The group experience in our project was key in creating a mechanism for positive social engagement.</p>

An intervention should find a cultural and contextual “fit,” but it should also be strategically designed to leverage dimensions of culture and context to enhance intended outcomes.

They postulate that women have “historically accumulated and culturally developed bodies of knowledge and skills” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We propose that women bring these funds to their participation in health interventions and that the success of a health intervention is mediated by the extent to which program design positively leverages cultural values and accommodates the socio-economic circumstances of a population in a way that incorporates and values participants’ knowledge and experience (<italic>funds of knowledge</italic>), and creates synergy with the specific social dynamics that define participants’ everyday lives (<italic>situated in participants’ culture and context</italic>). This synergy creates a learning environment that promotes transformative personal and social change, and nurtures empowering individual psychosocial dynamics that increase resilience and improve health outcomes.</p>

A large body of literature has explored the significant ways place is connected to health and wellness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] through multi-level environmental influences in which an individual is embedded—many of which are defined as the social determinants of health. However, social science researchers have identified that the ways that a person experiences and perceives a connection to a place is also key. This sense of “<italic>emplacement</italic>,” both spatial and social, plays an important role in personal wellbeing. Social connectedness is an essential component of this dynamic. Feminist scholars have expanded this concept through investigation of the gendered dimensions of “emplacement” in which women are <italic>displaced</italic> from historically male dominant spaces and therefore compelled to create alternative, protected spaces for feeling connected and engaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

              <p id="Par31">This study is a randomized control trial (RCT) with open assignment to two groups—one group receiving the study intervention and the other with no intervention. This study will implement the “Tertulias” peer support group intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] that we developed to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities related to social isolation and depression for FMI participants in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We will build on and leverage our extensive preliminary research about women’s social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] using a multi-level, community-engaged approach. Our intervention uses an innovative, culturally and contextually situated peer support group design that we developed to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for FMI participants in Albuquerque, New Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">We will use rigorous, mixed-method research to document results of the intervention on our primary hypotheses of a decrease in depression and increases in resilience and social support, as well as on our secondary hypotheses of decreased stress (including an innovative test of cortisol levels in hair as an objective biochemical indicator for degree of chronic stress), and increases in social connectedness and positive assessment of knowledge and empowerment gained through the Tertulias intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par34">We will test whether the intervention reduces social isolation as a mechanism for reducing depression by leveraging positive cultural dynamics and women’s funds of knowledge to nurture social connectedness, knowledge, and resiliency factors in the lives of participants in a transformative way.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The proposed study will be conducted in New Mexico by researchers at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The Tertulias intervention groups will be conducted at the facilities of our partner organizations: The Hopkins Center/Centro Sávila and One Hope Centro de Vida Health Center. Both partners are nonprofit healthcare organizations, The Hopkins Center/Centro Sávila provides clinical behavioral and mental health counseling. One Hope Centro de Vida Health Center is a community-run health clinic.</p>
              <p id="Par36">This project focuses on FMIs. All participants will be female immigrants over the age of 18 who were born in Mexico, report household income below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), speak Spanish fluently, and who are not incarcerated.</p>
              <p id="Par37">We will test the integration of our three theoretical frameworks in the Tertulias peer support group intervention. Peer support groups have been shown to be efficacious for a variety of contexts, populations, and health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. For women immigrants, culturally based interaction with peers in protected spaces that promote personal empowerment is important for rebuilding lives, redefining or reclaiming identity(s), and knitting a strong social fabric to make women and their families healthy and resilient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Yet just bringing women together would not likely result in systematic change to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities. As per our theoretical architecture, cultural and contextual dimensions of women’s lives need to be considered (<italic>situated</italic>), women’s own knowledge and experience (<italic>funds of knowledge</italic>) must be valued and validated, and women need to develop a feeling of personal connection with others and have a way to conceptually understand their lives within a larger social context (<italic>emplacement</italic>). In our preliminary research, we worked with women from the Latino community, including FMIs, to develop a novel “structured dialogue” approach for engaging small groups of participants in a way that integrates these three theoretical frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

                <p id="Par38">In both of our previous projects, participants shared stories, experiences, and ideas with each other.

                <p id="Par39">In our prior research, a trained facilitator led bi-directional “structured dialogue” that allowed discussion to occur in an organic, open-ended manner<bold>.</bold> The facilitator built on themes emerging in the peer-to-peer discussion by presenting powerful life stories and analyses from other studies of women’s health, and themes that emerged from interviews with individual participants. The group considered stories and themes that were presented and discussed them in relation to their own lives and experience—weaving together their own experiences with those of other women, both inside and outside the group. Through this process, they developed an understanding of the broader forces that influence and structure their choices and practices on an everyday basis. We found that this approach engaged women in a way that decreased depression and other negative emotional states, improved their capacity to deal with socioeconomic conditions and relationships with intimate partners, and gave them a new way of thinking about their own lives and for understanding their community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

                <title>Storytelling</title>
                <p id="Par40">Storytelling is a central component of the innovative structured dialogue group intervention that we have developed. Both of our prior projects with women used storytelling, an evidence-based strategy from research on empowerment among women that has been found to be particularly effective among women of color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In our projects, the participants shared stories of their experiences, or the facilitator presented stories from other women. For women in our studies, the act of storytelling was evocative. They shared experiences, expressed feelings, and saw the connection between their own stories and stories of others. Women found participation in this process to be empowering, giving them information and tools to understand the root causes of disparities they recognize in their own lives. The group-centered learning was generative through the development of social connections, and the identification of both individual actions and group strategies to improve health. Structured dialogue helped women participants create their own narratives in a way that was healing and personally transformative (<italic>empowering</italic>). The peer-to-peer nature of the proposed structured dialogue group intervention will help participants “locate” and “ground” (<italic>emplace</italic>) themselves within a supportive social network. The critical social “literacy” that accrues from the structured dialogue design of our model will help women further “locate” and “ground” themselves in relation to shared stories and experiences—stories and experiences from others in the group and those presented by the facilitator—that tether participants’ lives to policy and structural relations of power through transformative learning, building resilience, and becoming empowered.</p>

Each group will have 10 women and will meet weekly for 2 h over a 12-month period. Group meetings will be conducted in Spanish, led by a team of two FMI facilitators using our structured dialogue approach. Because of required safety restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, our original intention to hold these groups in-person was amended to hold the groups remotely by Zoom. We will work further with each Arm 2 participant to ensure that they know how to use Zoom and have electronic access. Because we recognize that a 2-h weekly meeting will use a significant amount of data, we will provide each Arm 2 participant with $30/month to support them to have a data plan sufficient to provide access for the meetings. Because we also recognize that the participants may be staying at home with children or other family members in a small space, we will also provide each group participant with a set of “earbud” style audio-phones to be able to provide privacy for the group from others who may be present in the room with the participant during the meetings.</p>

In the case of participants with these concerns, we will conduct the survey by phone and gather the hair sample at another time if resolution of the concern is able to be made within the timeframe of a week after starting the meetings.

                <title>Hair cortisol bio-measure of chronic stress</title>
                <p id="Par67">Health disparities research has matured through the application of the social determinants of health framework. However, the need to move beyond merely understanding social determinants to action-oriented intervention research is increasingly recognized. Identifying biomarkers to support this work is imperative. Therefore, as part of this project, we will gather hair samples to test for cortisol, a biomarker of stress. We know that stressful experience influences physical and psychological health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], and we now understand that stress can accumulate or become toxic, ultimately influencing the biology of the human body, including the hormones, cortisol and adrenalin, and the immune system. Such chronic toxic stress is an emerging construct in health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. However, measuring stress biochemically in the context of research is challenging. Many studies (the proposed study included) use psychosocial instruments that rely on self-report or recall. While often revealing valuable information, data from these instruments can be limited by respondent subjectivity or reporting bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Hence there is a critical need to develop an objective biomarker that can be used for unbaised measurement of chronic stress, such as altered hormone levels that the experience of stress provokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. In the context of this study, advances in studying hair cortisol, an emerging validated biomarker for chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] offer exciting opportunities<bold>.</bold> Cortisol levels are altered in people with chronic stress. Cortisol has traditionally been measured in blood, saliva, or urine by a variety of clinical testing approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Because of the diurnal variation in cortisol levels, these measures are unreliable. Furthermore, measures of bodily fluids offer a snapshot of cortisol levels at any particular moment that can have valuable clinical uses, but fail to reveal the bigger picture of chronicity. Unlike bodily fluids, hair provides a long-term read-out of cortisol levels over time. Typically hair grows by 1 cm per month. Therefore, cortisol extracted from 3 cm of hair detects the average cortisol levels in that person over the preceding 3 months. This innovative, non-invasive bio-measure of long-term or chronic stress is emerging with applications to a range of questions, including stress and diabetes, stress and poverty, and stress and child maltreatment<bold>.</bold> In recent literature, measurement of cortisol levels in hair has proven useful to determine the long-term effects of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], including in relation to depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Previously, there has been no good assay to determine this effect. Now, with the ability to measure average cortisol over a span of time, more complex relationships will be identified and analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]<bold>.</bold> This line of inquiry is an major advance in revealing the often subtle ways that dysregulation of cortisol levels is implicated in the risk of disease and negative health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. We will gather hair samples from all participants at baseline and 12 months to measure average levels of circulating cortisol as a biological marker for chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. The data collectors will use scissors to obtain a pencil-width (at least 3 cm long) of hair from the crown of the participant’s head as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Hair will be stored in pre-prepared foil packets placed inside plastic bags to maintain the orientation of the head-end of the hair sample. Cortisol will be extracted from 3 cm of hair measured from the scalp as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Hair will be pulverized in a Retsch Mixer Mill Type MM 400100-240 V 50/60HZ and extracted in methanol overnight, dried and re-suspended in buffer. Cortisol concentration will be measured by the Salimetrics expanded range, high sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (item 1–3002, Salimetrics, State College, PA). Cortisol levels will be compared across our dataset, and mean ± standard deviation determined. Levels ±2 S.D. from the mean will be considered elevated or depressed. Change in levels between time points (before and after the intervention) will be compared. Pregnancy (determined by a question on the survey) will be considered in our analysis, as well as hair products or steroid-containing topical lotions and drug therapies.</p>

Written consent will be obtained whenever possible, but we obtained permission for oral consent when necessary as described 2 paragraphs below in the Consent Section.</p>

                  <title>Consent</title>
                  <p id="Par112">We obtained a waiver of written consent for gathering the data required to determine eligibility and contact information. This information is necessary up front for us to recruit because we will be conducting group informational interest meetings describing the research and the consent form, and because this is a randomized study, we need to show potential participants the randomization video to determine if they really do want to participate. We will destroy the contact information from participants who later decline to participate at the time of written consent.</p>
                  <p id="Par114">All participants who enter the study will provide informed consent. We obtained permission to obtain oral consent from those who are unable to attend an in-person baseline data collection appointment because of COVID-19 restrictions. When we are attempting to schedule the appointment, it may not be feasible to have the data collectors meet with the participant in-person where the consent form would be signed prior to answering baseline survey questions or obtaining the baseline hair sample if the participant answers affirmatively to COVID-19 screening questions (e.g., positive COVID-19 test, contact with a COVID-19 person, recent out-of-state travel, fever or other symptoms of illness). We will attempt to conduct in-person data collection appointments because we need a baseline hair sample in addition to the survey questions. However, if the participant is unable to meet in-person, we do not wish to exclude the participant since the intervention is likely being conducted by Zoom and there is no further risk of contagion apart from the baseline data collection appointment. Therefore, we will obtain oral consent by phone or Zoom and document the participant’s name, the date of consent and the team member who conducted the consent. All of the consenting participants will have attended a two-hour Zoom meeting where we describe the study and the contents of the consent form in detail and show the randomization video. Following oral consent, we will provide the participant with a printed copy of the consent form by mail. We will conduct the baseline survey by phone or Zoom and we will attempt to schedule the hair sample collection at a later date, if feasible. If not feasible, the lack of hair sample for that participant will be recorded as missing data.</p>

                  <title>Confidentiality</title>
                  <p id="Par115">Guidelines for the protection of participant privacy and confidentiality will be followed in all cases. All members of the research team will maintain current Human Subjects training. They will understand the importance of privacy issues and their responsibility to maintain the highest research ethical standards in all respects. As indicated above, we obtained permission to make alterations to the consent process using a meeting, a PowerPoint presentation and a video. We believe that this will lead to superior understanding by the participants regarding the nature of participation and the concept of randomization. It will also make the study more feasible. However, women who choose will be able to have the information presented individually in a private setting. Also, we obtained permission to obtain oral consent from those who are unable to attend an in-person baseline data collection appointment because of COVID-19 restrictions. When we are attempting to schedule the appointment, it may not be feasible to have the data collectors meet with the participant in-person where the consent form would be signed prior to answering baseline survey questions or obtaining the baseline hair sample if the participant answers affirmatively to COVID-19 screening questions (e.g., positive COVID-19 test, contact with a COVID-19 person, recent out-of-state travel, fever or other symptoms of illness). We are attempting to conduct in-person data collection appointments because we need a baseline hair sample in addition to the survey questions. However, if the participant is unable to meet in-person, we do not wish to exclude the participant since the intervention is being conducted by Zoom and there is no further risk of contagion apart from the baseline data collection approintment. Therefore, we will obtain oral consent by phone or Zoom and document the participant’s name, the date of consent and the team member who conducted the consent. All of the consenting participants will have attended a two-hour Zoom meeting where we describe the study and the contents of the consent form in detail and show the randomization video. Following oral consent, we will provide the participant with a printed copy of the consent form by mail. We will conduct the baseline survey by phone or Zoom and we will attempt to schedule the hair sample collection at a later date, if feasible. If not feasible, the lack of hair sample for that participant will be recorded as missing data.</p>
                  <p id="Par116">Surveys, gathering of hair samples, and interviews will be conducted at a location to provide privacy. The final group session will not be private as it will be a group discussion resembling a focus group.</p>
                  <p id="Par117">At the beginning of each 12-month group cohort, the facilitator will instruct participants regarding privacy measures for the group context. The group participants will discuss the concept of privacy and if there is consensus, they will sign a letter committing not to discuss the content of the sessions with outsiders. All participants will be asked to sign a receipt for a merchandise card incentive which will be used for project accounting purposes only and will not be linked with or associated with research data.</p>
                  <p id="Par118">Consents and participant contact information sheets will be assigned a study ID. The ID and the contact sheet will be the only link between the participant and the data. We need to be able to maintain a link between the participant and the data to be able to notify participants of meeting logistics, to schedule follow-up appointments at 12 months, to schedule interviews, and to be able to make bi-monthly check-in calls with control participants. Consent Forms, the list of participants who provided oral consent, and contact information will be stored in separate locked cabinets in the office of the PI and with access only by the investigators. All other research data will be de-identified. The only link between the participant and the data or contact information will be through the study ID. Contact information will be destroyed 5 years following the end of the study. Consent Forms and the list of those who provided oral consent will be kept for 3 years following the end of the project, at which time they will be destroyed.</p>

We have budgeted for us to be able to present our work as a panel involving multiple members of the team, including community partners and members of the Advisory Board. We believe that this work will be of great interest to the professional community in New Mexico as the issues of social isolation and depression among FMIs are recognized as key health disparities. Our ability to demonstrate a scientific and measurable quantitative impact will be received as extremely exciting.</p>

Therefore, we have created an infrastructure to ensure that the participants have the possibility of continued social support. Centro Sávila has a continuous supply of interns (social work and counseling students) who spend at least 1 year working with clients about mental and behavioral health issues. When Tertulias groups end, we will invite participants to continue meeting with facilitation by a pair of Centro Sávila interns. This infrastructure creates a feasible way to create continuity and sustainability. One Hope will seek funding to be able to support the facilitators for groups held at their site.</p>
