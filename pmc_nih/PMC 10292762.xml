In the control group of 4 patients (1 patient did not undergo surgical resection because of abnormal preoperative cardiac clearance findings that were not deemed related to SGM-101 infusion), the mean (SD) lesion size was 1.33 (0.48) cm, 2 patients had elevated serum CEA markers, and 2 patients had normal serum CEA levels. Of the 4 patients who underwent surgical intervention, those with 2+ and 3+ tissue CEACAM5 expression had excellent tumor fluorescence, with a mean (SD) tumor to background ratio of 3.11 (0.45). In the patient cohort, the mean (SD) lesion size was 0.68 (0.22) cm, and no elevations in serum CEA levels were found. Lack of SGM-101 fluorescence was associated with benign lesions and with lack of CEACAM5 staining.</p>

              <p id="P9">Lung cancer, particularly non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carries one of the highest rates of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although implementation of screening programs in high-risk patient groups and education around tobacco use prevention have made an impact over the past few decades, NSCLC still inflicts significant strains on the general population.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Despite the introduction of advanced immune checkpoint treatments and targeted radiotherapy regimens, surgery remains the best tool in the armamentarium against the disease.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Stage by stage, surgery confers the highest survival probability in nondisseminated disease.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, success of surgical intervention is intimately related to oncologically sound disease removal by ensuring negative margins and identification of occult synchronous or metachronous lesions. Recurrence after surgery is correlated with inferior survival outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P10">Therefore, thoracic surgeons continually strive for R0 oncologic disease clearance at index operation.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Surgeons have traditionally relied on sensory feedback, such as visualization and tactile assessment, to confirm lesion localization and removal. However, with the increasing use of minimally invasive techniques, these core techniques have been continually challenged, as the surgeon has to rely on the visual field achieved via a thoracoscope or assess lesion characteristics ex vivo on the back table.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) has recently emerged as a potential solution to circumvent the current challenges.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This technology involves systemic delivery of tumor-targeted fluorochrome, which is then visualized using specialized near-infrared (NIR) (700–2526 nm) camera systems.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Several types of fluorochromes have been approved for a variety of clinical uses by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These fluorochromes include indocyanine green, pafolacianine, and gleolan, which improve outcomes in various solid organ malignant tumors, including sarcomas, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, intracranial tumors, and ovarian cancer. However, due to the large heterogeneity that exists within various NSCLC tumors, particularly lung adenocarcinomas, not all patients benefit from currently available NIR tracers.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P11">A promising target is the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen–related cell adhesion molecule type 5 (CEACAM5), also known as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Although the glycoprotein has been extensively studied and used for screening, diagnosis, and prognosis in gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms, it has been relatively underused in lung cancer, although 30% to 80% of lung adenocarcinomas express this surface receptor.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In addition, the surface glycoprotein expression in CEACAM5-positive tumors is significantly higher than that in normal tissue, making it an attractive antigen to be explored (10<sup>6</sup> surface antigens per cell).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Targeted delivery of anti-CEACAM5–conjugated NIR fluorochromes, such as SGM-101 (Surgimab), has been demonstrated in colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, with encouraging results.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> SGM-101 is an anti-CEACAM5 antibody conjugated to the NIR BM-104 fluorochrome that specifically emits fluorescence once it binds to CEACAM5-expressing tumors.

              <p id="P12">In this study, we explored the safety, efficacy, and specificity of SGM-101 during IMI-guided lung nodule resections.

Second, we assessed glycoprotein expression levels in 33 patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma from our institution to assess local rates of CEACAM5 tumor presence. Third, we performed an open-label nonrandomized controlled trial in patients with gastrointestinal tumors who presented with lung metastases based on serum CEA levels as a control and compared the results in subsequent patients who underwent SGM-101–guided primary lung cancer resection. We hypothesized that SGM-101 would specifically localize to CEACAM5-positive lung nodules and allow lesion localization in vivo, ex vivo, and on immunohistopathologic assessment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P25">Intraoperative molecular imaging–guided resections have been increasingly added to the armamentarium of solid organ malignant neoplasm resections. However, malignant tumors, particularly in the lung, are heterogonous, which requires exploration of different cellular targeting agents. One such target we explored in this study was the CEACAM5 cell surface glycoprotein, which is expressed in various adenocarcinomas, including colon, rectum, pancreas, esophagogastric, and lung adenocarcinomas.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We hypothesized that SGM-101, which is an anti-CEACAM5 antibody–conjugated fluorochrome, will specifically fluorescently label CEACAM5-positive lung nodules. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that explores CEACAM5 glycoprotein as a potential target in IMI-guided lung nodule resections.</p>
              <p id="P26">The feasibility and applicability of IMI tracers rely significantly on the clinical utility and ability to use the product in practice daily. Although the CEACAM5 glycoprotein has been extensively studied and validated in the management of various gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms, the same cannot be said in lung cancer.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Literature reports<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> demonstrate variable expression of the glycoprotein in lung cancer, and significant geographic variables are associated with the data. Therefore, we initially wanted to explore CEACAM5 as a potential target in our overall patient population.</p>
              <p id="P27">Twenty-two of 33 lung adenocarcinomas (67%) analyzed in our cohort demonstrated CEACAM5 expression by immunohistochemistry, and glycoprotein expression was largely detected in the tumor core itself rather than adjacent normal tissue, which is significant in developing targeted tracers to avoid false positivity (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">eFigures 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">eTable 1</xref> in <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of a large national cancer database similarly demonstrated NSCLC to have a high messenger RNA expression of CEACAM5 compared with normal and in line with pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers for which glycoprotein is an established clinical diagnostic and prognostic marker (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">eFigure 3</xref> in <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In addition, although the sample size was small, higher CEACAM5 expression was noted in higher-stage disease.</p>
              <p id="P28">In the control group of patients with metastatic pulmonary nodules, SGM-101 allowed for the in vivo and ex vivo localization of CEACAM5-positive tissues (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">eTable 6</xref> in <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Serum CEA levels had a good positive predictive value, but negative or normal values did not necessarily exclude fluorescence detection (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). These results corroborate previous findings of SGM-101 and indicate the glycoprotein targeting and specificity of the antibody fluorochrome conjugate, which does not change behavior in the pulmonary parenchyma.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The CEACAM5 expression levels at index primary lesion resection also appear to be correlated with metastatic CEACAM5 expression, which can further inform thoracic surgeons about the feasibility of using SGM-101 during metastasectomy.</p>
              <p id="P29">With the observation that lung parenchyma does not hinder SGM-101’s ability to penetrate pulmonary parenchyma, we explored NIR tracer lesion labeling in patients with pulmonary nodules suggestive of disease. It is our routine institutional practice not to perform diagnostic biopsy for patients with lesions concerning for primary lung cancer and unlike the control cohort did not have preoperative CEACAM5 or diagnosis status. Nevertheless, none of the 2 patients with benign tumors had any fluorescence in vivo, ex vivo, or in histologic assessment. This finding was associated with a lack of CEACAM5, TTF-1, CK 5/6, p63, and Ki-67 staining (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P30">Conversely, patients with strong CEACAM5 expression demonstrated fluorescence similar to that of the control group. SGM-101 could be detected in ex vivo analysis colocalized with CEACAM5 staining. Tumors with no CEACAM5 expression as predicted did not demonstrate any fluorescence in any setting. Unlike the control group, most lesions were smaller than 0.75 cm and tended to be deeper in the pulmonary parenchyma. The depth of lesion localization is a known challenge for NIR tracers and correlates with the emission wavelength of the target fluorochrome. With the increasing developments of new fluorochromes that operate in the NIR-II range (&gt;1000 nm), it is expected that deeper parenchyma in solid organ malignant neoplasms can be explored. We demonstrated that the targeted antibody in SGM-101 is highly specific and can potentially be conjugated to a different validated fluorochrome once NIR-II tracers become accessible.</p>
              <sec id="S20">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="P31">There are several limitations that need to be addressed in this proof-of-principle study. The sample size in each arm of the study was small, with a total of 9 patients with 14 total lesions undergoing SGM-101–guided resection. Larger clinical phase 2 and 3 randomized controlled studies are needed to discern the benefit of SGM-101 in IMI-guided lung cancer resections. In addition, in this early exploratory cohort, the selection of patients with positive serum CEA levels and/or preoperative biopsy with CEACAM5 immunohistochemical assessment can identify optimal patients who would benefit from SGM-101. Ideal patients who could benefit would be those with lesions greater than 1 cm that are closer to the pleural surface. Although the tracer adds additional cost to surgical care, potential benefits can be derived from SGM-101–guided resections. In optimally selected patients, the NIR tracer can confirm the detection of primary tumors, assess margins, and potentially identify occult lesions that would otherwise be missed by conventional means. These benefits would also facilitate surgery progression in cases of lesion fluorescence because the surgeon would not have to wait for frozen section confirmation, which can take up to 1 hour in certain facilities, therefore decreasing the time the patient is under anesthesia and operating room costs. Additional trials with larger cohorts can address these claims and challenges.</p>
