                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>It is unclear how excess adiposity and insulin resistance affect β cell function, insulin secretion, and insulin clearance in people with obesity.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We used a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure and a modified oral glucose tolerance test to evaluate the interrelationships among obesity, insulin sensitivity, insulin kinetics, and glycemic status in 5 groups of individuals: normoglycemic lean and obese individuals with (a) normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance (Ob-NFG-NGT), (b) NFG and impaired glucose tolerance (Ob-NFG-IGT), (c) impaired fasting glucose and IGT (Ob-IFG-IGT), or (d) type 2 diabetes (Ob-T2D).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), an assessment of β cell function, was greater in the Ob-NFG-NGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups than in the lean group, even when insulin sensitivity was matched in the obese and lean groups. Insulin sensitivity, not GSIS, was decreased in the Ob-NFG-IGT group compared with the Ob-NFG-NGT group, whereas GSIS, not insulin sensitivity, was decreased in the Ob-IFG-IGT and Ob-T2D groups compared with the Ob-NFG-NGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups. Insulin clearance was directly related to insulin sensitivity and inversely related to the postprandial increase in insulin secretion and plasma insulin concentration.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Increased adiposity per se, not insulin resistance, enhanced insulin secretion in people with obesity. The obesity-induced increase in insulin secretion, in conjunction with a decrease in insulin clearance, sufficiently raised the plasma insulin concentrations needed to maintain normoglycemia in individuals with moderate, but not severe, insulin resistance. A deterioration in β cell function, not a decrease in insulin sensitivity, was a determinant of IFG and ultimately leads to T2D.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Obesity is often associated with insulin-resistant glucose metabolism (i.e., impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production and insulin-mediated stimulation of muscle glucose uptake; ref. <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, many people with obesity and insulin resistance have normal fasting plasma glucose (NFG) concentrations and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) because of an increase in the plasma insulin concentration that compensates for the defect in insulin action (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The plasma insulin concentration is determined by the balance between the pancreatic β cell insulin secretion rate (ISR) and the plasma insulin clearance rate (ICR). It has been proposed that the increase in plasma insulin in people with obesity and insulin resistance is due to the ability of pancreatic β cells and tissues that clear insulin (primarily liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle) to sense the need to secrete more and clear less insulin to maintain normoglycemia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, we have recently found that the ISR is greater in people with obesity than in people who are lean, even when both groups are matched by basal plasma glucose concentration and hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This observation demonstrated that excessive body fat mass per se causes unique alterations in the relationship between plasma glucose levels and the ISR that are independent of insulin sensitivity. In addition, the ICR is dose dependent and saturable within the range of the postprandial plasma insulin concentration (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear whether the increase in the ISR and the decrease in the ICR after ingestion of glucose in insulin-resistant people with obesity and NFG and NGT are actually compensatory responses to insulin resistance or simply represent insulin hypersecretion due to obesity itself, with a concomitant dose-dependent decrease in the ICR. Moreover, the metabolic alterations (including insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and insulin clearance) that cause different types of dysglycemia in people with obesity are unclear.</p>
              <p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the independent and combined effects of obesity and insulin resistance on both the ISR and ICR during basal conditions and after glucose ingestion. We studied healthy, normoglycemic lean individuals (lean group) and 4 groups of individuals with obesity and different degrees of glycemic control: (a) NFG and NGT (Ob-NFG-NGT group); (b) NFG and impaired glucose tolerance (Ob-NFG-IGT group); (c) impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and IGT (Ob-IFG-IGT group); and (d) type 2 diabetes (Ob-T2D group). We also studied subgroups to evaluate the effects of obesity independent of insulin resistance, and insulin resistance independent of obesity on insulin kinetics. We hypothesized that (a) the ISR in relation to plasma glucose would be higher in the Ob-NFG-NGT than in the lean group because of the effect of obesity rather than the effect of insulin resistance on the ISR; (b) a decline in obesity-induced insulin hypersecretion during basal conditions and in response to an oral glucose load, rather than an increase in insulin resistance, is associated progressive deterioration in glycemic control from the Ob-NFG-NGT to the Ob-NFG-IGT to the Ob-IFG-IGT to the Ob-T2D groups; and (c) the ICR after glucose ingestion is a function of the ISR and is inversely related to plasma insulin concentrations, independent of whole-body insulin sensitivity. We evaluated insulin kinetics during a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with frequent blood sampling. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.</p>

                <p>Although the participants in all groups met the same inclusion age criteria, the mean age of the obese groups increased as the glycemic status of the groups deteriorated (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), presumably because the prevalence and severity of dysglycemia increase with age (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The 4 obese groups were matched in terms of percentage of body fat (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). By design, the fasting plasma glucose concentration and the plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after glucose ingestion increased from the lean to the Ob-NFG-NGT to the Ob-NFG-IGT to the Ob-IFG-IGT to the Ob-T2D groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The fasting plasma insulin concentration and basal ISR increased from the lean to the Ob-NFG-NGT to the Ob-NFG-IGT to the Ob-IFG-IGT groups, but were not different between the Ob-T2D and the Ob-NFG-NGT groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The basal endogenous glucose production rate was higher in the Ob-T2D group than in any of the other groups, with no differences among the other groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All individuals in the obese groups were more insulin resistant than were those in the lean group and, on average, individuals in the obese groups with IGT were more insulin resistant than were those in the obese group with NFG-NGT and the obese group with T2D (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, we noted considerable variability in insulin sensitivity among participants in each group (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI154068DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI154068DS1</ext-link>). The basal plasma ICR was higher (<italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in the lean group than in any of the obese groups and was not different among the obese groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); the basal ICR directly correlated with insulin sensitivity in the entire study population (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.64; <italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) and among only lean participants (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.48; <italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) or only participants with obesity (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.60; <italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>).

                <p>The plasma glucose concentration AUC for 180 minutes after glucose ingestion (AUC<sub>0–180</sub>) was not different in the Ob-NFG-NGT or the lean groups and increased from the Ob-NFG-NGT to the Ob-NFG-IGT to the Ob-IFG-IGT to the Ob-T2D groups (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). The difference in glucose AUC<sub>0–180</sub> between the Ob-IFG-IGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups was due to differences in fasting plasma glucose concentrations, because the incremental AUC<sub>0–180</sub> was not different between the 2 groups. Both the plasma insulin concentration AUC<sub>0–180</sub> and the ISR AUC<sub>0–180</sub> were highest in the 2 obese groups with IGT, with no differences between these 2 groups, and both the insulin concentration AUC<sub>0–180</sub> and the ISR AUC<sub>0–180</sub> were higher in the Ob-NFG-NGT and the Ob-T2D groups than in the lean group (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, B and C</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). The plasma ICR decreased rapidly during the first 30 minutes after glucose ingestion in all groups followed by a much slower decline in ICR values from 30 to 120 minutes and a slight increase thereafter in the lean and Ob-NFG-NGT groups, but not in the Ob-NFG-IGT, Ob-IFG-IGT, or Ob-T2D groups (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The average ICR during the OGTT and the ICR AUC<sub>0–180</sub> were greater in the lean and Ob-T2D groups than in the Ob-NFG-IGT, Ob-IFG-IGT, and Ob-NFG-NGT groups, with no differences between the lean and Ob-T2D groups or among the Ob-NFG-IGT, Ob-IFG-IGT, and Ob-NFG-NGT groups, respectively (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>The ISR in relation to the plasma glucose concentration during the first 30 minutes after glucose ingestion, when plasma glucose was rising, was greater in both the Ob-NFG-NGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups than in the lean group, with no difference between the 2 obese groups (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The relationship between ISR and glucose was best described by a second-order polynomial curve, which is consistent with a rapid initial insulin release in response to a rapid change in plasma glucose after the ingestion of glucose (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The ISR at any plasma glucose concentration and the slope of the ISR-glucose relationship curve were lower (<italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in the Ob-IFG-IGT group than in the Ob-NFG-NGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups and decreased further in the Ob-T2D group. The differences in β cell function among groups were maintained when the ISR values were expressed as pmol/min per m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area to adjust for differences in body size between participants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The differences and similarities among groups in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assessed during the entire 180-minute OGTT (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>) was the same as those observed from 0 to 30 minutes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast to the curvilinear relationships observed between the ISR and plasma glucose concentration, the relationships between plasma insulin and glucose concentration were linear (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) as a result of the postprandial decrease in ICR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) that increased the plasma insulin concentration relative to the ISR. The early rapid postprandial decline in the ICR during the OGTT (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) was consistent with a rapid concentration-dependent saturation of hepatic insulin clearance (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and was not different among groups when assessed in relation to either the plasma insulin concentration (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) or the ISR (data not shown). To evaluate whether differences in the number of men and women in our study groups could have affected the results, we performed the analysis with only women in each group and found that the results were qualitatively the same when men were excluded from the analyses (data not shown).</p>

However, both fasting and total postprandial (AUC<sub>0–180</sub>) plasma insulin concentrations and ISRs were higher in the obese group than in the lean group (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, B and C</xref>).

                  <p>The subgroups of participants in the Ob-NFG-NGT group that were “insulin sensitive” or “insulin resistant” (defined as insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate values above or below the group median value, respectively) were matched by age and adiposity, and whole-body insulin sensitivity was approximately 80% greater in the insulin-sensitive group than the insulin-resistant group (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The median value for the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate was 350 nmol glucose/kg fat-free mass per minute (FFM/min) per mU insulin/L. This cut-point value was nearly the same as the lowest value for insulin-stimulated glucose disposal observed in the lean group (355 nmol glucose/kg FFM/min per mU insulin/L). Accordingly, participants in the obese insulin-sensitive group were as insulin sensitive as the lean participants and participants in the obese insulin-resistant group were more insulin resistant than the lean participants. The fasting plasma glucose concentration was not different between the 2 groups, but the fasting plasma insulin concentration was approximately 50% higher in the insulin-resistant group than in the insulin-sensitive group (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The plasma glucose concentration AUC<sub>0–180</sub> tended to be greater, and both the insulin concentration AUC<sub>0–180</sub> and the ISR AUC<sub>0–180</sub> were greater in the insulin-resistant group than in the insulin-sensitive group (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, A–C</xref>). Both the basal ICR and the ICR after glucose ingestion were lower (<italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in the insulin-resistant group than in the insulin-sensitive group (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), and the difference remained even when the ICR was expressed relative to the plasma insulin concentration (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The greater ISR during the OGTT in the insulin-resistant group versus the insulin-sensitive group was due to higher plasma glucose concentrations in the insulin-resistant group, because the relationship between the ISR and plasma glucose was not different between the 2 groups (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). However, the plasma insulin concentration at any plasma glucose concentration or at any ISR value was greater in the insulin-resistant group than in the insulin-sensitive group (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, F and G</xref>) because of the lower ICR in the insulin-resistant group versus that of the insulin-sensitive group.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The β cell response to glucose involves a series of sequential events that are directly related to β cell glucose oxidation and the subsequent increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, which causes the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels and plasma membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and increased cytosolic calcium, which triggers the exocytosis of insulin-containing granules (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Insulin secretion that is initially triggered by membrane depolarization (i.e., electrical trigger) is amplified by additional intracellular and extracellular metabolic signals that optimize the ISR for a given amount of glucose and the rate of change in glucose (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The normal β cell response to glucose ingestion can be considered a 2-phase process: the dynamic early phase, when plasma glucose increases rapidly after glucose ingestion, which usually occurs during the first 30 minutes, and the subsequent gradual return to baseline in conjunction with the decline in plasma glucose levels (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, adequate β cell insulin secretion, particularly in the dynamic early phase after glucose ingestion, is critical to meet the demand for insulin needed to prevent large postprandial excursions in plasma glucose concentrations.</p>
              <p>We used a 3-hour OGTT with frequent blood sampling to evaluate the effects of obesity and insulin resistance on insulin kinetics in lean people and people with obesity, who were separated into 4 distinct groups on the basis of clinical categories of glycemic control, namely Ob-NFG-NGT, Ob-NFG-IGT, Ob-IFG-IGT, and Ob-T2D. Our data demonstrate that (a) β cells were extraordinarily sensitive to changes in plasma glucose concentrations in people without T2D who were lean or obese, and very small increases in the plasma glucose concentration after glucose ingestion caused marked increases in the ISR; (b) obesity itself, independent of insulin resistance, increased GSIS; (c) GSIS was greater in the Ob-NFG-NGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups than in the lean group, but was not different between the Ob-NFG-NGT and the Ob-NFG-IGT groups; (d) the deterioration in glycemic control observed in the Ob-IFG-IGT and Ob-T2D groups compared with the other obese groups was caused by a decline in GSIS, not a decrease in insulin sensitivity; and (e) the basal ICR was directly related to insulin sensitivity, and the ICR after glucose ingestion was inversely associated with plasma insulin concentrations. These results demonstrate that the increase in the ISR induced by excess adiposity and the decrease in the ICR associated with insulin resistance and increased plasma insulin concentration were able to sufficiently raise basal and postprandial plasma insulin levels to maintain normoglycermia in individuals with obesity and moderate insulin resistance (Ob-NFG-NGT), but not in those with more severe insulin resistance (Ob-NFG-IGT and Ob-IFG-IGT). The deterioration in glycemic control observed in people with obesity and both IFG and IGT or T2D is caused by a marked decrease in the β cell response to plasma glucose (i.e., GSIS), not a decrease in insulin sensitivity. Postprandial insulin clearance (i.e., the rate of removal of insulin from plasma) is a function of the amount of insulin delivered to organs that clear insulin, so people with obesity and insulin resistance have low postprandial insulin clearance because of high ISRs and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations, whereas people with obesity and T2D have “normal” ICRs because of defective ISRs and lower postprandial insulin concentrations.</p>
              <p>Our findings contradict the common view that insulin hypersecretion in people with obesity is a compensatory β cell response to insulin resistance (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). First, we found both basal and postprandial ISRs were greater in people who are obese than in those who are lean, even when insulin sensitivity was matched in the lean and obese groups. Second, both basal and postprandial ISRs in relation to plasma glucose were not different in our Ob-NFG-NGT subgroups that were either insulin sensitive or insulin resistant. Our data indicate that the insulin secretory response to plasma glucose was already at its maximum in individuals who are obese and insulin sensitive, and did not increase further with increasing insulin resistance. A deterioration in this enhanced GSIS leads to an increase in fasting plasma glucose concentrations and decreased oral glucose tolerance that ultimately results in T2D when the β cell defect is severe. Moreover, these findings help explain why an increase in the fasting plasma glucose concentration that is still within the normal range (&lt;100 mg/dL) is associated with an increase in the risk of developing T2D (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
              <p>The mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the increase in insulin secretion caused by obesity are unclear, but probably involve an increase in both β cell numbers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and the function of individual β cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which together increase the insulin secretory response to a glucose stimulus. The increase in β cell mass associated with obesity is presumably caused by chronic stimulation of pancreatic islets by insulinogenic nutrients and growth factors (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Obesity is also associated with a decrease in β cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channel density, which enhances cellular excitability and GSIS (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Impaired GSIS is presumably caused by both a reduction in β cell mass (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and individual β cell function (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In addition, differences in the incretin response or incretin sensitivity could also be involved in causing differences in the β cell response to glucose ingestion among groups (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
              <p>It has been proposed that insulin resistance causes a compensatory decrease in the ICR that increases the plasma insulin concentration and that this compensatory response is impaired in individuals with T2D (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We found that the basal plasma ICR was directly related to insulin sensitivity and that the average basal ICR in the obese groups was approximately 20%–30% lower than that in the lean group. Therefore, compared with the lean group, approximately one-third of the higher basal plasma insulin concentration in the obese groups was due to a decrease in the ICR, and two-thirds was due to an increase in the ISR. In addition, the ICR decreased rapidly during the first 30 minutes after glucose ingestion and remained lower during the entire postprandial period compared with basal conditions in all groups. The early decrease in the ICR after glucose ingestion was blunted in the Ob-T2D group compared with that in the other groups. However, the ICR at any plasma insulin concentration was not different between the Ob-T2D group and the other obese groups and was lower in the participants with obesity and insulin resistance than in the lean participants. Insulin clearance is a receptor-mediated process that occurs predominantly in the liver (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, both cell surface insulin receptor numbers and insulin dose determine the ICR, which is a saturable process (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, insulin receptors are internalized and temporarily (for approximately 30–60 minutes) removed from the cell surface, or even degraded, after insulin binding (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The lower basal plasma ICR in insulin-resistant individuals is most likely due to fewer cell surface insulin receptors in key tissues that clear insulin (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Furthermore, the early rapid and then sustained decrease in the ICR after glucose ingestion was likely caused by the rapid and progressive increase in the ISR that then slowed (in the Ob-NFG-IGT, Ob-IFG-IGT and Ob-T2D groups) or decreased (in the lean and Ob-NFG-NGT groups), in conjunction with a reduced availability of cell surface insulin receptors. Postprandial plasma insulin clearance was greater in the Ob-T2D group than in individuals in the other obese groups, who were also insulin resistant because of the marked defect in GSIS and the decreased delivery of insulin to the liver after glucose ingestion in the Ob-T2D group. These data demonstrate that the ability to clear insulin from plasma does not differ between people with obesity and T2D versus those with obesity who are insulin resistant but do not have T2D.</p>
              <p>Our study has some limitations. First, we did not include a group of participants with obesity who only had IFG, because very few participants in our studies had isolated IFG. This is consistent with the lower prevalence of isolated fasting plasma glucose compared with both isolated IGT and IFG combined with IGT (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Second, we only included lean participants with NFG and NGT as a reference group. Therefore, we do not know whether the alterations in insulin kinetics associated with the different types of dysglycemia we observed in people with obesity are also present in lean people.</p>
              <p>In summary, the data from the present study demonstrate distinct differences in basal and postprandial insulin kinetics in individuals who are lean and in those who are obese with different categories of glycemic control. Our results show that increased adiposity per se, rather than insulin resistance, enhanced GSIS. Insulin clearance from plasma was inversely associated with both insulin resistance and insulin delivery to tissues that clear insulin. The increase in GSIS associated with obesity, in conjunction with a decrease in the ICR, can sufficiently increase the basal and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations needed to maintain normoglycemia in individuals with moderate, but not severe, insulin resistance. A decline in GSIS, rather than an increase in insulin resistance, causes IFG and ultimately T2D.</p>

                <p>All participants completed a screening evaluation after fasting overnight for 12 hours that included a medical history and physical examination, standard blood tests, and a 75 g OGTT. Exclusion criteria included taking any medication that could affect the study outcomes, a history of intestinal resection, or participation in structured exercise for more than 90 minutes per week. Glycemic status was characterized as follows: (a) NFG (fasting plasma glucose &lt;100 mg/dL); (b) NGT(plasma glucose 2 hours after glucose ingestion &lt;140 mg/dL; (c) IFG (fasting plasma glucose ≥100 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL); (d) IGT (plasma glucose 2 hours after glucose ingestion ≥140 mg/dL and &lt;200 mg/dL); and (e) history of T2D and use of diabetes medications. All lean participants had NFG and NGT. Of the 87 participants with obesity, 33 had NFG with NGT, 17 had NFG with IGT, 19 had IFG with IGT, and 18 had T2D. Participants with isolated IFG combined with NGT were not included in this study, because only 3 participants in our studies met this criterion. The participant flowchart is shown in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>. Participants with T2D were being treated with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, oral diabetes medications, and insulin. All participants were instructed to stop taking glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for 2 weeks, oral diabetes medications for 3 days, and insulin for 1 day before each admission to the Clinical Translational Research Unit. During the period of medication withdrawal, blood glucose concentrations were maintained at less than 160 mg/dL before breakfast, at less than 250 mg/dL before bedtime, and at less than 120 mg/dL the night before metabolic testing by infusing insulin as needed.</p>

                <p>Body fat mass (FM) and FFM were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. After participants fasted for approximately 12 hours overnight, they completed a 3-hour 75 g OGTT with frequent blood sampling. Blood samples were collected before (at –10, –5, and 0 minutes) and 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after glucose ingestion to determine plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations. The averages of the values obtained at –10, –5, and 0 minutes were used as the time 0 (<italic toggle="yes">t0</italic>) value. The ISR was determined by fitting the plasma C-peptide concentrations at each time point to a 2-compartment model (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). β Cell function was assessed as the relationship between the ISR and plasma glucose concentration at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes of the OGTT, when plasma glucose concentrations were rapidly increasing after glucose ingestion. The plasma ICR was calculated as the volume of plasma that was cleared of insulin per minute. The ICR is expressed as L/min and represents a measure of whole-body insulin clearance, which includes insulin removal by the liver and other tissues. During basal conditions, when the plasma insulin concentration is at steady state, the insulin removal rate from plasma equals the ISR. Therefore, the ICR was calculated as the ISR, expressed as pmol/min, divided by the plasma insulin concentration, expressed as pmol/L. After glucose ingestion, measurement of the insulin removal rate requires an assessment of both the ISR and any change in plasma insulin pool size. Accordingly, the ICR over a given time interval (<italic toggle="yes">t1–t2</italic>) after glucose ingestion was calculated as the ICR AUC<italic toggle="yes">t1–t2</italic> (expressed in liters) = <inline-graphic xlink:href="jci-132-154068-e007.jpg" id="e1" xlink:role="graphic"/>, where <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> represents the plasma insulin concentration and <italic toggle="yes">Rd I</italic> represents the insulin removal rate, which can be calculated as the difference between the ISR AUC<italic toggle="yes">t1–t2</italic> and the change in plasma insulin pool size (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Four to 8 weeks after the OGTT, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure (insulin infusion rate: 50 mU/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area/min; target plasma glucose concentration: 100 mg/dL) plus [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] or [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose infusion (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) were used to determine the basal endogenous glucose production rate, whole-body insulin sensitivity (glucose infusion rate), the hepatic insulin sensitivity index (inverse of the product of the basal endogenous glucose production rate and the plasma insulin concentration), and the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The plasma glucose concentration during the clamp procedure did not differ among groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1–3</xref>), and we have found that using either [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] or [U-<sup>13</sup>C] as glucose tracers provided identical values for the endogenous glucose production rate and the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (unpublished observation).</p>

                <p>ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in metabolic outcomes among groups. In addition, ANCOVA was performed to evaluate the potential influence of age on study outcomes. Skewed data sets were log transformed before analysis. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to describe the relationship between 2 variables. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM or the median (quartiles).</p>

                <p>ISRs during basal conditions and after glucose ingestion are usually 45% higher in individuals with obesity than in those who are lean (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In addition, we found that the ISR during a 2-hour OGTT was 49% higher and that the total ISR in relation to the plasma glucose AUC was 67% higher (8.3 ± 1.5 vs. 5.0 ± 1.2 pmol/[mg/dL×120 min], mean ± SD) in people with obesity than in lean individuals who were matched on basal plasma glucose concentration and insulin sensitivity with the obese individuals (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Using these data, we estimated that 7, 12, and 17 participants per group would be needed to detect a 45%, 35%, and 25% difference, respectively, in β cell function between groups with a power of 0.8 and an α value of 0.05.</p>
