                <p>Keloids are a type of disordered scar formation which not only show heterogeneity between individuals and within the scar itself, but also share common features of hyperproliferation, abnormal extra-cellular matrix deposition and degradation, as well as altered expression of the molecular markers of wound healing. Numerous reports have established that cells from keloid scars display Warburg metabolism—a form of JAK2/STAT3-induced metabolic adaptation typical of rapidly dividing cells in which glycolysis becomes the predominant source of ATP over oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Using the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, along with cells from patients with STAT3 loss of function (STA3 LOF; autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome) we examined the role of JAK/STAT signaling in the hyperproliferation and metabolic dysregulation seen in keloid fibroblasts. Although ruxolitinib inhibited hyperactivity in the scratch assay in keloid fibroblasts, it paradoxically exacerbated the hyper-glycolytic state, possibly by further limiting OxPhos via alterations in mitochondrial phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup>). In healthy volunteer fibroblasts, folic acid exposure recapitulated the exaggerated closure and hyper-glycolytic state of keloid fibroblasts through JAK1/2- and STAT3-dependent pathways. Although additional studies are needed before extrapolating from a representative cell line to keloids writ large, our results provide novel insights into the metabolic consequences of STAT3 dysfunction, suggest a possible role for folate metabolism in the pathogenesis of keloid scars, and offer <italic>in vitro</italic> pre-clinical data supporting considerations of clinical trials for ruxolitinib in keloid disorder.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Keloids are a type of disordered scar formation characterized by hyperproliferation, abnormal extra-cellular matrix deposition and degradation, as well as altered expression of wound healing molecular markers [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although keloid scars have common aesthetic and physical consequences, the disorder is highly heterogeneous, demonstrating: population-level heterogeneity between keloids on different individuals; topographical heterogeneity between body sites on the same individual; as well as cellular and molecular heterogeneity within the scar itself [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous reports have established that cells from keloid scars display Warburg metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. First described in neoplastic cells by Dr. Otto H. Warburg [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the Nobel winning discovery identified the propensity for rapidly dividing cells to preferentially utilize glycolysis for ATP generation at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) despite available oxygen [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Subsequent research identified over activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; in conjunction with JAK2 [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) as a central mediator of keloid pathology [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, recent publications in cancer cells have identified the JAK/STAT signaling pathways as an inducer of Warburg metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>We previously demonstrated the importance of STAT3 in the scratch assay, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT; a central process of proliferation and migration of epithelial cells) mediated wound healing in patients with autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome due to STAT3 loss of function (STAT3LOF) [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We additionally demonstrated a role for STAT3 in the therapeutic response to the commensal flora <italic>Roseomonas mucosa</italic> in atopic dermatitis [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The influence of STAT3 on Warburg physiology as well as on cell proliferation and migration require concurrent activation of JAK2 [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Given that both STAT3 and JAK2 are functions are abnormal in keloid derived cells [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we hypothesized that pharmacologic and mutational disruptions of JAK2/STAT3 would influence both the metabolic and proliferation/migration abnormalities seen in keloid cells.</p>
              <p>Although the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib inhibited the hyperactivity of a representative keloid fibroblast cell line in the scratch assay, it worsened the hyper-glycolytic state. While the keloid fibroblast line had greater total phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup>), it had less pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> co-localized with the mitochondrial marker TOM70, suggesting that STAT3-mediated abnormalities may be influenced by the mitochondrial targeting of pSTAT3. In a representative healthy volunteer fibroblast line, folic acid exposure recapitulated the exaggerated wound closure and hyper-glycolytic state of keloid fibroblasts through JAK1/2-dependent pathways. Although additional studies are needed before extrapolating from a representative cell line to keloids writ large, our results add to the growing literature implicating the JAK/STAT3 pathway in the pathogenesis of keloid scars and suggest a possible role for folate metabolism in the pathogenesis of keloid scars and offer pre-clinical data supporting consideration of clinical trials investigating the use of ruxolitinib in keloid disorder.</p>

                <p>The human primary fibroblast cell line (ATCC PCS-201-012) and the human primary human keloid fibroblast cell line (ATCC CRL-1762) were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas). Fibroblasts from patients with STAT3 loss of function were a kind gift from the Boehm lab (NIH, Bethesda, MD) collected under the IRB approved clinical trial NCT00006150 after collecting both written and oral consent from each subject. All cells were cultured and proliferated as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. 96 or 24 well plates (Corning; Corning, NY) were coated with 1mg/mL rat tail collagen (Roche; Basel, Switzerland) overnight at 4°C. For 96 well plates, 17,000–25,000 cells and for 24-well plates 100,000–150,000 cells were seeded and allowed to adhere to the culture plate for 1–2 hours. Challenge with drugs or metabolites occurred for 1 hour prior to scratch using the Autoscratch (BioTek; Winooski, VT), or 2 hours prior to Seahorse (discussed below). Cells were placed in the Cytation 5 (BioTek) at 37°C with 5% CO2; images and quantitation were performed by the Scratch App (BioTek). Ruxolitinib was purchased from Caymen Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Folic acid was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and cell were treated with a final concentration of 1mM. Rotenone was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and cell were treated with a final concentration of 1μM. Cells were used between passages 2 and 10, with matching passage numbers used within any given experiment.</p>

                <p>Cells were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde solution (PFA) (Cat. No. 15710; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 20 minutes. After fixation cells were processed for the immunostaining protocol. Cells were washed with 1X PBS three times for 5 minutes each. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (T8787-100ML; Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 15 minutes, washed in PBS, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Cat.

                <p>Cellular oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis were measured using the Seahorse Bioscience Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XFe96, Seahorse Bioscience Inc., North Billerica, MA, USA) by measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR; indicative of respiration) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR; indicative of glycolysis) in real time according to manufacturer’s protocol. Spare respirator capacity (SRC) was calculated by subtracting the basal OCR from the maximal OCR.</p>
                <p>Analysis was performed as has been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, 10,000 fibroblasts from healthy volunteers, keloid patients or STAT3 loss of function patients were seeded in 96-well cell culture microplates designed for XFe96 in 200 μl of appropriate growth media. Fibroblasts were cultured with various stimuli for 2 hours. Prior to measurements, growth media was removed and replaced with 180 μl pH ready Seahorse Assay Media (Agilent; Catalog #103575–100) and incubated in the absence of CO2 for 1 hour in the Biotek Cytation1 instrument during which time pre-assay brightfield images were collected. Using a Mito Stress Test assay template, cells were sequentially treated with oligomycin (2 μM), carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (0.5 μM), and rotenone + Antimycin A (0.5 μM). OCR and ECAR were then measured in a standard six-minute cycle of mix (2 min), wait (2 min), and measure (2 min). Basal levels of OCR and ECAR were recorded first, followed by OCR and ECAR levels following injection of compounds listed above. All OCR and ECAR values were normalized following the Seahorse Normalization protocol. Briefly, after the assay cells were stained with 2μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 30 minutes while performing post-assay brightfield imaging. Cells were then imaged and counted using the Biotek Cytation 1. Cell counts were calculated by Cell Imaging software (Agilent) and imported into Wave (Agilent) using the normalization function.</p>

                <p>Using the scratch assay and a commercially available keloid cell line, we reproduced the findings from prior reports [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] demonstrating an increased wound closure over time in the keloid fibroblast line compared to the healthy volunteer (HV) fibroblast line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Consistent with their Warburg metabolism, the keloid fibroblast line demonstrated significant reduction in wound closure when treated with the glycolysis inhibitor 2DG but not the mitochondrial OxPhos inhibitor rotenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, the HV fibroblast line scratch closure was not significantly impacted by either treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We next compared fibroblasts from patients with loss-of-function mutations in STAT3 to contrast against the keloid cell line with hyper-activity of STAT3. Consistent with prior reports identifying the activity and accessibility of STAT3 as central in the hyper-proliferative/hyper-motile phenotype of keloid cells [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and similar to our prior findings [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], fibroblasts from patients with STAT3 LOF showed reduced closure in the scratch assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Keloid STAT3-mediated phenotypes in keloid cells are also known to be influenced by co-transcription with JAK2 [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consistent with these reports, the accelerated wound closure in the keloid cell line was blocked by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) while also inhibiting closure time in the HV fibroblast line in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>).</p>

Consistent with these reports and our finding of greater SRC in the keloid fibroblast line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), these cells had greater staining intensity for TOM70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), a mitochondrial membrane protein suggested as the mitochondrial entry receptor for phosphorylated STAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> (pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. STAT3 activity requires phosphorylation at one of the two primary phosphorylation sites, the serine at position 727 (pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup>) or the tyrosine at amino acid 705 (pSTAT3<sup>Tyr705</sup>). pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> preferentially transits to the mitochondria through TOM70 to influence metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

In healthy fibroblasts, folic acid recapitulated many of the abnormalities observed in the keloid fibroblast line including enhanced ECAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g004">Fig 4A</xref>); a non-significant reduction in basal OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and mitochondrial ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), but did not change in SRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248011.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

We demonstrate that the mutational or pharmacologic blockade of JAK1/2 or STAT3 signaling in fibroblasts alters cellular migration/proliferation, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as response to folic acid. In our current work, treatment with folic acid provided the greatest distinction between fibroblast cell lines from healthy volunteers and keloid scars. In the healthy fibroblast line, folic acid recapitulated many of the abnormalities in keloid fibroblasts while demonstrating opposing effects on metabolism and EMT in the cell line that was keloid derived. These findings are consistent with recent reports demonstrating efficacy for the folate targeting drug 5-FU against keloid scars [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>We hypothesize that increased folate in pigmented skin may contribute to epigenetic changes in STAT3, consistent with prior reports [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Alterations of mitochondrial STAT3 could then lead to a compensatory increase in STAT3, resulting in the documented increased nuclear pSTAT3<sup>Tyr705</sup> translocation [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], HIF1α expression [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], glycolytic activity [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and EMT [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, genetic alterations in STAT3 function, such as seen in STAT3 LOF, or JAK1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib may preclude these consequences. In fact, exposure to ruxolitinib appears to further reduce mitochondrial OxPhos activity in the keloid fibroblast line and may reduce ATP production efficiency. The impacts of mitochondrial associated pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> could not explain all of our observed differences between the keloid and HV fibroblast lines and therefore the ultimate impact of the reduced mito-pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> remains to be elucidated. However, our report appears to be the first to identify a baseline defect in pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> mitochondrial localization despite the previously described increase in total pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, folic acid physiology cannot present a unifying hypothesis because it only recapitulated some of the abnormalities seen in our chosen cell lines and we originally hypothesized that it would suppress mitochondrial pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup>. However, our findings were successful in uncovering that the STAT3-mediated impacts of folic acid influence the mitochondrial translocation of pSTAT3<sup>Ser727</sup> in ways that differ between HV, keloid, and STAT3LOF fibroblast lines.</p>
              <p>Our findings are limited by our focus on monolayer cultures of fibroblasts as the lone proxy for keloid pathology. Furthermore, our findings were derived from singular commercial cell lines. While the use of commercial cell lines may afford other researchers an opportunity to reproduce and expand upon our findings, our results cannot address the likely person-to-person, or body site-to-body site variation in healthy donors or patients with keloids. Full elucidation of keloid metabolism may also need to employ additional models and/or evaluate pathology in keloid-derived keratinocytes and melanocytes [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, while our findings reproduce the findings of prior reports identifying JAK1/2, STAT3, and folate as targetable pathways for the treatment of keloids, a potentially contrasting role for vitamin D impacting STAT3 signaling and risk of keloids in pigmented skin should also be considered [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, our findings support the consideration of future clinical assessment of ruxolitinib in the treatment of keloid scars. Ruxolitinib was initially approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis, a hyper-proliferative disorder which has also been associated with abnormalities in EMT [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and folate metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, our findings are consistent with other groups identifying that JAK1/2 signaling blockade reverses abnormal phenotypes in keloid-derived cells [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248011.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, ruxolitinib as either an intra-lesional adjunct to steroids or in currently experimental topical formulations [<xref rid="pone.0248011.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] may offer therapeutic benefit to patients with keloid scars if our findings can be validated in a larger number of patient-derived cell lines. However, large-scale studies of keloid scars will likely rely on surgically resected tissue given that experimental tissue collection would be unethical in this patient population.</p>
              <p>Overall, our findings reproduce the claims of many prior reports, suggest a potential role of folate metabolism in keloid pathogenesis, and present some of the first insights into the metabolic consequences of monogenic loss of STAT3 activity. Our work expands on the current literature to directly link JAK1/2, STAT3, and HIF1α to keloid pathology, folic acid responses, and Warburg physiology; however, other signaling pathways beyond these identified pathways are likely involved for each finding. We suggest that future work assessing the global overlap between metabolic and immunologic pathways may identify additional therapeutic options for diseases marked by abnormalities in immune function, tissue repair, and metabolism.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Authors examine JAK2/STAT3 driven proliferation and metabolic dysregulation in keloid fibroblasts. Using JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and 3 cell lines (healthy volunteer fibroblast cell line, keloid fibroblast cell line, and fibroblast cell line with STAT3 LOF) authors evaluated hyperproliferation and metabolic dysregulation by examining a) would closure; b) levels of OCR and ECAR; c) nuclear Hif1a; d) Tom20 levels; e) levels of mitochondrial pSTAT Ser727. Authors also examine whether addition of folic acid contributes to the altered proliferation and metabolic dysfunction in normal fibroblast cell line, keloid fibroblast cell line, and STAT3 LOF cell line. While it is an interesting study, experimental data does not necessarily directly support conclusions, and further experiments are required to validate the results.</p>
              <p>Major points:</p>
              <p>1) Authors state that Warburg metabolism is driven by JAK2/STAT3 metabolic adaptation. While in some scenarios Warburg effect could be driven by JAK/STAT, most of the literature does not describe requirement for JAK/STAT pathway for Warburg effect.</p>
              <p>2) Authors use STAT3 LOF cell line as a model of JAK/STAT hyperactive keloid cell line, however throughout the manuscript results from STAT3 LOF cell line are distinct from the Keloid cell line, suggesting that STAT3 LOF has a metabolic phenotype that does not match the one found in Keloid cell line.</p>
              <p>3) What is the impact of reduced mitochondrial levels of pSTAT3 S727 in keloid cell line? The OCR levels in HV and Keloid cell lines are not significantly different (Figure 1C), suggesting that levels of pSTAT3 S727 (Figure 3E) are not directly contributing to differences in the OXPHOS. If so, what is the significance of pSTAT3 S727?</p>
              <p>4) Conclusion that folic acid mediates effects on glycolysis are based on data that looks at indirect effects on glycolysis and mitochondrial ATP production across three cell lines. Current data does not directly support the hypothesis that folic acid mediates effects on glycolysis. Authors should show if inhibiting glucose uptake or glycolysis (for example by 2DG) prevents effects on cell lines treated with folic acid.</p>
              <p>Minor points:</p>
              <p>Line 47:</p>
              <p>Refs 5 and 10 show STAT3 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of keloids, but neither of the references mentions Warburg effect.</p>
              <p>Line 157: 2DG instead of 2GD.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled “Differential responses to folic acid in an established keloid fibroblast cell line are mediated by JAK1/2 and STAT3” by Myles et al submitted to PLOSOne described the potential role of JAK/STAT signaling and folate metabolism on the metabolic consequences during pathogenesis of keloid</p>
              <p>Scars. This is a well-designed study with a clear message and has a great clinical significance. I recommend publication of this article after addressing some of the minor comments.</p>
              <p>Comments:</p>
              <p>• Authors may explain the method how they isolated the fibroblast cells from health volunteer.</p>
              <p>• Figure 3 shown the immunofluorescence of HIF1a. This will be interesting if authors can validate this through western blotting of HIF1a protein.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Authors examine JAK2/STAT3 driven proliferation and metabolic dysregulation in keloid fibroblasts. Using JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and 3 cell lines (healthy volunteer fibroblast cell line, keloid fibroblast cell line, and fibroblast cell line with STAT3 LOF) authors evaluated hyperproliferation and metabolic dysregulation by examining a) would closure; b) levels of OCR and ECAR; c) nuclear Hif1a; d) Tom20 levels; e) levels of mitochondrial pSTAT Ser727. Authors also examine whether addition of folic acid contributes to the altered proliferation and metabolic dysfunction in normal fibroblast cell line, keloid fibroblast cell line, and STAT3 LOF cell line. While it is an interesting study, experimental data does not necessarily directly support conclusions, and further experiments are required to validate the results.</p>
              <p>Major points:</p>
              <p>1) Authors state that Warburg metabolism is driven by JAK2/STAT3 metabolic adaptation. While in some scenarios Warburg effect could be driven by JAK/STAT, most of the literature does not describe requirement for JAK/STAT pathway for Warburg effect.</p>
              <p>We have amended the text throughout that JAK/STAT is an inducer of Warburg metabolism, but is not the lone pathway of importance (most notably in the introduction, lines 47-49). We continue to highlight that one of the described master regulators of Warburg metabolism (HIF1a) is highly linked to JAK/STAT signaling. We have also clarified in the text of the discussion that other signaling pathways may play a role (lines 293-294).</p>
              <p>2) Authors use STAT3 LOF cell line as a model of JAK/STAT hyperactive keloid cell line, however throughout the manuscript results from STAT3 LOF cell line are distinct from the Keloid cell line, suggesting that STAT3 LOF has a metabolic phenotype that does not match the one found in Keloid cell line.</p>
              <p>We have clarified in the text that the STAT3 LOF cells are used to contrast against keloid cells – not to model them (lines 161-162). The keloid cells represent over-active STAT3 while the STAT3 LOF (loss of function) cells represent under-active STAT3. Thus, the cells lines’ distinctions are expected.</p>
              <p>3) What is the impact of reduced mitochondrial levels of pSTAT3 S727 in keloid cell line? The OCR levels in HV and Keloid cell lines are not significantly different (Figure 1C), suggesting that levels of pSTAT3 S727 (Figure 3E) are not directly contributing to differences in the OXPHOS. If so, what is the significance of pSTAT3 S727?</p>
              <p>We have clarified in the text that the ultimate importance of pSTAT3Ser727 remains unclear (lines 256-257). We identified a baseline difference but that difference could not explain the entire phenotype. We opted against omitting our finding because (to our knowledge) it is the first direct evidence of a mito-STAT3 defect in keloid cells even if it does not explain keloid pathogenesis. Thus we acknowledge that we have more to elucidate as to the significance of our finding but the novelty of the finding is worthy of communicating to the scientific community. </p>
              <p>4) Conclusion that folic acid mediates effects on glycolysis are based on data that looks at indirect effects on glycolysis and mitochondrial ATP production across three cell lines. Current data does not directly support the hypothesis that folic acid mediates effects on glycolysis. Authors should show if inhibiting glucose uptake or glycolysis (for example by 2DG) prevents effects on cell lines treated with folic acid.</p>
              <p>The experiment the reviewer is describing would assess if the effects of folic acid were mediated by glycolysis. However, we are asserting that the effects of folic acid are mediated by STAT3 and JAK1/2 – as indicated by the loss of folic acid effects in STAT3LOF cells and cells treated with JAK1/2 inhibition. We have attempted to clarify in the text. We have also cited publications that have previously established the effects of folic acid on induction of glycolysis (lines 216-217 and new references 36 and 37). </p>
              <p>Minor points:</p>
              <p>Line 47:</p>
              <p>Refs 5 and 10 show STAT3 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of keloids, but neither of the references mentions Warburg effect.</p>
              <p>We have amended the text to correct the descriptions. STAT3 in these papers is linked to keloid pathology, but separate work links STAT3 and Warburg physiology. We hope that our work now directly links the immunologic and metabolic pathways in STAT3.</p>
              <p>Line 157: 2DG instead of 2GD.</p>
              <p>This has been amended, thank you.</p>

              <p>Comments:</p>
              <p>• Authors may explain the method how they isolated the fibroblast cells from health volunteer.</p>
              <p>We have clarified that the HV fibroblasts were also from cell lines purchased from ATCC. We opted to use a cell line to represent this group as it would improve reproducibility (other researchers can test these exact cells in their own lab).</p>
              <p>• Figure 3 shown the immunofluorescence of HIF1a. This will be interesting if authors can validate this through western blotting of HIF1a protein.</p>
              <p>We have attempted to clarify in the methods that since our findings are in the cells undergoing EMT/proliferation/migration – those cells are limited to the leading edge of the scratch. Western blotting would lack the ability to localize the expression of any protein and could only represent a lysate of the entire well. Furthermore, given that immunofluorescence is an established equal in its ability to perform protein quantitation as Western blotting, the need to assess only the cells in the scratched area indicates that the data as presented is the valid presentation.</p>
