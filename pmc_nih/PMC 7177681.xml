                <p><italic>Background:</italic> Entrepreneurship education has demonstrated positive impacts in low-resource contexts. However, there is limited evidence of such programs evaluated among Native American (NA) youth in a rural reservation. <italic>Methods:</italic> A 2:1 randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of the Arrowhead Business Group (ABG) entrepreneurship education program on entrepreneurship knowledge, economic empowerment, and social well-being among 394 NA youth. An intent to treat analysis using mixed effects regression models examined within and between study group differences from baseline to 24 months. An interaction term measured change in the intervention relative to change in the control. ABG participants were purposively sampled to conduct focus groups and in-depth interviews. <italic>Results:</italic> Significant intervention vs. control group improvements were sustained at 12 months for entrepreneurship knowledge and economic confidence/security. Significant within-group improvements were sustained for ABG participants at 24 months for connectedness to parents, school, and awareness of connectedness. Qualitative data endorses positive impacts on social well-being among ABG participants. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Observed effects on entrepreneurship knowledge, economic empowerment, and connectedness, supplemented by the experiences and changes as described by the youth themselves, demonstrates how a strength-based youth entrepreneurship intervention focused on developing assets and resources may be an innovative approach to dually address health and economic disparities endured in Native American communities.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>The winners of the 2019 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Drs. Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer, are touted for advancing development economics methodology in which they run real-world controlled trials in small localities to gather evidence on how to reduce global poverty [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Another hallmark of their work is a departure from narrow finance-focused observation and analytics, to the inclusion of health and educational indicators. This paper is consistent with their award-winning approach and reports on a real-world controlled trial completed in a small locality evaluating the impact of an intervention on health and educational outcomes with the long-term goal of reducing poverty. More specifically, this paper describes entrepreneurship, economic and social well-being outcomes from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally based youth entrepreneurship education intervention among Native American youth living on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in rural Arizona.</p>
              <p>Participating youth, who are members of the White Mountain Apache Tribe (Apache), are exposed to high rates of poverty, high school drop-out, suicide, and substance use, as well as generational and modern traumas [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They are also part of a resilient and innovative peoples who have used research for over 40 years to develop public health solutions that have scaled to the world [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A recent paper from this trial reported on positive mental and behavioral outcomes among intervention participants—including less marijuana use, binge alcohol use, suicide attempts, physical fighting, and fights at school, compared to same-age peers who did not receive the intervention [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This paper will report on intervention impacts among participating youth’s entrepreneurship, economic, and social well-being outcomes.</p>

                <p>Past evidence has identified youth entrepreneurship education as a promising, strength-based, protective factor model [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Entrepreneurship education interventions generally employ a positive youth development approach to cultivate assets and resources to bolster the social well-being and potential of adolescent youth exposed to inordinate behavioral and economic risks [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To accomplish this, entrepreneurship education targets internal assets, such as entrepreneurship knowledge, economic confidence and security, and future planning, as well as resources, such as connectedness to school; relationships with parents, teachers, and other role models; and participation in productive economic activities [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

                <p>While very few entrepreneurship education interventions have been implemented on Native American reservations and none until now have been rigorously evaluated, entrepreneurship education interventions appear particularly promising for Native American (NA) youth living on reservations for two reasons: (1) Strengths-based approaches are highly congruent with Native views of ways to promote health and well-being [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and (2) NA adolescents face some of the worst social, economic, health, and education risks of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S. [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

                <p>A review of NA adolescent research yielded numerous protective factors for economic and social well-being in Native populations that are consistent with targets of entrepreneurship education, including: Belonging, cultural connectedness, and positive relationships with caring adults, leaders, and role models; mastery, independence, and self-efficacy; positive attachment to school, as well as hope and optimism [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

The original aims of the study were to longitudinally evaluate ABG for impacts on: (1) Adolescent behavioral and mental health outcomes, including substance use, suicide, and violence to self and others; (2) social well-being; (3) educational; and (4) entrepreneurship/economic outcomes [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This paper focuses on outcomes from aims 2 and 4. Behavioral and mental health outcomes (aim 1) have already been reported [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and educational outcomes (aim 3) are still being extracted from participating youth’s academic records.</p>

                <title>2.1. The Arrowhead Business Group Youth Entrepreneurship Model</title>
                <p>The ABG intervention and evaluation design was developed over a two-year formative period by the White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT/Apache) in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for American Indian Health. Described in more detail elsewhere, ABG consists of 16 lessons delivered through a residential summer camp followed by 6 monthly follow-on workshops, 4 to 6 h in length, to develop business plans [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lessons and activities are taught by two Apache paraprofessional facilitators to groups of 25 youth participants, aged 13 to 16 years old. ABG content—in successive order—includes: Apache culture and history and historical examples of entrepreneurship; problem solving and coping skills; communication, decision making, and goal setting; financial literacy, entrepreneurship training, and small business design; marketing; and development. The initial emphasis on Apache historical survival and cultural values, followed by soft skills (i.e., communication, problem-solving, and coping skills), before introducing financial and entrepreneurship training, was decided through the community-based development of the program. ABG lessons are supplemented with presentations by Apache entrepreneurs and elders to further promote culturally congruent concepts of entrepreneurship and connectedness to Apache culture and identity.</p>
                <p>A community advisory board (CAB) and Apache program staff recommended the importance of cultural grounding and soft skills development before delivering the more didactic entrepreneurship training, which they thought youth may perceive as irrelevant or unattainable without the introductory components. In addition, the format of the ABG curriculum was explicitly intended to support connections to school—as same-school peers participate together in ABG camps and content provides rationale for staying in school—in addition to connections to cultural and community leaders who meet with youth throughout the ABG intervention period. At the end of the program, participants present business ideas to a review board comprised of local business leaders and can receive start-up funds and mentorship from ABG program staff.</p>

                <title>2.2. A Peripheral Asset: The Arrowhead Café and Marketplace</title>
                <p>Originally, the six monthly ABG follow-on workshops were taught in a small conference room at historic Fort Apache, inside an early 20th century structure once occupied by the U.S. Calvary to suppress the Apache people. However, after the ABG program and evaluation began, local program leaders were inspired to launch the ABG Café and Marketplace with private funds raised for this purpose next to where the ABG workshops were taking place. Once the ABG Café and Marketplace were opened, program participants were able to seek apprenticeship opportunities there, and could borrow production supplies from an equipment co-op that includes cameras, screen-printing equipment, jewelry making materials, and art supplies. Over the course of this study, the Café and Marketplace, staffed with ABG program participants, grew into a popular eating and meeting place that also sold and promoted business products or services created by ABG youth participants and community members alike. The Café and Marketplace was inclusive and open to everyone in the community. Therefore, youth who were not participating in the ABG program also took advantage of the Café and Marketplace’s services. Involvement with the Café and Marketplace by youth who were not assigned to the ABG intervention may have potentially affected some of the trial outcomes. This positive unintended consequence of the ABG program is further elaborated in the discussion.</p>

                <p>Participants were ages 13–16, NA (self-identified)—94% Apache, 3% Navajo, 2% San Carlos Apache, and 1% other Native American ethnicity—and living on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Local study staff obtained informed consent from a parent or legal guardian for the adolescent’s participation and assent from minor participants. We partnered with 11 area middle and high schools for recruitment; youth were recruited in three annual cohorts. In each cohort, participants were enrolled by the study team, randomized, received their designated program from a trained facilitator, and completed self-report follow-up surveys out to 24 months post-intervention. Participants were randomized 2:1 through a randomization sequence generated via software by the study’s statistician in block sizes of 6, 9, or 12 to receive the control condition (which consisted of three 4- to 5-h recreational sports field days held at various popular outdoor locations on the reservation) or the ABG intervention plus control. This study design was endorsed by Apache research staff and our local CAB and ensured differences on key outcomes of interest could be attributed to receipt of the ABG intervention. Neither research staff nor study participants were blinded to randomization status.</p>

These two methods of data collection were utilized to ensure valid real-time data collection in a rural reservation-based context. Entrepreneurship knowledge and economic empowerment questions were developed by the study team and based on the extant entrepreneurship and economic empowerment literature (additional detail provided below). Social well-being outcomes included connectedness measured by the Hemingway Measure of Adolescent Connectedness, and the Awareness of Connectedness Scale; and hopelessness measured by the Hopelessness Scale, and hopefulness measured by the Apache Hopefulness Scale [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

See <xref rid="ijerph-17-02383-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for a complete description of the quantitative outcome variables included in this analysis.</p>
                <p>Entrepreneurship knowledge variables were designed to reflect key content of the ABG curriculum; response options were true/false and multiple choice. Entrepreneurship knowledge questions were organized by the following subscales with illustrative examples. <italic>Subscale A: Personal Finance and Business Planning:</italic> Subscale A includes 18 items, with questions primarily focused on personal financial/business planning knowledge and well-being. Example questions include: What daily expense can you give up in order to save for a big item, such as a laptop? When it is best to start a savings account? <italic>Subscale B: Entrepreneurial Knowledge and Business Development:</italic> Subscale B includes 13 items with questions addressing entrepreneurial/business development knowledge. Example questions include: What types of businesses must rely on donations to pay for expenses? What does a target market include?

In addition, separate sums were calculated for index A and index B.</p>
                <p>Economic empowerment variables were answered on a Likert scale (1 = Strongly Agree; 4 = Strongly Disagree). Likert scale questions were coded 1—strongly disagree to 4—strongly agree. Several questions required reverse coding to align with the direction of the other questions included. A mean score across items was calculated for each economic empowerment domain. Economic empowerment variables were organized by the following subscales:</p>

Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted at our local study office by Apache research staff using semi-structured interview guides. Interview guides asked participants what they liked or disliked about the ABG program, how participating in the program has changed their lives, how their relationships have changed as a result of participating in the program, how they view Apache culture, and specifically their opinions regarding Apache values around entrepreneurship. Qualitative data were collected to enhance understanding of how the program was being received by the participants in terms of their economic, entrepreneurship, and social well-being outcomes.

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>This paper reports the effects of the ABG program on entrepreneurial, economic, and social well-being outcomes from both quantitative and qualitative data collected with Apache youth in a rural reservation. The reported results and discussion aim to advance knowledge from a rigorous evaluation of a youth entrepreneurship education program on assets and resources hypothesized as important drivers of health and well-being in this and other low-resource populations.</p>
              <p>Intervention youth had gains in personal finance and business planning entrepreneurship knowledge that were significantly greater than gains made in the control group, and which persisted through 24 months of follow-up. There was a similar trend seen among intervention youth’s entrepreneurial and business development knowledge, which showed long-term statistically significant gains compared with youth in the control group. These quantitative findings are amplified by the voices of youth who described experiencing these entrepreneurship knowledge improvements in their own words, specifically how it grew their confidence in both handling money as well as their social skills. Thus, improvements in entrepreneurship knowledge may also portend increased mastery, independence, and self-efficacy, which are established protective factors against substance use and risks for suicide [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Youth who received the ABG program also had statistically significant increases in economic agency and participation as well as economic confidence and security between baseline and all follow-up time points. Control group youth did not experience significant gains in these economic empowerment outcomes until 24-months follow-up. While between-group differences in these outcomes were not significantly different at any follow-up time point, that intervention youth saw improvements in these domains in the short-term vs. control youth who did not see improvement until two-years later, is worth noting, as assets and resources acquired earlier in adolescence may buffer youth from multiple risks throughout seminal years of development [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, youth who received ABG had significant long-term improvements in their future planning and aspirations and intentions to preserve health at the 24-month time point. This change is echoed by their voices elucidated in the qualitative data describing how participating in the ABG program changed their outlook, attitudes, and hopes for the future. Hope and optimism, in particular, have been identified as protective factors against suicide for Native youth; thus, bolstering these feelings through entrepreneurship education may be particularly relevant for Native communities [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our findings regarding improvements in economic abilities and economic confidence among participants who received the ABG program could signify important contributions of the program in providing culturally meaningful income-earning opportunities for youth with limited prior employment or business experience. These impacts are further delineated in the words of the participating youth, who endorsed greater connection to school and parents and less frequent engagement in fighting and other nonproductive activities. Greater connectedness to school and family have been previously cited as promoting resilience, being commensurate with a positive youth development approach, and also direct buffers to substance use and suicide attempts among Native youth [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Linking entrepreneurial expansion to school, parents, and community connectedness may have substantive effects on positive health outcomes among Native youth. Although more research is needed in this area, our results underscore the promise of entrepreneurship education programs, such as ABG, for working upstream to prevent multiple risks for Native adolescents during a critical period of development. Our study did not find significant quantitative changes in ABG youth’s hopefulness or hopelessness, suggesting that more research is needed in this domain. The qualitative data, however, reflected increased positive thinking; it may be that the quantitative hope-related scales we utilized were not relevant to participants. Future economic-strengthening interventions may benefit from integrated health education or support to participants for developing short- and long-term financial goals.</p>

                <title>4.1. Positive Unintended Consequences of the ABG program</title>
                <p>While the ABG Café and Marketplace was originally envisioned as a space to provide opportunities for ABG participants to engage in experiential learning, the Café has grown over the study period to be a profitable healthy foods café, and perhaps the first focused on youth employment in rural reservations. It currently supports seven full-time employees, two of whom are ABG program graduates. The Café also spawned the ABG Food Truck that employs three full-time adult employees and has allowed the Café to expand its catering and special events business. Likewise, the Marketplace has grown into a local hub for emerging community artisans to sell goods and receive help from ABG staff to start new businesses. To date, the Marketplace has bought and sold products from over 300 adolescent and adult entrepreneurs from the Apache community. The Café and Marketplace are now a vital gathering place and community-based economic asset for this rural east Arizona tribal community.</p>
                <p>As mentioned, the Café and Marketplace were inclusive and open to all community members; it follows that in a small community, such as the White Mountain Apache, youth in the control program may have frequented these businesses and interacted with intervention youth, as well as ABG program facilitators and community mentors. Thus, the potential for diffusion of ABG intervention effects in this tight-knit community are worth additional consideration and exploration. In addition, before the completion of follow-up data collection, the main local high school contracted ABG staff to teach the ABG curriculum to all incoming freshmen. These students may also be diffusing program content to other students, family, and community members. Future research should utilize social network tools to determine the diffusion of the ABG intervention’s impact and which specific components reached the highest risk youth [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

                <title>4.2. Limitations</title>
                <p>The decision to use a 2:1 randomization scheme decreased our power to detect statistically significant differences within the control group and between intervention and control groups. However, all trends favored the intervention group. The randomization choice was guided by our Apache CAB to afford as many Apache youth as possible to receive the program. As described, neither research staff nor study participants were blinded to randomization status; thus, results may to some degree be impacted by response bias. We did not have the resources to blind both research staff and study participants to randomization status. This paper presents the results of an intent-to-treat analysis; a sensitivity analysis should be done next to examine the impacts of ABG among youth who completed surveys at each follow-up time point. Though all assessments were selected for past use with Native youth and extensively pilot tested and edited prior to utilization, that we did not see the same quantitative impacts as demonstrated in the qualitative data, particularly with regard to some of the social well-being constructs, suggests additional work is needed to identify valid and reliable measures for use in this population. Additionally, the results may not be generalizable to other diverse tribal populations as data were collected with one tribal community, though many reservation communities endure similar health and economic disparities. In addition, potential diffusion effects within the community, and specifically to youth participating in the control group, are worth additional research and examination. Finally, as previously mentioned, we were not able to reach saturation with our qualitative data collection. However, the benefit of conducting a qualitative descriptive approach is that we were able to stay close to the data and surface of words to illustrate the experience of participants in the ABG program; with this as our goal, a qualitative descriptive approach is often touted as the method of choice [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-02383" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>The first rigorously evaluated youth entrepreneurship program designed for and by a Native American community appears to improve entrepreneurship, economic, and social well-being outcomes for participants, and potentially their peers and parents. Significant quantitative differences were observed between intervention and control participants in entrepreneurship knowledge at 6- and 12-months follow-up; entrepreneurship and business knowledge at 6-, 12-, and 24-months follow-up; economic confidence and security at 12-months follow-up; and connectedness to teachers at 6-months follow-up. Qualitative data illuminated meaningful improvements in youth’s psychosocial and future well-being, focus on school, and connectedness to their parents, culture, and community. The observed effects on entrepreneurship knowledge, economic empowerment, and connectedness, plus the experiences and changes as described by the youth themselves, demonstrates how a strength-based youth entrepreneurship intervention focused on developing assets and resources may be an innovative approach to dually address health and economic disparities endured in Native American communities. Future research should evaluate the implementation of ABG in other Native American and similarly under-resourced communities disproportionately impacted by public health disparities.</p>
