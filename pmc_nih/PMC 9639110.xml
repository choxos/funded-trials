                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Given the burdens of treatment and poor prognosis, older adults with kidney failure would benefit from improved decision making and palliative care to clarify goals, address symptoms, and reduce unwanted procedures. Best Case/Worst Case (BC/WC) is a communication tool that uses scenario planning to support patients’ decision making. This article describes the protocol for a multisite, cluster randomised trial to test the effect of training nephrologists to use the BC/WC communication tool on patient receipt of palliative care, and quality of life and communication.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We are enrolling attending nephrologists, at 10 study sites in the USA, who see outpatients with advanced chronic kidney disease considering dialysis. We aim to enrol 320 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≤24 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> who are age 60 and older and have a predicted survival of 18 months or less. Nephrologists will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive training to use the communication tool (intervention) at study initiation or after study completion (wait-list control). Patients in the intervention group will receive care from a nephrologist trained to use the BC/WC communication tool. Patients in the control group will receive usual care. Using chart review and surveys of patients and caregivers, we will test the efficacy of the BC/WC intervention with receipt of palliative care as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include intensity of treatment at the end of life, the effect of the intervention on quality of communication (QOC) between nephrologists and patients (using the QOC scale), the change in quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care scale) and receipt of dialysis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Older adults with advanced kidney disease, particularly those with comorbidities and/or frailty, have life-limiting illness,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> which will lead to major changes in quality of life and functional status over time. As their kidney function declines, most will consider dialysis. Yet older adults often initiate dialysis without understanding their prognosis, the investment of time needed for receipt of dialysis and the life-sustaining nature of this treatment. Although some will gain a survival advantage, patients with multiple comorbidities will often fail to achieve this goal.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For example, median survival after starting dialysis is 15.6 months for patients age 80–85, and 20% will die within 3 months of dialysis initiation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Patients who do achieve prolonged survival with dialysis will nonetheless experience treatment burdens and distressing symptoms. These include time spent in dialysis; repeat hospitalisations; vascular access complications; and symptoms of pain, sleep disturbance, depression, itching, oedema, constipation, nausea and loss of appetite.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> When patients choose to forgo dialysis, they experience fewer treatment burdens, but their symptoms are similarly formidable.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref></p>
              <p>Clinicians, focused on disease management, describe dialysis options but struggle to concurrently communicate the severity of disease, the hardship of treatment and overall prognosis. As such, patients are often unaware of how sick they truly are.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Because dialysis is described as ‘kidney replacement’, it is regarded as a straightforward solution. Describing dialysis as a ‘fix’ for kidney failure does little to reveal how a patient might experience dialysis, or expected downstream outcomes, such as predictable changes in functional status or long-term prognosis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In one study, investigators found that for roughly 90% of patients, nephrologists did not disclose prognosis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Studies have found that between 20% and 60% of older adults regretted their decision to start dialysis.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref></p>
              <p>Given these concerns, nephrologists might benefit from a stronger framework to discuss dialysis initiation with older adults who have limited survival. This would support discussion of treatment options while describing the experiences and outcomes of treatment within the context of the patient’s overall health trajectory. Because kidney failure is life-limiting, the framework should also provide an entrée to concurrent palliative care, regardless of the patient’s choice about dialysis. Palliative care, with or without dialysis, is recommended for all patients with advanced kidney disease and limited survival to support advance care planning, symptom management and, when needed, high quality end-of-life care.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref></p>
              <p>To address this problem, we developed a communication tool called Best Case/Worst Case (BC/WC) to help nephrologists better describe a treatment choice between life with or without dialysis. The tool uses a strategy called scenario planning and a graphic aid to help patients and their caregivers anticipate and prepare for a future with kidney failure. By using scenario planning—narrative description about plausible futures—nephrologists can translate evidence about the patient’s prognosis within stories to demonstrate a range of plausible futures. We theorise that training nephrologists to use this tool to support shared decision making about dialysis will increase receipt of guideline-recommended concurrent palliative care for older adults with life-limiting kidney failure.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>We designed a multisite, cluster randomised clinical trial to test the effect of training nephrologists to use the BC/WC tool on receipt of palliative care, quality of life and quality of communication for older adults with kidney failure and limited life expectancy. First, we discuss the theoretical foundations of the intervention and study design. We then describe the research protocol including participant characteristics, data collection, outcomes and analysis plan.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Scenario planning</title>
                <p>The BC/WC communication tool uses an approach called ‘scenario planning’ to facilitate decision making in the setting of uncertainty. Scenario planning was originally developed in the 1950s for military planning. It was then popularised for broader use by Pierre Wack,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> an economist, to translate vast probabilistic information into narrative description to facilitate strategic decisions. Rather than emphasising precise isolated risks, this technique generates multiple plausible futures, prompting decision-makers to visualise what might happen under different sets of assumptions. Scenario planning is distinct from standard medical practice that uses risk prediction and statistics to describe prognosis. Scenario planning enables clinicians to say, “I cannot see the future, but if all goes well, this is what’s likely to follow, and if things go poorly, this is what we can expect.” By highlighting the interaction between forces that drive change and providing an organised way to consider alternative futures, scenario planning promotes insight.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although it has been successfully applied to a wide range of decisions in business and government, scenario planning is not broadly used clinically.</p>
                <p>We adapted scenario planning for healthcare decision making in the BC/WC communication tool.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This tool is distinct from decision aids that demonstrate event rates and probabilities, represent outcomes numerically<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> or pictorially, and function by activating patients for decision making before meeting with a clinician (ie, with brochures, educational videos, web programmes and decision tables).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> In contrast, nephrologists use the BC/WC tool directly with patients to illustrate treatment options, convey a clear message about prognosis and acknowledge uncertainty using language such as, ‘this is what we are hoping for’ or ‘this is what we are worried about.’ By using scenario planning to translate evidence about the patient’s overall health within narratives that show the range of plausible futures, nephrologists can elicit patients’ opinions about specific health states and recommend goal-concordant treatment. Use of this tool can encourage patients to comprehend a new, previously unimaginable reality and prepare for major shifts in a way that simple prognostication (forecasting) cannot. Moreover, scenario planning allows patients to anticipate unwanted events, such as recurrent hospitalisations, which can facilitate use of palliative care consultation to alleviate symptoms and clarify care goals regardless of the patient’s dialysis initiation decision.</p>

                <title>How the BC/WC tool works</title>
                <p>The clinician verbally describes the ‘BC,’ ‘WC’ and ‘most likely’ stories about the experience of each treatment option while using a graphic aid to help patients follow along and have a record of the conversation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Vertical bars represent each treatment option; their length shows the range of outcomes and the magnitude of the difference between the ‘BC’ (star), the ‘WC’ (box) and a ‘most likely case’ (oval). The clinician also writes notes about each option on the diagram. A copy of the graphic aid is stored in the patient’s chart. Patients also retain a copy to discuss options with family and to support future conversations with their nephrologist and other clinicians. This approach—using personalised information and a graphic aid—supports best practices to improve understanding of complex health information, especially for people with low health literacy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref></p>

The ‘most likely’ box is intentionally left blank for nephrologists to tailor to the patient.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This study is designed to test the effect of a decision-making intervention on the quality of care received, based on evidence that patients with life-limiting illness benefit greatly from concurrent palliative care.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> We hypothesise that improving conversations about dialysis will help patients receive palliative care consultation and support subsequent treatment decisions that align with personal goals.</p>
                <p>Patients who are more informed about the experience of dialysis and their overall health trajectory might take advantage of palliative care earlier in their course of illness. As compared with patients with terminal cancer and heart failure, patients with kidney failure are more than twice as likely to be admitted to the ICU and less than half as likely to be admitted to hospice in the final month of life.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref> Fewer than 6% of patients on dialysis have had the opportunity to discuss end-of-life wishes.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Palliative care for patients with poor prognosis is supported by the American Society of Nephrology,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> however, barriers to palliative care include (1) patient lack of awareness about the life-limiting nature of kidney failure and (2) an illness trajectory typified by a slow overall decline with interval catastrophic events and partial recovery, not a sharp and obvious deterioration.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These barriers cannot be overcome by simply referring patients to palliative care.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s1-4">
                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>As there is no ‘best treatment choice’ for these patients as a group, dialysis initiation is not the primary outcome. Measuring change in the rate of dialysis initiation does not reflect whether patients have received care in accordance with their goals. Moreover, there are unyielding challenges in attempting to measure receipt of goal-concordant care. One would first need to assess a patient’s goals and values, and then determine whether the treatment received was consistent with these values. Because clinicians do not typically elicit patients’ goals and values, measurement of this variable could change the outcome of interest.</p>
                <p>We also considered assessing decisional conflict and regret but found this measurement to be unsatisfactory. Ascertainment of decisional conflict is hampered by the framing of the clinical question.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> For example, if a nephrologist says, “You need dialysis or you will die,” patients will report little decisional conflict or regret on starting dialysis, yet this outcome does not capture whether patients are well-informed or if they have received goal-concordant care. Aiming to reduce decisional conflict suggests conflict around uncertainty is inherently undesirable, whereas conflict during deliberation might be necessary to make a decision that best reflects a patient’s values.</p>
                <p>We theorise that patients whose nephrologists communicate better will receive better care. Therefore, we will measure receipt of palliative care as the primary outcome. Teaching nephrologists to use the BC/WC communication tool will lead to increased receipt of palliative care via multiple pathways: first, via direct provision of information about prognosis and health trajectory, second, through improving the QOC about options and outcomes, and third, via improving decision making about dialysis initiation.</p>

                <p>To test the efficacy of the BC/WC intervention, we will use parallel randomisation with a wait-list control, randomising nephrologists within each site to receive intervention training at study initiation or on study completion. Patients in the control group will receive usual care; patients in the intervention group will receive care from a nephrologist trained to use the BC/WC communication tool.

                <p>To reduce the possibility of study staff exposure to the nephrologist’s randomisation assignment, we will provide regular reminders to nephrologists that they should not reveal their treatment group to study staff. To decrease ascertainment bias, study staff will adhere to a study script during interactions with nephrologists and during the survey administration with patients and caregivers. Patients and caregivers will be blinded to the measured outcomes of this study.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The original version of the intervention was developed with input from older adults via focus groups conducted at senior centres in Wisconsin.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The intervention was then modified to specifically to fit dialysis decision making with support from patients and their caregivers. In interviews, they expressed enthusiasm for content about prognosis and decision making and ease of use within their clinic visit with the nephrologist.</p>
                <p>The intervention comprises a 2-hour one-on-one training session, three additional 20 min coaching sessions, debriefs every 2 months during the first year and quarterly debriefs in the second year. The 2-hour training session includes a 10 min introduction, coach demonstration, individual preparation and practice with standardised patients, and expert feedback, that is, coaching. The primary skill targeted is translation of clinical knowledge and prognostic information into the BC/WC format, using scenario planning and the graphic aid. Nephrologists will receive specific instruction on how to refer patients to palliative care, including scripted language: for example, “I’d like you to see our palliative care team. They can help you feel as well as you can for as long as you can.”</p>
                <p>The training programme culminates in an assessment of nephrologists’ use of the tool with a standardised patient. Instructors will assess the fidelity of the nephrologist’s use of the BC/WC tool using a 19-item checklist of adherence criteria (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Nephrologists who do not achieve minimal competence (&lt;14/19) will receive additional training until they achieve competence.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Following the initial training, instructors will contact nephrologists for three additional 20 min coaching sessions. This will occur every 2 weeks for 6 weeks after training when nephrologists have had the opportunity to use this tool clinically. These sessions will focus on troubleshooting in-the-moment issues with additional support for integrating the tool within a busy nephrology clinic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person training, standardised patient scenarios and coaching were adapted for virtual education on the Zoom platform.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p>
                <p>To ensure intervention adherence throughout the study, study staff will remind nephrologists to follow the assigned communication condition prior to an enrolled patient’s clinic visit. Study staff will notify all nephrologists each time one of their patients has enrolled in the study. Specifically, study staff will say, ‘This patient is enrolled in the study, if you are in the intervention group, please use the communication tool during this visit.’ To document use of the tool, study staff will provide a folder including a triplicate carbon copy of the graphic aid template (one study copy, one copy for the patient and one copy for the patient’s chart), a written reminder to use the BC/WC tool (as appropriate), and blank carbon copy paper for notes written by study-enrolled nephrologists. Nephrologists in the waitlist control group may use any of the forms as they wish or disregard them. We anticipate minimal contamination between nephrologists as our experience indicates training and support is required to use the tool. Nephrologists will return the folder and its contents sealed in a preaddressed envelope directly to the Wisconsin education team.</p>
                <p>To maintain use of the tool over time, the education team will conduct debriefings with nephrologists every 2 months during year one and quarterly debriefings in year two. Instructors will review the submitted graphic aids, provide feedback on fidelity to nephrologists, and take field notes to evaluate training and implementation of the tool.</p>

Simultaneously, caregivers will complete a single-item literacy screener and the Cambridge Palliative Audit Schedule (CAMPAS-R), which allows us to assess the patient’s quality of life (QOL) as reported by caregivers.</p>
                  <p>Within 48 hours after the patient’s visit with the nephrologist, study staff will administer the QOC questionnaire via telephone. Unlike other measurements of physician communication that have high ceiling effects and limited ability to measure change, the QOC includes seven items specific to end-of-life communication, which, if not performed by the clinician, are scored as zero. This will allow us to discriminate between QOC attributable to patient satisfaction vs content.</p>
                  <p>We will repeat the quality-of-life measurement every 3 months for 2 years after enrolment or until patient death. We will administer the Quality of Death and Dying (QODD)<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> survey to enrolled caregivers between 30 days and 3 months after patient death for patients who die while on study.</p>

                  <p>The sample size estimate, 320 patients (160/group), is based on the primary hypothesis that patients in the intervention arm will be more likely to receive palliative care. This study is powered to detect a 10%–15% absolute difference in the care patients receive, consistent with other interventions designed to effectively increase access to palliative care.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43–46</xref> Smaller differences are unlikely to be considered meaningful to clinicians, patients or researchers.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We desire a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 for each aim and estimate that the between-physician variance is around 10%. We plan to use fixed effects to account for clustering by site because it is faithful to our study design and controls for confounding related to imperfect randomisation due to site imbalances better than a random effects model.</p>

                  <p>Our primary analysis will compare the efficacy of the BC/WC training programme relative to usual care in regard to receipt of palliative care consult within 12 months of study enrolment. We will use summary statistics to describe, by group, patient and nephrologist characteristics. As patient comorbidity and baseline functional status are highly predictive of outcomes, we will adjust for these covariates to avoid spurious results, and to increase power by reducing residual error in the response. We will use an intention-to-treat analysis and compare outcomes between the two arms using a proportional odds cumulative incidence model, where death is incorporated as a competing risk. The intervention will be a binary predictor and the treating physician will be a random effect to account for the correlation within the physician. Site will be included as a fixed effect.</p>

All analytical methods used will account for the cluster effect of the treating physician by incorporating a random-intercept for physician. We will analyse the cumulative receipt of palliative care throughout the length of follow-up using a proportional odds cumulative incidence model.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Death will be treated as a competing risk. Regarding quality of life, we will conduct a linear mixed effects regression on the difference in FACIT-Pal scale between baseline and death or at 2 years after enrolment, whichever occurs first. We will use a linear mixed-effects model with the QOC scale as the outcome.</p>
                  <p>We will perform additional analyses to test and quantify receipt of dialysis, and caregiver outcomes. We will analyse receipt of dialysis using the proportional odds cumulative-incidence model for competing risks with death as a competing risk. We will analyse the time from enrolment to death using a mixed-effects Cox regression. We will use linear mixed-effects model to analyse caregiver outcomes: QODD (for caregivers of decedents only), CAMPAS-R and QOC (family member version). We will use qualitative content analysis to analyse field notes from nephrologist training and follow-up sessions.</p>

                <title>Missing data</title>
                <p>Study participants are subject to attrition due to death (ADD), attrition due to illness (ADI) and attrition at random. ADD and ADI can lead to non-ignorable missing data because the missing mechanism is related to the patient’s health status, which is potentially an effect of the intervention. We expect that missing outcomes will be minimal for receipt of palliative care, intensity of treatment and QOC because they are measured at early stages (within 12 months) or 30 days retrospectively from death. The QOL measure, however, is likely to suffer from both ADD and ADI. We plan to compare the difference between QOL at baseline and death or 2 years after enrolment (whichever comes first) to handle the fact that patients will have a different number of observations. Similar strategies have been used by other studies of palliative care interventions reflecting a quality of life/length of life trade-off.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Receipt of palliative care and dialysis are subject to ADD. Death will be incorporated as a competing risk to account for different lengths of follow-up in our secondary analysis. Because death is not likely to be independent of the outcomes, we will conduct analyses using inverse probability censoring weighting<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> adjusting for confounders such as patient QOL measures as sensitivity analysis.</p>

                <title>Protocol modifications</title>
                <p>Few patients died during the first 12 months of data collection, which was inconsistent with their estimated survival based on risk prediction. This observation led us to believe that it would be unlikely to have enough observed death on study to evaluate the effect of the intervention on care received at the end of life. With permission from the funder and the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB), we reclassified the outcome ‘intensity of treatment at the end of life’ from a coprimary outcome to a secondary outcome. In addition, to address the COVID-19-pandemic-related decrease in enrolment we modified the approved proposal to expand enrolment criteria to include patients with eGFR of 24 or less and two additional study sites (as reported herein). These modifications were approved by the funder and the DSMB.</p>

                <title>Relevance and dissemination</title>
                <p>There is currently no level one data supporting the use of scenario planning for patients with life-limiting illness. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and intervention training materials, including the graphic aid, instructional videos and learner manual, are available free of charge at <ext-link xlink:href="https://patientpreferences.org/bcwc-nephrology/" ext-link-type="uri">https://patientpreferences.org/bcwc-nephrology/</ext-link>. Durable improvements in serious illness communication will require training in scenario planning, which could be disseminated by stakeholder groups including the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation. Empirical evidence of efficacy would support incentives from payors by rewarding nephrologists for use of the tool. We will distribute final study results to patient, caregiver and nephrologist participants via a study website, reminding them of the website at the time of final data collection. In addition, we will remind participants that study results are publicly available at ClinicalTrials.gov.</p>
                <p>By conducting this study in a patient population with one specific decision about initiation of life-sustaining treatment, we can consider how scenario planning might be effective in other settings where treatment decisions vary widely, for example, acute surgical interventions or cancer care. If effective, the BC/WC intervention is easily scalable. This communication tool can be rapidly adapted for other clinicians in order to provide better care for older adults with life-limiting illnesses.</p>
