                  <p>To model the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of potential cord blood therapy in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p>

                  <title>Study design</title>
                  <p>Markov microsimulation of ASD over the lifespan was used to compare two strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC), including behavioral and educational interventions, and 2) novel cord blood (CB) intervention in addition to SOC. Input data reflecting behavioral outcomes included baseline Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-3), monthly VABS-3 changes, and CB intervention efficacy on adaptive behavior based on a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (DukeACT). Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were correlated to VABS-3. Costs for children with ASD ($15,791, ages 2–17 years) and adults with ASD ($56,559, ages 18+ years), and the CB intervention (range $15,000–45,000) were incorporated. Alternative CB efficacy and costs were explored.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We compared model-projected results to published data on life-expectancy, mean VABS-3 changes, and lifetime costs. Undiscounted lifetime QALYs in the SOC and CB strategies were 40.75 and 40.91. Discounted lifetime costs in the SOC strategy were $1,014,000, and for CB ranged from $1,021,000-$1,058,000 with CB intervention cost ($8,000-$45,000). At $15,000 cost, CB was borderline cost-effective (ICER = $105,000/QALY). In one-way sensitivity analysis, CB cost and efficacy were the most influential parameters on CB ICER. CB intervention was cost-effective at costs&lt;$15,000 and efficacies ≥2.0. Five-year healthcare payer projected budgetary outlays at a $15,000 CB cost were $3.847B.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>A modestly effective intervention designed to improve adaptive behavior in autism can be cost-effective under certain circumstances. Intervention cost and efficacy most affected the cost-effectiveness results and should be targeted to increase economic efficiency.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 54 children in US and has profound effects on self-reported quality of life (QOL) as well as QOL of family members [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Further, medical care, social services, and lost productivity can cost up to $1.5 million over a lifetime [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacologic or medical treatments that target the core symptoms of autism. The current standard of care (SOC) treatment includes behavioral interventions that are costly, requiring up to 20 hours per week of expert time. Although randomized controlled trials have shown improvements in language and cognition associated with early intervention, many individuals with ASD continue to have significant impairments throughout their lifetime [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Recently, two trials of cord blood infusion in children with ASD have shown safety and feasibility of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While a subsequent randomized trial (NCT02847182) did not show significant benefit of cord blood therapy on primary trial outcomes, post-hoc subgroup analyses suggested improvements in an adaptive behavior subdomain, as well as improvements in brain activity, as assessed via EEG, and in sustained attention, as assessed via eye-tracking measures [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is large uncertainty around the potential benefits of cord blood therapy in ASD given its high upfront costs, and indeed if there is any benefit at all.</p>
              <p>Our objective was to develop a decision modeling framework to assess the cost-effectiveness of potentially efficacious therapies for ASD to inform future clinical trials and future drug development. While the cord blood intervention in a recent trial did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints, understanding combinations of ASD treatment efficacies and costs likely to be cost-effective for other interventions will prove critical. Findings from this analysis might inform future clinical trials and researchers on clinical endpoints, provide a framework for considering value-based payment for therapies proven efficacious, and identify remaining uncertainties requiring further data acquisition.</p>

                <title>2.1 Analytic overview</title>
                <p>We developed a Markov microsimulation model of autism over the lifespan to compare two strategies: 1) SOC, including standard behavioral and educational interventions, and 2) cord blood (CB) which included the above interventions as well as a cord blood infusion intervention [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To inform our basecase input parameters, we incorporated cohort characteristics from, and grounded our basecase cord blood efficacy assumptions on, the DukeACT (Efficacy of Intravenous Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion as Cell Therapy for Children With ASD) trial. We simulated a cohort with characteristics derived from participants with non-verbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) ≥70 in DukeACT from age 2 throughout their lifetime. The model was compared to literature that reported VABS trajectories and lifetime costs. Clinical and cost outcomes are reported both undiscounted, as in the budget impact analysis (BIA), and discounted at 3%/year for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Our analysis was conducted from a modified societal perspective, and we include a healthcare payer perspective as a sensitivity analysis (Appendix 5 in <xref rid="pone.0282906.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We considered an ICER&lt;$100,000/QALY cost-effective by US standards [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

                <title>2.2 Model structure</title>
                <p>Our Markov microsimulation model of ASD was developed using TreeAge (Williamstown, MA). Simulated participants with ASD enter the model at age 2 (health state <italic toggle="yes">child</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ages 2–18</italic>) and are followed monthly, accruing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (<bold>S1 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0282906.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref></bold>). ASD natural history is tracked using VABS-3 scores, initially drawn from a distribution seen in DukeACT and subsequently following developmental trajectories from the published literature [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. VABS-3 is assumed to vary from ages 2–7 years, after which the score is fixed due to an absence of data on VABS-3 changes in individuals with ASD and without ID after age 7 [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. VABS-3 has been shown to grow more rapidly in early childhood, plateauing as an individual ages, and we included sensitivity analyses exploring different rates of VABS-3 growth [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At age 18, simulated participants transition to one of three health states based on their VABS-3: 1) VABS-3&gt;85, 2) VABS-3 70–85, and 3) VABS-3&lt;70. Cutoff values were chosen using the mean and standard deviation of VABS-3, where a mean of 100 is equated to a typically developing peer, with a standard deviation of 15 [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Simulated participants also experienced monthly age-, sex-, and autism-specific mortality.</p>
                <p>Intervention</p>
                <p>DukeACT compared cord blood infusion to placebo and did not find an effect of cord blood treatment on the primary outcome, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-III (VABS-3) socialization subdomain score at 6 months, or any of the pre-specified secondary outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], including the VABS-3 composite score. However, post-hoc subgroup analysis of participants without intellectual disability (IQ ≥ 70) showed improvement at 6 months in the communication subdomain of VABS-3 in the treatment arm compared to the placebo arm among participants without intellectual disability. Given the lack of other informative data, to inform our basecase analysis, we incorporated 6-month data from DukeACT on the change in VABS-3 subscale scores seen in the placebo group and CB group as the modeled SOC and intervention, respectively. In this analysis, we assumed that clinicians, regulatory bodies, and other decision makers would not pursue implementation of a non-efficacious therapy. In the basecase, we incorporated a difference between the SOC and intervention arms in the communication subscale score that was uncovered in post-hoc subgroup analysis of a secondary outcome in DukeACT (VABS-3 communication subdomain scores). We acknowledge that in DukeACT, cord blood therapy may have had no effect and included this possibility in cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis.</p>
                <p>At model initiation, simulated participants are assigned a 6-month change in VABS-3 communication subscale score (SOC vs. CB), based on DukeACT findings. Simulated participants also draw 6-month changes in socialization and daily living subscale scores from the same distributions seen in DukeACT (no difference between SOC and intervention arms). As a conservative measure, we simulate the SOC group as receiving the full increase in VABS-3 subscale scores seen in DukeACT placebo group.</p>

We then combined male and female monthly rates using the percent male (78%), and converted back to probabilities.

                  <p>Yearly costs for children ages 2–17 years included excess healthcare costs, school costs, ASD-specific therapies, and caregiver time for individuals with ASD when compared with demographic and non-ASD-illness adjusted peers, resulting in an estimated cost of $19,199/year [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Costs for individuals with ASD and without intellectual disability aged 18+ years were $56,559, and included accommodation costs, employment support costs, medical and non-medical services costs, and caregiver and participant productivity loss costs [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is unlikely that the annual costs for adults with ASD are more than three times those for children, and our basecase adult cost is likely an overestimate [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, in the absence of other published estimates on the societal costs of adult ASD, we include these costs our basecase analysis and perform sensitivity analyses by reducing adult costs by 3x, to align better with the pediatric cost data source. All costs were assumed equivalent regardless of VABS-3 composite score, except for adult productivity loss costs, which were adjusted as detailed below. As such, any reduction in adult ASD medical costs would not affect incremental costs of the CB intervention, but instead impact total costs of both the SOC and CB interventions. All costs were updated to 2019 US dollars using published GDP deflators [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
                  <p>The cost of CB infusion in the intervention arm in the base-case analysis was assumed to be $15,000.

Costs of adverse events were incorporated as one-time $2,100 cost for mild/moderate and $11,600 for severe grades, assumed to be similar to outpatient and inpatient managed infusion reactions in older adults [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

Mean change in VABS-3 score from ages 2–7 was 6.2, similar to estimates of a change of 6.4 in published developmental models [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. At 6 months (after the intervention period), the CB strategy had a mean increase in VABS-3 communication subscale score of 2.94 which is consistent with the data imputed from DukeACT. Our model predicted discounted lifetime cost in the SOC strategy of $1,014,000, which is different than a literature-based estimate of $1.43M [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The reason for this difference is our use of a different annual cost estimate through ages 2–18 ($19,199 versus an estimated $50–60,000) which we chose due to consistency with other estimates of costs of pediatric autism [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

In the CB strategy, with a single $15,000 infusion cost, lifetime societal discounted costs were $1,028,000 yielding an incremental lifetime cost of $14,000 for the CB strategy. At higher infusion costs, lifetime societal discounted costs increased to $1,038,000 with a $25,000 intervention, $1,048,000 with an $35,000 intervention, and $1,058,000 with a $45,000 intervention. When a healthcare payer perspective was taken, lifetime discounted costs were $276,000 for SOC and $292,000 for CB.</p>
                <p>Assuming a $15,000 cost for treatment, the CB intervention with an efficacy of 3.0 was borderline cost-effective from a societal perspective, with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $105,000/QALY (<bold><xref rid="pone.0282906.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>).

Simultaneously varying CB efficacy from 1.0–6.0, and CB cost from $3,000-$33,000, we found that, in general, intervention costs &lt;$15,000 and efficacies ≥2.0 resulted in ICERs &lt;$150,000/QALY (<bold><xref rid="pone.0282906.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>).

                <p>The difference in 5-year undiscounted costs from the healthcare payer perspective was $16,000. If the CB intervention were offered to all 247,000 children ages 2–7 years with ASD but without intellectual disability in the United States, the projected 5-year incremental payer cost of CB compared to SOC would be $3.847B [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. If the efficacy of CB were 0, then this amount would be lost to a non-efficacious intervention. Reduced uptake of CB would lead to a proportionally reduced budget impact estimate, i.e., if only 20% of children ages 2–7 with ASD took up the CB intervention, the budget impact would be reduced by 80% to $0.769B.</p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>In this modeling study we estimated the long-term clinical and economic effects of a potential and novel therapy for children with ASD. We developed and validated a simulation model that incorporates VABS scores to track adaptive behavior development, and costs of ASD. Our results showed that even a modestly effective future intervention that improves adaptive behavior can be cost-effective over a lifetime. CB remained cost-effective (&lt;$100,000/QALY) when the intervention cost was &lt;$15,000. In sensitivity analyses, we found that the cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to variations in intervention cost, intervention efficacy, and changes in the QOL mapping equation. Of note, this analysis does not project the cost-effectiveness of cord blood therapy as trialed in DukeACT that did not have clinical efficacy, but rather a potential future intervention that is found efficacious in a well-conducted clinical trial.</p>
              <p>Our results might be used as a preliminary guide to future clinical trial VABS-3 communication subscale score endpoints that may be cost-effective. We showed that future interventions with costs &lt;$15,000 and efficacies on VABS-3 communication subscale score ≥2.0 might be cost-effective with an ICER&lt;$150,000/QALY. This modeling framework may further be used for value-of-information analysis to help inform study design and sample size for these future trials [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>We also find that providing such an intervention to every child 2–7 years old with ASD (without intellectual disability) in the US would be costly. Assuming an intervention cost of $15,000, and 100% uptake, the 5-year budget impact on the healthcare sector of providing the intervention was upwards of $3.8B. That said, uptake is likely to be much less than 100% and a one-time CB treatment might be less costly than providing intensive behavioral interventions.</p>
              <p>The high cost of the CB intervention simulated in this study must be taken into context with the high costs and healthcare system burden of alternative effective therapies in ASD [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Intensive behavioral interventions, such as the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), are the current gold standard therapies available that improve developmental trajectory in ASD [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cost estimates of ESDM show a $14,000 additional cost in the first 2 years of therapy, but with cost savings over the subsequent post-intervention years due to decreased educational and healthcare resource utilization [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As a conservative measure and because these ESDM cost estimates may not be generalizable past the original ESDM research study, we did not decrease childhood costs in our simulation for those receiving the intervention, but it is plausible that similar resource utilization reduction may occur with the CB intervention [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Intensive behavioral interventions require highly trained clinicians and significant time investments in implementation in non-academic health centers [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is unlikely that infusion would replace behavioral intervention but rather CB theoretically might augment their efficacy.</p>
              <p>We understand that–once an intervention is proven efficacious–there will remain questions about long-term effectiveness relative to upfront costs. In our current volume-based, fee-for-service healthcare reimbursement system, these concerns could lead to payment and coverage challenges and barriers to access. To address these concerns, a decision modeling framework such as ours might inform value-based payment (VBP) models for proven efficacious therapies. Such a payment model would need to align payer evidentiary demands; identify, capture (and link payments to) improved outcomes that matter to participants and payers and incentivizes better long-term evidence.</p>
              <p>This is among the first microsimulation models of ASD over the lifetime that incorporates adaptive behavior scores to track developmental trajectories in ASD. Many previously published decision modeling and cost-effectiveness analyses in ASD use IQ strata (i.e. IQ≥70 and IQ&lt;70) to determine future outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While intellectual disability measured by IQ has been shown to have the greatest predictive effect on adult outcomes, such as employment status, it is not useful when predicting outcomes in individuals without intellectual disability [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>The CB intervention efficacy on VABS assumed in our basecase, and factored into QALY calculations, analysis fits well within the range of minimally important clinical difference estimates, which range between 2.01–3.75 [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As a conservative measure, we did not incorporate any estimate of caregiver quality of life due to conflicting evidence on the role of adaptive behavior on affecting such caregiver outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We also did not model differences in VABS during adulthood affecting QOL, and their inclusion might further support cost-effectiveness findings [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
              <p>The population simulated in our analysis was based on the participants in DukeACT, however, we note this population is not representative of the general US population [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, our analysis excluded children with intellectual disability (ID), which is a common comorbidity in ASD, and use in this population if unproven would worsen cost-effectiveness. We also recognize the large financial barriers associated with harvesting and storage of autologous cord blood [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Publicly available donor cord blood may provide one solution to this problem, or if cord blood storage receives coverage.</p>
              <p>Our study has several limitations. First, we recognize the uncertainties in our underlying input data and the assumptions that are inherent in simulation modeling analyses. We presented sensitivity analysis to test these assumptions. Modeling developmental trajectories in ASD, like many neurodevelopmental disorders, requires simplification of individual heterogeneity. In simulating the VABS trajectory, we used literature estimates to simulate individual trajectories yearly from ages 2–7 years [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, we were unable to account for the extent that certain developmental trajectories were associated with better or worse response to the CB intervention due to lack of correlational data. Given lack of currently available data, we unable to project VABS trajectories past year 7 but the modeling framework we developed is readily adaptable to include this data as it is available. Additionally, we assumed an efficacious CB intervention for the purposes of informing future ASD trial design and drug development, assuming clinicians and policymakers would not implement a non-efficacious therapy. There are two placebo-controlled trials of CB in ASD that did not show significant effects on the primary outcome, and as such, our cost-effectiveness results should be considered as theoretical and informing future therapy and clinical trial development [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These assumptions were relaxed in sensitivity analyses where we lowered the efficacy of the intervention to 0, and where we reduced the productivity benefits in adulthood to 0.</p>
              <p>Second, in the basecase, we incorporated DukeACT 6-month efficacy data to inform our basecase intervention and assumed CB intervention efficacy lasted throughout childhood (for quality of life) and adulthood (for economic productivity). While it is likely that the adaptive behavioral skills acquired 6-months post intervention in DukeACT are not lost, long-term similar follow-up data for the intervention are not available. DukeACT collected 12-month data, however these data were collected remotely and are not comparable to the 6-month data. We addressed this limitation in sensitivity analyses where we lowered the efficacy of the CB intervention to 0, and where we reduced the productivity benefits in adulthood to 0. Third, our total adult ASD costs were an overestimate given inconsistencies in the published literature, however these costs did not affect cost-effectiveness or budget impact estimates as seen in sensitivity analysis [<xref rid="pone.0282906.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282906.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Future research might provide better estimates of the medical and non-medical costs of adult ASD for incorporation in economic analysis. Lastly, this study did not explicitly compare CB with intensive behavioral interventions. Future research comparing CB and intensive behavioral intervention might elucidate the separate, or perhaps even synergistic, effects of each individual intervention, as well as their combination.</p>
              <p>Overall, we find that a novel cord blood intervention in ASD with modest efficacy may be cost-effective under certain circumstances. Our projections may guide researchers and policymakers in their consideration of future novel therapeutics in ASD.</p>
