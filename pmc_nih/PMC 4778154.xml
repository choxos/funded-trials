                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>
As treatment for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) virus has evolved to all-oral, interferon-free directly acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, the impact of these improvements on patient adherence has not been described.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Medication
adherence was measured in 60 HCV, genotype-1, treatment-naïve participants enrolled in a phase 2a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health and community clinics. Participants received either ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) (90 mg/400 mg) (one pill) daily for 12 weeks, LDV/SOF + GS-9451 (80 mg/day) (two pills) daily for 6 weeks, or LDV/SOF + GS-9669 (500 mg twice daily; three pills, two in the morning, one in the evening) for 6 weeks. Adherence was measured using medication event monitoring system (MEMS) caps, pill counts and patient report.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall adherence to DAAs was high. Adherence declined over the course of the 12-week treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04). While controlled psychiatric disease or symptoms of depression did not influence adherence, recent drug use was a risk factor for non-adherence to 12-week (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), but not 6-week regimens. Adherence as measured by MEMS was lower than by patient report.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Adherence to short courses of DAA therapy with 1–3 pills a day was excellent in an urban population with multiple risk factors for non-adherence.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects over 180 million people worldwide and results in approximately 300,000 deaths annually due to cirrhosis and 200,000 deaths due to hepatocellular cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Treatment for HCV has rapidly evolved—from complex regimens associated with multiple toxicities that require weekly injections of pegylated-interferon (IFN) in combination with eight pills a day for 12–48 weeks—to new regimens of all-oral directly acting antiviral (DAA) agents only characterized by low pill burdens, short therapeutic courses, few side effects, and high (&gt;90 %) rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most recently, the DAA-only regimen consisting of a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 (GT-1) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Evaluating adherence to DAA-only regimens is vital to translating the high efficacy of these regimens observed in phase III clinical trials to the community. In particular, adherence is important to attaining the maximal rate of SVR from a treatment regimen, avoiding treatment failure and/or the development of DAA resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, the cost of medication non-adherence across all diseases has been estimated to exceed $100 billion in additional healthcare expenditures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Given the high cost of HCV DAA medications, which has driven some insurers to implement rules authorizing only one course of DAA therapy in a patient’s lifetime, maximizing SVR rates is especially important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>While low adherence (&lt;80 %) to IFN-containing regimens without DAAs has been shown to result in decreased rates of SVR, the impact of patient adherence on outcomes in DAA-only therapy has not been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As RNA virus, HCV rapidly replicates and is highly error prone, suggesting that it could develop high-level resistance to DAAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The subsequent risk of emerging class-specific viral mutants at treatment failure may restrict future treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the impact of duration, pill burden, and patient psychosocial factors on adherence to DAA-only regimens is critical to developing simple, efficacious treatments vital to achieving global eradication of HCV.</p>
              <p>To evaluate the potential impact of patient adherence to HCV treatment on outcomes, the adherence of patients enrolled in three arms of the NIH SYNERGY trial was measured.</p>

In order to maintain optimal levels of study medications in their blood, patients were counseled to take the study medications at approximately the same time every day. A dose taken correctly was measured within a time frame of 24 ± 2 h from the previous dose, except in the case of GS-9669, which was to be taken 12 h ± 2 h from the previous dose. Patients were instructed to bring their medication bottles to each study visit so that the study team could perform a pill count and collect MEMS data.

Ten percent, 17, 8, and 5 % of patients had abused alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and/or heroin, respectively, in the 6 months prior to starting the study medications. Twenty-seven percent of patients were employed outside of their home. Intravenous drug use (IVDU) was the most common self-reported risk factor for HCV (52 %), followed by IVDU along with blood transfusions (15 %) and blood transfusions alone (7 %).

                <p>Adherence to DAAs was high as measured by MEMS, pill count, and patient report. In patients treated with 12 weeks of LDV/SOF in a once daily combination tablet, the overall adherence was 97.6, 98.2, and 99.3 % by MEMS, pill count, and patient report, respectively. In patients treated with LDV/SOF and GS-9451 for 6 weeks with two pills once daily, overall adherence was 97.3, 98.2, and 99.3 % by MEMS, pill count, and patient report, respectively. In the regimen using LDV/SOF and GS-9669 with three pills (two in the morning, one in the evening) daily, overall adherence was 95.0, 98.9, and 99.5 % by MEMS, pill count, and patient report, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There was no difference in overall adherence among the three regimens by MEMS (<italic>p</italic> = 0.36), pill count (<italic>p</italic> = 0.60), or patient report (<italic>p</italic> = 0.84).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Adherence to DAA regimens measured by MEMS, pill count, and patient report. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 versus MEMS</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12072_2015_9680_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p>Within each regimen, adherence as measured by MEMS was consistently lower than that measured by patient self-report (LDV/SOF, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; LDV/SOF + GS-9451, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; LDV/SOF + GS-9669, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01).

                <p>Adherence results were not discussed with patients in order to mimic a “real-world” clinic experience where MEMS data would not be routinely available. One exception was a single patient who by MEMS was found to have missed five doses by the week 4 visit. Given that the patient had advanced liver disease with cirrhosis, the principal investigator decided that the risk of not counseling the patient outweighed any benefit to the adherence study. The patient was counseled by a study physician to improve adherence but subsequently missed six additional doses over the next 8 weeks.</p>

                <p>In the LDV/SOF treatment arm, patients took 72 ± 18 % of doses at the correct time. In the LDV/SOF and GS-9451 or GS-9669 arms, patients took 64 ± 18 and 61 ± 18 % of doses at the correct time, respectively.

Only 4 out of 60 patients missed two or more consecutive doses of study medications by MEMS. One patient treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks and one patient treated with LDV/SOF + GS-9669 missed two consecutive doses.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this phase 2a study, adherence to all-oral DAAs for HCV treatment was high among a largely inner-city patient population with multiple risk factors for treatment noncompliance. Although adherence declined with increases in pill burden and treatment duration, mean adherence as measured by MEMS did not fall below 95 % irrespective of these factors. Recent drug use was associated with decreased treatment compliance in the 12-week arm, but not in the 6-week arms. Additionally, neither concomitant controlled mental illness nor symptoms of anxiety or depression influenced adherence. Due to the efficacy of DAA regimens and the high adherence observed in this study, no risk factors could be associated with viral relapse. Overall, simple, short-duration, all-oral HCV therapy in patients with perceived risk factors for treatment noncompliance may be as efficacious as in populations without these risk factors.</p>
              <p>The development of DAAs has dramatically simplified treatment for hepatitis C by improving cure rates and decreasing side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The real-world effectiveness of all-oral, interferon- and ribavirin-free DAA regimens is similar to that seen in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given that missed doses of HCV treatment may result in the potential development of viral resistance, adherence to these DAA medications remains an important issue as larger numbers of HCV-infected patients are treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Participants in this study were generally representative of the patient population infected with HCV in the USA and demonstrated sociodemographic characteristics associated with medication non-adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although patients with active drug use, active alcohol abuse, or uncontrolled psychiatric disease were excluded from the study, diagnosed psychiatric disease was common, and many patients reported recent drug use. Data from this study show that medication adherence in patients with stable psychiatric disease or symptoms of depression (as measured by CES-D) is similar to that in patients without psychiatric disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Recent drug use was associated with decreased adherence in patients treated with the longer 12-week treatment duration, suggesting that shorter, simple regimens may be better for this patient population. These regimens may be administered in the setting of drug rehabilitation for patients not at high risk of HCV reinfection, where additional monitoring and adherence support is available.</p>
              <p>Adherence as measured by the MEMS and pill count was similar between the one-pill (LDV/SOF) and two-pill (LDV/SOF + GS-9451) per day regimes, but a trend toward lower adherence was observed in the three-pill (LDV/SOF + GS-9669) per day (two pills in the morning, one pill at night) regimen. It is unknown whether the additional pill burden or the additional time of pill administration had a greater bearing on this decreased adherence. It should be noted that for all three regimens, adherence as measured by MEMS was lower than that determined by patient report, but similar to that by pill count. This supports the finding that when prompted to report adherence rates, patients tend to overestimate their adherence and underestimate their number of missed doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Given the similar measurements obtained by MEMS and pill count and the high cost of MEMS caps, clinicians can consider pill count an alternative and reliable measure for monitoring patient adherence.</p>
              <p>While forgetting their medications and being away from home were among the top reasons for patients missing HCV medications, the most common reason, as reported by 38 % of patients, was feeling as if the medications were working. During this study, patients would meet with a member of the study team at each visit and discuss their progress on study. Anecdotally, many patients were interested and happy to see their rapid HCV viral load decline upon initiation of therapy. Patients were counseled that these results, while promising, did not indicate SVR. Given that many patients reported their reason for non-adherence as feeling reassured that the medications were working, additional counseling about the meaning of HCV viral load decline may be needed to improve adherence, particularly in non-study settings where patient interactions with their provider may be more limited.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this study include the small sample size, which restricts the ability to perform a multivariate analysis of risk factors for non-adherence. Since drug and alcohol abuse was self-reported by the patients, there may be an underestimation of these characteristics among our patient population. Additionally, adherence as studied here may be different from real-world clinical practice. Patients in this study were enrolled on a clinical trial to test novel DAA therapies for the treatment of HCV and thus had frequent study visits with their healthcare provider, which may serve to reinforce adherence to medications. However, only one subject who missed 11 of 84 doses had an intervention to address poor adherence. The remaining patients were observed, which may be comparable to a clinical setting where adherence by MEMS caps and pill counts are not routinely performed. The results of this study warrant future evaluations of adherence in patients undergoing DAA therapy in real-life settings worldwide, specifically for those DAA-based therapies that extend over 12 weeks and include ribavirin, which is still part of the standard of care for HCV in most parts of the world. Given the high degree of adherence and high percentage of SVR in this study, we were not able to demonstrate the threshold of adherence required to achieve SVR. This is an important clinical question that needs to be addressed in future clinical trials with a large number of patients as DAA therapy becomes more widely used globally.</p>
              <p>Although several studies of adherence have addressed issues related to long-term chronic illnesses, there are few studies investigating adherence to shorter medical regimens of 12–24 weeks or less of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study, we found that during a one-pill once-daily 12-week regimen, adherence to medication dropped off after 4 weeks, and significantly after 8 weeks. Therefore, efforts to devise DAA regimens for HCV treatment of no longer than 8 weeks should be encouraged.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, adherence to DAAs was high in this urban population of patients who are representative of the HCV epidemic in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Numerous potent regimens are in development for the treatment of HCV, thereby providing clinicians with multiple options for their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. When selecting the optimal treatment, clinicians should consider pill burden and treatment duration in addition to cost, adverse events, efficacy, and drug-drug interactions. Additionally, clinicians should be aware that HCV treatment of patients with controlled psychiatric disease or symptoms of depression may be equally successful as that in patients without psychiatric disease.</p>
