                  <title>Main Measures</title>
                  <p id="Par6">Investigators compared TIME versus control participant baseline to month 6 changes of HbA1c (primary outcome), blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), weight, and adherence to seven American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care. CHW assistance in identifying barriers to healthcare in the intervention group were measured at the end of mHealth communication (12 months).</p>

                  <title>Key Results</title>
                  <p id="Par7">A total of 89 individuals participated. TIME individuals compared to control participants had significant HbA1c decreases (9.02 to 7.59% (− 1.43%) vs. 8.71 to 8.26% (− 0.45%), respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), blood pressure changes (systolic: − 6.89 mmHg vs. 0.03 mmHg, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023; diastolic: − 3.36 mmHg vs. 0.2 mmHg, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046), and ADA guideline adherence (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) from baseline to month 6. At month 6, more TIME than control participants achieved <underline>&gt;</underline> 0.50% HbA1c reductions (88.57% vs. 43.75%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). BMI and weight changes were not significant between groups. Many (54.6%) TIME participants experienced <underline>&gt;</underline> 1 barrier to care, of whom 91.7% had medication issues. CHWs identified the majority (87.5%) of barriers.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par8">TIME participants resulted in improved outcomes including HbA1c. CHWs are uniquely positioned to identify barriers to care particularly related to medications that may have gone unrecognized otherwise. Larger trials are needed to determine the scalability and sustainability of the intervention.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="Par10">Eighty percent of individuals with diabetes live in low- or middle-income countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> In high-income countries, most (69%) of those suffering from diabetes are low- or middle-income.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Resource-limited and minority populations have a greater prevalence of diabetes and more disease-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Strategies to improve glycemic control are complicated by poverty, limited literacy, and access to medications and healthcare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> These severe disparities highlight the need for innovative changes.</p>
              <p id="Par11">One strategy to improve care in resource-limited settings is community health workers (CHWs). These individuals have been instrumental in improving patient outcomes for a variety of diseases and conditions including diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Our recent study showed that CHWs successfully led diabetes group visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Group visits or shared medical appointments are a cost-effective intervention, comprising of education, integrated primary care (e.g., medication reconciliation), and goal development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Most group visits are led by physicians or other health professionals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and, though bilingual providers add value in relating to the patient population, they are in short supply.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Integrating CHWs into group visits has showed value in overcoming cultural and language barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par12">However, there have been major concerns related to inadequate CHW training and support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> This has led to increased global interest in telehealth mechanisms including mobile health (mHealth), particularly as they relate to supporting CHWs by assisting with diagnostics, enhancing communication, and professional development, and, thereby, improving patient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> A study of 72 African American individuals revealed that CHW-participant mHealth collaboration improved participant diabetes self-management skills and provided support by connecting CHWs to the healthcare team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> A systematic review and meta-analysis illustrated numerous benefits of CHW-participant mHealth interaction including appointment reminders and reporting from peripheral sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par13">Though prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CHWs and mHealth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> their combination has not been evaluated. To evaluate this combined strategy in a clinical trial, investigators compared individuals with type 2 diabetes randomized to the program TIME (<italic>T</italic>elehealth-supported, <italic>I</italic>ntegrated care with CHWs, and <italic>ME</italic>dication-access) (intervention) versus usual care in the clinic (control). TIME consisted of CHW-participant mHealth communication, CHW-led diabetes group visits, and CHW-physician diabetes training and support via telehealth (video conferencing). Investigators evaluated clinical outcomes (i.e., HbA1c (primary), adherence to American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>) and CHW assistance in identifying barriers to healthcare. The overarching hypothesis was improved glycemic control of TIME compared to control participants.</p>

                <p id="Par15">We recruited two cohorts 6 months apart. Eligible participants were adults (<underline>&gt;</underline> 18 years) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c <underline>&gt;</underline> 6.5%), self-identified as Latino(a), and Spanish-speaking. Individuals were excluded if they were pregnant, had an event that would alter HbA1c levels (e.g., recent blood transfusion), or did not attend at least one group visit. Methods to identify potential participants were through the clinic database (primary), clinic referrals, or word of mouth. The clinic database filtered for Latino(a)/Hispanic with diabetes (ICD-10 E11:9, E11:X). Study staff contacted eligible individuals by phone to explain the study and interested individuals were invited to an orientation. At orientation, investigators obtained baseline clinical and survey data, signed written consent, and randomized participants to TIME (intervention) or usual care (wait-list control) using an automatic number generator to achieve block randomization. A physician completed a secondary chart review to confirm eligibility.</p>

Usual care in the clinic included diabetes management with physicians (quarterly) and clinical pharmacists (monthly) in addition to routinely offered nutrition classes. To allow wait-list control individuals the opportunity to receive TIME,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> they were offered the intervention months 7–12. After receiving the group visits, participants returned to usual care. Month 6 HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, and survey data were gathered for the wait-list control group prior to them receiving the intervention. Attrition was defined as study staff inability to contact a participant by month 6.</p>

                  <p id="Par23">The primary study outcome was glycemic control as measured by baseline to month 6 change of HbA1c. To evaluate individuals who maintained or achieved target (e.g., &lt; 7.0%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> by month 6 and assess the number who achieved clinically meaningful decreases in HbA1c (<underline>&gt;</underline> 0.5%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, investigators also conducted a sub-analysis named <italic>responders</italic>, defined as meeting either or both markers. Other clinical outcomes were blood pressure, weight, and BMI, of which investigators obtained at baseline (orientation) and 6 months (month 6 group visits). Baseline to month 6 adherence to seven ADA standard of care markers were collected through chart review at the following timepoints: baseline/month 6 (appropriately dosed statin, B12 screening), baseline/month 6 and 1 year prior to each timepoint (annual screenings: retinal, comprehensive foot exam, microalbuminuria, influenza vaccination), and baseline/month 6 and time prior to each timepoint as dictated per current recommendations (pneumococcal vaccination).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p>
                  <p id="Par24">Clinical outcomes were measured after the completion of the diabetes group visits rather than at the end of CHW-participant contact (12 months) due to introduction of multiple variables upon return to clinic including potential changes of providers, eligibility, and clinics. Month 6 was defined as 24 weeks after orientation ± 4 weeks. To reduce bias toward the intervention group who may have had more frequent checks, account for potential time variations between study arms, and collect data of participants not present at group visits, a study physician conducted a secondary chart review for all participants and recorded the lowest month 6 clinical value for HbA1c, blood pressure, and weight. Study team technique for obtaining clinical measures reflected those of the clinic (e.g., recheck blood pressure in both arms after 15 min for levels <underline>&gt;</underline> 140/90).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="Par35">Diabetes is an epidemic that continues to increase, requiring innovative measures to prevent further burden to vulnerable populations. This study validated that participants in TIME achieved superior glycemic control, blood pressure, and ADA guideline adherence compared to control individuals. Rationale for these findings are an integrated, multifaceted program including the combination of mHealth and CHWs, which is a novel approach to care with promising results that show efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Compared to our feasibility study, this investigation resulted in superior glycemic and blood pressure outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Overall, diabetes group visits and CHW interventions have shown effective HbA1c reductions (− 0.46%, − 0.71%, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> but less than those of the current study. This investigation transitioned from quarterly, in-person CHW training in our feasibility study to weekly, telehealth support. Also, this study strongly emphasized low-cost medications and combined CHWs and mHealth, which to our knowledge has not been published before in diabetes clinical trials. These factors likely contributed to the stronger findings from this study compared to our feasibility study and other investigations.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Telehealth (mHealth, video conferencing) was an important part of TIME. mHealth improved communication and connected CHWs and participants to the healthcare system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> whereas video conferencing enhanced consistent training and support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> These modalities likely greatly enhanced patient outcomes by assisting in high (87.5%) CHW ability to identify barriers to care, low attrition, physician communication, and, thereby, improved glycemic control. These findings are consistent with a large body of literature that has shown improved support and communication associated with telehealth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par38">Notably, the most common barrier to care related to medications and, therefore, the emphasis on low-cost hypoglycemic agents was critical. A study physician prescribed and maximized the most affordable ($4–$6/month) oral medications available at major pharmaceutical retailers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and high-cost agents including insulin were initiated when inexpensive options had been exhausted. Participants taking high-cost medications upon study entry were continued if they remained effective and accessible. CHWs facilitated medication access by alerting a study physician when participants experienced barriers. Prior studies have agreed upon the complexity of medication adherence, noting cost as a major contributor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par39">While many individuals experienced medication access barriers, others oftentimes were nonadherent due to fear, forgetfulness, and misunderstanding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> This is a complex topic where integrated diabetes care with group visits was important. For example, during the large groups, CHWs emphasized nonadherence issues and subsequent breakout sessions allowed opportunities to discuss individual concerns, address questions, and provide collaboration. CHW-participant mHealth communication provided further education, feedback, and reminders.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Investigators included individuals with baseline-controlled HbA1c levels for two major reasons. HbA1c variability disproportionately affects low-income populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and, therefore, controlled individuals may have had substantially different glycemic levels in recent months. HbA1c variability has severe consequences including cardiovascular events, microvascular complications, and all-cause mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> Additionally, though there are strong recommendations for diabetes prevention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> most programs exclude those who are controlled. Weight management is particularly important for these individuals;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> though not significant, TIME participants who were controlled at baseline lost more weight than the control arm (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This finding may have been significant with more participants in this subgroup.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Our study is limited by time and a moderate sample size that is majority female, although most diabetes group visit investigations are less than a year, have high attrition, and are minority male.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Results are also limited to Spanish-speaking individuals at a nonprofit clinic. Though multifaceted interventions limit deciphering the most efficacious variable, these strategies have been found valuable for the complicated nature of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> Long-term analyses including the role of behavioral health are difficult to assess in 6 months. Prior investigators found short-term success but failed to demonstrate sustainability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> In the current study, weight-neutral outcomes may also relate to the addition of hypoglycemic medications associated with weight gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par42">Several areas of future directions are warranted. Further variable and cost analysis of TIME’s multifaceted approach to diabetes care using multiphase optimization strategies or step-wedge designs are needed. Outcome sustainability after participants re-enter clinic are also warranted; observations suggest no clinically significant HbA1c change at <underline>&gt;</underline> 12 months for TIME participants. However, individual HbA1c trends demonstrate minimal improvement and possibly significant deterioration, which may be medication access related. Future studies should address clinic-wide strategies for sustainable medication access in low-income settings.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p id="Par43">This study demonstrates the integral role of CHWs in a multifaceted diabetes program. CHWs are uniquely positioned to recognize medication barriers that would likely have otherwise been unidentified. Telehealth played a key part in supporting the program for both CHWs and participants. To increase the likelihood of sustainability, longitudinal evaluations of TIME are needed to evaluate the ability to implement the program in multiple sites.</p>
