                <p id="Par1">The L-type calcium channel gene, CACNA1C, is a validated risk gene for schizophrenia and the target of calcium channel blockers. Carriers of the risk-associated genotype (rs1006737 <italic>A</italic> allele) have increased frontal cortical activity during working memory and higher CACNA1C mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex. The aim of this study was to determine how the brain-penetrant calcium channel blocker, nimodipine, changes brain activity during working memory and other cognitive and emotional processes. We conducted a double-blind randomized cross-over pharmacoMRI study of a single 60 mg dose of oral nimodipine solution and matching placebo in healthy men, prospectively genotyped for rs1006737. With performance unchanged, nimodipine significantly decreased frontal cortical activity by 39.1% and parietal cortical activity by 42.8% during the N-back task (2-back &gt; 0-back contrast; <italic>P</italic><sub>FWE</sub> &lt; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 28). Higher peripheral nimodipine concentrations were correlated with a greater decrease in activation in the frontal cortex. Carriers of the risk-associated allele, <italic>A</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 14), had a greater decrease in frontal cortical activation during working memory compared to non-risk allele carriers. No differences in brain activation were found between nimodipine and placebo for other tasks. Future studies should be conducted to test if the decreased cortical brain activity after nimodipine is associated with improved working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia, particularly those who carry the risk-associated genotype. Furthermore, changes in cortical activity during working memory may be a useful biomarker in future trials of L-type calcium channel blockers.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Cognitive deficits are a core symptom of schizophrenia, but currently available antipsychotic drugs improve mainly positive symptoms (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), leaving patients with often debilitating cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms (e.g. apathy, avolition, anhedonia). Efforts to develop cognitive-enhancing agents have been hindered, in part, by a lack of understanding of the neural systems underlying the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and therefore a lack of plausible drug targets for this clinical domain.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The CACNA1C gene (alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) has been identified by several independent studies as a genome-wide associated risk gene for both schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and bipolar disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We previously reported that healthy adults who carry the CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 <italic>A</italic> allele, which is associated with risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had increased activation in the prefrontal cortex during the N-back working memory task, compared to non-risk genotype carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Increased activation of the prefrontal cortex during working memory without change in performance on the task (i.e. inefficient cortical engagement) has been previously reported in patients with schizophrenia and their healthy siblings (who are at increased genetic risk for schizophrenia, but without illness)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We also found that mRNA expression of CACNA1C is increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in human post-mortem brain samples that carry the risk-associated genotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Yoshimizu and colleagues found that increased CACNA1C mRNA expression in carriers of the risk-associated genotype results in increased L-type voltage-gated calcium channel current density in induced human neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These data suggest that blocking the L-type calcium channel may improve cortical function in patients with schizophrenia.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The CACNA1C gene codes for the alpha 1C subunit of Cav1.2 channels and is the binding site for L-type calcium channel (LTCC) antagonists. Recently, Hayes et al. found that there were lower rates of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and nonaffective psychosis who were taking LTCC antagonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine LTCC antagonist used to treat cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage and has been shown to be effective in treating mood symptoms in case reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and treatment trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> of bipolar and unipolar depression. To date, there have been no clinical trials using nimodipine to treat schizophrenia. Nimodipine is highly lipophilic and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, making it an ideal candidate to probe the effects of L-type calcium channel blockade on cortical activation during working memory.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We conducted the following pharmacoMRI study to evaluate the effects of nimodipine on brain activation during cognitive and emotional tasks in healthy subjects. Based on our previous imaging genetics study, we hypothesized that nimodipine would decrease frontal cortical activation during working memory in the context of fixed performance, and that this improvement in cortical physiological efficiency would be greatest in subjects carrying the CACNA1C risk-associated genotype.</p>

                <p id="Par6">All subjects provided written informed consent approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board prior to study participation. Subjects were healthy, non-smoking, Caucasian, right-handed men 18–35 years old. Subjects were screened for current and past psychiatric illness using the Structural Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID) of DSM-IV Disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Subjects completed a history and physical examination, biochemical and hematological laboratory screens, MRI safety screen, and screened for drugs of abuse including alcohol. Subjects were nonsmoking, as confirmed with urine nicotine and cotinine screening. Subjects were excluded for past or current neurological or psychiatric illness, uncontrolled medical disorder, hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, or head trauma with loss of consciousness or evidence of functional impairment after head trauma. Subjects did not take psychotropic medications within 3 months of the first study visit or any enzyme-inducing or inhibiting agent within 1 month of the study. All subjects were right-handed as determined by the Edinburgh Inventory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A blood sample was collected and processed using standardized methods to extract DNA. Targeted genotyping of rs1006737 was done using a standard allelic discrimination Taqman assay, as described in the supplement.</p>

                <p id="Par7">The study was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over of a single 60 mg dose of oral nimodipine (20 mL of Nymalize®) and a matching placebo solution. An investigational pharmacist randomized subjects to receive either nimodipine or placebo for the first visit followed by the opposite treatment on the second visit. Visits were separated by a washout period (minimum 2-weeks). <italic>Nymalize</italic> and matching placebo were donated by Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC. Subjects were screened for drugs of abuse on the morning of each study visit and an intravenous catheter was placed in their left forearm for collection of multiple blood samples. Subjects completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) at the screening visit and then upon study visit admission and 15, 90, and 240 min after drug administration on each study visit to assess subjects’ mood during the study and compare between treatments.</p>

Samples between 40 and 90 min were taken in between each of the fMRI tasks. Samples were processed using centrifugation to separate plasma, using standard techniques. Nimodipine was extracted from plasma via protein precipitation, and drug quantification was performed using a validated liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.2 ng/mL.

                <p id="Par9">The first 15 subjects were scanned on the Siemens 3T Trio MRI and the last 15 subjects were scanned on the same magnet upgraded to the Siemens 3T Prisma MRI. All scanning parameters remained the same between the Trio and Prisma acquisitions. A structural MRI (T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE) was completed on each subject and reviewed by a neuroradiologist to ensure there were no structural abnormalities. The first functional MRI task was started ~30 min following drug/placebo administration. Subjects were trained or instructed on the fMRI tasks prior to scanning. Subjects completed the N-back working memory task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a modified monetary incentive delay task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, an emotional memory task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, an emotional face matching task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and the flanker task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, as previously described.

The PACE MOCO sequence, which prospectively corrects for motion during scan acquisition, eliminates subsequent need for realignment, thus minimizing the impact of motion on data quality.</p>

                <title>N-back working memory task</title>
                <p id="Par10">The N-back working memory task was scanned second in the series of fMRI tasks, ~45 min to an hour after nimodipine/placebo administration, which corresponds with peak nimodipine levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Neural activity was measured using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI while subjects performed the N-back. Details of the N-back task have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Briefly, there were 4 blocks of the 2-back (i.e. working memory condition) alternating with a 0-back (i.e. control condition). During the 0-back blocks, the subject serially responds with the current digit presented (1,2,3,4 in a diamond shaped box). During the 2-back block, the subject responds with number presented 2 previous (“<italic>N</italic>” = 2). Subjects were trained on the N-back task until they could perform the 2-back condition above 80% accuracy twice in a row. BOLD fMRI parameters for the N-back task were the following: axial slices = 33, thickness = 3.0 mm, voxel size=3.8 × 3.8 × 3.0 mm, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 28 msec, FOV = 240 mm, matrix = 64 × 64.</p>

                <p id="Par11">Functional MR images were processed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>) implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>). For each task, functional scans (<italic>n</italic> = 124 for the N-back task) were acquired for each participant to measure the T2*-weighted BOLD signal. Dummy scans (<italic>n</italic> = 2–3) were acquired at the beginning to allow for steady-state magnetization and discarded from subsequent analyses. Prospective motion-corrected images were spatially normalized to the first EPI scan, smoothed with a 10-mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter, and ratio normalized to the whole-brain global mean.</p>
                <p id="Par12">In the first-level analyses, for each task, linear contrasts were computed producing t-statistical parameter maps at each voxel. For example, t-statistical parameter maps were produced for the 2-back condition greater than 0-back condition contrast to isolate brain regions related to working memory. These statistical images were entered in a second-level model to identify significant activations within and between treatments and genotype groups.</p>
                <p id="Par13">The main effect of nimodipine on brain activity related to working memory (2-back &gt; 0-back) was analyzed using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test (placebo versus nimodipine) and the contrast was thresholded at pFWE &lt; 0.05 and 10 contiguous voxels (spatial extent threshold). To determine the effect of rs1006737 genotype on the main effect of nimodipine, the Image Calculator (ImCalc facility) in SPM12 was used to create images of Placebo-Nimodipine for each subject. These images were then entered into a multiple linear regression (an additive genetic model using copies of <italic>A</italic> allele), and masked for the main effect of nimodipine on N-back task activation. The interaction of genotype*nimodipine was thresholded at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 uncorrected and extent <italic>k</italic> = 10 voxels. First and second-level analyses were conducted for the other fMRI tasks, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par14">We conducted exploratory analyses to determine if there was a relationship between nimodipine concentrations, diastolic or systolic blood pressure, or heart rate, and the main effect of nimodipine on N-back working memory-related neural activation. A multiple linear regression was done for each covariate (regressed on images of Placebo-Nimodipine using ImCalc), masked for the main effect of nimodipine on N-back task activation, and thresholded at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 uncorrected and extent <italic>k</italic> = 10 voxels for each analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par27">In healthy subjects, nimodipine administration significantly decreased neural activity in parietal and frontal cortices during the N-back working memory task, despite fixed performance on the task. This is a pattern of change that suggests that nimodipine improves the physiological efficiency of cortical processing of working memory information. There were no effects of blood pressure or heart rate on our pharmacoMRI results, supporting the notion that the present drug and genotype effects on BOLD signal are indicative of a central nervous system effect. The effect of nimodipine appears to be relatively selective to working memory, as it did not affect neural activation during encoding or retrieval of aversive or neutral scenes, emotional face matching, attention, and cognitive control, or motivation and/or reward tasks. The apparent specificity of nimodipine’s effects on the working memory circuitry further suggests the changes are not related to global alterations in peripheral blood pressure or brain perfusion. The effects of nimodipine on frontal and parietal cortical activity during working memory were concentration-dependent, with higher concentrations resulting in lower frontal cortical activity. There were also several regions of the parietal cortex and SMA that showed a similar relationship, where higher concentrations had a greater decrease in neural activity. The larger reduction in frontal–parietal network activity, involving the parietal cortex (superior parietal, supramarginal gyrus) as well frontal areas (including SMA), may reflect the network involved in the representation of quantity (numbers) during working memory with a button press motor response. The N-back task has been shown to have high within-subject and group-level reliability, measured by a high intraclass correlation coefficient with retest scans, which makes this paradigm ideal for pharmacoMRI studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Carriers of the CACNA1C risk allele (<italic>A</italic>) had a greater decrease in frontal cortical activity after nimodipine, providing further evidence this effect is being driven by changes in calcium channel activity. We previously showed that CACNA1C risk allele carriers have increased CACNA1C expression in the dorsolateral PFC and hyperactivation of the prefrontal cortex during working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. If risk allele carriers have greater L-type calcium channel expression in the prefrontal cortex, the specific target of nimodipine, it may not be surprising that they would show the greatest effect in this region. However, evidence that CACNA1C risk-associated genotype predicts expression of this channel subunit is inconsistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Since all genotype groups had a decrease in prefrontal cortical activity after nimodipine, and there was no difference in nimodipine’s effect in the parietal cortex between genotype groups, we would predict that nimodipine could improve performance in all patients who have a working memory deficit, not just those carrying the risk genotype.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Nimodipine administration did not improve performance on the N-back task in these healthy subjects without a working memory deficit, which was to be expected since the N-back test is not designed to be behaviorally sensitive to change, particularly in subjects who can easily perform this task well. The subjects performed near or at a ceiling during both placebo and nimodipine (91% mean accuracy during the 2-back condition) and subjects were trained to perform at or above 80% accuracy. Our principal aim in this study was to assess the effect of nimodipine on cortical efficiency, a phenomenon associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, which is defined operationally as a change in physiological activity without a change in performance. Nimodipine has shown pro-cognitive effects in several animal models of cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, including improved spatial working memory performance in both young and aged rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and improved associative learning in aging rabbits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Nimodipine also improved performance on a delayed-response memory task in aged nonhuman primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Other animal studies have found that excessive calcium signaling can impair prefrontal cortical functioning, which then requires more extensive activation to compensate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which may explain the pro-cognitive effects of inhibiting calcium channel signaling. Research in nonhuman primates has shown that calcium actions in the prefrontal cortex can impair the information held in working memory through either neuronal hyperexcitability or calcium-cAMP signaling-dependent opening of potassium channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In humans, chronic treatment with nimodipine (30 mg TID for 12 weeks) resulted in better cognitive performance in patients with dementia and cognitive impairment in an open-label trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Studies are needed to test the effects of nimodipine on working memory performance and other cognitive domains in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders, who have cognitive deficits and therefore do not perform as well on the N-back task. Future studies should test multiple doses and cognitive testing outside of the fMRI to determine the dose-response relationship and determine nimodipine’s effects on other cognitive domains. Clinical studies of the cognitive effects of nimodipine should include functional MRI as a biomarker of treatment response, which would also provide insight into the mechanism behind nimodipine’s pro-cognitive effects.</p>
