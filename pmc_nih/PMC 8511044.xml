                <p id="Par1">Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a devastating complication of solid tumor malignancies, with dire prognosis and no effective systemic treatment options. Over the past decade, the incidence of LMD has steadily increased due to therapeutics that have extended the survival of cancer patients, highlighting the need for new interventions. To examine the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with LMD, we completed two phase II clinical trials. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular features underpinning observed patient trajectories in these trials by applying single-cell RNA and cell-free DNA profiling to longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) draws from enrolled patients. We recover immune and malignant cell types in the CSF, characterize cell behavior changes following ICI, and identify genomic features associated with relevant clinical phenomena. Overall, our study describes the liquid LMD tumor microenvironment prior to and following ICI treatment and demonstrates clinical utility of cell-free and single-cell genomic measurements for LMD research.</p>

Approximately 5–8% of all cancer patients develop LMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, with common histologies including breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, over the past decade, the incidence of LMD has risen due to increased patient survival through better tolerated and more effective treatment strategies. An effective systemic therapy for LMD is thus urgently needed, as current measures (e.g., craniospinal radiation and intrathecal therapies) have uncertain benefit and significant adverse effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the field of oncology, and demonstrated remarkable response rates in a variety of metastatic, chemotherapy-refractory solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. More recently, ICI has emerged as a promising option for central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Preclinical data have demonstrated infiltration of T cells and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in brain metastases (BM) of various histologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, suggesting the potential for ICI to be efficacious in the CNS. Relatedly, ICI for metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer parenchymal brain metastases has demonstrated objective intracranial responses at a rate similar to systemic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, however, ICI as treatment for LMD has not been evaluated in prospective clinical trials.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To address this unmet need, we initiated two phase II clinical trials of ICI in patients with LMD of any histology (NCT02886585, NCT02939300; see Methods). One trial (NCT02886585) evaluated the efficacy of an antibody targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, drug name pembrolizumab) and the other (NCT02939300) evaluated targeting of PD-1 (drug name nivolumab) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4, drug name ipilimumab). Both of these treatments were administered intravenously (IV), with blood and CSF drawn prior to each dose when clinically indicated (see Methods) and sent for genomic analysis. Notably, both trials achieved primary endpoint (60% and 44% of patients were alive at 3 months after enrollment in the pembrolizumab and ipilimumab/nivolumab trials, respectively) and showed improved overall median survival (3.6 and 2.9 months in the pembrolizumab and ipilimumab/nivolumab trials, respectively) compared to historical controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Despite the promise shown in NCT02886585 and NCT02939300, questions remain regarding the utility and long-term efficacy of ICI to treat LMD. For example, it is not known whether the clinical benefit observed in these patients is strictly a result of the systemic effects of ICI administration, or whether these extend to the CNS. Additionally, the cellular and molecular features that underlie patient response have yet to be elucidated.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and cell-free DNA-sequencing (cfDNA-Seq) in conjunction with conventional clinical assays to serial CSF and peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) samples from patients on these two ICI trials to: (1) describe the cellular composition of the LMD tumor microenvironment (TME); (2) assess inflammatory immune responses within the CSF; and, (3) identify potential factors informing the clinical courses observed in individual patients.</p>

                <p id="Par7">We performed longitudinal high-throughput scRNA-Seq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) on 12 pre-treatment and 25 post-treatment low-input CSF samples from 19 total patients enrolled in NCT02886585 and NCT02939300, including 9 patients sampled at multiple time points. After filtering for low quality cells, we retained 34,742 single cells from available clinical trial samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which we further classified and visualized using dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP; Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

The non-immune cell clusters (<italic>n</italic> = 11) exhibited strong patient-specific representation while the immune clusters (<italic>n</italic> = 5) grouped by phenotype rather than patient (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), consistent with previous observations derived through scRNA-Seq of human tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Development of a pipeline for scRNA/cfDNA from longitudinally sampled CSF samples before and after ICI therapy.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of the longitudinal sampling performed on patients in this study. <bold>b</bold> Longitudinal sampling overview from patients in each study, including trial primary endpoint (dashed line), and date of patient mortality, when known. <bold>c</bold> UMAP of single-cell transcriptomes from all captured CSF cells in both trials, colored by patient, with cell type of origin indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2021_25860_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e838"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par8">After initially identifying non-immune clusters via unsupervised clustering, we confirmed their malignancy status for samples from NCT02886585 by inferring copy number variation (CNV) profiles for each cell and matching to DNA-based profiling results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. DNA-derived CNV profiles were obtained via whole exome sequencing (WES) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from the CSF. Using these data, we confirmed that patient-specific non-immune clusters shared the inferred CNV profiles (as previously described) of their time-point matched cfDNA counterparts (Methods, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). The proportions of tumor cells captured by Seq-Well for available time points (see Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref> for all available cytology reports) correlated significantly (Kendall’s т correlation = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0027; Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.89, <italic>p</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) with the reported tumor cell fraction detected by CytoSpin from CSF (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">We found that CD8 + T cells in the CSF are more abundant (NCT02886585) and proliferative (both trials) in samples treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors relative to untreated samples. We first performed unsupervised analysis of the T/NK cluster (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>), and calculated the proportion of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK cells (which can co-segregate with T cells during high-level analyses of scRNA-Seq data based on gene-expression similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>) in each sample in our dataset (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The proportion of CD8 + T cells in post-treatment CSF samples from NCT02886585 was significantly higher than in pre-treatment samples in evaluable samples (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.87, Two-sided Wilcoxon’s rank-sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, <italic>N</italic> = 24 samples; 11 pre-treatment, 13 post-NCT02886585, see Methods), while there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of CD8 + T cells in the post-treatment CSF samples of NCT02939300 relative to pre-treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Unsupervised analysis of the T cells also revealed a cluster of cells with increased expression of genes associated with proliferation, including <italic>MKI67</italic>, <italic>BIRC5</italic>, and <italic>TOP2A</italic>, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

We calculated the fraction of proliferating CD8 + T cells for each sample.

                <p id="Par10">CD8 + T cells from samples treated with ICI transiently exhibited higher levels of genes associated with effector function and IFN-γ signaling relative to untreated samples, which were more naïve-like. Principal component analysis revealed that the first two principal components distinguished early post-treatment (&lt;30 days since initial treatment) and pre-treatment samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Loadings for these principal components were driven by genes associated with IFN-γ signaling as well as effector/naïve phenotypes of CD8 + T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, we detected a significant increase in genes related to effector-like function and IFN-γ signaling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>; gene lists in Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">5</xref>) in CD8 + T cells in recently treated (&lt;30 days since initial treatment) samples vs. pre-treatment in both NCT02886585 (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.91 and 0.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both IFN-γ and effector/naïve signatures respectively) and NCT02939300 (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.75 and 1.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both IFN-γ and effector/naïve signatures, <italic>N</italic> = 6,133 CD8 + T cells).

Taken together, these results suggest the onset of either an acute inflammatory response within the CSF to intravenously administered ICI or the infiltration of ICI-activated immune cells to this compartment, which may potentially explain the clinical efficacy of intravenous ICI against LMD in NCT02886585 and NCT02939300<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Acute immune response in CSF subsequent to intravenous ICI and relationship to survival.</title><p><bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> Mean module score for IFN-γ response within samples over time points for lymphoid (<bold>a</bold>), myeloid (<bold>b</bold>), tumor cells (<bold>c</bold>).

For all patients, we assessed the possibility of subclonal tumor heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> by inferring single-cell CNV profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> via clustering in windowed mean expression (WME, see Methods) space. Visualizing these clusters with reduced dimensions, we found little structured CNV heterogeneity within 14 of the 15 evaluable patients (Supplementary Fig. 8). For example, in P029, we observed clusters in gene expression space (primarily attributable to cycling status) but not in inferred CNV space; in other patients (P014, P050, P061), the inferred CNV variation was limited, restricted to only a few loci, or sampled at only one time point. In P043, however, we detected the presence of two distinct copy number profile clusters, which suggested the presence of tumor subclones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Methods). Moreover, the fractional abundance of these two subclones shifted over time, with one clone lowly abundant pre-treatment and monotonically increasing at the expense of the other (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

At post-treatment time points, cells with gene expression profiles correlating more strongly with copy number profiles from the later cfDNA (from P043-4) tended to have lower expression of IFN-γ response related genes while cells with gene expression profiles correlating more strongly with copy number profiles from the earlier cfDNA (from P043-2) tended to have higher expression of IFN-γ response related genes (Theil-Sen slope = −15.9 IFN-γ response/correlation difference for P043-3 and −8.79 IFN-γ response/correlation difference for P043-4).</p>

              <p id="Par20">Here, we have used low-input profiling techniques to perform scRNA-Seq characterization of cell types in the liquid component of the human LMD TME. We catalog the presence of tumor cells, lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells, examining shifts in their abundance and phenotype in conjunction with two clinical trials of ICI efficacy. These highly-resolved data enable further study of LMD- and treatment-associated phenomena that are unique to the CSF both within and across patients.</p>
              <p id="Par21">We calculated statistically significant increases in the abundance and outgrowth of CD8 + T cells in the CSF following ICI administration relative to pre-treatment in NCT02886585. Additionally, we detected higher overall levels of IFN-γ signaling and cytotoxicity in CD8 + T cells post-treatment in both trials. These results suggest that intravenous ICI administration modulates the immune microenvironment in the CSF of a subset of patients in these clinical trials, and that this may have been associated with observed clinical benefit.</p>
              <p id="Par22">We detect suggestive evidence that the magnitude of the initial inflammatory response among malignant cells may have prognostic value, warranting further investigation. Investigation of IFN-γ response and antigen processing signatures in the tumor compartments of patients in these trials reveals a distinct increase across patients immediately following the first ICI dose followed by a steady decrease over time. While this observation is consistent with reports of anti-PD-1 administration in the peripheral blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, it also illustrates a potential limitation in ICI efficacy for LMD. Additionally, these results underscore the importance of sampling time, as well as the value of longitudinal profiling, in scRNA-seq studies of response to therapies, as these responses are liable to exhibit transient transcriptional effects; more time-resolved sampling may be necessary to properly characterize the dynamic phenotypic processes presented here.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Finally, in a particular patient, we note evidence suggesting the existence of subclones that might underlie the transient response to ICI observed in that individual. We use that evidence to propose hypothetical drivers of increased or decreased immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">These results collectively support the findings of Brastianos et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and Brastianos et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>—namely, that ICI shows clinical efficacy in patients with LMD. Additionally, we observe strong compartmental and temporal variation in inflammatory signatures in the post-therapy TME, with significant implications for future study design in LMD and in other cancer types.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Due to the limited input volumes obtainable from clinical CSF samples, we were not able to obtain longitudinal data from all patients at all time points. Moreover, the diversity of the cohort—containing diversity in both primary histology and histological subtype—recommends that follow-up studies control for these factors, so as to confirm whether the biomarkers of response suggested above have clinical utility. Future work with larger cohort sizes, and more frequent longitudinal—as well as multi-site—sampling will enable the characterization of genotypic factors in ICI response in LMD, support comparisons of the effects of multiple vs. single-drug treatments, and further test and refine the prognostic biomarkers suggested in this work.</p>

The LMD cohort was Cohort C of this study. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at 200 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression, death, or grade 3–4 toxicity.

                <p id="Par35">Resuspended CSF cells were profiled using the Seq-Well platform for massively parallel, high-throughput scRNA-seq for low-input clinical samples. A complete description of methods is available online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. A complete list of primers described in Gierahn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> is additionally provided in Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">10</xref>. Briefly, cells from each CSF sample were manually counted (Bal Supply 808CI) and loaded onto one array preloaded with barcoded mRNA capture beads (ChemGenes). All samples retained fewer than 10,000 cells with the exception of two (CSF029-4 &amp; DFCI010-4; ~100,000 cells). Thus, all available cells were loaded onto a single array, except CSF029-4 and DFCI010-4 where ~10,000 cells were loaded. The loaded arrays containing cells and uniquely barcoded oligo-dT beads were then sealed using a polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 0.01 μm, which allows for the exchange of buffers but retains biological molecules confined within each nanowell. Subsequent buffer exchanges facilitated cell lysis, transcript hybridization, and bead recovery before performing reverse transcription <italic>en masse</italic>. Following reverse transcription using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher EP0753) and an Exonuclease I treatment (NewEngland Biolabs M0293L) to remove excess primers, PCR amplification was carried out using KAPA HiFi PCR Mastermix (Kapa Biosystems KK2602) with approximately 2,000 beads per 50 μl reaction volume. Libraries were then pooled into one tube (with the exception of CSF014-4, CSF029-4, CSF046-2, CSF104-1, CSF104-3, and CSF123-4, which were pooled to two tubes) and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) by a 0.6X SPRI followed by a 0.8X SPRI and quantified using Qubit hsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Q32854). The quality of each WTA product was assessed using the Agilent hsD5000 Screen Tape System (Agilent Genomics) with an expected peak ranging between 800 and 1500 bp tailing off to beyond 5000 bp, and a small or non-existent primer peak (~100–200 bp).</p>

Loaded samples ranged from 600 to 2,000 pg of pooled cDNA, depending on the peak distribution of the WTA product for the sample.

In brief, for each Illumina sequencing run, raw sequencing data were converted to demultiplexed FASTQ files using bcl2fastq2 based on Nextera N700 &amp; N500 indices corresponding to individual samples/arrays. Reads were then aligned to hg19 genome using the dropseq_tools v2.1.0 pipeline maintained by the Broad Institute using standard settings. Individual reads were tagged according to the 12-bp barcode sequenced and the 8-bp UMI contained in Read 1 of each fragment. Following alignment, reads were binned onto 12-bp cell barcodes and collapsed by their 8-bp UMI with a hamming distance correction of 1. DGE matrices (genes-by-barcode) for each sample were obtained from quality filtered and mapped reads, with an automatically determined threshold for barcode count.</p>
                <p id="Par38">DGEs from each sample were individually culled and inspected by unsupervised analysis before inclusion into the full analysis by a combination previously described methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Each barcode was initially scored on: (1) average expression of a list of curated housekeeping genes (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and (2) complexity, estimated by the total number of genes detected. All sequenced samples were cut to exclude barcodes with low complexity/housekeeping gene expression (400 gene complexity cutoff, housekeeping gene expression cutoff of 1.6 log<sub>2</sub>(tp10k)). Each sample was then inspected using unsupervised analysis to further identify and curate potential analyzable single cells. Individual arrays were analyzed to determine the extent of cross-cell type gene expression contamination. Minimal cross-cell type gene expression contamination existed between immune subsets, and select barcodes were filtered out according to cross expression of marker genes from other immune subsets. Further restrictive analyses incorporating lowered complexity thresholds and count-based downsampling was performed to control for technical confounders wherever relevant. Following curation, all samples were combined and genes expressed in at least 1% of the remaining barcodes were retained (in the case of WME calculations used in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> we retained genes expressed in at least 0.0875% of remaining barcodes; in the case of WME calculations used in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>, we retained all genes). Consecutive samples from the same patient were combined by assigning zeros to all undetected genes per sample and concatenating columns. miRNA and T cell receptor chain genes were subset and saved before cutting genes to ensure information was not lost.

When comparing scores within a specific subset of cells, AddModuleScore was constructed only over that subset, and recalculated if the subset was further partitioned. Tumor cell scores were calculated both across all patients (to compare pre-treatment and post-treatment time points across patients) and within individual patients (to compare across time points within patients). For specific comparisons of AddModuleScore-derived signatures with large differences in complexity between groups of cells, an upper complexity threshold and count-based downsampling were used to examine the possibility of complexity-confounded effects.

                <title>Inferred CNV analysis of Patient 043</title>
                <p id="Par50">To more accurately infer CNV patterns in high-complexity (complexity &gt; 1000) tumor cells with sub-chromosomal resolution, we group genes into fixed length windows of 200 genes consecutive along the genome, removing from consideration those genes in the uppermost decile of dropout rate, as well as all immunoglobulin genes. All possible windows were considered where all included genes reside on the same chromosome. We converted the log (TP10k + 1) gene expression profiles to TP10k ones. We then took the mean TP10k expression over genes in a window, neglecting the highest 5 gene expressions in that window. This vector of values is hereafter referred to as the unnormalized Windowed Mean Expression (uWME).</p>
                <p id="Par51">Having identified the malignant cells for each patient, we additionally computed a normalized version of the uWME as follows: the uWME from all patients’ non-malignant cells were averaged for each window across patients. HLA-* and associated genes on the 6p arm exhibited particularly strong hematopoietic expression; therefore, the means of these windows were imputed with the mean (windows) of the mean (patients) WME for all other windows. These values we refer to as the mean non-malignant uWME.</p>
                <p id="Par52">We normalize uWME for malignant cells by dividing the window uWME by the mean non-malignant uWME for each window, hereafter referred to as Windowed Mean Expression (WME).</p>
                <p id="Par53">To reduce possible confounding factors due to experimental or batch effects during subsequent clustering analysis, we converted the WME values in each single cell to ranks, hereafter referred to as the ranked, normalized WME (rWME). PCA and UMAP were performed on the rWME using the first 50 principal components of all tumor cells. In this P043, the UMAP-obtained clustering was concordant with that achieved via agglomerative clustering. To perform this clustering, we used as a distance metric 1-τ<sub>K</sub>, where τ<sub>K</sub> is the Kendall’s т coefficient between the WME of all pairs of cells. Agglomerative clustering was performed with a weighted linkage to obtain four clusters; two clusters contained single cells, and two other clusters contained 128 and 62 cells and were denoted descendant and ascendant respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par54">To support the subclonal hypothesis without relying on either inferred CNV profiles or unsupervised clustering thereof, we performed a supervised comparison of single-cell expression profiles at each time point to both the early and late cfDNA-derived WES copy ratios (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). We calculate the Kendall’s т correlation for all genes’ total copy ratio and single-cell expression, for all single cells. Then we calculate the difference in correlation for all single cells when using total copy ratio from time point 4 (late) vs. time point 2 (early). We observe that CSF043-2 single cells exhibit correlations more similar to WES from time point 2, and that CSF043-4 single cells exhibit correlations more similar to WES from time point 4. At CSF043-3, we observe bimodality in the distribution of the difference of Kendall’s т correlations. Additionally, we observe that single cells derived from post-treatment time points (CSF043-3 and CSF043-4) exhibit anti-correlation between their IFN-γ response score (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and the difference in Kendall’s т correlations between total copy ratios derived from WES at time point 4 vs. time point 2.</p>
                <p id="Par55">We note that the relative populations of the two identified clusters in P043 varied significantly across time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). We plotted, for each gene, the mean purity corrected tCR vs change in the WME between all possible pairs of time points. The purity corrected tCR has the following form:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

                <p id="Par56">This relationship is demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>, showing that the windowed expressional change between these clusters is concordant with the change in WES-derived tCR between any two time points. This concordance is robust to considering only the cells obtained at time point 3 (i.e., the correlated changes in single-cell expression and cfDNA-derived CNV profile cannot be attributed to batch effects confounding the observed scRNA-seq profiles).</p>
                <p id="Par57">Windowed-mean expression results were compared to the InferCNV R package from the Broad Institute, and broad amplifications and deletions were concordant between the two approaches (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a,b</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p id="Par58">Statistical analyses of differential expression were performed using Seurat v2.3.4 implemented in RStudio. All statistical tests of distributions, cluster diversity, and change in representation, etc. were performed using base R packages implemented in RStudio. All statistical tests of gene set enrichment were performed using piano v1.22.0 and implemented in RStudio for all except enrichments of cluster markers for the full dataset, which was implemented in R. All violin plots and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 without modifications to smoothing or density. Boxplot rectangles encompass the 25<sup>th</sup> to 75<sup>th</sup> percentile with outliers as individual points above and below the rectangle. Overlapping genes between IFN response and antigen processing signatures were removed from both before utilization.</p>
                <p id="Par59">As scores followed non-normal distributions as tested for using a Lilliefors normality test, we used a Wilcoxon rank-sum test where indicated for determining statistical significance. For scores in single-cell data, we report effect sizes in addition to statistical significance as an additional metric to capture the magnitude of the effect observed. The calculation was performed as Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> where: effect size <italic>d</italic> = (Mean<sub>1</sub>-Mean<sub>2</sub>)/(s.d. pooled). In Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, the calculation of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was modified to <italic>d</italic><sub>pair </sub>= (Mean<sub>1</sub>-Mean<sub>2</sub>)/(s.d.<sub>2</sub>), where the difference in means is normalized by the standard deviation of the pre-treatment group. All <italic>p</italic>-values subject to the multiple comparisons problem (such as marker identification by differential expression) were adjusted by Bonferroni correction. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were calculated via the R command wilcox.test. Related Student’s t-test p-values were computed in python 3.7.7 using the function scipy.stats.ttest_rel from scipy v1.5.4. Theil-Sen slopes were computed in python 3.7.7 using the function scipy.stats.theilslopes from scipy v1.5.4. Kendall-tau correlations and associated p-values were computed using the function scipy.stats.kendalltau from scipy v1.5.4.</p>
