                <p id="Par1">The gut microbiome is emerging as a key modulator of human energy balance. Prior studies in humans lacked the environmental and dietary controls and precision required to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of the gut microbiome. Using a Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD) designed to deliver more dietary substrates to the colon and therefore modulate the gut microbiome, we quantified microbial and host contributions to human energy balance in a controlled feeding study with a randomized crossover design in young, healthy, weight stable males and females (NCT02939703). In a metabolic ward where the environment was strictly controlled, we measured energy intake, energy expenditure, and energy output (fecal and urinary). The primary endpoint was the within-participant difference in host metabolizable energy between experimental conditionsÂ [Control, Western Diet (WD) vs. MBD]. The secondary endpoints were enteroendocrine hormones, hunger/satiety, and food intake. Here we show that, compared toÂ the WD, the MBD leads to an additional 116âÂ±â56 kcals (Pâ&lt;â0.0001) lost in feces daily and thus, lower metabolizable energy for the host (89.5âÂ±â0.73%; range 84.2-96.1% on the MBD vs. 95.4âÂ±â0.21%; range 94.1-97.0% on the WD; Pâ&lt;â0.0001) without changes in energy expenditure, hunger/satiety or food intake (Pâ&gt;â0.05). Microbial 16S rRNA gene copy number (a surrogate of biomass) increases (Pâ&lt;â0.0001), beta-diversity changes (whole genome shotgun sequencing; Pâ=â0.02), and fermentation products increase (Pâ&lt;â0.01) on an MBD as compared to a WD along with significant changes in the host enteroendocrine system (Pâ&lt;â0.0001). The substantial interindividual variability in metabolizable energy on the MBD is explained in part by fecal SCFAs and biomass. Our results reveal the complex host-diet-microbiome interplay that modulates energy balance.</p>

The gut microbiome has emerged as a control center for host energy balance through its impacts on energy harvest from food, gut hormones, and signaling through metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Existing data are largely restricted to preclinical models or observational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Prior controlled feeding studies have demonstrated that high-fiber diets are associated with reduced host metabolizable energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and that varying dietary energy load can alter energy harvest efficiency in a way that correlates to phyla in the gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite these advances, studies to date lack a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the contribution of the gut microbiome to the entire energy balance equation, including energy intake, energy expenditure, and fecal energy losses. Prior studies were also insufficiently precise to detect potentially modest differences in the composition of the gut microbiome, which can vary dramatically between individuals, particularly when appropriate environmental controls were not implemented.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To address these critical knowledge gaps, here we describe the results of the intersection of host-diet-gut microbiome factors on human energy balance generatedÂ by performing a controlled feeding study in a metabolic ward using a deep-phenotyping paradigm of quantitative bioenergetics (NCT02939703)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The primary endpoint for the protocol was the within-participant difference in 24-h fecal energy normalized to the total daily energy intake measured during the 6-day calorimetry block within each domiciled diet period. We hypothesized that with the MBD, there would be higher fecal energy (and thus lower host metabolizable energy) due to the greater availability of dietary substrates to the colonic gut microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This hypothesis also was supported by our in silico mathematical model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> that predicted an additional 110âkcals of additional fecal energy loss on the MBD per 2000âkcal consumed as compared to the WD. The principal secondary endpoints tested hypotheses about how diet-inducedÂ changes in the gut microbiota might change enteroendocrine hormone secretion, hunger/satiety, and food intake. These measures were evaluated during the final two days of each domiciled diet period. With this paradigm, we find that delivery of more dietary substrates to the gut microbiome leads to a net negative energy balance that is accompanied by a robust remodeling of gut microbiota composition, diversity and function and changes in host enteroendocrine hormones.</p>

                <p id="Par6">The details of participant flow from enrollment through analysis are detailed in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The intervention implemented in this trial included a highly digestible control Western Diet (WD) and a Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD). The MBD maximized the availability of dietary substrates to the gut microbiome and included four dietary drivers: dietary fiber, resistant starch, large food particle size, and limited processed foods (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Our design provided equivalent dietary metabolizable energy (kcal) and total macronutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates) based on classic principles and equations of food digestibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Diets were prepared in our metabolic kitchen and validated by measuring energy content via chemical analysis. Analysis of intake during the nine domiciled days that provided meals exactly as designed (i.e., excluding an ad libitum feeding day and a gastric emptying test day which required a liquid meal) demonstrated that the diets consumed by study participants delivered the planned energy, macronutrients, and gut microbiome dietary drivers (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par7">To avoid the confounding effects of over- or underfeeding on host and microbial metabolism, we evaluated energy balance by real-time assessment of energy intake (personalized to the energy needs of each participant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>) and energy expenditure (measured via whole-room indirect calorimetry). We found that energy balance was maintained within our target of Â±50âkcals per 6-day calorimeter stay (WD 4.1âÂ±â5.1âkcal/day; MBD 5.4âÂ±â2.8âkcal/day; <italic>P</italic>â=â0.8; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Weight stability was a secondary criterion for evaluating energy balance, and we previously reported that weight was stable during the 6-day calorimetry assessment period whilst the primary endpoint was measured and data were being generated without a link to diet assignment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Surveillance of adverse events revealed minimal gastrointestinal or other side effects that did not differ by diet (Supplementary DataÂ <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

We excluded people with recent antibiotic use or chronic health conditions that were evaluated by medical history, physical exam and standard clinical labs. The study sample was 30.8âÂ±â1.9 years of age, with a BMI within the normal weight to overweight range (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The habitual self-reported free-living intake of total dietary fiber was generally low in our study sample (7.6âg/1000âkcal/day [IQR 6.6, 10.4âg/1000âkcal/day]) on par with a Western diet and representative of adults living in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Free-living intake of macronutrients was similar to those in the study diets (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <title>Diet modulated host metabolizable energy</title>
                <p id="Par10">The overall goal of our study was to modulate the gut microbiome and employ a quantitative paradigm with enough precision to detect within-participant responses to the diet intervention. A key contribution to understanding the role of the gut microbiome on energy balance involves fecal energy. Prior methods lack precision and often provide results as energy per gram of feces, which does not contextualize fecal energy in terms of dietary intake (which we precisely controlled) and makes it difficult to interpret the relationships of fecal energy to host phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To this end, according to the method of Pak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we administered a low, non-laxative dose of non-absorbable non-digestible polyethylene glycol (PEG) with each meal. We measured the PEG concentration in fecal samples to normalize each fecal measurement to 24-h based on expected daily PEG excretion. To quantify fecal energy loss, we used chemical oxygen demand (COD), a measure of electron equivalents in organic carbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and adjusted the result to PEG recovery. COD is typically used for microbial bioenergetics in environmental biotechnology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We previously reported that, for food items, COD correlates highly to the commonly used bomb calorimetry method (<italic>R</italic>Â²â=â0.97)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. COD is a less expensive alternative that provides relevant information for microbial electron balances, and more physiologically relevant measurements since COD does not include the oxidation of ammonia, which humans do not utilize as an electron donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, COD is advantageous because it simultaneously measures electrons available to humans and microbes, thus enabling electron balances to quantify energy flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Based on this (fecal energy as COD adjusted to PEG recovery), the MBD increased mean daily fecal energy losses, compared to the WD, over the six calorimetry days of the domiciled controlled-feeding period (73.0âÂ±â6.1âgCOD/day on MBD vs. 32.1âÂ±â2.5âgCOD/day on WD; <italic>P</italic>â=â2.96 Ã10<sup>â7</sup>; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). When fecal energy loss was adjusted to total energy intake to calculate host metabolizable energy (primary endpoint), we found that it was lower with the MBD (89.5âÂ±â0.73% on the MBD vs. 95.4âÂ±â0.21% on the WD (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; <italic>P</italic>â=â2.73 Ã10<sup>â7</sup>), which equates to an additional 116âÂ±â56âkcals daily channeled to fecesÂ on the MBD vs. the WD (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>; <italic>P</italic>â=â4.95 Ã10<sup>â7</sup>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The microbiome enhancer diet reduced host metabolizable energy.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Daily energy lost by each participant in feces on the WD vs. MBD in grams COD/day (gCOD/day). <bold>b</bold> Host metabolizable energy based on the proportion of fecal COD to dietary intake. <bold>c</bold> Calculated host non-metabolizable energy (kcals).

Although we previously showed that weight was stable within individuals during each domiciled calorimetry period when the diets were consumed in random order<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we uncovered a small, clinically insignificant body weight reduction on both diets during the metabolic ward periods, and the loss was greater on the MBD than on the WD (â625.6âÂ±â196.5âg MBD; â134.4âÂ±â156.1âg WD; <italic>P</italic>â=â0.04; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

This suggests that, under conditions of fixed energy intake, the main quantitative contribution of the gut microbiome to host energy balance was through its effect on energy harvested from the diet, particularly when sufficient substrates were available for microbial fermentation, as with the MBD.</p>
                <p id="Par17">The relationships among diet composition, gut microbes, and colonic transit time (CTT) are complex, multi-directional, and vary within individuals over time and between individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Given the potential importance of CTT on the microbiota-driven host response to dietary manipulations, we evaluated whole-gut transit using a pH-sensing radiotransmitter device. This device has advantages to other methods (such as the use of scintigraphy or radio-opaque markers) including that it is noninvasive, generates pH, temperature and pressure data, provides whole gut and regional data, and importantly, the test is standardized to improve reliability of interindividual and longitudinal assessments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, the assessment was done under conditions of energy balance and with controlled diets that were customized to meet exactly the needs of each participant. This differs from other approaches that have evaluated gut microbiome-CTT interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and is an important advancement given the critical role of diet composition and quantity on both the gut microbiome and CTT. We did not find a statistically significant difference in CTT by diet (29.7âÂ±â4.4âh on MBD vs. 39.2âÂ±â6.2âh on WD; <italic>P</italic>â=â0.14; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Gastric emptying evaluated by acetaminophen appearance in the blood after a fixed liquid meal also was not different by diet (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). The pH of the colon can be an indicator of microbial fermentation activity. Neither the median pH of the entire colon (which reflects both fermentation and the impact of food mixing in the colon) nor the median pH within a 1-h window of the ileocecal passage (which is impacted primarily by microbial fermentation products)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> differed by diet (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.11 and 0.23, respectively; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). The lack of statistically significant effects was likely due to the substantial amount of interindividual variability in CTT, gastric emptying and colonic pH in response to each diet, confirming the complex and individualized relationships between diet and each of these parameters, which may be critical to understanding the host-microbiota axis within individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par18">We hypothesized that the MBD might decrease appetite relative to the WD via the inclusion of high-fiber foods and production of metabolites through gut microbial fermentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. We evaluated this via subjective appetite scores (visual analog scale) and ad libitum food intake (secondary endpoints). This hypothesis was not substantiated by our data (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6câh</xref>). Thus, the observed negative energy balance and minor changes in body composition on the MBD did not trigger a compensatory change in appetitive behaviors or food intake compared to the WD.</p>

However, the regulation of body energy stores involves neural circuits in the hindbrain and hypothalamus, proximal and distal gut hormone secretions and adipose tissue neural and endocrine signals to the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. We explored several potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiome might regulate body weight beyond the observed negative energy balance. On the second-to-last day of each domiciled period, we measured fasting and postprandial levels of several circulating hormones known to regulate appetite at 18 timepoints over 12-h (secondary endpoints). Consistent with the slight, but measurable decrease in body fat stores on the MBD, secretion of the adipose tissue hormone leptin had a significantly lower incremental area under the curve (iAUC) on the MBD (<italic>P</italic>â=â2.39 Ã10<sup>â5</sup>; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).

                <p id="Par20">Given the robust response to our diet intervention by the gut microbiome and host, we sought to determine the quantitative contributions of the gut microbiome to energy balance versus the impact driven solely by food digestibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Host metabolizable energy on the WD showed little interindividual variability (94.1â97.0%; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) since most nutrients were absorbed in the small intestine and were inaccessible to the gut microbiome. However, the range of host metabolizable energy in response to the MBD was much broader (84.2â96.1%; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The range translates to 73â390 non-metabolized kcals/day (vs. 59â185 kcals/day on the WD), a clinically meaningful quantitative difference that could tip the scale towards a greater negative energy balance.</p>
                <p id="Par21">This led us to postulate that the quantitatively important variability in host energy balance could be associated with the repertoire of gut microbes in the colon. To test this, we asked whether the variability in host metabolizable energy on the MBD could be related to a unique microbial signature. To identify those microbial signatures, we derived regression coefficients describing each microbeâs association with the independent variable of host metabolizable energy using MaAsLin2âs compound Poisson regression model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In total, host metabolizable energy was associated with the relative abundance of 16 species (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a, b</xref>). Four of those species had Qâ&lt;â0.05 and effect size â¥2 and have been identified as differentially abundant after weight loss (due to bariatric surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> or caloric restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>) and in bile acid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential role in weight regulation. Our results were not reproducible with an alternative nonparametricÂ method (Kendallâs tau-b correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>; Supplementary DataÂ <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and should be considered hypothesis-generating. Future studies that are designed and powered to explore the microbial species that explain the variability in host ME on the MBD are needed to confirm these results.</p>
                <p id="Par22">We next embarked on a series of mathematical modeling runs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> to estimate the gut microbial contribution to host energy balance. We previously reported that our in silico model estimates the dual impact of host digestion and microbial fermentation on macronutrient uptake in the small and large intestine and ultimately, on host metabolizable energy. The model also estimates the amount of SCFAs absorbed by the host due to microbial fermentation in the colon and the associated biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We applied an updated version of this model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> to predict the host metabolizable energy we measured in our study by inputting actual energy intake components and fecal energy in grams COD/day. Our previously published model used a fixed CTT of 48âh, which is a reasonable population-level estimate for healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. With a fixed CTT, the mean modeled host metabolizable energy for participants on the MBD was 92.4âÂ±â0.001% and for WD was 95.2âÂ±â0.001% (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). This is similar to the mean host metabolizable energy we measured on the MBD and the WD (89.5âÂ±â0.73% and 95.4âÂ±â0.21%, respectively; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). However, the model was biased as evidenced by the linear distribution of the points which estimated essentially the same metabolizable energy for each person in contrast to the variability in the measured metabolizable energy (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) and BlandâAltman plot (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). We hypothesized that we could reduce the modelâs bias by incorporating measured CTT since it is a key modulator of microbial composition, fermentation, and host energy balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Incorporating the measured CTT values reduced bias based on greater reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient: 0.514 with fixed CTT and 0.789 with measured CTT) and accuracy (bias correction factor: 0.645 with fixed CTT and 0.983 with measured CTT; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). Furthermore, systematic and proportional biases were minimized, as shown by a BlandâAltman plot (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that CTT is an important factor for estimating host metabolizable energy.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>The contributions of the gut microbiome to host metabolizable energy.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Concordance correlation coefficient plot between predicted (by modeling) and measured host metabolizable energy (ME) using the same fixed CTT (48âh) for all participants.

Our model predicted that more total energy (g COD) as SCFAs was absorbed by the host on the MBD, compared to the WD (72.3âÂ±â3.2âgCOD/day of microbially-derived SCFAs on the MBD vs. 36.4âÂ±â1.02âgCOD/day on the WD; <italic>P</italic>â=â7.25 Ã10<sup>â9</sup>; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>).

Therefore, despite less total energy being absorbed by the host on the MBD, a larger proportion was derived from SCFAs. Consistent with our experimental data, our model strongly supports a significant microbial contribution to host metabolizable energy and, therefore, the overall energy balance.</p>
                <p id="Par24">The wide interindividual variability in host metabolizable energy in response to the MBD is likely related to a combination of host and microbial factors. We postulated that we would be able to identify key parameters within our study sample that explain a portion of this variability. Thus, we undertook an exploratory, multi-step statistical process to identify potential host and microbial determinants of host metabolizable energy using data from the MBD only. We did so with an aim to consider a limited number of factors given our sample size. Following consideration of 15 potential factors as described in Methods, the final step in this process was a multivariate selection procedure into which one host factor (CTT) and two microbial factors (fecal propionate and biomass) were entered. The selection procedure chose fecal propionate and biomassâboth microbial factorsâfor the final optimized model and revealed that these two variables jointly explain 58% of the variance in host metabolizable energy. According to the final model, each standard deviation (SD) increment in 6-day fecal propionate (858.6âmg) was associated with a 2.1% lower host metabolizable energy (95% CI 0.95, 3.2), while each SD increase in biomass (0.49âlog of 16S rRNAÂ gene copy number) was associated with a 1.6% lower host metabolizable energy (95% CI 0.44, 2.7) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par25">Microbial communities in the gut have a profound impact on mammalian host endocrinology, physiology, and energy balance, with most causal inferences historically restricted to preclinical animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Prior human studies exploring the relationships among the gut microbiome, obesity and energy balance lacked the deep phenotyping, precise methodologies, and rigorous controls that are instrumental for drawing causal inferences with respect to human health. Our central finding was that a diet designed to feed and modulate the colonic gut microbiome, under conditions of fixed energy intake and physical activity, led to reduced metabolizable energy to the host due to increased fecal energy output consisting of undigested food, 16S rRNA gene copy number (a surrogate of fecal bacterial biomass), and microbial metabolites but not to changes in energy expenditure. Thus, the greater fecal energy loss on the MBD was not just due to undigested food, but also to an in increase in fermenting gut microbes and their metabolites. Although higher energy harvest by microbes is believed to lead to more energy being absorbed by the host based primarily on preclinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, our results show the opposite: host metabolizable energy was lower due to higher fecal energy loss on the MBD.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The greater fecal energy loss translated to an additional 116âkcal/day lost in feces when participants were fed the MBD as compared to the WD. The clinical significance of this difference can be inferred from the reduction in food intake needed to maintain a weight-reduced state with obesity pharmacotherapy which has been modeled to be approximately 200âkcal/day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In addition, the cumulative impact over time of a 116âkcal/day energy deficit is in alignment with the population-level impact of âsmall changesâ in energy balance to promote weight loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The direction of change in energy absorbed from the diet by the host (lower on the MBD) was consistent in 16 out of 17 study participants. This means that the gut microbiome of most of our participants had the capacity to utilize available dietary substrates as evidenced by changes in relative abundance of species capable of utilizing those substrates. This observation is contrary to the âextinctionâ hypothesis proposed in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and suggests that, with rigorously controlled dietary conditions that vary markedly in the amount of substrate delivered to the colon with a comparable kcal and total macronutrient profile, healthy humans harbor microbiomes which are adaptable and/or have sufficient functional redundancy to overcome certain extinctions that might be imposed by diet or other factors.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The reduction in host metabolizable energy on the MBD relative to the WD was not accompanied by a change in energy expenditure or an increase in hunger or ad libitum energy intake. However, the significant diet-induced modulation of the gut microbiome was accompanied by a modest change in weight/body composition and robust enteroendocrine signals from the adipose-pancreas-gut axis. Our results support the hypothesis that an intentional remodeling of the gut microbiome through provision of adequate dietary fiber, resistant starch, and a focus on whole, minimally processed foods resets the integrated sensing mechanisms known to affect food intake and body energy stores. One or more of these mechanisms or other unknown mechanisms might be responsible for the associations between a diverse human gut microbiome and lower body mass index in free-living humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Future host-diet-gut microbiome research should delve into the complex and interrelated systems that control body weight.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The quantitative contributions of gut microbes to host energy balance were addressed in two ways. First, the microbial biomass was modeled to contribute to &gt;25% of the total fecal energy on both diets. Second, fermentation increased as evidenced by increased fecal and serum SCFAs on the MBD as compared to the WD. Thus, host energy absorption shifted towards microbially produced SCFAs and away from proximally digested and absorbed nutrients. While the quantitative contribution of microbially generated SCFAs as inputs to host energy balance was negated by the additional loss of microbial biomass in the feces, the uptake of more microbially produced SCFAs was associated with increased total GLP-1 and PP concentrations which may trigger important energy homeostasis signaling cascades to promote satiety and suppress hunger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">We also found a taxonomic signature that was in alignment with the expected impacts of the substrates available to the gut microbes on the two diets. Many of the species detected at higher abundance on the MBD were fiber degraders and/or butyrate producers. We posit that the higher relative abundance of microbes that produce SCFAs could modulate several components of the energy balance equation. For example, <italic>Lachnospira pectinoschiza</italic>, <italic>Eubacterium eligans</italic>, and likely the uncharacterized <italic>Oscillibacter</italic> are butyrate producers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Butyrate plays important roles in host energy balance by stimulating the release of satiety hormones such as GLP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> and accelerating CTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In addition, acetate stimulates the release of satiety hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and acts as a satiety signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Host metabolizable energy was highly variable on the MBD. Given our tight control of energy intake and energy expenditure, this suggests that the microbial contribution to this variability was greater in some hosts than others. Indeed, with a proportionally equivalent input of substrates for microbes, fecal energy losses varied over an ~5-fold range. Next steps should include investigating the mechanisms by which the microbial communities in the human colon modulate energy balance and their interaction with host factors such as CTT, which will provide valuable quantitative data to drive personalized strategies to optimize host-microbiota-diet interactions and prevent or treat obesity.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Our in silico mathematical model, which accurately estimated host metabolizable energy measured in our study, allowed us to predict the quantitative contribution of biomass to fecal energy harvest and the 2-fold greater uptake of microbial derived SCFAs on the MBDÂ than on the WD. In addition, we found that microbial biomass and fecal propionate (a surrogate of colonic fermentation) explained over half of the variance in host metabolizable energy. This further supports our hypothesis that the gut microbiome is an important component of diet modulation of host energy balance. We believe that by optimizing CTT, biomass, and SCFA production through diet, among other factors that may be revealed in future studies, the highly adaptable gut microbiome can serve as a target for personalized medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Our results collectively indicate that when dietary substrates are less available to the gut microbes (as with the WD), the microbes are âstarvedâ of host diet-derived substrates. This is in agreement with the findings from Sonnenberg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The lower 16S rRNA gene copy number on the WD suggests a decrease in microbial biomass due in part to lower fermentable substrate availability to the microbes from the diet. Lower fecal and serum SCFAs on the WD point to lower microbial fermentation, which is an indicator of reduced microbial energy harvest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, the increased relative abundance of mucin degraders on the WD suggests that the microbiota was âstarvedâ of diet-derived substrates and turned to the host-derived energy sources such as mucin. Mouse models have shown that <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>, which normally degrades glycans from plant-based foods, consumes host-derived mucin when diet-derived glycans are not available in sufficient quantitites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Similarly, mucin-degrading bacteria are more abundant in humans on calorie restricted diets or suffering from anorexia nervosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Our study had several limitations that should be considered when interpreting our results. Although our data revealed key gut microbiome contributions to human energy balance, we were unable to deconvolute the complex human host-diet-gut microbiome interactions and therefore, cannot establish whether the changes in energy balance we observed are causally attributable to the diet, the microbes, or some combination. Future directions to address these gaps include implementing bioinformatic pipelines that allow for absolute quantification of microbial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> and the proportion of fecal energy contributed by the gut microbes (vs. undigested food). Additional mechanistic experiments are needed in preclinical models and bioreactors to establish the specific physiological pathways driven by communities of microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, identify systemic lipids, metabolites or proteins that mediate diet-host-microbe interactions, and understand how microbes utilize dietary components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Given the small sample size of our precisely controlled study, selection bias may limit generalizability to other populations. Future studies should confirm and expand our findings in larger study samples. Nonetheless, the randomized crossover design vastly reduces the likelihood of confounder bias and yields outstanding internal validity. Larger studies could enable subgroup analyses to inform whether effect sizes vary by sex or other participant characteristics.</p>
              <p id="Par35">A key open question to advance this field is whether and how obesity or caloric restriction impact diet-gut microbiome effects on human energy balance. Given the size and scope of the global obesity epidemic and its continued increase, new solutions are needed. The scientific community has recently reoriented itself towards population interventions that promote small changes in energy intake and expenditure as a means of preventing weight gain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. This study demonstrates the potential to enact the âsmall changesâ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> principle through the consumption of whole foods to modulate the gut microbiome. Such a simple principle could be a useful population-level tool to fight the global obesity epidemic. Future experiments should focus on the microbial or host mechanisms that underly the observed large inter-individual variability in the response to delivery of greater dietary substrates to the gut microbes. These mechanisms can then be targeted with precision nutrition approaches.</p>

We applied block randomization stratified by sex. The randomization code was generated by the study statistician who worked directly with the study dietitian in charge of assigning menus to participants. Participants were enrolled by the study coordinator. In order to balance sex, we randomly assigned 3 blocks to each sex. Within each block (<italic>n</italic>â=â6), participants were randomly assigned using simple randomization to one of two diet sequences with a 1:1 allocation ratio using SAS PROC PLAN.

To achieve this, the MBD was higher in fiber and resistant starch, which are known substrates for microbial fermentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

One final element of our diets was minimizing processed foods on the MBD, in contrast to the known excess of processed foods in the WD.

                <p id="Par46">Diets were prepared in our metabolic kitchen based on kcals needed to maintain energy balance as determined by whole-room indirect calorimetry. Diets were designed with menu software (ProNutra Version 3.5, Viocare, Inc, Princeton, NJ) that proportionately calculated diets based on each participantâs energy needs. Duplicate meals were prepared during all calorimetry days and evaluated for energy content as a quality-control step (Eurofins, Madison, WI). Nutritional composition of the diets was based on the menu software database (USDA Database Standard ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>), with the exception of resistant starch, because it is absent from all currently available nutritional databases. We limited foods containing resistant starch on the WD and then estimated the content on both diets based on published estimates of resistant starch content of common foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Diets were equivalent in metabolizable energy and proportions of macronutrients. As much as possible, we used similar types of foods on both diets to minimize differences in micronutrients.

Diet adherence was monitored during the 11-day outpatient phase at clinic visits 2 or 3 times per week where at least one meal was consumed on site.

Briefly, COD was measured per manufacturerâs protocol using a reactor digestion method with high-range digestion vials followed by a colorimetric assay (HACH, Loveland, CO; Product # 2125925). To ensure that fecal energy was accurately reflective of 24-hour fecal production, we utilized the non-absorbable, non-digestible fecal marker polyethylene glycol (PEG). Participants consumed 1.5âg/day (0.5âg/meal)Â of PEG of molecular weight 3350âg/mol (PEG3350). The PEG3350 was procured by a compounding pharmacy that prepared 0.5âg capsules (percent errorâ=â2.8%) (Pharmacy Specialists, Altamonte Springs, FL). The details of the PEG assay are below. Fecal energy was measured in 6-day composites of feces collected in our calorimeters. We normalized fecal energy produced to the weight of all feces produced in those 6-days and then to PEG recovery. Fecal energy loss was converted to host metabolizable energy by calculating the percentage of energy that was lost in feces (in g COD) relative to total energy intake (in g COD). The conversion from energy in COD to kcals lost in feces per day (non-metabolizable kcals) was calculated by multiplying total EI in kcals by the percent host metabolizable energy.</p>

                <title>Mathematical modeling</title>
                <p id="Par64">Previously, we developed an in silico multicompartment transit, reaction, and absorption model with these 3 compartments: upper gastrointestinal tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, and the remaining human body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The model estimates human dietary absorption for the general population and humans who had sections of small intestines and large intestines surgically removed. Specifically, the model calculates the host absorption of carbohydrates, protein, and fat in the upper gastrointestinal tract and microbe-derived SCFAs in the lower gastrointestinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For each participant, we had daily and cumulative values for grams of carbohydrates, proteins, fat, total fiber, and resistant starch consumed based on our designed menus. To use this information in our mathematical model, we systematically converted the measurements into gCOD/day of a) Available Sugar and Starch; CHO (g) - Resistant Starch (g) â fibers (g), b) Resistant Starch (RS), c) Non-Starch Polysaccharides (NSP), d) Proteins, and e) Fat. These data were input into the model to estimate host metabolizable energy and compare it to our measured data. We then improved the model by using the measured CTT and evaluated the impact of this change by comparing actual versus modeled data. The performance of the model for estimating host metabolizable energy was evaluated by analyzing concordance correlation coefficient components: bias correction factor (Cb)- accuracy; Pearsonâs correlation coefficient (r) between measured and modeled metabolizable energy- precision; concordance coefficient correlation (Ïc)- precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. We evaluated systematic and proportional bias with a BlandâAltman plot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>. We compared the absolute and proportional SCFA absorption with a paired two-tailed t-test.

                <title>Statistics and reproducibility</title>
                <p id="Par65">Details of the sample size determination have been previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Briefly, our prior modeling experiments predicted a difference of 110âkcal of fecal energy loss (COD g/day) on the MBD vs. WD for a person consuming 2000âkcal/day. Our power analysis was based on prior data on repeated measures of 24-h and sleeping energy expenditure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup> and prior COD measurements where replicate variability was known. Our sample size was adequate to detect a 120âkcal/day difference in energy expenditure and an 80âkcal/day difference in fecal COD. This small sample size was made possible by the repeated measures, precision of our measurements, crossover design, and tight control of diet and environment.</p>
                <p id="Par66">Descriptive statistics for continuous variables are presented as meanâÂ±âstandard error of the mean if normally distributed or as median (interquartile range) if non-normally distributed; categorical variables are shown as counts and percentages.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Appropriate to our randomized crossover design, we used a linear mixed model (SAS PROC MIXED) with diet, period, and sequence as fixed effects and participant as a random effect to compare differences by diet in our primary endpoint (host metabolizable energy: fecal energy loss adjusted to energy intake) and most other secondary and exploratory endpoints. When the distribution of the model residuals was found to deviate considerably from normality, a logarithmic transformation was applied. For each endpoint, we included only participants with complete data for both diet interventions when the data were considered to be missing not at random. Otherwise, no data were excluded from the analyses. Three values that were considered to be missing at random for the enteroendocrine hormone data (one out of 18 serial timepoints over the day was missing for each of three participants due to temporary issues with blood draw or laboratory analysis, but not because the entire sample was missing) were imputed using the interpolation method (i.e., averaging the previous and subsequent values)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>. We imputed the last (+180) timepoint of 6 serial timepoints for one participant for the gastric emptying assay using the last observation carried forward approach, given the relative stability of the +120âmin and +180âmin timepoints (median difference 0.55âng/mL; IQR â0.55, 1.55)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par68">To identify host and microbial determinants of host metabolizable energy, we first constructed a correlation matrix with hypothesis-driven host and microbial factors that might influence the efficiency of dietary energy harvest. We evaluated a total of 15 factors in the following domains: biomass, gut transit time (small intestinal and colonic), ileocecal passage pH, SCFAs (circulating and fecal acetate, propionate, butyrate, total, and acetate to propionate ratio), and total GLP-1. We elected not to include relative microbial abundance data given the inability of a general linear model to appropriately handle zero-inflated data. We eliminated independent variables that were highly correlated to each other and selected only variables with reasonable correlations with host metabolizable energy (<italic>P</italic> valueâ&lt;â0.2 for Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients) for inclusion in a general linear regression variable selection procedure. For variables from same âfamilyâ (e.g., SCFA and microbial species), we selected the variable most highly correlated with host ME. Relevant to our results, fecal acetate and butyrate were highly intercorrelated with propionate. Since propionate had the strongest correlation with host metabolizable energy, it was selected as the representative SCFA. For variables not from the same family (e.g., colonic transit, SCFA), we retained variables unless correlations prohibitively high (i.e., Pearson or Spearmanâs rho â¥0.75). Based on these criteria, from our original list of 15 variables, three variablesÂ (CTT, fecal propionate, and biomass) were included in a stepwise linear regression selection procedure (PROC GLMSELECT in SAS). The selection procedure primarily used <italic>P</italic>Â values to determine which variables should be included or excluded from stepwise models, and the model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup> was chosen as the final model.</p>
                <p id="Par69">Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and R 4.2.2. A <italic>PÂ </italic>value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. When using the false discovery rate (FDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref></sup> to correct for multiple comparisons for differential abundance analysis of gut microbial composition and associations of gut microbes with host metabolizable energy, an FDR <italic>Q</italic>Â valueâ&lt;â0.05 was considered statistically significant. Since inadvertent visualization of the diets could unblind investigators, the study could not be conducted in a blinded manner. However, the treatment assignment was not revealed to investigators and all data were collected and maintained blinded to treatment assignment until the database was locked upon study enrollment completion and statistical analyses were completed.</p>
