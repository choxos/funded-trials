                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>To determine whether <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation is associated with cancer progression during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in CRPC.</p>

                  <title>Patients and methods</title>
                  <p>In a Local CRPC cohort, 42 prostatic specimens were collected from patients who were diagnosed as CRPC and underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). In a metastatic CRPC (Met CRPC) cohort, 12 metastatic biopsies were collected from CRPC patients who would be treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride (Clinical Trial NCT01393730). As controls, 36 benign prostatic specimens were collected from patients undergoing prostate reduction surgery for symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The methylation status of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site(s) at <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter regions was tested.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Compared with benign prostatic tissue, CRPC samples demonstrated higher <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation in the whole promoter region (Local CRPC cohort: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Met CRPC cohort: <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05). In Local CRPC cohort, a higher ratio of methylation was correlated with better OS (R2 = 0.33, <italic>P</italic> = 0.013). Hypermethylation of specific regions (nucleotides -434 to -4 [CpG# -39 to CpG# -2]) was associated with a better OS (11.3±5.8 vs 6.4±4.4 years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and PFS (8.4±5.4 vs 4.5±3.9 years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) with cutoff value of 37.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation was associated with OS independently (whole promoter region: P = 0.035; specific region: <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Our study demonstrate that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation in promoter regions, specifically at CpG# -39 to -2, is significantly associated with better survival for CRPC patients treated with ADT. Recognition of epigenetic modifications of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> may affect the choices and sequence of available therapies for management of CRPC.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Advanced castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) accounts for majority of 31,000 deaths each year in the United States, and prognostic tools that determine patients’ overall survival (OS) are lacking [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Oral inhibitors targeting CYP-17 (by abiraterone) and the androgen receptor (AR) (by enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide) have increased survival in CRPC in phase III studies [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, resistance to AR-directed therapies remains a challenge, which indicates a complexity in the progression from invasive cancer to castration-resistant disease. Persistent AR signaling despite AR-axis inhibition is a critical mechanism of resistance in patients with metastatic CRPC (Met CRPC) [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, a better understanding of the drivers in resistance is needed to develop therapeutic strategies that offer patients long-term clinical benefit.</p>
              <p>Predictive biomarkers identifying CRPC patients who respond optimally to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is of great clinical importance. One mechanism of CRPC development is intratumoral biosynthesis of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from adrenal precursors, which requires three enzymatic steps. 5-α reduction catalyzed by steroid 5-α reductase (SRD5A) is one of the three steps [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. SRD5A has three isoforms, SRD5A1, SRD5A2 and SRD5A3. A recent study demonstrated that the expression of SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 are inversely modulated by AR activation, i.e., <italic>SRD5A1</italic> transcription is activated but <italic>SRD5A2</italic> is repressed, favoring a transcriptional isoform switch that correlates with SRD5A expression patterns in human tumors [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) models, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that SRD5A1 is upregulated in the Met CRPC setting and is directly regulated by androgens [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, patients carrying the more active GG genotype in <italic>SRD5A2</italic> rs523349 exhibited a higher risk of the progression and death, suggesting that high 5α-reductase activity due to <italic>SRD5A2</italic> rs523349 polymorphism may contribute to resistance to ADT in CRPC [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mechanism underlying this transcriptional regulatory switch is still unknown.</p>
              <p>In benign prostatic tissue, expression of SRD5A2 protein is variable and negatively correlated with methylation of the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter. Our recent studies show that 30% of adult prostates without malignancy do not express the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> gene or protein, and that somatic suppression of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> during adulthood is dependent on epigenetic changes associated with methylation of the promoter region of the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we tested <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation of 42 prostatic specimens and 12 metastatic biopsies and found significant hypermethylation of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter region for CRPC compared with benign prostatic specimens. Contrary to common belief that DNA methylation occurs during tumor initiation and progression [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we demonstrated that hypermethylation of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> in the whole promoter region (cytosine-phosphate-guanine [CpG]# -72 to +65) was correlated with better OS and progression free survival (PFS) of CRPC patients, and hypermethylation of promoter subset, CpG sites (CpG # -39 to -2), was best correlated with OS and PFS of CRPC patients. Our study suggests that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation in promoter regions, specifically at CpG# -39 to -2, a condition that favors an estrogenic as opposed to an androgenic milieu in the prostate, is significantly associated with better survival for CRPC patients treated with ADT. Recognition of epigenetic modifications of <italic>SRD5A2</italic>, which affects the prostatic hormonal environment, may affect the choices and sequence of available therapies for management of CRPC.</p>

                <p>With the approval of institutional review board at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a total of 58 CRPC specimens and 36 benign prostatic specimens were used for methylation testing. Written consent was obtained from the study participants for the two cohorts.The Local CRPC cohort patients were diagnosed as CRPC between 2004 and 2013. Forty two formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatic specimens were collected from patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at MGH to relieve patients’ urinary outflow obstruction from locally advanced PCa. All patients had received primary or secondary ADT. Pathology samples were reviewed by an expert genitourinary pathologist (CLW). As controls, 12 frozen benign prostatic specimens were collected from patients who underwent TURP for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) at MGH. The metastatic cohort included 12 metastatic biopsies that were collected from CRPC patients who were treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride (Clinical Trial NCT01393730). For comparison with this cohort, 24 benign prostatic specimens were collected from patients who underwent TURP for symptomatic BPH at MGH.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Continuous variables were reported as the means ± SD. The mean differences of average methylation ratios of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter between CRPC and benign prostatic tissues were compared using the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. A heatmap was generated to compare the average methylation ratios between the two groups and identify the specific promoter regions with the most significant difference. R package “pheatmap” (version 1.0.12, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap</ext-link>; R software 3.6.0) was used to draw the heatmap of methylation sites in the two cohorts, respectively. Those methylation sites were automatically clustered according to the “Euclidean” distance. With a cutoff value of the ratio of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation, CRPC patients were further sub-grouped as <italic>SRD5A2</italic>-hypermethylation group and <italic>SRD5A2</italic>-hypomethylation group. Cutoff values were determined by X-tail software (version 3.6.1; Yale University, New Haven, USA). OS and PFS data of the CRPC patients were retrieved and calculated, then the ratio of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation was correlated to the prognosis of disease with survival curve and correlation analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation in predicting the OS and PFS of CRPC patients receiving ADT were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and tested using the log-rank test. Multivariable analyses were performed, including GS, PSA, and ratio of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation as covariates. A P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistical significance. All the statistical analyses were conducted by R (version 3.5.2; The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and GraphPad Prism (version 7.00; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA).</p>

                <title>Hypermethylation of the SRD5A2 promoter region for CRPC</title>
                <p>Several independent studies have shown that expression of SRD5A1 is increased and SRD5A2 is decreased in the transition from hormone-naive PCa to CRPC [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the mechanism and clinical significance of changes associated with SRD5A2 in CRPC is poorly understood. To explore whether epigenetic changes of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> affects the therapeutic efficacy of ADT, we tested and compared <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation ratios between CRPC and benign prostatic tissues using the NGBS technique. We found that the methylation ratios of main <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter regions were higher for CRPC prostatic tissues compared with benign prostatic tissues in the local CRPC cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To identify methylation in the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> specific promoter region, we performed unsupervised cluster analysis of the ratio of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation on all CpG methylation sites. The CpG methylation sites were clustered into three modules, CpG# -72 to -42; CpG#-40 to -35 / CpG# -31 to -19; CpG# -34 to -32 / CpG# -18 to 65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

                <p>Validating our finding in Met CRPC tissues demonstrated a similar finding as the Local CRPC cohort, i.e., higher methylation ratio of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> for CRPC patients compared with that in the benign control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

As expected, in the local CRPC cohort, a higher methylation ratio was significantly associated with better OS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.038, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) and better PFS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.019, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).

                <p>Furthermore, we expected to find the best promoter regions, which might be more predictive of the outcome of ADT treatment. Among the series of promoter regions, the region located at CpG# -39 to -2 had the most statistically significant value in the Local CRPC cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229754.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Higher methylation of this specific region (nucleotides -434 to -4 [CpG# -39 to CpG# -2]) was associated with better OS (11.3 ± 5.8 vs 6.4 ± 4.4 years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and PFS (8.4 ± 5.4 vs 4.5 ± 3.9 years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) with a cutoff value of 37.9% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229754.s006">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

                <p>Then, we validated our finding using the publicly available TCGA dataset. The data of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation from 502 primary PCa tissues and 50 normal control prostatic tissues were extracted from TCGA. We found that the promoter regions of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> of PCa specimen were significantly hypermethylated compared with normal prostatic tissues (P &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). To compare the expression of SRD5A2, 497 primary PCa tissues and 52 normal prostatic tissues were analyzed, and we found that the expression of SRD5A2 in primary PCa tissues was significantly lower than the normal prostatic tissues (P &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the methylation levels of most sites of the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter were negatively correlated with expression of SRD5A2.

              <p>SRD5A2 is the predominant isoform of 5-α reductase expressed in the prostate, whereas SRD5A1 represents less than 10% of total 5α-reductase levels in normal prostate cells [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In PCa cells, the expression of SRD5A2 decreases, but the expression of SRD5A1 increases [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These two enzymes have been associated with PCa initiation and PCa progression. For instance, studies on polymorphisms in <italic>SRD5A1</italic> and <italic>SRD5A2</italic> have suggested its association with PCa risk and PCa recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, <italic>SRD5A2</italic> rs9282858, the common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism was found not significantly associate with PCa risk [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, further studies are warranted to identify how the epigenetic change of these enzymes effects on PCa. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to analyze the association of epigenetic change of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> with response to ADT for CRPC patients. In contradistinction to widely held assumptions that DNA methylation is correlated with cancer progression, our findings show that hypermethylation in the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter region, specifically CpG# -39 to -2, predicted better OS and PFS for patients with CRPC. The study suggests that quantitative <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation analysis in a pre-treatment biopsy could allow identification of patients most likely to benefit and facilitate tailoring of ADT therapy. For example, PCa patients with <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation may benefit less from intensified AR-directed therapy, or from early addition of docetaxel in castration-sensitive metastatic disease [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Alternatively, patients with <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation may respond differently to androgen signaling inhibitors or targeted therapies toward the estrogen receptor pathway may prove beneficial in this subset of patients.</p>
              <p>Tumor cells can be activated by epigenetic alterations, and further use epigenetic processes to escape from chemotherapy and host immune surveillance. Therefore, targeting the epigenome, including DNA methylation and histone modifications has been a growing emphasis of recent drug discovery [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our study, data from two cohorts demonstrated that there is hypermethylation of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter in CRPC compared with benign prostatic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This result was further confirmed by analyzing TCGA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229754.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Most interestingly, we found that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation in promoter regions, specifically at CpG# -39 to CpG# -2, is significantly associated with better survival for CRPC patients treated with ADT. Being consistent with the study for high-risk gliomas which showed that <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter methylation predicts better survival outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], our finding not only provides evidence that alteration of the epigenome is an important step in cancer progression, but also opens new windows of opportunities in personalized medicine for CRPC patients.</p>
              <p>There are several methods to test for DNA methylation or a CpG island in the promoter region of a single gene. The most widely used methods include pyrosequencing, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and direct Sanger sequencing. In this study we used the tNGBS technique to test the methylation of the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter region, which allowed us to analyze massive quantities of CpG sites for methylation [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While we analyzed methylation of single CpG site in the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter region, our future study will identify whether single CpG site(s) methylation within a CpG island shore of the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> gene contribute(s) to alteration in SRD5A2 expression and subsequent acquisition of treatment resistance.</p>
              <p>Here, we present evidence that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter methylation could be used as a prognostic marker for CRPC patients treated with ADT. An explanation could be that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter hypermethylation causes the absence of SRD5A2 expression, and an androgenic to estrogenic switch in prostate tissue. This hypothesis is supported by our recent studies and others [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In BPH tissues, we showed that the level of estradiol is dramatically elevated in prostatic samples with methylation of the <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter, a condition that favors an estrogenic, as opposed to an androgenic, milieu in the prostate. The phosphorylation of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) in prostatic stroma is upregulated when SRD5A2 expression is absent [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. During PCa initiation, not only androgens but also estrogens are required for malignant transformation [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], suggesting that there is a role for AR/ERα cooperation in androgen targeted therapy resistance. Therefore, combination of treatments targeting both AR and ERα pathways may improve therapies for management of CRPC [<xref rid="pone.0229754.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229754.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Together, we postulate that <italic>SRD5A2</italic> methylation in promoter regions, a condition that favors an estrogenic, as opposed to an androgenic milieu in the prostate, is significantly associated with better survival for CRPC patients treated with ADT. Further studies are warranted to examine whether hormonal interventions play a role in CRPC disease progression and treatment efficiency.</p>

              <p>Methylation of SRD5A2 promoter predicts a better outcome for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Olumi:</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit and my decision is "<bold>Minor Revision"</bold> to fully meet  the PLOS ONE’s publication criteria (as it currently stands). Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Understanding prostate cancer tumor progression mechanism and potential targets for treatment is very important. The 5a-Reductase types 1 and 2, encoded by SRD5A1 and SRD5A2, are key enzymes that catalyze the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, androgen receptor (AR) agonist in prostate cells. 5a-Reductase type 2 is the predominant isoform expressed in the normal prostate. However, its expression decreases during prostate cancer (PCa) progression, whereas SRD5A1 increases, and the mechanism underlying this transcriptional regulatory switch is still unknown. In this research manuscript, Wang, et al  reports that methylation of <italic>SRD5A2</italic> promoter occurs frequently in CRPC patients treated with ADT, and provided  important patient data (from local cohorts and TCGA). Furthermore, authors demonstrated the negative correlation between promoter methylation of SRD5A2 and SRD5A2 expression.</p>

              <p>1. The major strength of the study is the patient data from two cohorts to validate their hypothesis and comparison of findings with the TCGA data. Paper is well written and all the experiments with perfect controls in place.</p>
              <p>2. Authors shall provide explanation about the basis on which CpG methylation sites were clustered into 3 modules, (CpG# -72 to -42; CpG# -40 to -35 and -31 to -19; CpG# -34 to -32 and -18 to 65 in CRPC patients) whereas methylation sites were clustered into 2 modules (CpG# -72 to -35, -31; CpG# -34 to -32 and -30 to 65 in metastatic CRPC cohorts).</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors found any relation between the expression of SRD5A2 and survival in local CRPC patient cohorts, although they have shown through the TCGA data analyzed by MEXPRESS?</p>
              <p>4. In Figure 3, 4 and 5 only 3 H has a value of “r”=0.78 (positive correlation), in other panels, “r” shows weak correlation, would the authors explain why.</p>
              <p>5. In Figure 5 B and C, “r” and “P” values are not shown. Authors shall add the “r” and “P” in figure 5 B and C.</p>
              <p>6. Have authors found any correlation between Androgen Receptor expression and SRD5A2 expression in local patient cohorts?</p>
              <p>7. Authors have used local patent cohorts, please provide a link where data can be accessible if possible as per the PLosOne data sharing policy.</p>

              <p>The present study is a provacative analysis on the methylation status of the SDR5A2 promoter, which encodes an enzyme that metabolizes testosterone to the more potent androgen DHT, in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)( specimens. Although the numbers of specimens analyzed in the present data are relatively small, the findings do show that there is a significant trend for promoter hypermethylation in CRPC specimens compared to benign prostate tissue. Most significantly, the higher ratio of promoter hypermethylation was positively associated with a significant increase in time to progression and patient survival when the patient data was interrogated. Immunohistochemistry analysis of SDR5A2 protein levels inversely correlated with the gene methylation levels, although this data has marked overlap and requires further follow-up. The data were further studied in the TCGA database which supported the primary data in this manuscript. Although the number of metastatic samples was very low in this study (n=12), the data indicate that the SDR5A2 methylation status is likewise able to predict patient survival.  The data are well discussed and fit well into emerging findings regarding the altered hormonal milieu in CRPC that drives androgen resistance.</p>

              <p>1. The paper would be improved by cell-based interrogations that replicate the specimen-based observations and support the conclusions, i.e. modifications of SDR5A2 methylation status change expression of this gene and alter its protein levels as well as steroid metabolism.</p>
              <p>2. At present, the studies are merely correlative and direct studies are warranted. </p>

              <p>comparison of findings with the TCGA data. Paper is well written and all the experiments with perfect</p>
              <p>controls in place.</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for reviewer’s positive comments.</p>
              <p>2. Authors shall provide explanation about the basis on which CpG methylation sites were clustered</p>
              <p>into 3 modules, (CpG# -72 to -42; CpG# -40 to -35 and -31 to -19; CpG# -34 to -32 and -18 to 65 in</p>
              <p>CRPC patients) whereas methylation sites were clustered into 2 modules (CpG# -72 to -35, -31; CpG#</p>
              <p>-34 to -32 and -30 to 65 in metastatic CRPC cohorts).</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for this suggestion. In the section of Statistical Analysis, we explained: R</p>
              <p>package “pheatmap” which was used to draw the heatmap of methylation sites in the two</p>
              <p>cohorts, respectively. Those methylation sites were automatically clustered according to the</p>
              <p>“Euclidean” distance.</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors found any relation between the expression of SRD5A2 and survival in local CRPC</p>
              <p>patient cohorts, although they have shown through the TCGA data analyzed by MEXPRESS?</p>
              <p>Response: Our two cohorts include patients with metastatic CRPC. As a result, we have</p>
              <p>focused our study on the methylation of SRD5A2 promoter and survival in patients with</p>
              <p>metastatic CRPC. To address the reviewer’s concern, as mentioned by the reviewer, we utilized</p>
              <p>the TCGA data to assess SRD5A2’s promoter methylation. In the near future studies, we plan to</p>
              <p>evaluate if the expression of SRD5A2 is associated with survival of localized CRPC patients.</p>
              <p>4. In Figure 3, 4 and 5 only 3H has a value of “r”=0.78 (positive correlation), in other panels, “r” shows</p>
              <p>weak correlation, would the authors explain why.</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for this careful review. In Figure 3, 4 and 5, the majority of analyses showed</p>
              <p>the significant correlations (P&lt;0.05), which are consistent with the Kaplan Meier survival curve.</p>
              <p>The low R value might be caused by the small number of subjects.</p>
              <p>5. In Figure 5 B and C, “r” and “P” values are not shown. Authors shall add the “r” and “P” in figure 5 B</p>
              <p>and C.</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for this suggestion. The “r” and “P” values in figure 5 B and C have been</p>
              <p>added.</p>
              <p>6. Have authors found any correlation between Androgen Receptor expression and SRD5A2</p>
              <p>expression in local patient cohorts?</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for this question. At this moment, we did not evaluate the correlation</p>
              <p>between AR and SRD5A2 expression.</p>
              <p>7. Authors have used local patient cohorts, please provide a link where data can be accessible if</p>
              <p>possible as per the PLosOne data sharing policy.</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for this suggestion. We have made the raw informatics data accessible</p>

              <p>Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s great suggestion on the mechanism study.</p>
              <p>Utilizing prostate cancer LnCap, DU145 and other cell lines, we are working to</p>
              <p>understand whether and how the modification of SRD5A2 methylation status alters</p>
              <p>steroid metabolism. This suggestion will be part of future publications which is some</p>
              <p>time away.</p>
              <p>2. At present, the studies are merely correlative and direct studies are warranted.</p>
              <p>Response: Again, we thank the reviewer’s for his/her insight. Currently, we are using cultured</p>
              <p>cells to identify whether there is a cause and effect relationship between SRD5A2 methylation</p>
              <p>and better survival for CRPC patients using in-vitro and in-vivo model systems.</p>
