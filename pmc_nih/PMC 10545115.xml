                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Policies to reduce red meat intake are important for mitigating climate change and improving public health. We tested the impact of taxes and warning labels on red meat purchases in the United States. The main study question was, will taxes and warning labels reduce red meat purchases?</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We recruited 3,518 US adults to participate in a shopping task in a naturalistic online grocery store from October 18, 2021 to October 28, 2021. Participants were randomized to one of 4 conditions: control (no tax or warning labels, <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 887), warning labels (health and environmental warning labels appeared next to products containing red meat, <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 891), tax (products containing red meat were subject to a 30% price increase, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 874), or combined warning labels + tax (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 866). We used fractional probit and Poisson regression models to assess the co-primary outcomes, percent, and count of red meat purchases, and linear regression to assess the secondary outcomes of nutrients purchased. Most participants identified as women, consumed red meat 2 or more times per week, and reported doing all of their household’s grocery shopping. The warning, tax, and combined conditions led to lower percent of red meat–containing items purchased, with 39% (95% confidence interval (CI) [38%, 40%]) of control participants’ purchases containing red meat, compared to 36% (95% CI [35%, 37%], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001) of warning participants, 34% (95% CI [33%, 35%], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of tax participants, and 31% (95% CI [30%, 32%], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of combined participants. A similar pattern was observed for count of red meat items. Compared to the control, the combined condition reduced calories purchased (−311.9 kcals, 95% CI [−589.1 kcals, −34.7 kcals], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.027), while the tax (−10.3 g, 95% CI [−18.1 g, −2.5 g], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.01) and combined (−12.7 g, 95% CI [−20.6 g, −4.9 g], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001) conditions reduced saturated fat purchases; no condition affected sodium purchases. Warning labels decreased the perceived healthfulness and environmental sustainability of red meat, while taxes increased perceived cost. The main limitations were that the study differed in sociodemographic characteristics from the US population, and only about 30% to 40% of the US population shops for groceries online.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Red meat consumption negatively impacts both the environment and consumers’ health. Red meat production is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, land clearing, and biodiversity loss, and red meat consumption has been found to increase the risk of several noncommunicable diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The United States is among the world’s top producers of greenhouse gas emissions and top consumers of red meat, with nearly half of Americans consuming red meat on a given day [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, a recent survey found that approximately 70% of Americans are concerned about addressing global climate change [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and another survey found that 40% of Americans were trying to reduce their red meat consumption [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], signaling that implementing population-wide interventions to reduce red meat consumption may be possible.</p>
              <p>Public policies are a critical tool for reducing red meat production and consumption because they can affect entire populations and stimulate changes in supply and demand. The landmark 2019 EAT-<italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic> Commission report noted that a full range of population-level interventions—from “soft” interventions such as consumer awareness campaigns to “hard” interventions such as fiscal measures—will be essential to transform food systems and diets to achieve targets for health and sustainability [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Warning labels and taxes are 2 policies that have been effectively used to reduce consumption of tobacco, sugar-sweetened beverages, and other unhealthy foods [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Modeling studies have found that meat taxes would reduce consumption and lead to reduced mortality and healthcare costs, increased quality of life, and higher productivity [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, one previous study evaluated graphic warning labels on meat products and found that a disgust-eliciting image under the guise of trivia reduced participants’ intention to consume meat compared to an explicit warning label [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Little experimental research, however, has examined how these policies affect purchases of red meat, and to our knowledge, no policies have been implemented to target red meat reduction.</p>
              <p>Empirical data in this area are important because it is unclear whether taxes and warning labels on red meat would have similar effects as they have on other products like sugary drinks, tobacco, and alcohol. In the US, meat is typically consumed as the main part of a meal. Because of its more central role in the American food basket, it is possible that consumers are less likely to view red meat products as “discretionary” or “nonessential” than they would with sugary drinks, and, thus, they may be less likely to change their behavior in response to taxes or labels. On the other hand, relative to sugary drinks, where the majority of Americans are aware of common health harms associated with consumption [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a much smaller proportion are aware of the harms associated with red meat [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This suggests that warning labels that educate consumers about these health and environmental harms may reduce consumption.</p>
              <p>Health behavior and economic theory and research indicate that these policies could lead to reductions in purchases through multiple pathways. Meat taxes reduce consumption by increasing prices and, thus, reducing demand for these products [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Warning labels reduce consumption by increasing attention, helping people understand the healthfulness or the environmental impacts associated with the product, increasing risk perceptions about harms associated with consumption, and changing behavioral intentions, leading to reductions in selecting meat products for purchase [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although prior research suggests that warnings and taxes reduce purchases of products like sugary drinks, tobacco, and alcohol, it is not clear whether these policies will have similar effects on red meat. In the US, meat is typically consumed as the main part of a meal [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because of its more central role in the American food basket, it is possible that consumers are less likely to view red meat products as “discretionary” or “nonessential” than they would with sugary drinks, tobacco, or alcohol, and thus they may be less likely to change their behavior in response to taxes or labels. On the other hand, relative to sugary drinks, where the majority of Americans are aware of common health harms associated with consumption [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a much smaller proportion are aware of the harms associated with red meat [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This suggests that warning labels that educate consumers about health and environmental harms may reduce consumption.</p>
              <p>To address these gaps and inform policymaking, the main study question was, will taxes and warning labels reduce red meat purchases? To address this question, we tested the impact of taxes, warning labels, and taxes combined with warning labels on red meat purchases among US red meat consumers using a randomized controlled trial in a naturalistic online grocery store. Secondary objectives included testing the impact of these policies on nutrient purchases, psychological outcomes, and policy support.</p>

                <p>A convenience sample of 5,533 participants was recruited from October 18, 2021 to October 28, 2021 by CloudResearch (Prime Research Solutions LLC, New York) to complete an online survey and experiment. CloudResearch targeted recruitment to create a sample that approximately represented the US population in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, income, and age. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, currently resided in the US, reported eating red meat at least 1 or more times per week during the last 30 days, and reported typically doing at least half of the grocery shopping for their household (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>).

                <p>After providing online written informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: control (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 887), warning labels (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 891), tax (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 874), or combined (warning labels + tax, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 866). In the control condition, products containing red meat retained their original price and did not display any additional labels on the product page. In the warning labels condition, red meat products had health and environmental warning labels applied next to the product image. In the tax condition, prices of red meat products were raised 30% over the baseline price. In the combined condition, red meat products received both the warning labels and the tax.</p>

                <title>Stimuli</title>
                <p>We developed one health (“WARNING: Eating red meat increases your risk of colon cancer and rectal cancer”) and one environmental (“WARNING: Eating red meat harms the environment”) warning (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). The warning labels were designed based on previous research on warning efficacy [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and nutrient warning labels in effect globally [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

                  <title>Shopping task</title>
                  <p>Participants completed a shopping task in the naturalistic online grocery store. Participants selected items using a predetermined 9-item shopping list: 1 pizza, 1 burrito, burger patties (meat or vegetarian), breakfast sausages (meat or vegetarian), 1 frozen individual meal, 1 loaf of bread, 1 sandwich filling (for example, ham, turkey, or peanut butter), 1 pack of tortillas, and 1 taco filling (for example, steak, chicken, or beans). The shopping list was informed by data on the main sources of red meat consumption in the US [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Participants were informed that their budget was $40, similar to the amount spent by participants during cognitive testing of the store and shopping protocol. To check out of the store, a participant’s shopping basket had to have +/−2 items of the total number of items on the shopping list (i.e., 7 to 11 items). To encourage participants to select products that they would purchase in real life, participants were informed that 10% of participants would be randomly selected to receive the groceries they selected during the shopping task and the remainder of their budget in cash. Around 10% of participants were randomly selected to receive a $40 gift card.</p>
                  <p>After completing the shopping task, participants were directed to a survey to complete a post-shopping questionnaire. All participants were given an incentive paid in points redeemable by CloudResearch for completion of the survey and experiment.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcomes</title>
                  <p>The co-primary outcomes were the count of products that contained red meat and the percent of products in the shopping basket that contained red meat. We hypothesized that, compared to the control condition, both taxes and warnings would lead to reduced purchases of products that contain red meat, and the combination of taxes and warnings would lead to a larger reduction in purchases of products that contain red meat than taxes or warnings alone.</p>

                <sec id="sec018">
                  <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>Secondary behavioral outcomes included the total saturated fat, sodium, and calories purchased, calculated by summing these outcomes across all items in the participants’ basket. We additionally conducted exploratory (not preregistered) analyses examining the weight of red meat items purchased, given that policies designed to reduce purchase of an item can do so by reducing the number of items purchased (as operationalized through the count and percentage outcomes) as well as the size or amount of the item purchased (operationalized through the weight of the product).</p>
                  <p>The study additionally assessed secondary psychological outcomes hypothesized as potential drivers of behavior change. Secondary psychological outcomes were assessed with survey items (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>). All items were assessed on 1 to 5 Likert-type scales, coded as 1 (low) to 5 (high).</p>
                  <p>These outcomes included cognitive elaboration, or how much they thought about health harms, environmental harms, and price, during the shopping task. Next, the survey assessed perceptions of eating red meat in general, including perceived healthfulness, perceived risk of cancer, and perceived environmental harms. The survey additionally examined intentions to reduce consumption.</p>
                  <p>Next, the survey assessed perceptions of specific red meat products (burger patties, pepperoni pizza, and ham luncheon meat, shown in random order). Products were shown as they appeared in the participants’ trial condition (e.g., participants randomized to the tax condition were shown images of the products with their price including the 30% tax). For each product, the survey assessed perceived healthfulness, perceived sustainability (how bad or good for the environment the product is), and perceived cost. We averaged the perceived healthfulness and the perceived sustainability of the burger, pizza, and ham products into 2 single outcomes (perceived healthfulness and perceived sustainability of specific red meat products), as Cronbach’s alpha for these products was greater than 0.7 for both healthfulness and sustainability. However, it was less than 0.7 for the perceived cost of these products, and so these were analyzed as separate outcomes. Reliability of 0.7 is a standard cutoff for demonstrating that items in a scale have sufficient internal consistency [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
                  <p>The survey also assessed support for red meat taxes, health warnings, and environmental warnings. For simplicity of interpretation, we created a binary variable for support for each policy (i.e., responses of “agree” or “strongly agree”). We also examined effects on the lack of support for these policies (i.e., responses of “disagree” or “strongly disagree”).</p>
                  <p>Process measures included whether the participant could easily find all food and beverage items they were looking for, whether there were enough options, whether the store felt like a real online grocery store, and whether the items they selected in the store were similar to their usual grocery purchases. Three additional items assessed interest in health and six additional items assessed interest in sustainability. Items for health and for sustainability were each combined into a scale, except for the item “I do not need to change my diet as it is healthy enough” (which we did not use in subsequent analyses), as it resulted in Cronbach’s alpha for health interest dropping below 0.7.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the survey assessed demographic information including age, gender, race/ethnicity, political affiliation, educational attainment, and household income.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses, hypotheses, and data sharing plan were preregistered on <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT04716010) (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Statistical Analysis Plan</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Study Protocol</xref></bold>). All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata Statistical Software, Release 17 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA). We used two-tailed tests and a significance level of 0.05. We report unadjusted values for the primary, secondary, and other outcomes. Per CONSORT guidelines, we did not test for balance in covariates across conditions [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>Sample size calculations were conducted using PASS 2019 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA). The tax was expected to have a larger effect than the warning label, so the study was powered to detect the main effect of the warning labels. The study was originally powered for an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect a Cohen’s f = 0.05 main effect of the warning labels with 80% power at the 5% level (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 786 per condition). However, we chose to compare individual conditions instead, and post hoc power calculations showed that we had a large enough sample (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 866 to 891 per condition) to detect a Cohen’s d = 0.13 difference between the warnings and control conditions at the 5% level with 80% power. For reference, given the observed mean count and percent of red meat items in the control condition and standard deviations, a Cohen’s f of 0.05 corresponds to effects of approximately 0.25 on the count of red meat items (a 7% difference) and 2.7 percentage points on the percent of red meat items, with similar effects (0.23 and 2.5, respectively) for a Cohen’s d of 0.13.</p>
                <p>We used regression models to assess differences in the outcomes by condition, comparing each of the 3 intervention conditions (warnings only, taxes only, warnings + taxes) to the control condition. We also assessed differences in the primary outcomes between the 3 intervention conditions. We used Poisson and fractional probit regression models for the count and percent of items in the basket that contained red meat, respectively, and linear regression models for the remaining outcomes, with condition as the independent variable. We used robust standard errors in all models except linear regression models where we did not find evidence of heteroskedastic errors based on Breusch–Pagan test assuming independent and identically distributed (IID) errors. Differences between conditions were assessed by comparing the predicted means by condition.</p>
                <p>In order to understand whether taxes and warning labels had a differential effect on red meat purchases for specific sociodemographic subpopulations, we carried out moderation analyses. Specifically, we examined whether intervention effects on the primary outcomes differed by participant characteristics including red meat consumption in the past 30 days, interest in health, interest in sustainability, household income in the last 12 months, education, age, race/ethnicity, political orientation, and gender (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref></bold>). For each of these potential moderators, we fit a Poisson regression model for the count outcome and a fractional probit model for the fractional outcome with condition, the moderator, and their interaction as the independent variables. Using the model estimates, we then estimated the difference between each intervention condition and the control condition at each level of the moderator and tested the hypothesis of equal differences with the control condition across those levels for each intervention condition, examining all pairwise comparisons (e.g., for age, 18 to 39 years versus 40 to 59 years, 18 to 39 years versus 60 years or over, and 40 to 59 years versus 60 years or over). Prior to analyses, we collapsed several moderators to avoid small cell sizes (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref></bold>).</p>
                <p>As preregistered, we carried out sensitivity analyses for the main comparisons on the primary outcomes. Specifically, we repeated the analysis excluding participants in the bottom 2% of total spending, participants who completed the study in less than half the median completion time of 18 minutes and 46 seconds, and participants who purchased less than half of the items on the shopping list, using each product’s department, aisle, and shelf, as well as manual inspection when in doubt, to determine if it was a valid shopping list item. Finally, we examined whether dropping out of the shopping task (i.e., started but did not complete the task) was associated with condition or any of the demographic characteristics collected in the screener and checked the robustness of the results to these associations.</p>

              <p>In the control condition, an average of 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38%, 40%) of the products participants selected contained red meat. Relative to the control group, participants in the warning label, tax, and combined conditions purchased a lower percent of red meat items, 36% (95% CI [35%, 37%], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001), 34% (95% CI [33%, 35%], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 31% (95% CI [30%, 32%], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), respectively (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, Panel A,</bold> and <bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref></bold>). When comparing differences between conditions, participants in the tax condition purchased a lower percentage of products containing red meat than did people in the warning label condition (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.022), and participants in the combined condition purchased a lower percentage of products containing red meat than did participants in either the warning or tax condition (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

              <p>Results for count outcomes followed a similar pattern. Each condition reduced the number of items containing red meat purchased relative to the control. The average count of purchased items containing red meat in the shopping basket for the control condition was 3.5 items (95% CI [3.4 items, 3.6 items]), compared to 3.2 items (95% CI [3.0 items, 3.5 items]) in the warning label condition (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002) and 3.1 items (95% CI [2.8 items, 3.3 items]) in the tax condition (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The combined led to the smallest number of items containing red meat purchased (2.7 items, 95% CI [2.6 items, 2.9 items]) relative to the control, warning label, and tax conditions (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for all 3 comparisons) (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, Panel B,</bold> and <bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
              <p>The impact of the combined condition on red meat purchases was moderated by education and age (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables</bold>). Relative to the control, the combined condition led to fewer red meat purchases for all education levels except those with a graduate degree. For example, among participants who had a high school degree, relative to the control, the combined condition led to an 8.7 percentage point reduction in red meat purchases (95% CI [−11.6 percentage points, −5.7 percentage points]). In contrast, among those with a graduate degree, the combined condition had no impact on red meat purchases. Additionally, relative to the control, the combined condition led to larger reductions in red meat purchases for the youngest age group (−11.0 percentage points, 95% CI [−13.8 percentage points, −8.3 percentage points]) than for the oldest age group (−5.0 percentage points, 95% CI [−8.2 percentage points, −1.8 percentage points]). There was no evidence of moderation for the other conditions or by other variables, and the pattern of moderation results for count of red meat purchases was similar (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables</bold>).</p>
              <p>The conditions also affected secondary behavioral outcomes, with effects varying by nutrient (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Relative to the control, the combined condition led to fewer calories purchased (-311.9 calories, 95% CI [-589.1 calories, -34.7 calories], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.027). Both the tax and combined conditions led to lower saturated fat purchased compared to control (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.01 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001, respectively), as well as reductions in the total weight of products that contain red meat (−321 g, 95% CI [−399 g, −242 g] and −421 g, 95% CI [−501 g, −342 g], respectively, from a baseline of 1,603 g in the control condition). There were no significant impacts on sodium purchased.</p>

              <p>In the control condition, policy support was low for taxes (21.4% of participants in favor and 55.7% against) and higher for health and environmental warning labels on red meat (42.1% and 40.2% of participants in favor and 28.5% and 32.2% against, respectively). Exposure to the tax led to lower support for taxes and higher opposition to taxes. Exposure to the taxes also led to lower support for environmental warning labels and increased opposition to health warning labels. In contrast, exposure to warning labels led to increased support for health and environmental warning labels; there was no effect on support for taxes or opposition for taxes or labels (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004284.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref></bold>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In a randomized trial, we found that both warning labels and a tax led to modest reductions in purchases of items containing red meat. The largest impact came from combining both warnings and the tax, resulting in an approximately 21% to 26% relative reduction of red meat purchases across outcomes. This reduction in purchases of items containing red meat translated into a reduction in calories and saturated fat of the shopping basket, but not sodium.</p>
              <p>Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that taxes and warning labels applied to foods reduce purchases. Although limited research has explored the impact of these policies in the context of environmentally harmful products, our results are in line with nascent evidence that environment-focused fiscal and labelling policies may shift food purchasing behaviors. For example, a recent study by Wolfson and colleagues that found that, among US consumers, climate impact labels—and particularly negatively framed “high-impact” labels—led to an increase in sustainable selections from a fast food menu [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results showed that taxes also reduced red meat purchases and that these reductions were larger than for warnings, albeit by a small margin. These results are in line with a choice experiment conducted in Australia, which reported that price changes had a larger effect on selection of healthy and sustainable food options than did labels or logos [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These results are also in line with economic theory, which suggests that educational interventions alone will be less likely to lead to meaningful reductions in red meat consumption than a tax [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Warnings and taxes alone led to small reductions in red meat purchases, and the combined label and tax condition had the largest impact on red meat purchases. These results are consistent with a recent United Kingdom–based study in a simulated lunchtime canteen, which also found that labeling and taxes were most effective at shifting choice to meals with a lower carbon footprint when used in combination [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A Canadian study of sugar reduction policies also found additive effects on sugar purchases when taxes and front-of-package labels were implemented together [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. One explanation is that these policies operate through distinct and complementary pathways: Warning labels can inform consumers and increase risk appraisals, whereas taxes incentivize consumers to select lower-cost (untaxed) items. Indeed, we also found that warning labels changed perceptions of the healthfulness and sustainability of red meat, whereas taxes influenced perceptions of cost. Together, these results suggest that the US could achieve the greatest public health and environmental impact by implementing warnings and taxes together.</p>
              <p>In addition to reducing red meat purchases, warning labels and taxes also reduced purchases of nutrients. Specifically, the combined tax and warning label condition led to reductions in both total energy and saturated fat, while taxes reduced saturated fat, and no condition impacted sodium. These results highlight the importance of understanding how these interventions affect substitutions across the food basket and ultimately influence the overall nutritional quality of diets. Moreover, a better understanding of substitutions is needed, as net health and environmental effects of policy actions to reduce red meat will vary depending on whether participants substituted to poultry, a plant-based meat alternative, beans, vegetables, or another food. Indeed, a recent simulation study in New Zealand found that while all meat replacement diets were associated with health gains and greenhouse gas reductions, replacement with minimally processed plant-based foods led to greatest benefits for all outcomes relative to ultraprocessed plant food alternatives, cellular meats, or diets based on other recommendations (e.g., EAT-<italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic>) [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Future research will be critical for understanding how to design policies to not only discourage red meat intake but also promote healthy and sustainable substitutions.</p>
              <p>We found that policies may have a differential impact for some subpopulations. For example, the combined tax and warning label condition led to a larger reduction in red meat purchases for younger versus older adults. One possibility is that younger people have greater knowledge of and concern about sustainability issues with regard to food [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and thus are more responsive to policies. We also found some evidence of higher impact in the combined condition for lower-educated populations compared to those with a graduate degree. A recent study found that higher-educated US adults were more likely to report efforts to reduce red meat consumption [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], suggesting those with a graduate degree are already making efforts to reduce and may therefore be less likely to be further influenced by red meat policies. Other research has shown that education is associated with baseline knowledge about the health and environmental harms of eating red meat [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; thus, policies such as warning labels, which seek to increase awareness, may have little impact among highly educated groups. The findings of a greater potential impact among participants with lower education suggests that such policies could promote health equity by leading to greater dietary change in lower educated groups, who tend to suffer a disproportionate burden of diet-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and cancer [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study used both health and environmental warnings in the labeling policy condition, so we were unable to disentangle the effects of the 2 types of warnings. Our previous research has found that health warnings and “combined” warnings that include both health and environmental messages are perceived as more effective than warnings that include only environmental messages [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] suggesting that the health warning may have been responsible for most of the observed reductions in red meat purchases in this study. In contrast, a study in the UK found that nutrition labels (Nutriscore) did not impact the healthfulness of purchases in an online experimental store but that environmentally focused “ecolabels,” either alone or in combination with nutrition labels, improved the sustainability of purchases [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Future research should examine whether health and environmental warnings have a differential impact on purchasing behaviors, and whether either type of warning is more likely to lead to reactance (message rejection) or label fatigue.</p>
              <p>This study has strengths and limitations. One strength was the use of a naturalistic online grocery store designed to mimic a real-world US retailer. The use of these online stores provides a major advantage in that participants can choose from a wide assortment of real products in a setting that looks and feels like a real store. A recent validation study found that expenditures in the naturalistic online grocery store used in this study were moderately-to-strongly correlated with expenditures made in a real online grocery store and that 95% of participants reported making similar purchases in the naturalistic online store as they did in a real online store [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, in this study, it is unclear the extent to which aspects of this experiment (e.g., the use of a prespecified shopping list, lack of financial transactions) may have altered purchasing behaviors and attenuated or amplified the impact of the policies. For example, it is possible that in the real world, where habits, preferences, and other concomitant secular trends could influence consumer response, the effects of the policies could be attenuated. Or, real-world effects could be stronger because people are spending real money.</p>
              <p>In addition, our study sample differed in sociodemographic characteristics from the US population (e.g., our sample included somewhat more women and respondents who identified as non-Hispanic white), though it is unclear whether this was due to the online panel, the fact that we included only meat consumers, or both. A related limitation is that, while online food retail is growing, only about 30% to 40% of Americans shop for groceries online [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is not clear whether online food shopping behavior differs from in-person shopping behaviors, and, thus, it is unclear how generalizable our results are to consumers who do not shop online. Future research could address these limitations by testing these policies in a real-world brick-and-mortar retail setting where participants use their own shopping lists, spend their own money, and can take home products for consumption.</p>
              <p>This study has several public health and policy implications. The results show that taxes and warning labels reduce red meat purchases among red meat consumers, suggesting that adoption and implementation of these policies could yield both health and environmental co-benefits. However, the likelihood of policy adoption is unclear. While several countries in Europe have recently considered adopting meat taxes [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], policy discussions on red meat in the US have been limited. A recent legal analysis found that while public policies to encourage meat reduction are legally feasible in the US, political feasibility is highly uncertain given the economic and political power of meat industry lobbies [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Policymakers may wish to consider the potential benefits to consumers, along with the legal and political feasibility, when weighing regulatory options for reducing intake of red and processed meat. Another barrier to policy adoption is public support: In this study, overall support for both policies was low (&lt;50% of participants), and similar to a previous study [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], support was lower for taxation than labeling. However, some evidence suggests that this barrier could be overcome through different types of messaging about the policy. For example, one study in Germany found that consumers were more likely to support a meat tax if it was justified by animal welfare than by climate change mitigation [<xref rid="pmed.1004284.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Research will be necessary to understand what type of framing or justification is likely to elicit higher support for meat reduction policies in the US.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In a randomized controlled trial using a naturalistic online grocery store, we found that taxes and warning labels reduced purchases of red meat purchases as well as calories and saturated fat. The condition that included both taxes and warning labels had the biggest impact, suggesting this combined approach would achieve the greatest co-benefits for health and environment.</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Notes from the Academic Editor:</p>
              <p>It is an interesting paper on a really important topic. A few comments:</p>
              <p>1. The intro says few studies have been conducted on warning labels and taxes for meat. But there are some and I think it would be appropriate to review this literature briefly in the intro to indicate what's already known on the topic. eg. <ext-link xlink:href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08590-z" ext-link-type="uri">https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08590-z</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204139" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204139</ext-link> Similarly, I'd like to see some of the theory around why these particular interventions - beyond simply that they've been effective in other settings - described here. Some of this is information is already in the discussion, but to my mind it is useful for the reader to have that background when considering this place of this new work as they read through it.</p>
              <p>2. I think the sample is convenience, not purposive. If the latter, they need to be clear what purpose trying to achieve.</p>
              <p>3. Whilst I appreciate the substantial work put into this experimental naturalistic online grocery store, it remains an experimental setting. There is some mild indication in the discussion that behaviour in this may not be generalisable to real-life, but hardly any consideration of this point. It would be great to see some data on how realistic behaviour in this environment is. If that's not available, then that needs to be said. Key issues include: a minority of the population use online grocery shopping regularly so however naturalistic it is, this is not an everyday experience for them; they aren't spending their own money; they aren't responding to their 'normal' grocery shopping needs. For this reason, I find it quite hard to judge how important the findings might be.</p>
              <p>4. In terms of novelty, I'm not sure it's a major advance to show that the effect of taxes and warning labels generalise to foods they haven't explicitly commonly used previously - the paper could justify why they may or may not to help us understand this. But it is an important thing to confirm.</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This study aims to test the impact of taxes and warning labels on red meat purchases in the US.</p>
              <p>Comments:</p>
              <p>"A purposive sample of 5,533 participants was recruited in October 2021 by CloudResearch (Prime Research Solutions LLC, New York) to complete an online survey and experiment. CloudResearch targeted recruitment to create a sample that approximately represented the US population in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, income, and age."</p>
              <p>Can the authors please assess whether the final analysed cohort can be considered to be representative of the wider population, for generalisability of the study findings?</p>
              <p>"After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: control, warning labels, tax, or combined (warning labels + taxes)."</p>
              <p>The authors have followed a rigorous study design, helping to reduce possible sources of bias and confounding in the data and analysis.</p>
              <p>"Participants completed a shopping task in the naturalistic online grocery store. Participants selected items using a pre-determined nine-item shopping list: 1 pizza, 1 burrito, burger patties (meat or vegetarian), breakfast sausages (meat or vegetarian), 1 frozen individual meal, 1 loaf of bread, 1 sandwich filling (for example, ham, turkey, or peanut butter), 1 pack of tortillas, and 1 taco filling (for example, steak, chicken, or beans). The shopping list was informed by data on the main sources of red meat consumption in the United States."</p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>"Participants were informed that their budget was $40"</p>
              <p>The participants completed the task under the same conditions as each other, which helps to reduce potential confounding. However, can the authors please comment on whether this may also restrict the generalisability of the study findings (i.e. the structure of the study means the research question is conditional on the shopping list and budget)?</p>
              <p>"To encourage participants to select products that they would purchase in real life, participants were informed that 10% of participants would be randomly selected to receive the groceries they selected during the shopping task and the remainder of their budget in cash. In reality, 10% of participants were randomly selected to receive a $40 gift card."</p>
              <p>The approach taken by the authors seems sensible, and helps to promote more realistic shopping tendencies of the participants.</p>
              <p>"After completing the shopping task, participants were directed to a survey to complete a post-shopping questionnaire. All participants were given an incentive paid in points redeemable by Cloud Research for completion of the survey and experiment. "</p>
              <p>Can the authors please clarify how many of the shopping participants went on to complete this survey?</p>
              <p>Can the authors please explore whether the particpants of the survey were more likely to be the participants who spent less money on the shop (e.g. were those with a tendency to save money in the shop, more prone to respond to an incentive for participation in the survey)?</p>
              <p>"For policy support outcomes, for simplicity of interpretation, we created a 160 binary variable, 'agree' or 'strongly agree' vs. the remaining three response options ('neither agree nor disagree', 'disagree', and 'strongly disagree')."</p>
              <p>Did the authors consider conducting a sensitivity analysis on this dichotomisation, including 'neither agree nor disagree' in the alternative categorisation for example?</p>
              <p>"Analyses and hypotheses were pre-registered on <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT04716010). "</p>
              <p>Can the authors please supply a copy of the study protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) in the next submission?</p>
              <p>"Per CONSORT guidelines, we did not test for balance in covariates across conditions"</p>
              <p>The authors have suitably provided the completed CONSORT checklist in the supplementary material.</p>
              <p>"The study was originally powered for an ANOVA to detect a Cohen's f=0.05 main effect of the warning labels with 80% power at the 5% level (n=786 per condition). However, we chose to compare individual conditions instead, and post-hoc power calculations showed that we had a large enough sample (n=866 to 891 per condition) to detect a Cohen's d=0.13 difference between the warnings and control conditions at the 5% level with 80% power."</p>
              <p>The authors transparently communicate the basis and amendment to the sample size calculations.</p>
              <p>"We used Poisson and fractional probit regression models for the count and fraction of items in the basket that contained red meat, respectively, and linear regression models for the remaining outcomes, with condition as the independent variable. We used robust standard errors in all models except linear regression models where we did not find evidence of heteroskedastic errors based on Breusch-Pagan test assuming IID errors. Differences between conditions were assessed by comparing the predicted means by condition."</p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>"For each of these potential moderators, we fit a Poisson regression model for the count outcome and a fractional probit model for the fractional outcome with condition, the moderator, and their interaction as the independent variables. "</p>
              <p>The authors have applied technically appropriate statistical methods.</p>
              <p>"Using the model estimates, we then estimated the difference between each intervention condition and the control condition at each level of the moderator and tested the hypothesis of equal differences with the control condition across those levels for each intervention condition, examining all pairwise comparisons (e.g., for age, 18- 39y vs. 40-59y, 18-39y vs. 60y or over, and 40-59y vs. 60y or over)."</p>
              <p>Did the authors consider correcting for multiple comparions here?</p>
              <p>"As pre-registered, we carried out sensitivity analyses for the main comparisons on the primary outcomes. "</p>
              <p>The authors have conducted some insightful additional analyses which help to demonstrate the robustness of the study findings.</p>
              <p>Overall, the Results are presented accurately and the Discussion is well balanced. </p>
              <p>"One limitation of this study is that the intervention focused only on red meat, rather than aiming to reduce both red and processed meat. Because Americans have high consumption of processed meat and consumption of processed meat is linked to an array of adverse health effects, future studies should examine how policies impact both red and processed meat. ... At the same time, it is possible that effects of these policies could be attenuated in the real world, where habits, preferences, and other concomitant secular trends (e.g., price inflation) could influence consumer response." </p>
              <p>Can the authors please expand on the discussion of the study limitations?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper which makes a strong and original contribution to the field. How best to proceed with public health interventions on food and drink consumption is a live issue and this paper provides additional robust evidence on the relative benefits of warning labelling and taxation. This is of relevance to policymakers in particular, but also of interest to clinicians experiencing the downstream effects of (lack of) policy.</p>
              <p>A few comments for consideration by the author:</p>
              <p>Data availability - Please ensure that a DOI or relevant identifier is included for the data files prior to publication.</p>
              <p>Charts - It may be worth using a different signifier for significant differences as bold text is quite difficult to see, at least at the resolution used in the paper.</p>

              <p>Discussion - An additional point that is worth including is the combination of environmental and health warning labels in the study. Future research should separate these out and examine whether either is more effective and whether including more than one has diminishing returns or unintended consequences of creating awareness 'fatigue' (leading to a reduced response).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript describes an experiment to test the impact of taxes and warning labels on red meat purchases in a virtual (naturalistic) online grocery store. The warning label, 30% tax, and combined warning + tax conditions led to modest reductions in red meat-containing items purchased. The randomized controlled trial design is appropriate and reporting of the study methods and findings was clear and complete. Below are suggestions to increase clarity in places:</p>
              <p>Lines 71-72: Secondary objectives included testing the impact of warnings and taxes on psychological measures and support for policies but these were not reported in the abstract. For completeness, I suggest these results are also reported briefly in the abstract.</p>
              <p>Line 79: Can the authors comment on how representative the 13,000 products in their naturalistic online grocery store were of the full range of products stocked by the grocery retailer they set out to mirror? It would be useful to know if they included products from all departments and aisles or just a selection and, if the latter, how selections were made.</p>
              <p>Line 85: A purposive sample of 5533 participants was recruited and intended to represent the US population in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, income, and age. However, only 3518 of these (63.6%) completed the study (line 228). The authors should describe how the final sample differed from the intended sample in terms of key demographics and if the final sample was representative of the US population in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, income, and age. Sample demographics are presented in a table but there is no comment on their representativeness. I note that the overall sample was 60% women, 43% college-educated and 73% white so it seems unlikely that it represents the diversity of the US population. this has implications for the generalisability of the study findings to other population groups.</p>
              <p>Line 157: The authors should explain the significance of Cronbach's alpha being greater or less than 0.7 (and hence why outcomes were combined or analyzed separately).</p>
              <p>Lines 188-194: What is the clinical significance of a Cohen's f = 0.05 or Cohen's d = 0.13? It would be good to relate these statistics to tangible differences in red meat purchases if possible.</p>
              <p>Lines 205-215: Are moderation analyses appropriate when reporting RCT results? The randomized nature of the experiment means personal characteristics should be balanced across groups so I am unsure of the benefit (or indeed appropriateness) of moderation analyses with this study design. They are not usually reported for large public health interventions as far as I am aware.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Taillie,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Impact of taxes and warning labels on red meat purchases in a naturalistic online grocery store: A randomized controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-23-00922R2) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by two reviewers. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by Aug 02 2023 11:59PM.   </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>CT Studies</p>
              <p>Thank you for providing your CONSORT checklist. Please replace the page numbers with paragraph numbers per section (e.g. "Methods, paragraph 1"), since the page numbers of the final published paper may be different from the page numbers in the current manuscript. With my apologies for not having mentioned this in the previous revision round.</p>
              <p>In accordance with ICMJE requirements, PLOS Medicine requires prospective, public</p>
              <p>registration of a data sharing plan (as part of mandatory clinical trials registration) for all</p>
              <p>clinical trials that began enrollment on or after January 1, 2019. Please confirm the registration of a data sharing plan and add link or add as SI. (Thank you for already adding the Statistical Analysis Plan and Study Protocol).</p>
              <p>TITLE</p>
              <p>Please add US or similar to your title to provide the locality context of your study.</p>
              <p>ABSTRACT</p>
              <p>For the abstract, please structure the abstracts along the following 3 headings: Background, Methods and Findings, Conclusions. (Currently there are separate headings for Methods and Findings sections). Please remove all other subheaders.</p>
              <p>Please quote aggregate participant demographic characteristics in the abstract; please quote effect size + 95% CI for the primary outcome(s) - not just a p value. For p values, please report p values as p&lt;0.001 and where higher please provide the exact number e.g. as p=0.002 (in line with the format used throughout the manuscript). </p>
              <p>Overall, please check and ensure you adhere to the CONSORT abstract checklist (for more details see here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort-abstracts/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort-abstracts/</ext-link>). </p>

              <p>AUTHOR’S SUMMARY</p>
              <p>In the final bullet point of ‘What Do These Findings Mean?’, please include the main limitations of the study in non-technical language.</p>
              <p>RESULTS</p>
              <p>E.g see lines 281 - 282: Suggest reporting statistical information as follows for clarity for the reader “…36%; (95% CI [35%,37%] p=0.001), instead of 36% [(35, 37), p=0.001].</p>
              <p>Please provide 95% CIs and p values for all results were appropriate, check and amend throughout.</p>
              <p>Please specify the statistical test used to determine p value.</p>
              <p>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</p>
              <p>Can you please re-check figure 3, error bars look identical (which can be correct but maybe have a look if indeed correct).</p>
              <p>I note that S1 Table.doxc still contains branded images - see Survey measures appendix – Sample images. </p>

              <p>Dear Dr Taillie, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, [AE Name], I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Impact of taxes and warning labels on red meat purchases among US consumers: A randomized controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-23-00922R3) in PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>We have also added a final acceptance request: to remove the brande images from the SI. I checked with our copyright team and while we appreciate you blurred the brand names but the entire packaging is part of the brand image and thus may fall under a license.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>

If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
              <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
