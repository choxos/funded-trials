                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>To end the HIV epidemic in Philadelphia, implementation of evidence-based practices (EBP) to increase viral suppression and retention in HIV care is critical. Managed problem solving (MAPS), an EBP for antiretroviral therapy adherence, follows a problem-solving approach to empower people living with HIV (PWH) to manage their health. To overcome barriers to care experienced by PWH in Philadelphia, the EBP was adapted to include a focus on care retention and delivery by community health workers (CHWs). The adapted intervention is MAPS+. To maximise the clinical impact and reach of the intervention, evaluation of the effectiveness and implementation of MAPS+ is necessary.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This manuscript describes the protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in 10 clinics in Philadelphia. This research incorporates innovative approaches to accomplish three objectives: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW-led MAPS+ intervention to improve viral suppression and retention in care 1 year after the individual implementation period (N=390 participants), (2) to examine the effect of the menu of implementation strategies on reach and implementation cost and (3) to examine processes, mechanisms, and sustainment of the implementation strategies for MAPS+ (N=56 participants). Due to various factors (eg, COVID-19), protocol modifications have occurred.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The institutional review board (IRB) at the city of Philadelphia serves as the primary IRB; initial approval was granted on 21 December 2020. The University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern University executed reliance agreements. A safety monitoring committee comprised experts in implementation science, biostatistics and infectious diseases oversee this study. This research will offer insights into achieving the goals to end the HIV epidemic in Philadelphia as well as implementation efforts of MAPS+ and other behavioural interventions aimed at increasing medication adherence and retention in care. Dissemination will include deliverables (eg, peer-reviewed manuscripts and lay publications) to reach multiple constituents.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services developed the ending the HIV epidemic (EHE) plan to reduce the number of new HIV infections by 90% in the USA by focusing on regions with high HIV prevalence.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Philadelphia (1 of the 48 EHE prioritised counties),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> HIV disproportionately affects individuals from marginalised groups, (eg, black individuals, particularly men who have sex with men).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Multifaceted factors have created barriers to care, which has resulted in poor rates of retention in HIV care and viral suppression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To end the HIV epidemic in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) established the goal of having 95% of people living with HIV (PWH) with evidence of care in the last 5 years achieve viral suppression. To achieve this goal, Philadelphia requires concentrated efforts to implement evidence-based practices.</p>
              <p>Managed problem solving (MAPS) is a low-intensity behavioural intervention endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase viral suppression in PWH.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The intervention consists of four individual sessions during the first 3 months reinforced by ongoing telephone calls during the intervention period of 1 year. Using the problem-solving framework,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the facilitator and participant work together to solve adherence barriers, which empowers individuals to manage their own health. MAPS follows five steps: (1) identifying barriers to adherence, (2) brainstorming to generate potential solutions, (3) decision-making and developing an action plan, (4) implementing the plan and (5) evaluating and modifying the plan. Despite demonstrated effectiveness in increasing adherence to antiretroviral therapy and viral suppression, none of the HIV care sites in Philadelphia were implementing the intervention. To address low adoption, barriers of time and limited capacity of health professionals, the intervention was adapted to restructure the delivery model. Community health workers (CHWs) can serve as a workforce to deliver MAPS to PWH. Task-shifting from healthcare professionals to CHWs has demonstrated success across many contexts, including improving uptake of HIV services, retention in care and cost savings.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In high-income countries, studies have shown an association between CHW involvement in the HIV continuum of care and improvements in viral suppression.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Thus, CHWs can serve as trusted, effective individuals for the delivery of HIV care. The adapted intervention facilitated by CHWs that focuses on both viral suppression and retention in care is termed MAPS+ (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

              <p>To maximise the clinical impact and reach of MAPS+, systematic evaluation of the effectiveness and implementation of the adapted intervention is needed. Hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials facilitate the dual assessment of both clinical and implementation outcomes, thus closing the research-to-practice gap.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This manuscript outlines the protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in 10 clinics in Philadelphia. Overall, this research aims to improve retention in HIV care and viral suppression through successful implementation of MAPS+ among PWH in an EHE prioritised county. To accomplish this goal, this research will pursue the following objectives: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of CHW-led MAPS+ intervention to improve viral suppression and retention in care 1 year after the implementation period, (2) to examine the effect of the implementation strategies on reach and cost and (3) to examine processes (eg, barriers and facilitators) and mechanisms of the implementation strategies for MAPS+.</p>

                <p>Ten clinics in the Philadelphia metropolitan area will be randomised at 9-month intervals (ie, two cohorts comprised four clinics and one cohort comprised two clinics) to receive MAPS+ via simulated restricted randomisation by the research team. The selected clinics include sites that receive funding from the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (ie, sites located in prioritised areas) and provide care to more than 75% of PWH in Philadelphia. The population served mirrors the local and national epidemiologic profiles of PWH. Clinic sizes include: &lt;500 PWH (N=1), 500–1000 PWH (N=2) and &gt;1000 PWH (N=7). Seven of the clinics are affiliated with academic institutions, while the remaining three are community-based clinics. Colocated services include medical case management (10/10 clinics), medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders (9/10 clinics), mental health services (6/10 clinics) and nutritional services (4/10 clinics). Providers include internists, family practitioners, infectious disease specialists, physician assistants and nurse practitioners.</p>
                <p>CHWs will be recruited from diverse sources depending on the existing structure, including referral from clinics, online job postings and a formal CHW certification programme. Eligibility criteria include: (1) share demographic characteristics of the population of PWH in Philadelphia (eg, race/ethnicity, language, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and place of residence), (2) share life experiences regarding exposure to social determinants of health (eg, housing instability, food insecurity and incarceration), (3) possess basic trouble-shooting and communication skills, (4) hold non-stigmatising beliefs towards HIV treatment and care, (5) have prior experience working with marginalised populations or active involvement in the community and (6) have at least a high school diploma or equivalent. Criteria will be assessed through a questionnaire that includes a medical problem-solving measure, a series of interviews and letters of reference. HIV status will not influence eligibility. Selected CHWs will be employed, trained and embedded in clinics in which they will implement MAPS+.</p>

Each clinic will have the autonomy to operationalise the process of accompanying patients to medical appointments based on CHW, patient and staff preferences.</p>

Each strategy was operationalised with specific examples for clinic settings and mapped to relevant behaviour change theories to provide a mechanistic understanding of their function. This process produced a menu of 34 strategies for the implementation of MAPS+, which was supplemented with an additional five strategies through discussions with policymakers for a final list of 39 strategies.</p>

                <p>Adaption of MAPS+ involved task-shifting delivery to CHWs and integrating a focus on retention in care. Therefore, assessment of the effectiveness of MAPS+ is needed. Aim 1 will evaluate the effectiveness of CHW-led MAPS+ intervention to improve viral suppression and retention in care 1 year after the implementation period. The team hypothesises that participants receiving MAPS+ will achieve a higher rate of viral suppression and a higher rate of retention in care compared with treatment as usual.</p>

                  <title>Participants and procedures</title>
                  <p>Participants will include target users (ie, PWH not virally suppressed who are in ongoing care or out-of-care). PWH will be recruited from 10 clinics in Philadelphia participating in Data-to-Care. Data-to-Care is an evidence-based approach used by many public health departments that leverages HIV public health data to identify PWH out of care and in need of intervention.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Eligibility criteria include: (1) documented HIV diagnosis, (2) receiving care at one of the 10 study clinics and (3) not virally suppressed as defined by at least two consecutive HIV viral loads greater than 200 copies/mL. Care status will be determined from an out-of-care list generated by PDPH that includes HIV laboratory surveillance data and clinic appointment data, which is reconciled in monthly meetings at each study clinic. This list will serve as a sampling frame from which CHWs can contact individuals for potential participation.</p>
                  <p>CHWs will recruit potential participants via multiple mechanisms including ad hoc referral from HIV care providers, psychologists and medical case managers. A list of clinic patients lost to care or known to be virally unsuppressed will be used for ‘cold calls’ by CHWs. In addition, CHWs will join clinic conferences for patients lost to care and/or unsuppressed as allowed by local practice. Recruitment will emphasise that MAPS+ is offered as an additional service to all clinic patients. Recruitment will aim to enrol 390 participants. CHWs will administer MAPS+ per protocol. The intervention will consist of four in-person (ie, in clinic) or virtual sessions (ie, via telephone or videoconference), followed by weekly and then monthly check-ins via telephone calls or text messaging. The initial session lasts approximately 60–90 min, with follow-up session durations varying (range: 5–30 min). Strategies to retain participants include sending a reminder text the day before appointments, obtaining emergency contact information for participants and team meetings for CHWs. Ad hoc interactions initiated by participants for new problems that arise or lack of resolution of existing problems for which they want CHW input will be allowed.</p>

                  <p>Given the focus on the effectiveness of MAPS+, the primary outcome variable will be HIV suppression, the biomarker in PWH most strongly associated with protection from morbidity and mortality and prevention of transmission to others. HIV suppression will be defined as &lt;200 copies/mL within 3 months of a participant’s end of enrolment in the trial.</p>
                  <p>A secondary outcome variable will include retention in care. Retention in care will be defined by the measure developed by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which includes (at least one visit with an HIV provider in each 6-month interval of the follow-up year with 60 or more days between clinic visits). Data will be obtained from CAREWare, the electronic database that reports clinical data to PDPH, at the conclusion of a participant’s enrolment in the trial.</p>
                  <p>Multiple exposure variables will be obtained from CAREWare to allow for control of potential confounding variables in the effectiveness analyses. Measures include: age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, HIV history (eg, mode of acquisition and opportunistic infections), HIV treatment history, substance use, presence of comorbid mental health disorders, income and housing information.</p>

Logistic regression models will test the association between MAPS+ exposure (dichotomised as receiving MAPS+ or not) and viral suppression.

In addition, χ<sup>2</sup> tests will evaluate the association between patient sex and reach.</p>
                  <p>Cost analyses will focus on calculating the frequency and duration of the key measures. The cost of each component of the implementation strategy (eg, training activities) will be determined per clinician and site. Calculations will include opportunity cost of clinician time to capture true costs. Analyses will calculate total hours spent, as well as associated costs by actor, action and implementation strategy for comparison to the total implementation cost. Sensitivity analyses will estimate the implementation costs under hypothetical scenarios to evaluate potential cost savings (eg, different frequencies and unit durations of actions).</p>

                <p>This trial will deploy three primary strategies for the delivery of MAPS+. To optimise the effectiveness, efficiency and transportability, it is critical to understand the processes and mechanisms of these implementation strategies (ie, causal pathway between the strategy and outcomes).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Further, production of an implementation blueprint requires particular attention to scalability. Thus, aim 3 will examine processes and mechanisms of the implementation strategies for MAPS+.</p>

                  <p>Interviews will occur concurrently with the trial throughout years two to four to attain better understanding of the implementation process across various stages. To elicit diverse perspectives, 56 individuals will be recruited via email from four stakeholder groups: clinic staff (N=30), CHWs (N=6), PWH (N=15) and HRSA leaders (N=5). Purposive sampling will ensure recruitment across treatment arms and time.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Interviews with HRSA leaders will occur in year four to understand potential scalability at the national level pending effectiveness of the implementation strategies. All participants will provide demographic information before proceeding with the interview.</p>
                  <p>The CFIR will inform the development of a semi-structured interview guide. The CFIR provides a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of implementation determinants.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Interviews will include questions across all five CFIR domains as well as specific mechanisms through which implementation strategies operate (eg, self-efficacy) and sustainability (eg, clinic’s plan to sustain MAPS+ delivery and needed support). All interviews will be conducted in English via phone by a member of the research team trained in qualitative research. Interviews will be audiorecorded and transcribed. Transcripts will be uploaded into NVivo Qualitative Data Analysis Software (QSR International, V.12, 2018) for data management and analysis.</p>

                <p>This trial was registered on ClincalTrials.gov on September 23, 2020 (NCT04560621). The institutional review board (IRB) at the city of Philadelphia serves as the primary IRB (per preference of participating sites), where approval was granted on 21 December 2020 (#2020-59). The University of Pennsylvania executed a reliance agreement on 27 May 2021. Due to change of institution for one of the MPIs, Northwestern University executed a reliance agreement on 24 October 2022 and completed additional administrative review on 6 December 2022. A safety monitoring committee (SMC) comprised experts in implementation science, biostatistics, behavioural interventions and infectious diseases oversee this study. The SMC convened an introductory meeting on 10 May 2021, which will continue twice a year. All participants will provide informed consent before proceeding with enrolment (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental Additional file 3</xref>). All personal information will be kept confidential by the research team. Protocol modifications and adverse events will be reported to the respective IRBs.</p>

Given the valuable insights for both the implementation science and HIV research communities, outputs will target a diverse set of journals. Second, this research will be presented at academic conferences of varying foci. Third, to increase accessibility to the findings, dissemination will also include lay publications (eg, op-eds). Fourth, to expand the reach of this research, the research team will share the findings in multiple presentations, including meetings with leadership at PDPH and meetings with community partners. Fifth, the training manual will be made available for download on a dedicated website.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This research includes multiple innovations. First, adaptation of MAPS+involved task-shifting the intervention to CHWs. Although common in low-income and middle-income countries, task-shifting is not common practice in the USA. Such change in delivery may decrease burden on the clinical team and increase reach of the evidence-based practice to a vulnerable population, thus overcoming the typical implementation-as-usual approach that results in failure. Second, this study will employ a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, a design seldomly used in HIV research.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This approach enables the dual evaluation of clinical and implementation outcomes to close the research-to-practice gap. Third, this research leverages a partnership between the PDPH, health system and research team that will foster sustainability of the work and serve as an example for other cities.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Fourth, this research will pragmatically assess the cost of the implementation approach and explore implementation mechanisms, two emerging topics critical for advancing the field of implementation science.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
              <p>The original protocol contains differences from the procedures reported in this manuscript. Modifications occurred due to several reasons that emerged in the beginning stages of the study. First, the study launched during the COVID-19 pandemic. Protocols required alterations to accommodate infectious disease control procedures, such as space constraints, seating of CHWs in clinics, desire to have less non-essential staff present in clinics and patients’ comfort with telehealth technology. Second, the clinics had preferences on who would lead the process of hiring the CHWs. These different arrangements required meeting with each site individually to tailor the communication and CHW oversight process to the local needs. The process resulted in half of the CHWs being directly employed by the research team (and deployed within the site) and half of the CHWs being directly employed by the clinic (and working with the research team). These differences in implementation will be explored qualitatively. Third, participant recruitment difficulties arose. The original protocol conceptualised the research to be a pragmatic trial (ie, MAPS+ offered as part of standard of care not requiring consent), which proved difficult due to constraints including the requirement by the IRB of record to obtain written informed consent for participation. This has offered challenges in ascertaining reach. These modifications provide valuable insights for implementation research, as issues can arise in clinical trials despite well-planned procedures. Successful completion of the research will likely require additional adjustment.</p>
              <p>This research has the potential to yield multiple public health benefits. If findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a task-shifted behavioural intervention, this work will produce an evidence-based practice that effectively targets two key measures for HIV treatment, adherence and retention in care. The evaluation of implementation processes will identify the best strategies for increasing access to MAPS+. These anticipated outcomes align with multiple EHE pillars.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> By increasing viral suppression through improved medication adherence, the risk of HIV transmission among the population will decrease, which will reduce the incidence of HIV and contribute to EHE in Philadelphia. Insights can be applied beyond the study setting and target intervention. Future efforts can leverage these findings to scale up implementation of MAPS+ in other HRSA-funded clinics, for example. Further, Philadelphia is 1 of the 48 prioritised EHE counties, so this research can inform both local EHE efforts as well as national goals. In addition, this research may demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a task-shifted behavioural intervention, which may serve as a model for other behavior-focused evidence-based practices for HIV treatment.</p>
