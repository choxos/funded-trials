                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>To address challenges with delivery of an evidence-based HIV care coordination program (CCP), the New York City Health Department initiated a CCP redesign. We conducted a site-randomized stepped-wedge trial to evaluate effectiveness of the revised versus the original model.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Setting:</title>
                  <p>The CCP is delivered in New York City hospitals, community health centers, and community-based organizations to people experiencing or at risk for poor HIV outcomes.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>The outcome, timely viral suppression (TVS), was defined as achievement of viral load &lt;200 copies/mL within 4 months among enrollees with unsuppressed viral load (â¥200 copies/mL). Seventeen original-CCP provider agencies were randomized within matched pairs to early (August 2018) or delayed (May 2019) starts of revised-model implementation. Data from 3 periods were examined to compare revised versus original CCP effects on TVS. The primary analysis of the intervention effect applied fully conditional maximum likelihood estimation together with an exact, conditional <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value and an exact test-based 95% CI. We assigned each trial enrollee the implementation level of their site (based on a three-component measure) and tested for association with TVS, adjusting for period and study arm.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Over 3 nine-month periods, 960 individuals were eligible for trial inclusion (intention to treat). The odds ratio of TVS versus no TVS comparing revised with original CCP was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.7). Thus, the revised program yielded slightly lower TVS, although the effect was statistically nonsignificant. TVS was not significantly associated with revised-CCP implementation level.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Program revisions did not increase TVS, irrespective of the implementation level.</p>

              <p>The individual-level and population-level benefits of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) depend on early and consistent medical care and treatment to achieve and maintain viral suppression (VS).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Care coordination and patient navigation interventions have shown some evidence of effectiveness for HIV care and treatment engagement in clinical trials and quasi-experimental evaluations.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In New York City (NYC), a comprehensive care coordination program (CCP) was launched in 2009 using federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funding, which covers an array of medical and supportive services to low-income people with HIV (PWH) in the United States.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> CCP effectiveness findings<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to designate the CCP first as an evidence-informed intervention for retention in HIV care and then as a structural evidence-based intervention for VS.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, a minority of previously unsuppressed CCP clients achieved VS (43%)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or durable VS (21%),<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and some CCP features were identified as implementation barriers: a rigid system of program tracks, a complex reimbursement model, and a requirement for weekly visits over a three-month âinduction period.â<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Of clients enrolled, more than one-third dropped out of the program within 12 months.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In response to the identified barriers,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> intervention literature, and CCP evaluation findings,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> the NYC Health Department and its community partner, the HIV Health and Human Services Planning Council of New York, outlined a set of CCP revisions. These revisions were integrated into the Health Department's late-2017 request for proposals initiating a competitive solicitation for CCP contracts. The request for proposals also outlined plans for an experimental evaluation using contract-level randomization to an early or delayed start of the revised model.</p>
              <p>This article reports on the experimental component<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> of the <underline>P</underline>rogram <underline>R</underline>efinements to <underline>O</underline>ptimize <underline>M</underline>odel <underline>I</underline>mpact and <underline>S</underline>calability based on <underline>E</underline>vidence (PROMISE) study of the revised CCP. The goal of PROMISE is to investigate the impact and implementation of empirically driven course corrections to an already-effective intervention model. Drawing upon an implementation-science framework, we hypothesized that model revisions would reduce service delivery barriers and increase program fidelity and effectiveness. Specifically, we hypothesized that a higher proportion of virally unsuppressed PWH enrolling in the revised CCP would achieve timely VS (TVS), as compared with virally unsuppressed PWH enrolling in the original CCP during the same period. To test this hypothesis, we used a cross-sectional, stepped-wedge design for the rollout of the revised model in previously funded, re-awarded CCP provider agencies.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This study adds to the relatively scarce peer-reviewed literature on an evolving area of practice: structural care interventions addressing barriers to engagement among high-need PWH.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Since its inception, the CCP was designed to meet the full range of clients' medical and social service needs while building HIV self-management skills, through interdisciplinary team-based case management, patient navigation, and structured health education. The navigator was integrated into care team communications/decisions and charged with outreach and regular visits to clients in their preferred locations outside of the program setting. The original-CCP intervention has been previously described<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and packaged in an online toolkit.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> For this trial, the control condition was the site-level continuation of original-CCP delivery, while the intervention condition was a site-level change from original-CCP to revised-CCP delivery. The Health Department maintained study assignments by staggering sites' revised-CCP trainings and contract starts.</p>
                <p>Program revisions affected service elements, modalities, and flexibility of delivery, while leaving core components of the original CCP intact.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Major additions included a training and toolkit for assessment and counseling around client HIV self-management<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>; videoconferencing options for certain services, such as directly observed therapy (DOT); and support for âimmediateâ ART (ART),<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> defined in this program as ART initiation (by PWH not on ART) within 4 days of enrollment. Changes included replacing conditional per-member-per-day reimbursement with a fee-for-service reimbursement model accounting for resource demands, such as staff travel for visits, and offering higher rates for meeting performance standards. Induction period requirements and enrollment tracks were removed in favor of flexibility.

                <p>To assess revised-CCP implementation during the trial, we identified components specific to the revised CCP: SMA (completed within 45 days of enrollment), observation of at least 3 ART doses per week for DOT clients, and adherence to updated program eligibility criteria. The first 2 components had been selected as contract-monitoring performance indicators, with 75% thresholds for success. The third component was selected as a proxy for sites' overall integration of model revisions, with a lower threshold (67%) because available surveillance and vital-statistics data captured most eligibility criteria (recent HIV diagnosis, care or treatment initiation, absences from care, unsuppressed VL, hepatitis-C coinfection, and pregnancy), but could not capture ART regimen change, missed appointments, or provider-assessed risk of care interruption or treatment failure. Using eligibility and services data for the first 5 months (enrollment window) of a given period, we classified each agency as fully implementing (meeting thresholds for all components), partially implementing (not meeting thresholds), or preimplementation (not assigned to revised-CCP delivery, ie, all sites in Period 0 and delayed-implementation sites in Period 1).</p>

                <p>Sensitivity analyses using statistical tests for large-sample approximations (Wald test, score test, and generalized log-likelihood ratio) all gave similar results to the exact conditional approach used in the main analyses and did not alter the inference about revised-CCP effectiveness. In additional analyses, neither period effect differed significantly across paired sites. However, a random-effects meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity in the pair-specific site effects (Ï<sup>2</sup> for homogeneity = 20.8 on 7 degrees of freedom [df], <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004). The estimated summary average of the random site effects was â0.48 corresponding to an OR on TVS (comparing early-implementing versus late-implementing sites, adjusted for period and intervention effects) of 0.62, which is not significantly different from null (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.08).</p>
                <p>We checked whether the overall null intervention effect could be explained by relatively small, homogeneous effects across pairs of sites or large, heterogeneous effects in opposite directions, canceling one another. Although the estimated intervention effects varied from pair to pair, the individual standard errors were large and the Ï<sup>2</sup> homogeneity test statistic was close to its df (Ï<sup>2</sup>=9.0 on 7 df, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.25). We conclude that there is no significant heterogeneity in true intervention effects, and that it is reasonable to summarize the overall intervention effect as reported above.</p>
                <p>We also conducted a partial assessment of the key analytic assumption of no period-by-site interactions within pairs of sites. Such interactions could arise through a variety of causal mechanisms and might facilitate interpretation of the overall trial findings. Although there was weak evidence of such an interaction in Period 2, its impact did not alter the overall conclusions of the primary analysis.</p>

              <title>LIMITATIONS</title>
              <p>A limitation of this trial was its focus on a single, short-term clinical outcome (TVS), which may not capture the revised or original CCP's influence on complex barriers to care and treatment engagement. Our data sources are inadequate to assess outcomes such as patient-provider communication, stress/coping, or ART adherence intention, which might more rapidly shift following program modifications. Within the 4-month follow-up period, we did observe a lower program dropout proportion (8.8% versus 14.6%) in the revised versus original CCP. However, the TVS outcome was selected due to its direct role in preserving health and preventing transmission and the early decision to build this trial around observational data sources, to avoid attrition, interference with service delivery, or unnecessary client burden. The 4-month follow-up period was determined by expectations for TVS with optimal ART access and adherence and the collective investment of program stakeholders in rapidly translating agreed-upon model revisions to real-world practice, which made any greater delay between implementation starts untenable. Statistical power was limited due to the fixed sample size, set by the original-CCP sites re-awarded contracts and the rates at which unsuppressed PWH presented for services during the 3 enrollment windows. Strengths of this trial include the site-randomized, controlled evaluation design and the fully conditional analysis, minimizing bias from self-selection, secular changes in the outcome, or site differences in factors that may influence TVS.</p>

              <title>CONTEXTUALIZATION OF NULL FINDINGS</title>
              <p>The HIV behavioral-intervention literature includes relatively few completed randomized controlled trials comparing one structured intervention with another structured intervention diverging only in certain components or mode of delivery.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Findings of significant outcome differences between such interventions are rare,<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> with some manifesting in the opposite direction from that expected.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> A faith-based adaptation of the evidence-based âSISTAâ HIV prevention intervention stands out in its demonstration of noninferiority for the primary outcome (consistent condom use) and some benefits beyond those of the original intervention,<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> perhaps due to the collaborative redesign process (with a âChurch Advisory Boardâ) and/or the testing of the intervention in the community and congregation to which it was tailored. In a Baltimore randomized controlled trial, an evidence-based case-management intervention (âProject Bridge,â designed for PWH transitioning from incarceration) that was adapted to support PWH on probation/parole showed no outcome benefits over usual care.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The investigators suggest their null results may be tied to unrecognized commonalities between the adapted intervention and âusual careâ in Baltimore.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It is not clear whether our trial's findings reflect a null difference in effectiveness between the revised and original CCP (which has already shown superiority to usual care<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>) or reflect incomplete implementation of revised-CCP components during the trial. Analyses to date have not detected significant implementation variability in relation to the outcome, but our implementation measure may be insufficiently sensitive to such variability. Similarities to the original CCP and data limitations make it difficult to capture unique revised-CCP components, only one of which (SMA) is expected for every client. To avoid measuring implementation based on a single component, we included a rarely used component (DOT) and site adherence to program eligibility criteria, although this meant characterizing trial enrollees' implementation-level exposure based on broader practices at their enrollment site, not based on their individual receipt of revised-CCP components.</p>
              <p>Although we observed no TVS benefit of the revised CCP over the original among unsuppressed enrollees, further research is needed to assess the effects of the revised CCP on the larger pool enrolled, specific subgroups, and additional (including longer-term) outcomes. Ongoing observational analyses of the revised CCP's effects (on 12-month and durable VS) relative to usual care will permit comparison with findings from similar analyses conducted for the original CCP.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>

              <title>INTERPRETATION</title>
              <p>This study's early TVS findings do not support updates to the CCP as previously packaged for replication,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> nor do they suggest a need to roll back revisions made in NYC. Ongoing analyses will determine the extent to which the revisions facilitate reach to PWH who most need assistance or contribute to greater program engagement among PWH and providers. Much of the impetus for the program redesign came from original-CCP providers' reported implementation challenges. If the redesign reduced barriers to delivery or participation (as suggested by the lower dropout rate), without significantly reducing the CCP's short-term clinical benefits, that may be sufficient reason to continue to implement the revised intervention. Further evolution of the revised CCP is also under consideration and will be informed by additional findings from the PROMISE study.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p>
