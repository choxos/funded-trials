                  <p id="Par1">This article describes a study protocol for testing the Measurement Training and Feedback System for Implementation (MTFS-I) and comparing two implementation strategies for MTFS-I delivery. MTFS-I is a web-based treatment quality improvement system designed to increase the delivery of evidence-based interventions for behavioral health problems in routine care settings. This version of MTFS-I focuses on family-based services (FBS) for adolescent substance use. FBS, comprising both family participation in treatment and family therapy technique use, have achieved the strongest evidence base for adolescent substance use and are a prime candidate for upgrading treatment quality in outpatient care. For FBS to fulfill their potential for widespread dissemination, FBS implementation must be bolstered by effective quality procedures that support sustainable delivery in usual care.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Adapted from measurement feedback systems for client outcomes, MTFS-I contains three synergistic components: (a) weekly <italic>reporter training modules</italic> to instruct therapists in reliable post-session self-reporting on FBS utilization; (b) weekly <italic>mock session videos</italic> of FBS interventions (5–8 min) for supportive training in, and practice coding of, high-quality FBS; and (c) monthly feedback reports to therapists and supervisors displaying aggregated data on therapist-reported FBS use. MTFS-I is hosted online and requires approximately 20 min per week to complete. The study will experimentally compare two well-established implementation strategies designed to foster ongoing MTFS-I usage: Core Training, consisting of two 3-h training sessions focused on FBS site mapping, selecting FBS improvement goals, and sustaining MTFS-I, followed by routine remote technical assistance; and Core + Facilitation, which boosts Core Training sessions with collaborative phone-based clinical consultation and on-site facilitation meetings for 1 year to promote FBS goal achievement. The study design is a cluster randomized trial testing Core Training versus Core + Facilitation in ten substance use treatment clinics. Study aims will compare conditions on MTFS-I uptake, FBS delivery (based on therapist-report and observational data), and 1-year client outcomes.</p>

                <title>Increasing the effectiveness and sustainability of family-based services for adolescent substance use via quality improvement systems</title>
                <p id="Par11">Discovering and disseminating effective methods to improve the quality of treatment services for adolescent substance use (ASU) within the national behavioral healthcare system is a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Broadly speaking, ASU treatment quality is considered mediocre to inadequate due to a host of factors headlined by the absence or modest scope of evidence-based services, along with inadequate provider training, lack of reliable quality metrics and quality monitoring procedures, and ineffective system-level policies for supporting quality mandates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To correct these quality deficits, ASU treatment delivery must be supported by effective quality assurance procedures designed to ensure that efficacious treatments are delivered with fidelity, that is, to the intended population, by appropriately trained providers, and in accord with specified principles and procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This includes the need for quality metrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that can reliably measure implementation fidelity in routine settings.</p>
                <p id="Par12">A valuable strategy that can buttress quality delivery of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) is use of “learning” quality improvement systems that promote data-driven decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the behavioral treatment arena, learning systems of this kind consist of treatment quality procedures in which EBI implementation activities are carried out incrementally, implementation and sustainability data are regularly collected and reviewed, and continuous EBI modifications are made to increase fit and/or feasibility (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Learning systems are intended to ingrain data-driven decision-making into the procedural routines of agencies.</p>
                <p id="Par13">One highly promising means to upgrade the quality of the ASU treatment system is increasing the implementation of family-based services. “Family-based” refers to both <italic>family participation</italic> in services, meaning family member involvement in treatment-related activities; and <italic>family therapy techniques</italic>, the specific interventions that clinicians use to target family members and family processes for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Family-based services (FBS) have by far the strongest research base for treating ASU, posting an exemplary record of success in comparison to alternative EBIs as well as usual care, and FBS produce the largest average effect sizes by a wide margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. FBS also have the strongest empirical support for treating adolescent disruptive behavior (i.e., aggression, conduct disorder, delinquency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and many FBS studies report significant reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms as well as gains in prosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. FBS are strongly endorsed by federal agencies, national service provider organizations, policy-making groups, and clinicians who treat youth in routine behavioral care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">The primary implication of these scientific and policy mandates for improving treatment quality is clear: To promote effective implementation of FBS for ASU, pragmatic quality procedures for sustaining high-fidelity FBS need to be developed. This article describes an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study protocol designed to achieve this goal. The protocol is a cluster randomized trial that will test a Measurement Training and Feedback System for Implementation (MTFS-I) to increase delivery of high-quality FBS in ASU treatment settings; the evidence base supporting each component of MTFS-1 is presented in the next sections. The protocol will experimentally compare two research-based implementation strategies for sustaining MTFS-I in clinical practice: Core Training versus Core + Facilitation.</p>

                <title>Measurement: leveraging pragmatic quality metrics via a therapist-report measure of family participation and family therapy technique adherence</title>
                <p id="Par15">Arguably, the first step toward enhancing FBS delivery in routine care is identifying quality metrics that can reliably track FBS fidelity. This study will employ a research-validated measure of FBS fidelity, the <italic>Inventory of Therapy Techniques for Adolescent Behavior Problems</italic> (ITT-ABP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], that assesses both family participation and family therapy techniques. The ITT-ABP (detailed in the “<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods/design</xref>” section) is a therapist-report tool with three significant features. First, it meets key criteria for being a pragmatic measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]: relevance to stakeholders, low burden, broad applicability, strong psychometrics, and useful for data-driven decision-making (i.e., actionable). Second, it measures “core elements” of FBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]: discrete treatment techniques that are common ingredients of multiple manualized family therapy models. Core elements are considered easier to master than full manuals, and they equip clinicians with a diverse portfolio of techniques that can be judiciously applied to clients presenting with comorbid, heterogeneous, and/or emerging clinical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], making them well suited for the eclectic treatment practices that constitute usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Third, as described below, the ITT-ABP is one of few therapist-report fidelity measures in behavioral health to demonstrate promising reliability with gold-standard observational ratings, and it has shown both construct and predictive validity in usual care.</p>

                <title>Training: upgrading therapist-report reliability by mimicking observational coding methods</title>
                <p id="Par16">Training clinicians to reliably self-report about treatment implementation is a pragmatic strategy to enhance fidelity monitoring and ultimately increase EBI delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Unfortunately, studies attempting to show concordance between therapist self-ratings and observer ratings of fidelity have mostly produced disappointing results, casting doubt on whether therapists can reliably rate their own performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This includes research-trained clinicians delivering manualized treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] as well as front-line clinicians in routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par17">MTFS-I contains an innovative <italic>Training</italic> component with the goal of increasing the reliability of therapist-report fidelity tools such as the ITT-ABP. As detailed below, MTFS-I utilizes online training methods to coach community clinicians to be fluent in fidelity self-rating by employing procedures analogous to those used to train observational fidelity raters in controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Gold-standard observational methods, used primarily in research settings to confirm the integrity of experimental treatments, require numerous hours for introducing the coding scheme, reviewing recordings to calibrate scoring, and convening meetings throughout coding activities to prevent coder drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Directly transporting these methods to everyday care—that is, training agency staff on site to reliably assess treatment delivery by their supervisees or colleagues—is beyond the normal resource capacity of most providers. However, some have asserted that by mimicking observational methods, it may be possible to improve the reliability (and hence, utility) of therapist self-reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The approach most likely to succeed is online training, wherein reporter training content can be presented in a pragmatic, user-tailored manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. MTFS-I online training procedures for therapist self-reporting on FBS delivery are described in the “<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods/design</xref>” section.</p>

                <title>Feedback system for implementation: adapting measurement feedback systems to serve as quality procedures for treatment implementation</title>
                <p id="Par18">To allow therapist-report data on FBS delivery to be regularly monitored for quality purposes, MTFS-I embeds therapist reports within a governing learning system adapted from conventional measurement feedback system (MFS) procedures. MFS is a performance feedback loop in which a given quality metric is continuously monitored by the clinician to gauge case progress and support clinical decision-making. MFS feedback loops usually take the form of easy-to-digest data reports providing summary appraisals of individual client progress on quality metrics in comparison to a desired benchmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To date, MFS has been used in behavioral healthcare primarily to monitor client outcomes, wherein the metrics are standardized measures of client functioning—for example, therapists tracking weekly client-report depression scores compared to clinical norms on a validated depression scale. MFS has led to impressive gains in treatment outcomes across diverse clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], including substance users (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). MFS successes for client outcomes have generated enthusiasm about the value of developing complementary procedures for treatment implementation. When attuned to implementation characteristics such as EBI fidelity, MFS can serve as a functional quality procedure with broad dissemination potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par19">MTFS-I expands on conventional MFS by (a) adding <italic>Training</italic> in therapist-report accuracy and (b) focusing on <italic>Implementation</italic> in the form of FBS fidelity. Note that the Training and Feedback components contained in MTFS-I are symbiotic: reporter training is meant to ensure that therapists generate valid data to anchor feedback reports, and feedback reports supply motivational context for dedicated participation in reporter training.</p>

                <title>Enhancing sustainability: applying Core Training and Facilitation strategies to boost MTFS-I implementation in usual care</title>
                <p id="Par20">To implement MFS successfully in behavioral healthcare settings, supportive strategies are needed: conducting on-site MFS training aimed at improving user attitudes and self-efficacy, incentivizing regular MFS use, engaging leadership and identifying local champions to bolster MFS use, and providing technical assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To promote routine uptake of MTFS-I, this study will test two validated implementation strategies for sustaining quality procedures in behavioral care: Core Training versus Core + Facilitation. Core Training, which is based on principles of process improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and typically consists of workshop training followed by ongoing technical assistance, represents the primary implementation strategy used in large-scale innovation diffusion. Facilitation is an additive implementation strategy intended to reinforce core training and foster high-quality sustainability of the innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Both strategies are innovation diffusion approaches that complement quality methods commonly employed in behavioral care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similar implementation interventions have improved service quality outcomes in large substance use treatment systems (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). For the current study, these strategies will be deployed to promote MTFS-I in ASU treatment sites in a manner that is both standardized and tailored to the unique context and self-defined needs of each site, thereby allowing MTFS-I to be scalable across several settings.</p>

Study aim 1 will compare Baseline versus Implementation phases in average FBS delivery (combining across sites). We hypothesize that FBS delivery will be significantly greater during the Implementation phase, following Core Training. Study aim 2 will experimentally test the effects of implementation strategies on FBS delivery. We hypothesize that Core + Facilitation will be superior to Core Training in uptake of MTFS-I components: submission of fidelity data, completion of online training activities, and review of feedback reports. Also, Core + Facilitation will be superior to Core Training in family member involvement in treatment and clinician utilization of family therapy techniques.

                <p id="Par22">The study design is a two-group, parallel cluster randomized trial with baseline comparison: following a 4-month Baseline phase, ten ASU treatment sites will be randomized across two conditions, Core Training versus Core + Facilitation, for a 1-year Implementation phase. Cluster randomized trials are appropriate when interventions are allocated randomly to organizational units (in this case, treatment sites) rather than to individuals to enhance ecological validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For aims 1 and 2, we will collect FBS quality data along with MTFS-I uptake data. For aim 3, we will extract client outcome data from archived state databases for 1-year pre-Implementation (prior to Core Training activities) and 1-year follow-up. In aim 1, by comparing Baseline versus Implementation phases, we can examine the effectiveness of the Core Training strategy for enhancing FBS quality across all study sites, thereby yielding proof-of-concept data in accord with the well-established stage model of behavioral treatment development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

                <p id="Par23">Ten outpatient ASU treatment sites will be purposively sampled to promote site diversity in size and location. Based on these factors, along with data on organizational characteristics of selected sites (see below), we will create yoked pairs for randomization so that each pair is matched as closely as possible (e.g., sites that are both small, rural, and with a single clinical supervisor). Randomization to Core Training or Core + Facilitation will occur after each pair has completed Core Training. State census data indicate that the median annual enrollment across substance use programs serving youth age 13–21 years is about 120. Thus for aim 3 analyses of archived state data, the study will include approximately 1200 clients across ten clinics. For aim 2, we expect to enroll 80 therapists total (8 therapists per site [6 active slots plus 2 to replace dropouts]) treating 480 total cases (60 therapist slots × 8 cases/year) for which ITT-ABP data will be provided. We anticipate that treatment will average ~ 6 sessions/case, yielding 2880 submitted fidelity checklists. For observational fidelity analyses, therapists at each site will submit audio-recorded sessions with consenting families; conservatively, about half of study families (<italic>n</italic> ~ 240) will consent to allow recording, and about half of sessions with completed fidelity checklists will have a companion recording, yielding a final pool of <italic>n</italic> ~ 721 recordings.

We will include Site (census, location, organizational context), Therapist (age, sex, ethnicity, experience, EBI attitudes, family therapy proficiency), and Client (age, sex, race/ethnicity, family composition) factors at their respective levels to examine potential covariance effects. Variables representing adherence to Core Training and adherence to Facilitation will be entered at the Site level to ensure that fidelity differences do not confound experimental comparisons; these factors will also be tested as potential moderator variables. Effect sizes will be calculated using the standardized <italic>d</italic> effect size indicator, interpreted as the standardized difference between contrasts: between Conditions (Core Training vs. Core + Facilitation) and Phase (Baseline vs. Implementation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Aim 1 exploratory contrasts will examine the Phase (within-subjects) effect, contrasting Baseline versus Implementation across all sites in average FBS delivery, as measured by family participation, and family therapy technique use. Aim 2 analyses will experimentally test the effects of implementation strategies (Core Training versus Core + Facilitation) on FBS delivery. Reliability between therapists and observers on the Family Therapy technique scale of the ITT-ABP will be calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient<sub>2,2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]; we expect adequate therapist reliability (coefficients &lt; 0.40) per our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We will compare study conditions on MTFS-I uptake, family participation, and family therapy technique use. Aim 3 analyses will compare conditions on archived client outcomes for the Baseline versus Implementation phases, adjusting alpha for multiple comparisons. Product interaction terms will be included to examine Phase by Condition effects; for significant interactions, we will test simple effects by examining Phase effects separately within condition.</p>

                <title>Key study innovations</title>
                <p id="Par38">This study has several innovations that advance the science of ASU services research. MTFS-I is the first learning quality improvement system created to monitor non-manualized delivery of family therapy for ASU. MTFS-I leverages user-centered online training methods designed to strengthen the fidelity of FBS and also increase the accuracy with which therapists report on their own implementation of FBS. By increasing the capacity of therapists to report on their own FBS delivery, MTFS-I can significantly enhance the practicality and utility of methods for monitoring clinical service quality.</p>
                <p id="Par39">This study operationalizes FBS fidelity as a quality indicator for ASU treatment. Within the evolving behavioral healthcare system, quality indicators are the primary barometers used to assess the appropriateness and potential effectiveness of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Conventional quality indicators capture broad principles of care such as treatment selection, retention and follow-up rates, referrals for ancillary care, and client safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Quality indicators of this kind are important but limited: They can verify only if a given procedure occurred or a service quota was met, and not the degree of treatment fidelity delivered. In addition to tracking family participation in services, the current study also measures session-level extensiveness of treatment techniques as a quality indicator. This movement toward dimensional measurement of service quality in routine care is a top priority for improving quality procedures. For example, dimensional assessment of ASU quality affords greater specification of therapeutic processes; this, in turn, facilitates clinically rich decision-making tailored each client’s unique needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Moreover, this study employs observational methods to verify therapist self-reports of FBS technique use. Observational assessment of treatment practices is roundly needed to support data-driven upgrades to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par40">By focusing on core practice elements of the FBS approach, this study diverges markedly from conventional efforts to disseminate FBS for ASU via manualized family therapy models relying on purveyor-driven quality procedures. The manual-driven strategy has encountered barriers to implementing FBS models in routine care: high consultation costs, limited flexibility for selective treatment planning favored by clinicians, and sustainability limitations due to vicissitudes in local regulatory practices, purveyor commitment, and provider stamina to honor quality procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As previously discussed, the core elements approach can mitigate many of these barriers, and so far it has accumulated an impressive research base in comparison to disorder-specific treatment manuals and usual care for youth mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">That being said, it is critical to note that MTFS-I is not intended to train therapists to implement new EBIs, nor to replace standard clinical training experiences for EBIs already in practice. As described above, MTFS-I focuses on training and feedback for EBIs that are already endorsed by, and perhaps practiced to some degree by, the given site. The goal is to promote more extensive and high-quality use of site-endorsed EBIs. MTFS-I is not designed to introduce frontline clinicians to new treatment approaches or core techniques.</p>

                <title>MTFS-I sustainability</title>
                <p id="Par42">Sustainability of innovations in behavioral treatment is an abiding concern of implementation science. MTFS-I procedures are sustainable beyond a research context only if (a) demands on provider time and resources are modest and (b) providers independently value its benefits and are motivated to utilize it. Regarding provider burden, MTFS-I is anchored by user-centered design features that minimize staff time commitments. The weekly time investment is 20 min for clinical staff for online training, plus another 15 min per week for therapists to enter ITT-ABP data and review feedback reports. These commitments appear feasible given the expected benefits of increased FBS quality. The flexibility of MTFS-I components also promotes their acceptability: Feedback report templates can be tailored to meet the needs of therapists, supervisors, administrators, and/or state agencies; and supervisors have appreciable latitude for how to incorporate report data into supervision meetings. The web-based learning management platform of MTFS-I is highly conducive to dynamic adaptation over time as procedures become routinized within a given agency. Finally, the proposed study is designed to test whether well-established innovation implementation strategies—core training and facilitation—enhance the sustainability of MTFS-I. Again, the time commitment for these quality procedures (six total hours for Core Training, followed weekly phone consultations and quarterly on-site meetings) seems quite favorable given the anticipated boost to the quality and maintenance of MTFS-I implementation.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Regarding provider motivation, there are several direct benefits and strong incentives for ASU treatment clinics to sustain MTFS-I. Our own research on EBIs for ASU in routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] has shown that clinicians are motivated to submit self-report data and engage in discussions related to quality improvement if they believe these activities enhance their clinical knowledge and skillsets and are valued by supervisors and agencies. Also, this study’s collaborative implementation activities will enable us to shape MTFS-I components according to local user needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These motivational processes can heighten provider commitment to adopting MTFS-I procedures, particularly when they are sanctioned by state regulatory agencies in support of government priorities for improved treatment quality and accountability. What is more, quality procedures grounded in pragmatic quality metrics such as the ITT-ABP will likely increase in value to treatment agencies as accountability contracting (e.g., value-based purchasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]) becomes commonplace. Finally, MTFS-I procedures bypass two major obstacles to implement MFS in routine behavioral care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] by (a) providing ongoing and accessible training experiences to all system users and (b) ensuring that feedback data are systematically incorporated into everyday workflow and supervision.</p>
