                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Prospective data on maintenance therapy with bevacizumab for persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-related schwannomatosis (<italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN) is lacking. In this prospective multicenter phase II study, we evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of bevacizumab for maintenance therapy in children and adults with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN and hearing loss due to vestibular schwannomas (VS).</p>

                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Following induction therapy, participants received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 18 months. Participants were monitored for changes in hearing, tumor size, and quality of life (QOL), and for adverse events. Hearing loss was defined as a statistically significant decline in word recognition score (WRS) or pure-tone average compared to the study baseline; tumor growth was defined as &gt;20% increase in volume compared to baseline.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Twenty participants with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN (median age 23.5 years; range, 12.5–62.5 years) with hearing loss in the target ear (median WRS 70%, range 2%–94%) received maintenance bevacizumab. Freedom from hearing loss in the target ear was 95% after 48 weeks, 89% after 72 weeks, and 70% after 98 weeks. Freedom from tumor growth in the target VS was 94% after 48 weeks, 89% after 72 weeks, and 89% after 98 weeks. NF2-related QOL remained stable for 98 weeks whereas tinnitus-related distress decreased. Maintenance bevacizumab was well tolerated, with 3 participants (15%) discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Maintenance bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 3 weeks) is associated with high rates of hearing and tumor stability during 18 months of follow-up. No new unexpected adverse events related to bevacizumab were identified in this population.</p>

              <p>Hearing loss due to vestibular schwannomas (VS) is nearly universal for persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-related schwannomatosis (<italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN, formerly known as neurofibromatosis type 2). Treatment with bevacizumab can improve hearing in many persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN and progressive VS, but prospective data on long-term maintenance therapy are lacking. Here, we report the results of a multicenter phase II study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of bevacizumab for maintenance therapy in children and adults with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN and hearing loss due to VS. We found that maintenance bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was associated with high rates of hearing and tumor stability during 18 months of follow-up. This prospective study validates previously reported retrospective studies using low-dose bevacizumab for maintenance therapy. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal treatment regimen for persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN who respond beyond 2 years.</p>

            <p><italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-related schwannomatosis (<italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN, formerly known as neurofibromatosis type 2<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>) is a rare tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by the presence of multiple benign nervous system tumors including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Hearing loss due to vestibular schwannomas (VS) is nearly universal for persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN. In addition, VS cause tinnitus, vertigo, brainstem compression, and lower cranial nerve dysfunction which independently and collectively impair quality of life (QOL).<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage occur in 30%–40% of persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN and progressive VS treated with bevacizumab, a humanized antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–9</xref></sup> Discontinuation of treatment is associated with a gradual decline in hearing and an increase in tumor size, indicating that long-term maintenance therapy is required to maintain clinical benefit. However, prolonged treatment with bevacizumab is associated with clinically relevant adverse events, including hypertension, proteinuria, menstrual irregularities, and delayed wound healing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Determining the activity and safety of maintenance bevacizumab is important for persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN who are typically young at treatment initiation and are likely to require prolonged treatment.</p>
            <p>Previous clinical trials of <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN patients have provided bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks (or equivalent).<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> This clinical trial (NCT01767792) was designed to address 2 questions regarding treatment with bevacizumab. Induction treatment was provided at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks to determine whether dose intensification could improve hearing responses. In contrast, maintenance therapy was provided at 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks to determine whether dose reduction could minimize toxicity without sacrificing efficacy. Participants who experienced a statistically significant hearing decline during maintenance therapy compared with the study baseline were transitioned to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks to determine if the hearing decline was related to underdosing of bevacizumab. Participants who experienced further hearing decline on bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks discontinued treatment. We previously reported the safety, efficacy, and biomarker results for induction therapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We now report the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab for participants during maintenance therapy.</p>

Key exclusion criteria included prior antiangiogenic therapy, medical conditions incompatible with bevacizumab treatment, and tumors not amenable to volumetric MRI analysis. Participants with stable or improved WRS after 6 months of induction treatment (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) were subsequently treated with maintenance bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 18 months.

                <p>The target VS was assigned by the treating physician. Contralateral VS, if present, were monitored in similar fashion to target VS. Audiology was performed at baseline, every 12 weeks during treatment, and at the end of treatment. WRS, a measure of hearing intelligibility, was assessed using a 50-word list of monosyllable words delivered via standardized methodology.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The 95% critical-difference table was used to determine hearing responses, including hearing improvement, stable hearing, or hearing decline, as previously reported.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Pure-tone average (PTA) was used to assess hearing thresholds, a measure of hearing sensitivity; PTA is measured in decibels with higher levels indicating a greater degree of hearing loss. An increase in PTA of 12 dB or greater was defined as a hearing decline.</p>
                <p>Brain MRI was performed at the study baseline, every 12 weeks during treatment, and at the end of treatment. MRI scans included postcontrast imaging through the internal auditory canal (slice thickness ≤3 mm) and the entire brain. Volumetric analysis was performed centrally by independent radiologists as previously described.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Changes in VS volumes compared with the study baseline were determined for the target and, when present, for contralateral VS ≥ 0.4 ml at baseline. Radiographic response (RR) was defined as ≥20% decrease in tumor volume, progressive disease (PD) as ≥20% increase in tumor volume, and stable disease (SD) as all other results.</p>
                <p>The NF2 Impact on Quality of Life (NFTI-QOL) questionnaire was used to measure NF2-specific QOL.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This validated questionnaire assesses 8 domains including hearing, dizziness and balance, facial weakness, sight, mobility and walking, role and outlook on life, pain, and anxiety and depression. Participants score each domain from 0 (not present) to 3 (stops usual activities). The responses are summed (ranging from 0 to 24), with higher scores indicating worse disease-specific QOL. The psychological distress caused by tinnitus was evaluated using the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ), as previously described.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The TRQ consists of 26 statements such as “my tinnitus has made me unhappy” which participants rate from 0 (not at all) to 4 (almost all of the time). The responses are summed (ranging from 0 to 104), with higher scores indicating more distress related to tinnitus. Participants completed NFTI-QoL and TRQ every 6 months during maintenance therapy. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID) in these scores was defined as previously described.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Bevacizumab is recommended for the treatment of VS in <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN patients by the European Association of Neuro-Oncology.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Two doses of bevacizumab have been approved for cancer treatment by the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency: 2.5 mg/kg/week dose equivalent and 5.0 mg/kg/week dose equivalent.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, guidance on long-term dosing for <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN patients with benign tumors is lacking, and studies of vascular normalization with anti-VEGF drugs suggest that lower doses may improve outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In this phase II trial involving participants with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN and progressive vestibular schwannoma, treatment with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (1.67 mg/kg/week dose equivalent) after induction therapy was effective in preventing hearing decline and tumor growth, in maintaining NF2-related QOL, and in reducing distress related to tinnitus.</p>
              <p>Our findings support those of previously reported retrospective studies of bevacizumab in persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN. Small retrospective studies of persons receiving low-dose bevacizumab during maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 2.5–5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) report freedom from tumor growth in 90%–100% at 1 year and in 63%–88% at 2 years,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> which is equivalent to the 94% and 89% reported in our study and compares favorably with rates of 69% and 36% in newly diagnosed patients enrolled in a natural history study.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> To date, the minimum effective dose of bevacizumab for maintenance therapy has not been determined, and clinicians should choose among the various dosing regimens to best fit an individual patient’s needs.</p>
              <p>A posthoc analysis of clinical outcomes by age revealed important differences. More pediatric participants experienced hearing loss (27% of eligible ears) or tumor growth (50% of VS) than adult participants (6% of eligible ears and 4% of VS) during maintenance therapy. A similar trend for reduced efficacy of bevacizumab for pediatric patients was noted during induction therapy and in retrospective studies of bevacizumab for pediatric patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Our findings are also aligned with those reported by a nationally coordinated health care system in the United Kingdom<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>; by pediatric oncology centers in France<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>; and by 6 international pediatric institutions<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> suggesting that pediatric patients benefit less from bevacizumab than adults. The basis for this difference is not yet known. However, age at first symptom is strongly associated with disease severity, and individuals diagnosed under age of 16 years typically exhibit a more severe phenotype with early hearing loss and mortality.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Finally, we document improvement in NF2-related QOL and in tinnitus-related distress with bevacizumab treatment that corresponds with previous reports,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> although all studies have been limited by low-patient numbers. In contrast to previous studies,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> our results suggest that some ears that experience hearing decline on low-dose bevacizumab can be salvaged by an increase in bevacizumab. This finding highlights the importance of individualizing treatment and considering dose intensification for those who have exhibited stable or improved hearing on higher doses of bevacizumab previously.</p>
              <p>Bevacizumab was well tolerated during 2 years of treatment. Only 2 participants chose to stop treatment due to grade 1 or 2 adverse events, and 1 was stopped by the treating physician for grade 3 toxicity. The rate of hypertension in this study (65%) was higher than reported in a recent meta-analysis of 14 studies for persons with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN (29%),<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and may reflect to the prospective nature of the trial, the duration of treatment, or other unmeasured differences in the cohort. In contrast, the rate of proteinuria (15%) was somewhat lower than in the meta-analysis (30%) whereas the rates of menstrual irregularities were similar. No new safety signals for bevacizumab were identified during maintenance therapy.</p>
              <p>Our trial had several strengths, including a prospective trial design that posed independent questions about induction therapy and maintenance therapy, enrollment of participants across multiple dedicated NF clinics, a relatively long treatment period with bevacizumab, and a primary outcome (hearing) which is directly related to QOL for people living with <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN.</p>
              <p>This trial also has limitations. First, given the rarity of <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN and previous reports of treatment efficacy, a double-blind trial design was not possible. Second, the analysis by age was a posthoc assessment which limits the ability to make conclusions about the effect of age on response to bevacizumab. Third, the trial was limited to participants with progressive VS enrolled at specialty centers, potentially limiting the generalizability of these findings. Despite these limitations, our results agree with the previous retrospective case series.</p>
              <p>For <italic toggle="yes">NF2</italic>-SWN patients with progressive VS, treatment with low-dose bevacizumab as maintenance therapy following higher dose induction therapy is associated with high rates of hearing preservation and low rates of tumor progression. Additional studies are required to determine the minimum effect dose of bevacizumab for maintenance and whether this treatment approach may be useful to maintain clinical response and minimize side effects beyond 2 years.</p>
