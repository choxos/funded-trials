              <abstract>
                <p>Given the increased use of air cleaners as a prevention measure in classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to investigate the effects of portable air cleaners with HEPA filters and window A/C fans on real-time (1 minute) concentrations of PM less than 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) or less than 1 microns (PM<sub>1.0</sub>) in two classrooms in a non-urban elementary school in Rhode Island. For half of each school day, settings were randomized to “high” or “low” for the air cleaner and “on” or “off” for the fan. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to evaluate the impacts of each set of conditions on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations. The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4–4.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 3.4–3.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>1.0</sub>. On average, use of the fan when the air cleaner was on the low setting decreased PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 0.53 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) when the fan was off decreased PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 0.10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM<sub>1.0</sub>, use of the fan when the air cleaner was on low decreased concentrations by 0.18 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) when the fan was off decreased concentrations by 0.38 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21]. In general, simultaneous use of the fan and filter on high did not result in additional decreases in PM concentrations compared to the simple addition of each appliance’s individual effect estimates. Our study suggests that concurrent or separate use of an A/C fan and air cleaner in non-urban classrooms with low background PM may reduce classroom PM concentrations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Airborne transmission of the novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 has prompted increased scrutiny of indoor air quality (IAQ), especially in settings where many people gather such as schools, offices, and restaurants [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To further improve indoor air quality and make indoor environments healthier, the Biden Administration launched an effort in March 2022 to improve ventilation and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in buildings, including school buildings [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In schools, where attendance is typically mandatory and classrooms can reach a high occupant density, environmental health experts recommend advanced air ventilation and filtration to protect students and teachers [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While it is possible to achieve high ventilation rates in classrooms by opening doors and windows, filtration presents a set of challenges. Many schools do not have windows that can be opened for safety or energy efficiency reasons. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in older schools are typically equipped with low-grade filters such as minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 8, which captures approximately 84% of PM 3–10 μm in diameter, 20% of PM 1–3 μm in diameter, and is not rated for capture efficiency of particles smaller than 1.0 μm [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends upgrading to more efficient filters such as MERV 13 and higher, especially in buildings that recirculate air within the same room or same local ventilation zone [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278046.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the mechanical ventilation systems in many school districts are too old to be compatible with newer filters [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278046.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For school districts that are structurally capable of adding MERV 13 filters, costs associated with installation, operations, and maintenance can easily exceed millions of dollars [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given the challenges of installing new HVAC systems or filters in school buildings, portable air cleaners and fans have become popular, less expensive alternatives to reduce PM concentrations. Air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are at least 99.97% efficient at capturing particles 0.3 μm and larger in size, offer the possibility of substantially reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles as well as improving overall IAQ [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278046.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>PM is one of the most common pollutants that could potentially degrade air quality in classrooms [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Indoor PM levels are influenced by several factors, such as ambient air pollution levels, air exchange rates, occupancy, type and intensity of indoor activities, and particle sizes [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One study in Munich, Germany found that PM concentrations in classrooms are about six times higher than outdoor concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Children are particularly vulnerable to potential health consequences related to PM exposure due to their immature respiratory and immune systems and greater breathing rates per body weight [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Beyond the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, improved air ventilation is associated with lower school absenteeism, better performance on cognitive function tests, and fewer respiratory symptoms, such as those related to asthma, lung inflammation, and allergies [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure in children has been associated with asthma incidence (OR = 1.10, 95% CI:1.01, 1.20), prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 1.08, 95% CI:1.02, 1.16), and rhinitis (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05,1.26) [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A review study of 33 articles further provided evidence that exposure to particulate air pollution has adverse impacts on children’s respiratory health, with stronger negative effects seen among children with asthma [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>While portable air cleaners are commonly used to reduce PM concentrations, especially in locations near roadways and other sources of air pollution, less is known about the use of conventional fans. Several studies have tested the use of portable air cleaners in school settings, characterizing their effectiveness in reducing exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> alone [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; PM<sub>10</sub> alone [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278046.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; airborne allergens [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; ultrafine particles (UFPs), black carbon, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; as well as their effect on indoor NO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Only one study has evaluated the performance of fans in mitigating PM levels in classrooms [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The objective of this study is to provide data on the effectiveness of portable air cleaners and fans operating in tandem to reduce PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations in occupied classrooms.</p>

                <title>Study location</title>
                <p>The study was conducted in a public elementary school in a small town in Rhode Island, USA. Two classrooms of similar size, occupancy, age of students, and ventilation conditions were selected for air monitoring. Both classrooms were rectangular, with areas of approximately 140 m<sup>2</sup> and 152 m<sup>2</sup> (volume 427 m<sup>3</sup> and 463 m<sup>3</sup>) for classroom A and B, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0278046.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Neither classroom had windows that open, except for the windows in which the A/C units were located. Classroom A was located on the first floor and classroom B was located on the second floor of the same building.</p>
                <p>Prior to the start of the study, each classroom was equipped with a portable air cleaner with an H13-grade True HEPA filter (Medify Air Model MA-112) and a window A/C unit (LG 15000 BTU Model LW1516ER) with separate cooling and fan functions. The volume flow through the air cleaner can be adjusted in five increasing settings: “sleep,” 1, 2, 3 and 4. According to the manufacturer, the air cleaner has a reported maximum clean air delivery rate (CADR) rating of 950 m<sup>3</sup>/h and can cover an area of 762 m<sup>2</sup> with two air changes/h. While it is recommended that HEPA filters be cleaned regularly and replaced every six months, the school’s maintenance schedule was unknown. However, as the air cleaners had been installed after the beginning of the COVD-19 pandemic, we can assume that they were under six months old at the time of sampling. The fan function on the A/C unit could be adjusted in three increasing settings: 1, 2, and 3. Due to school policies, the air cleaners were operated continuously during the school week (24 h, M-F) throughout the study period, while the A/C fans were operated only during school hours (8:30am to 3:45pm, M-F). The A/C cooling function was not used during the study period.</p>

                <title>Sampling methods</title>
                <p>Two personal aerosol monitors (SidePak Model AM510, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), one measuring PM<sub>2.5</sub> and one measuring PM<sub>1.0</sub>, were placed side-by-side across the room (approximately 12 m away) from the air cleaner and A/C unit in each of the classrooms. The same units were used in the same classrooms throughout the sampling period. The inlets of the aerosol monitors were located about 1–1.2 m above ground level. Additionally, one HOBO data logger (HOBO U12 Temp/RH/Light/External Data Logger, Onset Computer Inc., Pocasset, MA, USA) was placed next to the aerosol monitors in each classroom to measure temperature and relative humidity.</p>
                <p>Samples were collected at one-minute intervals during the school week (M-F) from 3/31/2021 to 4/16/2021, for a total of eleven days. Different sets of conditions were used in each classroom each half-day. The HEPA cleaner settings (“high” = setting 4 or “low” = setting 1) and fans (“fan on” = setting 1 or “fan off” = 0) for classroom A and classroom B were assigned randomly prior to the start of sampling using R version 4.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The schedules of half-day settings were distributed to teachers at the start of sampling, as well as log sheets to record deviations from the schedule and times of events that may impact PM concentrations (e.g., bus arrivals, times during which all students typically leave the classroom). We defined noon (12pm) as the cutoff for each trial given that teachers typically transferred from one trial to the next between noon and 12:30pm on each day.

                <p>The SidePak aerosol monitors were factory-calibrated to the respirable fraction of standard ISO 12103–1, A1 Test Dust prior to the start of data collection. Prior to data collection, all monitors were co-located within a controlled environment and operated for several hours to ensure all monitors functioned properly. The monitors were deemed to have an acceptable level of precision if the average percent difference in PM concentrations between the co-located instruments was ≤ 10%. If this threshold was not met, correction factors were calculated to ensure that differences in the collected data were not due to differences in the instruments used. Exceedances of this threshold were reviewed within the context of testing data, given that greater percent error was possible for these monitors at lower concentrations.</p>

                <p>The raw data were trimmed to standard-length school days (8:30am to 3:45pm) and data pertaining to days on which there was no school (i.e., weekends and holidays) were removed. Summary statistics, box plots, and histograms were first generated for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> at the half-day and minute level. With our dataset of half-day trial averages, we utilized one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if there were significant differences between trial averages.</p>
                <p>We also developed linear mixed models using concentration data at the one-minute level. We defined three fixed effects: fan (1 = on, 0 = off), air cleaner (1 = high, 0 = low), and fan*air cleaner, and one random effect: half-day (1 = morning, 0 = afternoon). We included a fixed effect for classroom (0 = classroom B (second floor), 1 = classroom A (first floor)) to control for time-invariant differences between the two classrooms. Given the potential for high autocorrelation in minute-level data, we also used a covariance structure following autoregressive 1 (AR 1) in the linear mixed models. Given large changes in relative humidity over our study period, a secondary analysis considered relative humidity in each classroom.</p>
                <p>All descriptive statistics and analyses were performed using R. Statistical significance was set using ɑ = 0.05.</p>

              <p>A total of 12 half-day trials of <italic toggle="yes">fan off / air cleaner low</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">fan off / air cleaner high</italic>; and 11 half-day trials of <italic toggle="yes">fan on / air cleaner low</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">fan on / air cleaner high</italic> were completed in the classrooms. We removed one full day of sampling for one classroom due to deviations from the scheduled settings. Given the observed percent differences in the pre-sampling data, correction factors were applied to all measurements from both monitors in one of the classrooms. The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4–4.1 μg/m<sup>2</sup> for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 3.4–3.9 μg/m<sup>2</sup> for PM<sub>1.0</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0278046.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mean temperatures were similar across days, with temperatures ranging from 69.6–70.9 ℉. However, mean relative humidities varied more widely, with a range of 31.5–37.6%. The lowest mean relative humidity was observed in the <italic toggle="yes">fan on / air cleaner high</italic> trials, while the greatest was observed in the <italic toggle="yes">fan off / air cleaner low</italic> trials.</p>

The linear mixed model results are shown in <xref rid="pone.0278046.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The differences in <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> included are due to missing humidity information.

When the fan was off, use of the air cleaner on a high setting decreased concentrations, on average, by 0.10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005] compared to low setting. For PM<sub>1.0,</sub> when the air cleaner was on low, use of the fan decreased concentrations, on average, by 0.18 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01]. When the fan was off, use of the air cleaner on the high setting decreased PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations, on average, by 0.38 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21] compared to the low setting. The product terms for fan on * air cleaner high were statistically significant and positive for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and null for PM<sub>1.0,</sub> indicating no additional decreases in either size fraction when both appliances were used simultaneously. Results were generally similar when adjusting for relative humidity.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This was one of the first studies to investigate the effects of different low-cost indoor air quality interventions on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations in a classroom in a non-urban elementary school in the Northeastern United States. The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4–4.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 3.4–3.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>1.0</sub>. On average, addition of the fan (with the air cleaner on low) decreased PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 0.53 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) alone decreased PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 0.10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM<sub>1.0</sub>, addition of the fan (with the air cleaner on low) decreased concentrations by 0.18 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) alone decreased concentrations by 0.38 μg/m<sup>3</sup> [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21]. We observed that the lowest classroom PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations occurred when both the fan and portable HEPA air cleaner were used simultaneously. However, for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the lowest concentrations were seen when the fan was on and the air cleaner was on low because most of the benefit was through the use of the fan. Overall, the trends observed in this study give insight into non-urban classroom air quality and how different commercially available, cost-effective IAQ interventions could be incorporated into classrooms to effectively reduce PM concentrations.</p>
              <p>Our results were consistent with previous studies on the effects of ventilation systems and portable air cleaners on indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> levels in various settings. However, it is important to note that these studies did not evaluate fan use and occurred in areas with higher ambient air pollution. The application of a new mechanical ventilation system with a fine F8 (MERV 14) filter reduced classroom PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations by 30% compared to baseline in an elementary school in Amsterdam with average background PM<sub>2.5</sub> ranging from 11.2 to 17.9 μg/m3 [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Barkjohn et al. 2020 also demonstrated that the use of HEPA fitted portable air cleaners in homes in Beijing, where outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> ranged from 25 to &gt;200 μg/m3, significantly reduced indoor/outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> ratios by 72% when windows were closed [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a crossover study within two residential homes, Hart et al. 2011 demonstrated that a portable air cleaner can be efficient in reducing particulate matter concentrations by &gt;60% for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> in homes that used wood stoves as a primary heating source [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A pilot study in four kindergarten classrooms in Poland found that air quality in classrooms with a HEPA air cleaner was on average almost 40–50% better than in those without any procedures to decrease air pollutant concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These studies support our findings that use of air cleaners indoors in a classroom reduces PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations, although we observed smaller decreases of approximately 13% and 2% in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations when the fan was on and the air cleaner was on high, respectively. In addition, they do not provide an explanation for why the greatest reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations occurred with the low HEPA air cleaner setting and not the higher setting, which filters a greater volume of air per hour.</p>
              <p>We speculate that using a lower CADR setting could provide a greater reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in classrooms with low background PM<sub>2.5</sub> due to particle removal efficiency. A lab study demonstrated that increased media velocity was associated with a decrease in HEPA filter efficiency from 99.999%, although the efficiency rate did not decrease below 99.977% [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A higher CADR setting increases the volume of air filtered during a given period, resulting in greater air exchange. However, as air is pulled through the HEPA filter more quickly, the filter may be less effective at removing particles, especially at low concentrations. A setting that reduces the rate of air filtration would theoretically move the air through the filter more slowly, allowing for more effective removal of particles. One study found that using portable HEPA air cleaners at home on “Auto” mode significantly reduced indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations compared to homes that manually selected the air cleaner settings [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The authors concluded that auto-mode filtration provided the most efficient results, especially when indoor sources (e.g., cooking) were present. While the air cleaners used in this study did not have an “Auto” mode, it is possible the lower CADR setting was more efficient for PM<sub>2.5</sub> given the low background concentrations and possible settling on indoor surfaces. However, we were not able to address the influence of classroom occupancy and activity on indoor PM levels. It is possible the higher CADR setting may have been more efficient at removing PM<sub>1.0</sub> since smaller particles are more likely remain suspended. Croxford et al. reported that use of an electrostatic air cleaner in an office setting in London reduced smaller particles (PM<sub>2.0</sub>) more effectively than larger particles (PM<sub>2-10</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, Park et al. 2020’s study of 34 elementary schools in Korea found that air cleaners appeared to remove PM<sub>2.5</sub> more effectively than PM<sub>10</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, a crossover study of five elementary schools found that the use of electrostatic air cleaners in school classrooms substantially decreased airborne indoor PM concentrations but not indoor surface dust levels [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our findings might imply that, at low concentrations, larger particles are removed more effectively with a lower CADR setting while smaller particles are removed more effectively with a higher CADR setting since they are less likely to settle on indoor surfaces.</p>
              <p>This study also evaluated A/C fan ventilation; however, research is limited on the effect of fan use on indoor classroom PM concentrations. A study of five classrooms in Hong Kong, a region with high ambient concentrations of PM, suggested that even in the presence of ventilation (air conditioning or ceiling fans) indoor PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations mirrored outdoor PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. If we expect that classroom PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations may mirror outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in areas with high pollution levels, this may also be the case in a city with very low ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. If a location has low background PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, ambient PM from natural ventilation may dilute indoor PM concentrations. During the study period, there were four days with average daily ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations that were lower than the average daily classroom concentrations (see <xref rid="pone.0278046.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Therefore, natural ventilation with ambient air may have contributed to lower classroom PM concentrations. The presence of a window A/C unit could have also introduced small quantities of outdoor air into the classroom if not sealed properly, or through leaks in the A/C unit. If ambient air that had lower PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations was introduced into the classroom, the classroom PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations could be diluted, resulting in lower indoor PM2.5 concentrations.</p>

              </fig>
              <p>We speculate the dual effect of the air cleaner running on “low” and the fan “on” may result from low background PM concentrations compounded by the combined filtration and air circulation from both the air cleaner and the A/C unit. The fans were located approximately one meter above ground level and therefore could have introduced diluted air into the classroom without disturbing settled particles on the ground. Background PM concentrations in the classrooms may have further influenced the effectiveness of the air cleaners. As detailed above, low concentrations of PM may not be effectively filtered by higher CADR settings due to increased flow rate and potential settling of coarser particles. We were not able to evaluate flow dynamics between the A/C fan, the air cleaner, and the mechanical ventilation systems in each classroom, so it is difficult to say whether the additional air circulation provided by the A/C fan contributed to resuspension of such particles. Additionally, the filter in the A/C unit, even if crude, could have removed some larger particles. Further, the concentrations observed in this study could relate to the condition of the HEPA filters. The air cleaner machines were purchased for the classrooms as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it is unknown when (or whether) the HEPA filters in the air cleaners were last cleaned or changed. If the filters were clogged with debris, filtration efficiency may have been affected.</p>
              <p>Our study was strengthened by use of the same classrooms over a two-week period in the same elementary school. The classrooms were of approximately equal size (area: 140 m<sup>2</sup> and 152 m<sup>2</sup>; volume: 427 m<sup>3</sup> and 463 m<sup>3</sup>) and layout, and there was a consistent number of students (14–16) in each classroom over the sampling period (<xref rid="pone.0278046.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). This limited potential confounding in our data by changes in classroom size and occupancy. The use of a randomized schedule further limited potential sources of unmeasured confounding. Another strength of this study is that we evaluated two fractions of particulate matter to determine whether air quality interventions differed by PM particle size.</p>
              <p>In contrast, a major limitation of this study was our inability to evaluate the classrooms under the condition of air cleaner “off” due to COVID-19 and health guidelines, eliminating the possibility to compare the effects of HEPA filter settings to a baseline without the air cleaner. We also did not evaluate the overall school filtration system, which could have influenced PM concentrations in the classrooms and could have attenuated the impacts of the air quality interventions seen in this study. Correction factors calculated from baseline data were applied to two of the aerosol monitors to adjust for differences between the units in measuring PM concentrations, which could have influenced the results.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, given the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and visitor restrictions in place, we were unable to be present in the classrooms during the study period and were not able to gather real-time CADR values or evaluate the sound level of the air purifier and A/C unit at different levels. Sound at different levels was also not evaluated in this study as the primary purpose was to evaluate PM concentrations. Additionally, the teachers were required to operate air purifiers while the classroom was occupied to reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure, however, teachers had the ability to run the purifiers at a variety of settings and we selected only a few settings to study as part of our intervention. It should also be noted that we did not receive noise complaints from the teachers who volunteered their classrooms for the study and the sound was not loud enough to interfere with speaking or listening in the classroom. Even though the use of the air purifier and fan introduces additional noise into the classroom, the devices improve indoor air quality and health. Lastly, despite the classrooms being of approximately equal length, width, and height, the air cleaners in the two classrooms were positioned at different heights (one on the floor and another elevated approximately 0.5 m). However, we were able to include a fixed effect to correct for baseline classroom differences in our mixed model analyses.</p>
              <p>Despite the limitations, this study is impactful because it adds to the limited body of literature surrounding PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations in classroom settings in the United States. This study provides a foundation for future research in the field, especially since the Biden administration initiated a new focus on indoor air quality with an emphasis on schools. Though we did not consider the effects of seasonality given the small sampling period, seasonality should be considered in future studies. Classroom PM concentrations have been shown to vary by season, with higher concentrations of PM occurring in the winter compared to the summer [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Occupant behavior (e.g., window opening, time/activity spent indoors) would also vary significantly by season. It would also be worthy to more closely evaluate the impacts of occupancy—the number of teachers and students per classroom—on PM concentrations. Multiple studies have shown that mechanical forces are a primary driver of classroom air quality [<xref rid="pone.0278046.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the teachers were asked to track times of events that may impact PM concentrations (e.g., bus arrivals, times during which all students typically leave the classroom), the data was not sufficient to make any conclusions about the influence of activity on PM concentrations in our study. Therefore, it is important for future studies to look at how the number of occupants per classroom, and student activity, influences PM concentrations and the effectiveness of different air quality interventions.</p>
              <p>Our study only involved two classrooms because of availability of equipment and could have been strengthened if more classrooms were evaluated. As a result, the findings from two classrooms in one school limit the generalizability of the study findings even though we included multiple day measurements. Furthermore, to better evaluate the effectiveness of air quality intervention, air cleaner devices should be placed in the same location and height in each classroom to ensure consistency in sampling. Monitoring the CADR levels at different operating levels would help contextualize the impact of using the air cleaners at different settings. It is also important to note that this study was conducted in a non-urban area with low ambient PM concentrations and is not reflective of how these air quality interventions may work in urban settings or areas with higher ambient PM concentrations.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study demonstrated that the lowest average classroom PM concentrations occurred when the A/C fan was on in the classrooms. The highest concentrations of both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1.0</sub> concentrations occurred when the filter was used on low without concurrent use of the fan. Therefore, the use of a fan in a non-urban classroom with low background PM concentrations may help to reduce overall classroom PM concentrations. Specifically, within the context of this study for a school with a low background PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration, the use of an air cleaner on the “low” setting instead of a “high setting” could be used to supplement classroom ventilation and filtration while also lowering operating costs. In settings where ambient air quality is already at an acceptable level, using air cleaners at a higher setting may not be as efficient and may not significantly improve air quality compared to a lower setting.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Schiff,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jun 18 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Abstract:</p>
              <p>The structure of the abstract must be changed. Start with the problem you have found that triggers your research and finalize with the objective, methodology and conclusions.</p>
              <p>This is the second sentence of the abstract: “Our objective was to determine if use of air cleaners with HEPA filters and air conditioning (A/C) units were associated with changes in particulate matter (PM) air pollution concentrations in a real-world environment.”</p>
              <p>Could you change the order and include the sentence as the main goal of the article? What is the method to achieve that goal?</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Lines 101-103: “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide data on the effectiveness of portable air cleaners and fans operating in tandem to reduce PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in occupied classrooms.” This could be the main objective of the article. I suggest not to mention “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study…” Just state the objective of the article.</p>
              <p>Please, unify the format of the tables.</p>
              <p>Figure 1. Please explain the equation and the parameter “r”.</p>
              <p>Conclusions:</p>
              <p>Use some of the numerical results to reinforce the statements.</p>
              <p>Include some limitations you might have found in the methodology and future improvements.</p>
              <p>All the data stated in the abstract should have comments in the conclusion section:</p>
              <p>“The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4 - 4.1 µg/m 2 for PM 2.5 and 3.4 - 3.9 µg/m 2 for PM 1.0 On average, use of the fan decreased PM 2.5 by 0.53 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) decreased PM 2.5 by 0.10 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM 1.0 , use of the fan decreased concentrations by 0.18 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) decreased concentrations by 0.38 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21].”</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript titled ‘Effects of portable air cleaners and A/C unit fans on classroom concentrations of particulate matter in a non-urban elementary school’ documents the effects of air cleaner in the low/high mode and A/C fan in the on/off mode using linear mixed regression models. Interestingly, the manuscript does not discuss potential impacts of students’ activity on classroom PM and on the effects of air cleaner. Because student activity is an important factor affecting classroom PM concentrations and effect of air cleaners on classroom PM, this needs to be discussed in Discussion. The manuscript may also consider the following comments to improve clarity and flow of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. Lines 44-47: It should be mentioned that the effect of fan was adjusted for air cleaner; likewise, the effect of air cleaner was adjusted for A/C fan.</p>
              <p>2. Lines 48-51: General statement (lines 48-49) of the study findings and the conclusion (lines 50-51) don’t seem to agree in the current writing. It looks like that the conclusion should be modified to more specific one because the effects of concurrent use of an A/C fan and air cleaner on reducing the PM were dependent of the mode of the air cleaner and PM size. The proper conclusion would have implication in saving energy.</p>
              <p>3. Lines 48-49: Does the ‘additional decreases in PM concentrations’ mean no interaction effect between fan on and air cleaner on high? But the interaction was only significant for PM2.5 but not for PM1.0. If this statement was from the interaction model outputs, it should be also specific to PM size.</p>
              <p>4. Lines 79-84: The sentences are about health effects of PM, which has nothing to do with use of air cleaner or improved ventilation that seemed to be the theme for the previous sentences within the paragraph. Thus, it would flow better if these were moved to the next paragraph (after the last sentence of the next paragraph that is describing PM health effect).</p>
              <p>5. Wondering if the authors examined interaction between classroom humidity and fan or between humidity and air cleaner in the regression models?</p>
              <p>6. Lines 198-205: It seemed that fan effect was bigger for PM2.5 then PM1.0, but air cleaner effect was bigger for PM1.0 than PM2.5. Isn’t this worth to discuss further in Discussion?</p>
              <p>7. The title of Table 2 should state ‘Unadjusted ANOVA’ if the ANOVA models were not adjusted for anything.</p>
              <p>8. Lines 235-243: The studies discussed are all home studies. Are there any studies of evaluating the effect of air cleaners in classrooms? Unless discussion is strictly limited to HEPA air cleaners, there are some studies examining effects of air cleaners in classrooms (e.g., Wargocki et al., HVAC R Res. 14 (2008): 327-344; Mattsson and Hygge, 2005 Indoor Air Conference Proceedings, pp 1111-1115; Park et al., Building and Environment 167, 2020: 106437), which should be discussed.</p>
              <p>9. Lines 256-257: The discussion doesn’t agree with the current study finding. It was reported in Results that the air cleaner on high mode reduced PM1.0 concentrations more than PM2.5. Thus, your argument in this sentence about ‘less effective at removing particles for smaller size PM by air cleaner on high mode’ is not supported by your own finding.</p>
              <p>10. Line 268: ‘….some average daily ambient …’. Specify ‘some’ in this sentence because there are only two days when ambient PM2.5 concentrations were lower than classroom PM2.5.</p>
              <p>11. Lines 261-273: This paragraph was not clear. What is the main discussion point of the paragraph? The paragraph may need to be modified for clarification.</p>
              <p>12. In the limitation section, the small number of classrooms in the study also needs to be mentioned as a limitation. Findings from only two classrooms in one school may not be generalizable although the study has multiple day measurements.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Dear Author,</p>
              <p>Your manuscript follows a very interesting approach. However, important information is missing to be able to assess the results and evaluate them for a school. For example, a room sketch is missing, as well as information about the ceiling height, with the coordinates for the air purifier, A/C unit and also the measuring points. Furthermore, you do not address the CADR values that are realised at different levels of the air cleaner. The sound level at the different levels is also not mentioned, although this is a critical factor for use in classrooms. The same applies to the A/C unit. I read online that a sound pressure level of 57 dB(A) is generated at the "Low" level, which is clearly too high and would in turn have an impact on the students' ability to concentrate. In my view, when you address the specific case in schools, you have to take these points into account.</p>
              <p>From my point of view, a major revision is necessary so that a general gain in knowledge emerges from the manuscript.</p>

              <p>Abstract (Reorganized) </p>
              <p>Given the increased useing of air cleaners in classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic as a prevention measure, this study aimed to investigate the the effects of portable air cleaners with HEPA filters and window A/C fans on real-time (1 minute) concentrations of PM less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less than 1 microns (PM1.0) in two classrooms in a non-urban elementary school in Rhode Island. For half of each school day, settings were randomized to “high” or “low” for the air cleaner and “on” or “off” for the fan. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to evaluate the impacts of each set of conditions on PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations. The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4 - 4.1 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 3.4 - 3.9 µg/m3 for PM1.0 On average, use of the fan alone decreased PM2.5 by 0.53 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) alone decreased PM2.5 by 0.10 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM1.0, use of the fan alone decreased concentrations by 0.18 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) alone decreased concentrations by 0.38 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21]. In general, simultaneous use of the fan and filter on high did not result in additional decreases in PM concentrations compared to the simple addition of each appliance’s individual effect estimates. use of either appliance individually. Our study suggests that concurrent or separate use of an A/C fan and air cleaner in non-urban classrooms with low background PM may reduce classroom PM concentrations.</p>

              <p>Include some limitations you might have found in the methodology and future improvements.</p>
              <p>Response (bold are the changes): This study adds to the limited body of literature surrounding PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in classroom settings in the United States and provides a foundation for future research in the field. Though we did not consider the effects of seasonality given the small sampling period, seasonality should be considered in future studies. Classroom PM concentrations have been shown to vary by season, with higher concentrations of PM occurring in the winter compared to the summer [32]. Occupant behavior (e.g., window opening) would also vary significantly by season. It would also be worthy to more closely evaluate the impacts of occupancy—the number of teachers and students per classroom—on PM concentrations. Multiple studies have shown that mechanical forces are a primary driver of classroom air quality, therefore it is important to look at how the number of students per classroom influences PM concentrations and the effectiveness of different air quality interventions [32]. This study only involved two classrooms as a result of availability of equipment and could have been strengthened if more classrooms were evaluated. As a result, the findings from two classrooms in one school limit the generalizability of the study findings even though the study has multiple day measurements.. Furthermore, to better evaluate the effectiveness of air quality intervention, the air quality device should be placed in the same location and at the height in each classroom to ensure consistency in sampling method. Monitoring the CADR levels at different air quality device operating levels would help contextualize the impact of using the air quality devices at different settings. It is also important to note that this study was conducted in a non-urban area with low ambient PM concentrations and is not reflective of how these air quality interventions may work in urban settings or areas with higher ambient PM concentrations. </p>
              <p>All the data stated in the abstract should have comments in the conclusion section:</p>
              <p>“The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4 - 4.1 µg/m 2 for PM 2.5 and 3.4 - 3.9 µg/m 2 for PM 1.0 On average, use of the fan decreased PM 2.5 by 0.53 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) decreased PM 2.5 by 0.10 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM 1.0 , use of the fan decreased concentrations by 0.18 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) decreased concentrations by 0.38 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21].”</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - we have added this to the conclusions section.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>The manuscript titled ‘Effects of portable air cleaners and A/C unit fans on classroom concentrations of particulate matter in a non-urban elementary school’ documents the effects of air cleaner in the low/high mode and A/C fan in the on/off mode using linear mixed regression models. Interestingly, the manuscript does not discuss potential impacts of students’ activity on classroom PM and on the effects of air cleaner. Because student activity is an important factor affecting classroom PM concentrations and effect of air cleaners on classroom PM, this needs to be discussed in Discussion. The manuscript may also consider the following comments to improve clarity and flow of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you – we have added not being able to record student activity (due to COVID-19 limitations at the time) as a limitation to the study, which can be found in the Discussion. It should be noted that we asked the teachers to track times of events that may impact PM concentrations (e.g. bus arrivals, times during which all students typically leave the classroom), but the data was not sufficient to make any conclusions.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. Lines 44-47: It should be mentioned that the effect of fan was adjusted for air cleaner; likewise, the effect of air cleaner was adjusted for A/C fan.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you – please see lines 40-46 in the tracked changes document to see the clarification on the adjustments for air clear and the A/C fan. </p>
              <p>2. Lines 48-51: General statement (lines 48-49) of the study findings and the conclusion (lines 50-51) don’t seem to agree in the current writing. It looks like that the conclusion should be modified to more specific one because the effects of concurrent use of an A/C fan and air cleaner on reducing the PM were dependent of the mode of the air cleaner and PM size. The proper conclusion would have implication in saving energy.</p>
              <p>Response: Simultaneous use of the fan and air cleaner did not result in significant, additional decreases in PM2.5 - as stated in the results section, the interaction term was actually significantly positive. Regarding PM1.0, no significant differences associated with simultaneous use of the air cleaner and fan were found. We have updated the phrasing of the results in the Abstract as well as in the Results section to better reflect this finding.</p>
              <p>3. Lines 48-49: Does the ‘additional decreases in PM concentrations’ mean no interaction effect between fan on and air cleaner on high? But the interaction was only significant for PM2.5 but not for PM1.0. If this statement was from the interaction model outputs, it should be also specific to PM size.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this comment. As clarification and as described in the Result section, the interaction term was significantly for PM2.5 and null for PM1.0. This indicated that concurrent use of the appliances, in our study setting, did not result in significantly lower PM concentrations for either size fraction below the simple addition of each separate effect estimates. In line with previous comment, we have rephrased the results description in the Abstract and Result sections to reflect this more clearly.</p>
              <p>4. Lines 79-84: The sentences are about health effects of PM, which has nothing to do with use of air cleaner or improved ventilation that seemed to be the theme for the previous sentences within the paragraph. Thus, it would flow better if these were moved to the next paragraph (after the last sentence of the next paragraph that is describing PM health effect).</p>
              <p>Response: Given the challenges of installing new HVAC systems or filters in school buildings, portable air cleaners and fans have become popular, less expensive alternatives to reduce PM concentrations. Air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are at least 99.97% efficient at capturing particles 0.3 µm and larger in size, offer the possibility of substantially reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles as well as improving overall IAQ [7,5]. Beyond the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, improved air ventilation is associated with lower school absenteeism, better performance on cognitive function tests, and fewer respiratory symptoms, such as those related to asthma, lung inflammation, and allergies [9, 10, 11]. PM2.5 exposure in children has been associated with asthma incidence (OR=1.10, 95% CI:1.01, 1.20), prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR=1.08, 95% CI:1.02, 1.16), and rhinitis (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.05,1.26) [12]. A review study of 33 articles further provided evidence that exposure to particulate air pollution has adverse impacts on children’s respiratory health, with stronger negative effects seen among children with asthma [13]. </p>
              <p>PM is one of the most common pollutants that could potentially degrade air quality in classrooms [14]. Indoor PM levels are influenced by several factors, such as ambient air pollution levels, air exchange rates, occupancy, type and intensity of indoor activities, and particle sizes [14, 15, 16]. One study in Munich, Germany found that PM concentrations in classrooms are about six times higher than outdoor concentrations [17]. Children are particularly vulnerable to potential health consequences related to PM exposure due to their immature respiratory and immune systems and greater breathing rates per body weight [11]. Beyond the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, improved air ventilation is associated with lower school absenteeism, better performance on cognitive function tests, and fewer respiratory symptoms, such as those related to asthma, lung inflammation, and allergies [9, 10, 11]. PM2.5 exposure in children has been associated with asthma incidence (OR=1.10, 95% CI:1.01, 1.20), prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR=1.08, 95% CI:1.02, 1.16), and rhinitis (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.05,1.26) [12]. A review study of 33 articles further provided evidence that exposure to particulate air pollution has adverse impacts on children’s respiratory health, with stronger negative effects seen among children with asthma [13]. </p>
              <p>5. Wondering if the authors examined interaction between classroom humidity and fan or between humidity and air cleaner in the regression models?</p>
              <p>Response: We tried this and a model with a three-way interaction - generally, the main effects are almost identical, although there are some significant but small interactions with humidity that vary for the size fractions. However, we decided not to include the result due the difficulty to interpret the impact and the concern that if may distract from results. </p>
              <p>6. Lines 198-205: It seemed that fan effect was bigger for PM2.5 then PM1.0, but air cleaner effect was bigger for PM1.0 than PM2.5. Isn’t this worth to discuss further in Discussion?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - this point has been addressed in the Discussion.</p>
              <p>7. The title of Table 2 should state ‘Unadjusted ANOVA’ if the ANOVA models were not adjusted for anything.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - we have added this distinction.</p>
              <p>8. Lines 235-243: The studies discussed are all home studies. Are there any studies of evaluating the effect of air cleaners in classrooms? Unless discussion is strictly limited to HEPA air cleaners, there are some studies examining effects of air cleaners in classrooms (e.g., Wargocki et al., HVAC R Res. 14 (2008): 327-344; Mattsson and Hygge, 2005 Indoor Air Conference Proceedings, pp 1111-1115; Park et al., Building and Environment 167, 2020: 106437), which should be discussed.</p>
              <p>Response: The studies discussed were limited to HEPA air cleaners. We discussed one classroom study that also used HEPA air cleaners, but acknowledged a general lack of existing literature. However, we have cited more school studies elsewhere in the Discussion, including a few mentioned by the reviewer.</p>
              <p>9. Lines 256-257: The discussion doesn’t agree with the current study finding. It was reported in Results that the air cleaner on high mode reduced PM1.0 concentrations more than PM2.5. Thus, your argument in this sentence about ‘less effective at removing particles for smaller size PM by air cleaner on high mode’ is not supported by your own finding.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this comment. We went to this paragraph and revised our language. We had incorrectly discussed particle size instead of particle concentration since our study was in a classroom that had very low PM concentrations. We also added additional context. Please see lines 365- 398 (in track changes document). </p>
              <p>10. Line 268: ‘….some average daily ambient …’. Specify ‘some’ in this sentence because there are only two days when ambient PM2.5 concentrations were lower than classroom PM2.5.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - we have added this clarification.</p>
              <p>11. Lines 261-273: This paragraph was not clear. What is the main discussion point of the paragraph? The paragraph may need to be modified for clarification.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you – The main discussion of the paragraph was to highlight the fact that the study was conducted in a location that has very low ambient PM concentrations and that those low ambient concentrations may have impacted classroom PM concentrations. We edited the paragraph starting at line 404-422 (in the track changes document) to emphasize the low ambient PM concentrations. </p>
              <p>12. In the limitation section, the small number of classrooms in the study also needs to be mentioned as a limitation. Findings from only two classrooms in one school may not be generalizable although the study has multiple day measurements.</p>
              <p>Response (bold are the changes): This study adds to the limited body of literature surrounding PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in classroom settings in the United States and provides a foundation for future research in the field. Though we did not consider the effects of seasonality given the small sampling period, seasonality should be considered in future studies. Classroom PM concentrations have been shown to vary by season, with higher concentrations of PM occurring in the winter compared to the summer [32]. Occupant behavior (e.g., window opening) would also vary significantly by season. It would also be worthy to more closely evaluate the impacts of occupancy—the number of teachers and students per classroom—on PM concentrations. Multiple studies have shown that mechanical forces are a primary driver of classroom air quality, therefore it is important to look at how the number of students per classroom influences PM concentrations and the effectiveness of different air quality interventions [32]. This study only involved two classrooms as a result of availability of equipment and could have been strengthened if more classrooms were evaluated. As a result, the findings from two classrooms in one school limit the generalizability of the study findings even though the study has multiple day measurements.. Furthermore, to better evaluate the effectiveness of air quality intervention, the air quality device should be placed in the same location and at the height in each classroom to ensure consistency in sampling method. Monitoring the CADR levels at different air quality device operating levels would help contextualize the impact of using the air quality devices at different settings. It is also important to note that this study was conducted in a non-urban area with low ambient PM concentrations and is not reflective of how these air quality interventions may work in urban settings or areas with higher ambient PM concentrations. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Dear Author,</p>
              <p>Your manuscript follows a very interesting approach. However, important information is missing to be able to assess the results and evaluate them for a school. For example, a room sketch is missing, as well as information about the ceiling height, with the coordinates for the air purifier, A/C unit and also the measuring points. Furthermore, you do not address the CADR values that are realized at different levels of the air cleaner. The sound level at the different levels is also not mentioned, although this is a critical factor for use in classrooms. The same applies to the A/C unit. I read online that a sound pressure level of 57 dB(A) is generated at the "Low" level, which is clearly too high and would in turn have an impact on the students' ability to concentrate. In my view, when you address the specific case in schools, you have to take these points into account.</p>
              <p>Response: We added sound level as a limitation in our discussion. We were concerned about the impact of the sound in the classroom; however, the air purifiers and A/C fans were not so loud and did not interfere with the ability to teach in the classroom. Furthermore, internet research indicates that 60 dB is conversation volume. We currently do not have a sketch of the classrooms but we included dimensions of the classrooms and location of the air purifiers in the classroom in the methods section.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #3: Dear Authors,</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, my points were not fully considered.</p>
              <p>Noise level: A sound pressure level of 60 dB(A) in a school is totally unacceptable. The American National Standards Institute recommends a maximum level of 35 dB(A) in classrooms, the same applies to the guidelines in Europe, most of which also consider a maximum value of 35 dB(A) to be acceptable, although maximum values of up to 40 dB(A) can be found in guidelines.</p>
              <p>I consider this point critical for classrooms, since the use of such devices requires the acceptance of teachers and students. Especially in classrooms, guidelines on noise levels should be discussed.</p>
              <p>The measurement setup is not yet sufficiently described.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I find the approach of this work good and the investigations carried out interesting. The presentation of the results is also very good. The description of the measurements and their structure, which would be important for a deeper understanding and classification, is still missing.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #3: Dear Authors,</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, my points were not fully considered.</p>
              <p>Noise level: A sound pressure level of 60 dB(A) in a school is totally unacceptable. The American National Standards Institute recommends a maximum level of 35 dB(A) in classrooms, the same applies to the guidelines in Europe, most of which also consider a maximum value of 35 dB(A) to be acceptable, although maximum values of up to 40 dB(A) can be found in guidelines.</p>
              <p>I consider this point critical for classrooms, since the use of such devices requires the acceptance of teachers and students. Especially in classrooms, guidelines on noise levels should be discussed.</p>
              <p>The measurement setup is not yet sufficiently described.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I find the approach of this work good and the investigations carried out interesting. The presentation of the results is also very good. The description of the measurements and their structure, which would be important for a deeper understanding and classification, is still missing.</p>
              <p>Response: We added sound level as a limitation in our discussion. We were concerned about the impact of the sound in the classroom; however, the air purifiers and A/C fans were required to be used in the classrooms for health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers were required to have the air purifiers on but teachers had the ability to choose which settings they wanted to use in their classrooms; some used higher settings than others. During our study we varied the treatment settings but these did not include the air purifier setting ‘off” nor did they include the highest air purifier setting. Furthermore, we asked teachers to report on the sound level throughout the study period and to report if the sound level interfered with their ability to teach in the classrooms. We did not receive any reports of noise interfering with the ability to teach in the classroom. Overall, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of various air purifier and fan settings in a classroom setting on particulate matter concentrations and we did not focus on other environmental exposures, although sound is a consideration especially in schools. The use of air purifiers in the classroom has health benefits even though noise can be a concern, however, in our study noise complaints were not received. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, research indicates that 60 dB is conversation volume. According to our research, the CDC notes that 60 dBA is a normal conversation/AC level and that sounds at these levels do not typically cause hearing damage. The CDC further states that 30 dBA is equivalent to a whisper. We also investigated the air purifier used in the classroom and at its maximum level (there are four levels, 1-4) the sound would be 70 dBA, however, in our study the maximum level used was level 3, so less than 70dBA. 70 dBA is the level the CDC notes as causing annoyance by noise, but not hearing damage. We acknowledge that 35 dBA is a recommendation for classrooms, however, it is not a requirement for classrooms and was not realistic in the context of COVID-19 and the requirement for classrooms to use air purifiers. </p>
              <p>We also provided a classroom schematic in the supplementary material, depicting the layout and sizes of the classroom. The schematic also includes dimensions of the classrooms and location of the air purifiers in the classroom in the methods section. Dimensions and description of air purifier and air monitor locations in the classrooms can be found in the methods section of the manuscript. </p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Abstract:</p>
              <p>The structure of the abstract must be changed. Start with the problem you have found that triggers your research and finalize with the objective, methodology and conclusions.</p>
              <p>This is the second sentence of the abstract: “Our objective was to determine if use of air cleaners with HEPA filters and air conditioning (A/C) units were associated with changes in particulate matter (PM) air pollution concentrations in a real-world environment.”</p>
              <p>Could you change the order and include the sentence as the main goal of the article? What is the method to achieve that goal?</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>Abstract (Reorganized) </p>
              <p>Given the increased useing of air cleaners in classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic as a prevention measure, this study aimed to investigate the the effects of portable air cleaners with HEPA filters and window A/C fans on real-time (1 minute) concentrations of PM less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less than 1 microns (PM1.0) in two classrooms in a non-urban elementary school in Rhode Island. For half of each school day, settings were randomized to “high” or “low” for the air cleaner and “on” or “off” for the fan. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to evaluate the impacts of each set of conditions on PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations. The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4 - 4.1 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 3.4 - 3.9 µg/m3 for PM1.0 On average, use of the fan alone decreased PM2.5 by 0.53 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) alone decreased PM2.5 by 0.10 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM1.0, use of the fan alone decreased concentrations by 0.18 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) alone decreased concentrations by 0.38 µg/m3 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21]. In general, simultaneous use of the fan and filter on high did not result in additional decreases in PM concentrations compared to the simple addition of each appliance’s individual effect estimates. use of either appliance individually. Our study suggests that concurrent or separate use of an A/C fan and air cleaner in non-urban classrooms with low background PM may reduce classroom PM concentrations.</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Lines 101-103: “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide data on the effectiveness of portable air cleaners and fans operating in tandem to reduce PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in occupied classrooms.” This could be the main objective of the article. I suggest not to mention “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study…” Just state the objective of the article.</p>
              <p>Response: The objective of this study is to provide data on the effectiveness of portable air cleaners and fans operating in tandem to reduce PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in occupied classrooms.</p>
              <p>Please, unify the format of the tables.</p>
              <p>Response: We have adjusted the formatting and file types of the tables to be unified.</p>
              <p>Figure 1. Please explain the equation and the parameter “r”.</p>
              <p>Response: We have added a caption within the figure describing both these components.</p>
              <p>Conclusions:</p>
              <p>Use some of the numerical results to reinforce the statements.</p>
              <p>Response: Please see the tracked changes document that demonstrate the use of numerical results to reinforce the statements. </p>
              <p>Include some limitations you might have found in the methodology and future improvements.</p>
              <p>Response (bold are the changes): This study adds to the limited body of literature surrounding PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in classroom settings in the United States and provides a foundation for future research in the field. Though we did not consider the effects of seasonality given the small sampling period, seasonality should be considered in future studies. Classroom PM concentrations have been shown to vary by season, with higher concentrations of PM occurring in the winter compared to the summer [32]. Occupant behavior (e.g., window opening) would also vary significantly by season. It would also be worthy to more closely evaluate the impacts of occupancy—the number of teachers and students per classroom—on PM concentrations. Multiple studies have shown that mechanical forces are a primary driver of classroom air quality, therefore it is important to look at how the number of students per classroom influences PM concentrations and the effectiveness of different air quality interventions [32]. This study only involved two classrooms as a result of availability of equipment and could have been strengthened if more classrooms were evaluated. As a result, the findings from two classrooms in one school limit the generalizability of the study findings even though the study has multiple day measurements.. Furthermore, to better evaluate the effectiveness of air quality intervention, the air quality device should be placed in the same location and at the height in each classroom to ensure consistency in sampling method. Monitoring the CADR levels at different air quality device operating levels would help contextualize the impact of using the air quality devices at different settings. It is also important to note that this study was conducted in a non-urban area with low ambient PM concentrations and is not reflective of how these air quality interventions may work in urban settings or areas with higher ambient PM concentrations. </p>
              <p>All the data stated in the abstract should have comments in the conclusion section:</p>
              <p>“The mean half-day concentrations ranged from 3.4 - 4.1 µg/m 2 for PM 2.5 and 3.4 - 3.9 µg/m 2 for PM 1.0 On average, use of the fan decreased PM 2.5 by 0.53 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.64, -0.42] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) decreased PM 2.5 by 0.10 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.20, 0.005]. For PM 1.0 , use of the fan decreased concentrations by 0.18 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.01] and use of the filter on high (compared to low) decreased concentrations by 0.38 µg/m 3 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.21].”</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - we have added this to the conclusions section.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>The manuscript titled ‘Effects of portable air cleaners and A/C unit fans on classroom concentrations of particulate matter in a non-urban elementary school’ documents the effects of air cleaner in the low/high mode and A/C fan in the on/off mode using linear mixed regression models. Interestingly, the manuscript does not discuss potential impacts of students’ activity on classroom PM and on the effects of air cleaner. Because student activity is an important factor affecting classroom PM concentrations and effect of air cleaners on classroom PM, this needs to be discussed in Discussion. The manuscript may also consider the following comments to improve clarity and flow of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you – we have added not being able to record student activity (due to COVID-19 limitations at the time) as a limitation to the study, which can be found in the Discussion. It should be noted that we asked the teachers to track times of events that may impact PM concentrations (e.g. bus arrivals, times during which all students typically leave the classroom), but the data was not sufficient to make any conclusions.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. Lines 44-47: It should be mentioned that the effect of fan was adjusted for air cleaner; likewise, the effect of air cleaner was adjusted for A/C fan.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you – please see lines 40-46 in the tracked changes document to see the clarification on the adjustments for air clear and the A/C fan. </p>
              <p>2. Lines 48-51: General statement (lines 48-49) of the study findings and the conclusion (lines 50-51) don’t seem to agree in the current writing. It looks like that the conclusion should be modified to more specific one because the effects of concurrent use of an A/C fan and air cleaner on reducing the PM were dependent of the mode of the air cleaner and PM size. The proper conclusion would have implication in saving energy.</p>
              <p>Response: Simultaneous use of the fan and air cleaner did not result in significant, additional decreases in PM2.5 - as stated in the results section, the interaction term was actually significantly positive. Regarding PM1.0, no significant differences associated with simultaneous use of the air cleaner and fan were found. We have updated the phrasing of the results in the Abstract as well as in the Results section to better reflect this finding.</p>
              <p>3. Lines 48-49: Does the ‘additional decreases in PM concentrations’ mean no interaction effect between fan on and air cleaner on high? But the interaction was only significant for PM2.5 but not for PM1.0. If this statement was from the interaction model outputs, it should be also specific to PM size.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this comment. As clarification and as described in the Result section, the interaction term was significantly for PM2.5 and null for PM1.0. This indicated that concurrent use of the appliances, in our study setting, did not result in significantly lower PM concentrations for either size fraction below the simple addition of each separate effect estimates. In line with previous comment, we have rephrased the results description in the Abstract and Result sections to reflect this more clearly.</p>
              <p>4. Lines 79-84: The sentences are about health effects of PM, which has nothing to do with use of air cleaner or improved ventilation that seemed to be the theme for the previous sentences within the paragraph. Thus, it would flow better if these were moved to the next paragraph (after the last sentence of the next paragraph that is describing PM health effect).</p>
              <p>Response: Given the challenges of installing new HVAC systems or filters in school buildings, portable air cleaners and fans have become popular, less expensive alternatives to reduce PM concentrations. Air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are at least 99.97% efficient at capturing particles 0.3 µm and larger in size, offer the possibility of substantially reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles as well as improving overall IAQ [7,5]. Beyond the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, improved air ventilation is associated with lower school absenteeism, better performance on cognitive function tests, and fewer respiratory symptoms, such as those related to asthma, lung inflammation, and allergies [9, 10, 11]. PM2.5 exposure in children has been associated with asthma incidence (OR=1.10, 95% CI:1.01, 1.20), prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR=1.08, 95% CI:1.02, 1.16), and rhinitis (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.05,1.26) [12]. A review study of 33 articles further provided evidence that exposure to particulate air pollution has adverse impacts on children’s respiratory health, with stronger negative effects seen among children with asthma [13]. </p>
              <p>PM is one of the most common pollutants that could potentially degrade air quality in classrooms [14]. Indoor PM levels are influenced by several factors, such as ambient air pollution levels, air exchange rates, occupancy, type and intensity of indoor activities, and particle sizes [14, 15, 16]. One study in Munich, Germany found that PM concentrations in classrooms are about six times higher than outdoor concentrations [17]. Children are particularly vulnerable to potential health consequences related to PM exposure due to their immature respiratory and immune systems and greater breathing rates per body weight [11]. Beyond the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, improved air ventilation is associated with lower school absenteeism, better performance on cognitive function tests, and fewer respiratory symptoms, such as those related to asthma, lung inflammation, and allergies [9, 10, 11]. PM2.5 exposure in children has been associated with asthma incidence (OR=1.10, 95% CI:1.01, 1.20), prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR=1.08, 95% CI:1.02, 1.16), and rhinitis (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.05,1.26) [12]. A review study of 33 articles further provided evidence that exposure to particulate air pollution has adverse impacts on children’s respiratory health, with stronger negative effects seen among children with asthma [13]. </p>
              <p>5. Wondering if the authors examined interaction between classroom humidity and fan or between humidity and air cleaner in the regression models?</p>
              <p>Response: We tried this and a model with a three-way interaction - generally, the main effects are almost identical, although there are some significant but small interactions with humidity that vary for the size fractions. However, we decided not to include the result due the difficulty to interpret the impact and the concern that if may distract from results. </p>
              <p>6. Lines 198-205: It seemed that fan effect was bigger for PM2.5 then PM1.0, but air cleaner effect was bigger for PM1.0 than PM2.5. Isn’t this worth to discuss further in Discussion?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - this point has been addressed in the Discussion.</p>
              <p>7. The title of Table 2 should state ‘Unadjusted ANOVA’ if the ANOVA models were not adjusted for anything.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - we have added this distinction.</p>
              <p>8. Lines 235-243: The studies discussed are all home studies. Are there any studies of evaluating the effect of air cleaners in classrooms? Unless discussion is strictly limited to HEPA air cleaners, there are some studies examining effects of air cleaners in classrooms (e.g., Wargocki et al., HVAC R Res. 14 (2008): 327-344; Mattsson and Hygge, 2005 Indoor Air Conference Proceedings, pp 1111-1115; Park et al., Building and Environment 167, 2020: 106437), which should be discussed.</p>
              <p>Response: The studies discussed were limited to HEPA air cleaners. We discussed one classroom study that also used HEPA air cleaners, but acknowledged a general lack of existing literature. However, we have cited more school studies elsewhere in the Discussion, including a few mentioned by the reviewer.</p>
              <p>9. Lines 256-257: The discussion doesn’t agree with the current study finding. It was reported in Results that the air cleaner on high mode reduced PM1.0 concentrations more than PM2.5. Thus, your argument in this sentence about ‘less effective at removing particles for smaller size PM by air cleaner on high mode’ is not supported by your own finding.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this comment. We went to this paragraph and revised our language. We had incorrectly discussed particle size instead of particle concentration since our study was in a classroom that had very low PM concentrations. We also added additional context. Please see lines 365- 398 (in track changes document). </p>
              <p>10. Line 268: ‘….some average daily ambient …’. Specify ‘some’ in this sentence because there are only two days when ambient PM2.5 concentrations were lower than classroom PM2.5.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you - we have added this clarification.</p>
              <p>11. Lines 261-273: This paragraph was not clear. What is the main discussion point of the paragraph? The paragraph may need to be modified for clarification.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you – The main discussion of the paragraph was to highlight the fact that the study was conducted in a location that has very low ambient PM concentrations and that those low ambient concentrations may have impacted classroom PM concentrations. We edited the paragraph starting at line 404-422 (in the track changes document) to emphasize the low ambient PM concentrations. </p>
              <p>12. In the limitation section, the small number of classrooms in the study also needs to be mentioned as a limitation. Findings from only two classrooms in one school may not be generalizable although the study has multiple day measurements.</p>
              <p>Response (bold are the changes): This study adds to the limited body of literature surrounding PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in classroom settings in the United States and provides a foundation for future research in the field. Though we did not consider the effects of seasonality given the small sampling period, seasonality should be considered in future studies. Classroom PM concentrations have been shown to vary by season, with higher concentrations of PM occurring in the winter compared to the summer [32]. Occupant behavior (e.g., window opening) would also vary significantly by season. It would also be worthy to more closely evaluate the impacts of occupancy—the number of teachers and students per classroom—on PM concentrations. Multiple studies have shown that mechanical forces are a primary driver of classroom air quality, therefore it is important to look at how the number of students per classroom influences PM concentrations and the effectiveness of different air quality interventions [32]. This study only involved two classrooms as a result of availability of equipment and could have been strengthened if more classrooms were evaluated. As a result, the findings from two classrooms in one school limit the generalizability of the study findings even though the study has multiple day measurements.. Furthermore, to better evaluate the effectiveness of air quality intervention, the air quality device should be placed in the same location and at the height in each classroom to ensure consistency in sampling method. Monitoring the CADR levels at different air quality device operating levels would help contextualize the impact of using the air quality devices at different settings. It is also important to note that this study was conducted in a non-urban area with low ambient PM concentrations and is not reflective of how these air quality interventions may work in urban settings or areas with higher ambient PM concentrations. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Dear Author,</p>
              <p>Your manuscript follows a very interesting approach. However, important information is missing to be able to assess the results and evaluate them for a school. For example, a room sketch is missing, as well as information about the ceiling height, with the coordinates for the air purifier, A/C unit and also the measuring points. Furthermore, you do not address the CADR values that are realized at different levels of the air cleaner. The sound level at the different levels is also not mentioned, although this is a critical factor for use in classrooms. The same applies to the A/C unit. I read online that a sound pressure level of 57 dB(A) is generated at the "Low" level, which is clearly too high and would in turn have an impact on the students' ability to concentrate. In my view, when you address the specific case in schools, you have to take these points into account.</p>
              <p>Response: We added sound level as a limitation in our discussion. We were concerned about the impact of the sound in the classroom; however, the air purifiers and A/C fans were not so loud and did not interfere with the ability to teach in the classroom. Furthermore, internet research indicates that 60 dB is conversation volume. We currently do not have a sketch of the classrooms but we included dimensions of the classrooms and location of the air purifiers in the classroom in the methods section.</p>
