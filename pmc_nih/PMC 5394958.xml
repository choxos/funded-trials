                <p>A vailable tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia bind in an adenosine 5â²-triphosphate-binding pocket and are affected by evolving mutations that confer resistance. Rebastinib was identified as a switch control inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 and FLT3 and may be active against resistant mutations. A Phase 1, first-in-human, single-agent study investigated rebastinib in relapsed or refractory chronic or acute myeloid leukemia. The primary objectives were to investigate the safety of rebastinib and establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose. Fifty-seven patients received treatment with rebastinib. Sixteen patients were treated using powder-in-capsule preparations at doses from 57 mg to 1200 mg daily, and 41 received tablet preparations at doses of 100 mg to 400 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were dysarthria, muscle weakness, and peripheral neuropathy. The maximum tolerated dose was 150 mg tablets administered twice daily. Rebastinib was rapidly absorbed. Bioavailability was 3- to 4-fold greater with formulated tablets compared to unformulated capsules. Eight complete hematologic responses were achieved in 40 evaluable chronic myeloid leukemia patients, 4 of which had a T315I mutation. None of the 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia responded. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed inhibition of phosphorylation of substrates of BCR-ABL1 or FLT3 by rebastinib. Although clinical activity was observed, clinical benefit was insufficient to justify continued development in chronic or acute myeloid leukemia. Pharmacodynamic analyses suggest that other kinases inhibited by rebastinib, such as TIE2, may be more relevant targets for the clinical development of rebastinib (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier:00827138</italic>).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Genetic changes that alter tyrosine kinase function are found in multiple malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In CML, the BCR-ABL1 translocation is the hallmark of the disease, leading to constitutive kinase signaling.<sup><xref rid="b1-1020519" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have altered the natural history of CML.<sup><xref rid="b2-1020519" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-1020519" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In AML, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) also leads to constitutive activation of FLT3, and likewise, FLT3 inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML.<sup><xref rid="b4-1020519" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-1020519" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="b8-1020519" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although TKIs are very effective treatments for CML, resistance and disease progression eventually occur in some patients. Second generation ABL1 TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) are not effective against the T315I BCR-ABL1 mutation, which is the most prevalent mutation found in patients progressing on these agents.<sup><xref rid="b9-1020519" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-1020519" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The recent approval of ponatinib has added a treatment effective against the T315I mutation to the therapeutic armamentarium.<sup><xref rid="b11-1020519" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, resistance to ponatinib has been observed in some patients, making the development of new T315I-targeted inhibitors a necessity.</p>
              <p>All TKIs currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration inhibit their target kinases by competing with adenosine 5â²-triphosphate (ATP) for binding. Rebastinib (DCC 2036) is a âswitch controlâ inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including ABL1, FLT3, and TIE2.<sup><xref rid="b12-1020519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Based on crystallographic analyses, rebastinib binds as a type II inhibitor that additionally penetrates into and binds the switch control pocket of the ABL1 kinase domain, key amino acid residues that mediate the change from inactive to active conformation. Through occupancy of this switch control pocket, rebastinib blocks the conformational process required for kinase activation. This unique binding mode enables rebastinib to maintain the ABL1 kinase domain in the inactive conformation, independent of the state of phosphorylation of the regulatory Tyr 393. Additionally, for certain TKI resistance mutations that also dysregulate and activate c-ABL1 (e.g., T315I and Y253F), rebastinib binding forces these mutant variants of BCR-ABL1 to adopt inactive conformations, durably blocking downstream cellular signaling pathways.<sup><xref rid="b12-1020519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="b16-1020519" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Rebastinib inhibits the BCR-ABL1 T315I mutant kinase in an ATP noncompetitive manner, even at the high millimolar concentrations of ATP found intracellularly. <italic>In vivo</italic>, rebastinib is effective in a mouse model of CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia induced by BCR-ABL1 T315I.<sup><xref rid="b12-1020519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Potential advantages of switch pocket inhibitors compared to ATP-competitive inhibitors include longer off-rates compared to ATP-binding site inhibitors due to their binding into the deeply embedded switch pocket, and the fact that switch pockets are more varied in sequence from kinase to kinase than are ATP-binding pockets. The latter could potentially lead to inhibition of fewer off-target kinases.</p>

                <p>Patients â¥18 years old were eligible if they had a diagnosis of CML in chronic, accelerated or blast phase resistant to â¥2 TKIs or with T315I mutation, or had resistant or refractory AML with FLT3 ITD and had not received prior FLT3 inhibitors, or were â¥60 years old and not candidates for standard chemotherapy. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of â¤2 for patients with CML and â¤1 for those with AML was required. After the MTD was established, only patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP CML) and accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (AP CML) were enrolled into a CML expansion portion. After treating 13 patients in the CML expansion portion, enrollment was further limited to patients with CP-CML with the T315I mutation. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in the <italic>Online Supplementary Information</italic>.</p>
                <p>Rebastinib was administered orally daily in continuous 28 day cycles. Dosing started with powder-in-capsules (PIC) at 57 mg once daily (QD), escalating in 11 consecutive cohorts up to 1200 mg QD. Doses between the planned initial single-patient cohorts were increased by 100%. Subsequent cohorts enrolled at least 3 patients each in an accelerated 3+3 dose-escalation design, whereupon occurrence of grade â¥2 adverse events (AEs) accelerated titration stopped and a standard 3+3 design came into effect. During the trial, formulated tablets were introduced to seek more predictable pharmacokinetics. These were administered to patients in 3 cohorts from 100 mg to 200 mg. Patients receiving PIC were transferred to tablets after the safety of tablets had been confirmed. Intra-patient dose-escalation was permitted to a higher dose that had been evaluated in other patients for at least 28 days.</p>

                <p>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as the occurrence of one of the following AEs, which were considered to be at least possibly related to rebastinib during the first treatment cycle of the dose-escalation portion: 1) Grade 4 hematologic toxicity sustained for â¥4 weeks (â¥6 weeks in patients with prior bone marrow transplantation), 2) â¥Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that could be managed to â¤Grade 2 severity), and 3) any rebastinib-attributed AE that resulted in a treatment delay â¥28 days. Twenty seven patients were treated in the dose-escalation portion. Three patients experienced a DLT in the first cycle of treatment (<xref rid="t3-1020519" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). After exceeding the MTD at 200 mg tablets twice daily (BID), an additional 30 patients were enrolled in the expansion portion at 150 mg tablets BID.

                <p>One patient in the 1200 mg QD dose level (PIC) experienced 2 DLTs (Grade 3 dysarthria and muscular weakness). This dose level was not expanded to 6 patients because of a planned change to tablet formulation. Two patients experienced a DLT in the first cycle of the 200 mg BID dose level with tablets; one experienced Grade 3 muscle weakness of their upper and lower extremities and the other experienced Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Consequently, the tablet dose of 150 mg BID was determined to be the MTD, and this dose cohort was expanded with an additional 27 patients to further characterize the safety profile. Of these 27 patients, 18 experienced a Grade 3 adverse event of special interest (AESI) considered possibly or probably related.</p>
                <p>Analyses of all 57 (100%) patients showed that all experienced at least one AE of any grade during the entire treatment.

The most common Grade 3 and 4 AEs (incidence &gt;5%) were: muscular weakness (13 patients, 23%), hypertension (4 patients, 7.0%), and dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and blurred vision (3 patients each, 5%) (<xref rid="t4-1020519" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Twenty six (46%) of the â¥Grade 3 AEs were considered related (Grade 3/4/5: 25 patients [44%]/0 patients/1 patient [2%], respectively). The most common Grade 3 and 4 related AEs (incidence &gt;5%) were muscular weakness (12 patients, 21%), and myalgia and blurred vision (3 patients each, 5%). A total of 34 patients (60%) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) (as reported by the investigator) during the study. The most common SAEs included muscular weakness (4 patients, 7%), disease progression, and pneumonia (3 patients each, 5%). In 18 patients (32%), these SAEs were considered related to study treatment. The most common study drug related SAE was muscular weakness (4 patients, 7%). Related SAEs occurred at dose levels of 300 mg BID and 1200 mg QD with PIC; and 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg BID with tablets (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S2</italic>). No treatment-related SAE was reported for patients treated at dose levels below 300 mg BID (PIC) and 100 mg QD (tablet).</p>
                <p>Events suggestive of musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., muscular weakness and myopathy), nervous system disorders (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy), as well as visual abnormalities (e.g., blurred vision) were identified as AESIs (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S3</italic> and <italic>Table S4</italic>). Musculoskeletal disorders of all grades was reported in 22 patients who experienced 34 events. In 14 of the 22 patients, musculoskeletal disorders occurred during Cycle 1. Among the 22 patients, 13 experienced Grade 3 events, and no Grade 4 event occurred. Recovery was documented in 11 of the patients within several days of halting rebastinib administration, and 2 patients discontinued study treatment due to musculoskeletal disorders. In the majority of cases, these events were reported during the first cycle of therapy. Nineteen patients (33%) experienced AEs of any grade collectively suggestive of nervous system disorders. Two patients with Grade 3 nervous system disorders continued on decreased rebastinib dosages, and the nervous system disorder resolved. Twenty-four AEs of visual abnormalities were reported in 19 patients (33%). Four out of 5 patients with 2 reported AEs recovered from at least 1 event. Thirteen out of 14 patients with Grade 1 as the highest severity, 2/2 with Grade 2, and 3/3 with Grade 3 reported recovery from visual abnormalities. Two patients with Grade 3 visual abnormalities discontinued from the study due to the AE. In 10 of the 19 patients, visual abnormalities were first reported during Cycle 1 (Grade 1/2/3: 6/1/3 patients, respectively). Treatment interruption was required in 3 patients; 1 patient with Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 visual abnormalities each and recovery from the event was documented (<italic>data not shown</italic>).</p>
                <p>In addition, 4 CML patients (7%) experienced AEs suggestive of a potential â¥Grade 3 cardiomyopathy (congestive cardiac failure in 2 patients, viral cardiomyopathy in 1 patient, and cardiomyopathy in 1 patient). The patient who was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy on Day 1 had a medical history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He was immediately withdrawn from the study due to this event. Grade 3 congestive cardiac failure in another patient occurred on Day 4 and led to death on Day 7. Since 1998 this patient had received, among other therapies, interferon, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. The patient had a history of previous pleural effusion on dasatinib, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic dyspnea, and tachycardia. The third patient presented on Day 7 with Grade 3 cardiomyopathy; his symptoms included Grade 3 elevated cardiac enzymes and Grade 2 atrial fibrillation. He had a history of hypertension and received imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib as prior CML treatment. This patient recovered after cardiac conversion to a normal sinus rhythm. The fourth patient presented with Grade 3 bronchitis on Day 211, followed by Grade 3 congestive cardiac failure on Day 213 and died due to cardiac failure 2 days later. This patients prior therapies for CML included imatinib and dasatinib. His medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and bicuspid aortic stenosis with valve replacement.

                <p>In addition to BCR-ABL1 and FLT3, rebastinib is a potent TIE2 inhibitor (<italic>unpublished data</italic>). In selected patients, elevated plasma levels of the TIE2 ligand angiopoietin 2 (ANG2) were observed on Day 22 compared to baseline levels. ANG2 increases were observed in 19/20 of the Day 22 patient samples, with no change observed in 1/20 samples (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Both C<sub>max</sub> and trough exposures of rebastinib on Day 8 significantly correlated with increased levels of plasma ANG2. Increased plasma ANG2 levels also correlated with trough rebastinib exposures on Day 22 (<italic>data not shown</italic>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This Phase 1 study of the switch-control inhibitor, rebastinib, was conducted in patients with relapsed CML and AML based on its potency against ABL1 and FLT3. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies had established that rebastinib is an effective inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 and other kinases.<sup><xref rid="b12-1020519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The MTD of continuously administered rebastinib was determined to be 150 mg BID, with dysarthria, muscular weakness, and peripheral neuropathy representing the DLTs at a dose of 200 mg BID. Expansion of the 150 mg BID dose cohort consolidated the safety findings of the dose-escalation. The most common AEs included muscular weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and visual abnormalities. In addition, 4 patients experienced severe cardiac AEs during the study.</p>
              <p>Visual abnormalities have been recently described with other TKIs.<sup><xref rid="b20-1020519" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-1020519" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Such events observed with rebastinib were mostly of mild severity, and many of the events resolved with no change to rebastinib dosing. Since there were no significant ocular findings in preclinical animal studies, detailed baseline ophthalmologic examinations were not performed at baseline in this study, and a potential contribution of pre-existing conditions or the underlying disease could not be ruled out. Baseline and serial ophthalmologic examinations will be included in forthcoming studies in order to gain insight into the relatedness of the blurred vision seen with rebastinib in CML and AML patients. The mechanism by which these events are mediated will also need to be investigated.</p>
              <p>A number of TKIs have been associated with a low incidence of cardiomyopathy occurring after months of treatment.<sup><xref rid="b22-1020519" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The rebastinib study herein documented 3 cases of cardiomyopathy occurring during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Since these patients had alternative potential causes of cardiomyopathy, and there was no screening of cardiac function at baseline in this study, the relationship seen between cardiomyopathy events and rebastinib exposure is not clear. However, preclinical studies have suggested that ABL inhibition may lead to myocardial toxicity.<sup><xref rid="b23-1020519" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Future rebastinib studies will include baseline and serial echocardiography studies to carefully investigate cardiac function. The pharmacokinetics parameters of rebastinib indicated rapid absorption of the drug, and an increase, though less than dose-proportional, in exposure with dosage. The T<sub>1/2</sub> was 12â15 hours; however, due to the biphasic elimination of rebastinib resulting in trough concentrations of generally 10â20% of C<sub>max</sub>, some accumulation should be expected with a BID dosing regimen. Average plasma levels of 200 ng/mL (360 nM) were achieved transiently from ~1â4 hours postdose at the MTD of 150 mg BID. At this exposure level, the amount of free drug in circulation is expected to be ~1.3 nM (based on determined human plasma protein binding of 99.65%). With regards to potential off-target effects of rebastinib, the only kinases that would be inhibited by â¥50% at concentrations of &lt;1.3 nM include c-ABL1 (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.7 nM), TIE2 (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.058 nM), and TRKA and TRKB (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.17 nM and 0.42 nM, respectively).<sup><xref rid="b12-1020519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Further monitoring of AESIs will help to understand the off-target effects or collateral âtargetâ effects of rebastinib.</p>
              <p>A safety exposure analysis that investigated the relationship of AESIs of cardiac, eye, musculoskeletal, and peripheral neuropathy/nervous systems disorders to rebastinib exposure measured as C<sub>max</sub> or AUC(<sub>0â4h</sub>) suggested that AESIs of musculoskeletal and peripheral neuropathy/nervous systems disorders may be related to rebastinib exposure. Regarding the severity of cardiac and ocular disorders, an increase in these disorders with an increase in rebastinib exposure cannot be ruled out. The understanding of safety exposure outcomes for cardiac and ocular disorders will improve from longitudinal monitoring in future studies.</p>
              <p>Pharmacodynamic data show that the rebastinib plasma concentrations achieved in patients inhibited BCR-ABL1 in patient samples, including mutant alleles of BCR-ABL1, like T315I. Patients with CML who entered this trial were resistant or intolerant to &gt; 1 of other BCR-ABL1 TKIs. In approximately half of the cases, no mutations were present in BCR-ABL1, possibly indicating activation of other pathways for cell survival. Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 in these patients, as monitored by pharmacodynamic analysis, may not necessarily correlate with clinical response. In addition, postdose levels of rebastinib in certain patients may not have inhibited phosphorylation of targets to the level needed to irreversibly commit leukemic progenitors to apoptosis, and thereby achieve a response.<sup><xref rid="b24-1020519" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> While rebastinib exposures at 150 mg BID on average were above or near the level required for 80% inhibition of BCR-ABL1 for the entire dosing period, exposures were only above the IC<sub>80</sub> for inhibition of T315I mutant BCR-ABL1 for ~3 hours after each dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1020519">Figure 2</xref>). Based on experience with other BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, a higher dose, e.g., 175 mg BID, if it would have been tested and tolerated, would probably not have led to an improved efficacy outcome in the case of BCR-ABL1 T315I resistance mutations.</p>
              <p>When this study was designed, the only drug with activity against the BCR-ABL1 T315I mutation was omacetaxine mepesuccinate, which yields cytogenetic responses in ~20% of CP-CML patients.<sup><xref rid="b25-1020519" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Although the overall cytogenetic response rate of CML patients to rebastinib (21%) was comparable to that of omacetaxine, the response rate was considerably lower than that which has subsequently been reported with ponatinib in a comparable patient population.<sup><xref rid="b11-1020519" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thus, continued development of rebastinib in CML may not be justified. Pharmacodynamic analysis suggested the inhibition of other rebastinib-targeted kinases in patients receiving rebastinib, such as TIE2 in particular. Compensatory elevations in circulating ligands upon the inhibition of their cognate receptor kinases have been frequently observed clinically. For example, the inhibition of VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 by sunitinib leads to increases in the plasma levels of VEGF and PlGF in patients.<sup><xref rid="b26-1020519" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Thus, increased plasma ANG2 levels observed in patients on the trial herein provide evidence of TIE2 inhibition by rebastinib in humans. Future clinical development of rebastinib will focus more on diseases involving TIE2 or TIE2-expressing macrophages and the tumor microenvironment. The ANG/TIE2 kinase signaling pathway is a pivotal signaling axis in the tumor microenvironment, mediating tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell intravasation, extravasation, therapy resistance, and immunosuppression.<sup><xref rid="b27-1020519" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="b30-1020519" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> TIE2 is expressed in endothelial cells and a subset of highly protumoral macrophages, referred to as TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs), both of which contribute to tumor angiogenesis.<sup><xref rid="b31-1020519" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that TEMs expand an immunosuppressive population of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment.<sup><xref rid="b29-1020519" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b32-1020519" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In addition, it was reported that TEMs mediate tumor cell vascular intravasation and extravasation, and ultimately the formation of metastases.<sup><xref rid="b33-1020519" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â<xref rid="b35-1020519" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Data from <italic>in vitro</italic> assays indicate that the testing of a daily dose lower than the MTD defined in the study herein is warranted for TIE2 inhibition in future studies. This hypothesis is being tested in an ongoing clinical trial (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier:02824575</italic>).</p>
