                  <p>The Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal Internet study designed to characterize the course of episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). Participants were recruited from a Web-panel using quota sampling in an attempt to obtain a sample demographically similar to the US population. Participants who passed the screener were assessed every three months with the Core (baseline, six, and 12 months) and Snapshot (months three and nine) modules, which assessed headache frequency, headache-related disability, treatments, and treatment satisfaction. The Core also assessed resource use, health-related quality of life, and other features. One-time cross-sectional modules measured family burden, barriers to medical care, and comorbidities/endophenotypes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Migraine is a common and often debilitating condition, with a one-year prevalence of 11.7% to 13.2% in studies from the United States (US) (<xref rid="bibr1-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr3-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Migraine is generally divided into two groups based on headache days per month. Episodic migraine (EM) is characterized by &lt;15 headache days per month and chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by ≥15 headache days per month. However, the definition of CM has evolved over the past 25 years (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), most recently with the 2013 release of ICHD-3 beta (<xref rid="bibr5-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>EM and CM have been well characterized in population studies from many regions of the world (<xref rid="bibr2-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr14-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and results have been summarized in meta-analyses (<xref rid="bibr15-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

              <p>Despite previous in-depth population studies, much remains to be discovered about the effects of EM and CM on individuals. Largely uninvestigated areas include 1) the natural history or longitudinal disease course of EM and CM over a single year, 2) barriers to effective diagnosis and treatment of migraine (especially CM), 3) differences between EM and CM in observed impact and burden on families, and 4) comprehensive comorbidity profiling and differential association with EM and CM. The Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study was designed to extend knowledge about these and other issues. The longitudinal assessments were designed to enhance understanding of the natural history of and subject-specific variations in attack frequency, disability, psychiatric comorbidities, and treatment. In addition, a series of cross-sectional modules assessed previously unexplored aspects of barriers to care, comorbidities, and family burden of migraine among those with CM and EM. In this first report from the CaMEO Study, we describe methodology and design, explore nonresponse bias, and present preliminary findings on respondent demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and headache-related disability.</p>

                  <p>The study had a screening and recruiting phase and then longitudinal assessments approximately every three months over one year. In addition, a series of cross-sectional surveys assessed health care use, family burden, and comorbidities/endophenotypes.

                  <p>The screening and recruiting phases occurred from September 2012 through October 2012. Members of an Internet research panel (Research Now, Plano, TX), which has 2.4 million active US members, provided the sampling frame. Panel members were carefully screened and selected to be broadly representative of the US population. Quota sampling was used in an attempt to recruit a study sample that was representative of US population demography. Email invitations were sent to 489,537 panel members inviting them to complete the Screening Module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102414552532">Figure 1</xref>), which was a brief survey capturing headache information and demographics (median completion time = 8 minutes; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102414552532">Table 1</xref>). The Study Population section describes the screener’s operating characteristics and migraine definitions used in the CaMEO Study.

                <p>In stage 2, the Comorbidities/Endophenotypes Module (median completion time = 19 minutes) collected data on a broad set of indicators (e.g. migraine features, allergies and respiratory disorders, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, sleep problems, autonomic disorders, psychiatric disorders, and internal disorders; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0333102414552532">Table 3</xref>), in an attempt to discover new empirically supported subclasses of migraine and increase taxonomic classification accuracy within the migraine spectrum.</p>
                <p>The Family Burden Module assessed headache-related burden from the perspective of the migraineur (proband), their partners (i.e. spouses/significant others), and their children. The Proband Family Burden Module assessed the proband’s perspective on the impact of their headaches on family well-being, interpersonal relationships, and family and social interactions and activities as well as the impact of migraine on family finances, career, and health-related quality of life (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0333102414552532">Table 3</xref>). Partners and children were identified by the proband; participating partners and children reported their perspectives on the effect of the proband’s migraines on family life.</p>

                  <p>The migraine Screening Module (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102414552532">Table 1</xref>), based on the American Migraine Study (AMS)/the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study diagnostic module (<xref rid="bibr7-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), was used for migraine classification. This screener has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 82% for migraine diagnosis (<xref rid="bibr30-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 80% for CM diagnosis (<xref rid="bibr31-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The screener was based on lifetime recall of migraine symptoms associated with the respondents’ most severe headache (e.g. unilateral, pulsating, moderate/severe pain intensity, routine activity exacerbation of headache pain, nausea, phonophobia, photophobia), and was used to make modified ICHD-3 beta migraine classifications (<xref rid="bibr5-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although the AMS/AMPP diagnostic module was based on ICHD-2 migraine criteria, no significant changes occurred between ICHD-2 and ICHD-3 beta that are related to the criteria used in this study. The AMS/AMPP diagnostic module classification criteria were considered modifications of ICHD-3 beta migraine criteria because two criteria were not confirmed: ≥5 lifetime migraine events (criterion A) and duration of attack untreated from four to 72 hours (criterion B).</p>
                  <p>In addition, this module assessed baseline headache frequency with a single open-response item on three-month recall of headache days, which was averaged to obtain a one-month headache day rate to classify respondents as having EM or CM using modified Silberstein-Lipton criteria (headache frequency of ≥15 (CM) or &lt;15 (EM) days per month over the preceding three months) (<xref rid="bibr32-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The modified Silberstein-Lipton CM criteria employed in the CaMEO Study align to ICHD-3 beta criteria for CM, except for the requirement that ≥8 of the headache days per month be migraine (criterion C from the ICHD-3 beta CM criteria). Criterion C was not employed because it is difficult to assess in a large, self-report data-collection paradigm and requires the use of a diary and physician interview to accurately assess.</p>
                  <p>Only reliable respondents were included in the final sample (defined as those who completed baseline surveys in a reasonable time to read and respond to items (≥10 minutes), and reported consistent age and sex). Respondents eligible for inclusion were reliable active panel members, aged ≥18 years, met migraine criteria, and had experienced ≥1 headache within the past 12 months.</p>

                  <p>For the proband, partners were defined as “currently in a relationship with a spouse, partner, or significant other.” Partners were eligible to participate if they had cohabitated with the proband for ≥2 months. Eligible child respondents included adolescent/adult children, grandchildren, and stepchildren aged 13 to 29 years, cohabitating with the proband for ≥2 months. Because of the risk of potentially low partner and child Family Burden Module response rates, baseline respondents who were considered to be over-quota, but otherwise qualified for the CaMEO Study, were resampled for the Family Burden Module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102414552532">Figure 1</xref>).

              <p>The CaMEO Study is a large Internet survey of the US population designed to identify individuals with EM and CM and chart their longitudinal course with assessments every three months over one year. In addition, the CaMEO Study assessed barriers to care, comorbidities/endophenotypes, and family burden of EM and CM. A large number of studies examining EM, CM, or both (e.g. systematic reviews by Natoli et al. (<xref rid="bibr16-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and Stovner et al.

Previous large population-based studies designed to identify and characterize US migraineurs with EM or CM (including prevalence estimates) used postal mail surveys or telephone interviews (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0333102414552532">Table 7</xref>); only the International Burden of Migraine Study (IBMS), which included the US, used Internet surveys. As with the CaMEO Study, IBMS was not designed to be population based; however, IBMS was a cross-sectional international burden of illness study, and therefore did not have longitudinal assessments.

Study design and population differences, including international versus US participation, may result in inconsistent demographic data between studies.</p>
              <p>The CaMEO Study found that the rate of disability days per month (using MIDAS) was 3.63 times greater for those with CM than for those with EM. This is consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Thus, chronic migraineurs are less able to perform work and leisure activities than those with EM, in line with previous findings of a direct correlation between attack frequency and headache-related disability for people with migraine (<xref rid="bibr38-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the CaMEO Study, socioeconomic status was reduced in those with CM compared with those with EM, as chronic migraineurs were found to have less education, less full- or part-time employment, and were more likely to have lower annual income. This finding is generally consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bibr17-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); however, IBMS and the Taiwanese clinic study found similar annual household income in EM and CM groups (<xref rid="bibr9-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This discrepancy with the CaMEO Study may be caused by potentially different income sources internationally (e.g. work, government-issued disability payments). A single-center outpatient study (<xref rid="bibr19-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found the CM group had less education, and was more likely to be married than those with EM.</p>

                <title>Assessment of potential bias</title>
                <p>All surveys are prone to selection bias, which can include under-coverage, voluntary response bias, and nonresponse bias. Under-coverage occurs when some members of the population are inadequately represented in the sample. The CaMEO Study addressed this by balancing the target sample on key demographics and by adjusting for demographic characteristics in the analyses. Voluntary response bias occurs when respondents are self-selected volunteers and may represent those with the strongest opinions or most severe disease. Although not directly assessed in the CaMEO Study, we suspect that this effect may work in both directions; more severe migraine cases may be both unable to respond and more interested in responding, which may negate this potential source of bias. Beyond the rates of CM, the AMPP Study, US IBMS, AMS, and CaMEO Study profiles are similar (<xref rid="bibr2-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr8-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), which suggests that biases in CaMEO are not very different from these earlier studies.</p>
                <p>The CaMEO Study was not designed to be a prevalence study. We acknowledged at inception that use of online panel sampling would limit generalizability in a way that mailed surveys do not, thus precluding explorations of prevalence. But prevalence has been well addressed (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and was not of central interest here. Though we used probability sampling of quotas from a nationally distributed online panel to obtain the CaMEO migraine sample, response rates were low. Only 16.5% of invitees responded, 11.9% of whom provided useable data.</p>
                <p>Analyses of nonresponse are imperative to understand the implications of survey results, as characteristics of nonrespondents may differ from those of respondents (<xref rid="bibr40-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Nonresponse bias occurs when individuals chosen for the sample are unwilling or unable to participate in the survey, causing respondents to differ in meaningful ways from nonrespondents. To assess this potential source of bias in the CaMEO Study, we sent a follow-up survey to nonrespondents to obtain demographics and disease severity (see the online Supplementary Appendix). Comparison of respondent and nonrespondent demographic data found that large sample sizes exaggerated the significance of small differences (online Supplementary Table 1). Respondents to the Nonrespondent Survey and the initial survey are similar; however, the low rate of participation in the Nonrespondent Survey leaves open the possibility of nonresponse bias.</p>
                <p>This study has several limitations. All data were collected via self-report, and no supporting documentation or medical or pharmacy records were collected for verification, as this would be impractical given the large study size. As noted above, despite quota sampling, baseline demographic characteristics differed between the CaMEO Study respondents and nonrespondents (online Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Consistent with other epidemiologic studies (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), the large sample sizes in CaMEO may have made minor demographic differences become significant. The migraine-positive case rate in the overall Nonrespondent Survey was generally similar to that of the respondents, suggesting disease state did not present a sampling bias. However, data for only 2.0% of nonrespondents (8225/408,754) were available for these analyses, and thus may not be representative of the entire set of nonrespondents. Other analyses of nonrespondents have found that nonresponse was associated with low socioeconomic status, but not health status (<xref rid="bibr40-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Because the variable of interest in our study is health status (i.e. migraine), it is possible that any differences that may have been caused by nonresponse may not have a great effect (<xref rid="bibr40-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Benefits/risks of conducting large-scale epidemiologic studies in national online sampling panels</title>
                  <p>Internet research panels provide the advantage of enabling access to large numbers of willing survey participants who can be sampled and stratified according to pre-identified demographic and disease/symptom-based criteria. In CaMEO, over the course of a year, we succeeded in screening and following 16,789 migraineurs, replicated many of the findings of prior studies like the AMPP Study during the data processing and verification phase, and succeeded in obtaining our target sample proportions. We succeeded in guiding a total of 3626 migraineurs through five complete waves of longitudinal assessments and 3513 migraineurs with complete data through all nine study modules. However, Internet data capture, by virtue of its electronic and nearly automatic nature, is not faultless and the risk remains that some groups of interest may be over- or under-sampled because of issues of Internet access (<xref rid="bibr41-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="bibr42-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr43-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr44-0333102414552532" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and a lack of rigor in the management of Internet panel members.</p>
                  <p>Internet sampling panels often have limits on the number of studies in which members can participate. These limits are set by the panelist and are designed to minimize panelist burden and optimize participation. Our sampling protocol required panelist limits to be overridden so that baseline participants would receive invitations to all modules and every phase of the quarterly longitudinal assessments. This occurred in nearly all cases, except in wave 4 of the longitudinal assessment and a few cases spread across other modules.</p>
                  <p>In wave 4 panelist limits were not overridden for 1657 active participants. As a result, these 1657 participants never received invitations for wave 4; the number of these cases that would have responded in wave 4 had they been invited is unclear. To estimate the impact of the omission of these cases, we focused on a decomposition of the 34% of cases (556/1657) who had not attrited by wave 3. Our best estimate of those we would have lost has a lower and upper estimate based on responsiveness patterns among these 34% of cases. Our lower bound is based on those who responded sequentially in all waves 1 to 3, but not in wave 5. Our upper bound is based on those who responded in every wave but wave 4, the wave to which they were not invited. Our lower bound total sample is 184 subjects, who represent 2.8% of the 6362 wave 4 respondents. These 184 cases were composed of 173 persons with EM (2.9% of wave 4 EM respondents) and 11 individuals with CM (2.7% of wave 4 CM respondents). Our upper bound total sample was <italic>n</italic> = 372, constituting 5.8% of the 6362 wave 4 respondents. These 372 cases were composed of 335 people with EM (5.6% of the wave 4 EM respondents) and 37 people with CM (9% of wave 4 CM respondents). For our primary group of interest, there were an estimated 11 to 37 additional CM cases that could have been obtained at wave 4 but were not, and our expected CM sample for wave 4 in the absence of this limit filter error would move from the observed 406 CM cases to 417 or 443 CM cases, depending on the estimate.</p>
                  <p>There were also 199 cases who were eligible for at least one component of the Family Burden Module (either proband or partner), 15 cases who should have been invited to the Comorbidities/Endophenotypes Module, and four cases who should have been invited to the wave 2 Snapshot Module who were not invited because of this restriction limit error.</p>
                  <p>Despite limitations, the strengths of the CaMEO Study include a large nationwide sample (<italic>n</italic> = 16,789) and repeated assessments at three-month intervals. This provides a novel longitudinal perspective on the course and consequences of migraine. Cross-sectional modules were designed to fill a gap in knowledge about migraine and will provide novel data on previously unexamined aspects of migraine, including headache-related family burden, barriers to and patterns of migraine care, endophenotypes, and comorbidities among those with CM and EM.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Baseline results from the CaMEO Study confirmed previous findings that CM is associated with increased headache-related disability, psychiatric comorbidities, and greater financial and occupational burden than is EM. As more data are analyzed, the CaMEO Study will continue to provide a naturalistic understanding of the longitudinal course and consequences of EM and CM; quantify variations in headache frequency, headache-related disability, comorbidities, medication use, and effect of migraine on the family unit; and contribute a wealth of information to the limited amount of data on CM. The insights gleaned from the CaMEO Study into the characteristics of EM and CM will help to optimize future treatment paradigms to improve outcomes for the many individuals affected by migraine.</p>
