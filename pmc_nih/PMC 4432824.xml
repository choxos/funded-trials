                  <p>Propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, exerts an indirect effect on the vasculature by leaving α-adrenergic receptors unopposed, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction. We have previously shown that propranolol diminishes peripheral blood following burn injury by increasing vascular resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether wound healing and perioperative hemodynamics are affected by propranolol administration in severely burned adults.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Sixty-nine adult patients with burns covering ≥30% of the total body surface area (TBSA) were enrolled in this IRB-approved study. Patients received standard burn care with (n = 35) or without (control, n = 34) propranolol. Propranolol was administered within 48 hours of burns and given throughout hospital discharge to decrease heart rate by approximately 20% from admission levels. Wound healing was determined by comparing the time between grafting procedures. Blood loss was determined by comparing pre- and postoperative hematocrit while factoring in operative graft area. Data were collected between first admission and first discharge.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Demographics, burn size, and mortality were comparable in the control and propranolol groups. Patients in the propranolol group received an average propranolol dose of 3.3 ± 3.0 mg/kg/day. Daily average heart rate over the first 30 days was significantly lower in the propranolol group (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05). The average number of days between skin grafting procedures was also lower in propranolol patients (10 ± 5 days) than in control patients (17 ± 12 days; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02), indicative of a faster donor site healing time in the propranolol group. Packed red blood cell infusion was similar between groups (control 5.3 ± 5.4 units vs. propranolol 4.4 ± 3.1 units, <italic>P</italic> = 0.89). Propranolol was associated with a 5 to 7% improvement in perioperative hematocrit during grafting procedures of 4,000 to 16,000 cm<sup>2</sup> compared to control (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002).</p>

                  <p>Administration of propranolol during the acute hospitalization period diminishes blood loss during skin grafting procedures and markedly improves wound healing in severely burned adults. As burn patients require serial surgical interventions for motor and cosmetic repair, restricting blood loss during operative intervention is optimal.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>A severe burn injury is characterized by a profound increase in metabolism, far beyond that produced by other forms of trauma. Hypermetabolism is mediated by a surge in stress hormones including catecholamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and glucocorticoids and may persist long after the initial burn insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cardiac stress following burn injury is characterized by increased cardiac work, cardiac output, resting heart rate, rate pressure product, and stroke volume. If left untreated, these perturbations in cardiac physiology contribute greatly toward postburn morbidity and mortality.</p>
              <p>Hyperdynamic changes to the cardiovascular system are frequently associated with copious amounts of operative blood loss. Paired with inadequate resuscitative efforts and shifts in fluid compartments, these changes cause many patients with burn injury to become hemodynamically unstable. Additionally, as patients with burn injury undergo serial skin grafting procedures, limiting hemorrhage during these operations becomes paramount to early recovery.</p>
              <p>Propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, has widespread systemic effects following burn injury. Recently, we reported that administration of propranolol in children with severe burn injury for one year significantly improves body composition, resting energy expenditure, and cardiac function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Attenuation of cardiac sequelae occurred in a dose-dependent manner with the most favorable results noted at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Peripherally, propranolol decreases lower limb blood flow by increasing leg vascular resistance in severely burned adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Induction of peripheral vasoconstriction by propranolol has led to the successful implementation of the β-blocker in the management of infantile hemangiomas, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] variceal bleeding, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and recurrent epistaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An overview of the mechanisms by which propranolol induces peripheral vasoconstriction is presented in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Whether or not the effects of these changes on cardiovascular function alter operative hemorrhage or wound healing times remains to be determined. Here we report the perioperative effects of propranolol administration in adults with severe burn injury in a prospective, single-institution study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism by which propranolol induces peripheral vasoconstriction. Induction of peripheral vasoconstriction by propranolol can be attributed to three main actions. (1) Inhibition of β<sub>1</sub> receptors in the heart decreases cardiac output, thereby inducing reflexive peripheral vasoconstriction via stimulation of α<sub>1</sub> receptors in vascular smooth muscle. (2) Direct inhibition of β<sub>2</sub> receptors incites peripheral vasoconstriction. (3) By blocking β-adrenergic effects of circulating catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor effects remain unopposed, resulting in vascular smooth muscle contraction. Solid arrows indicate direct effects, and broken arrows indicate indirect effects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13054_2015_913_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Patient enrollment and stratification</title>
                <p>One thousand seven hundred four patients were admitted or referred to the Blocker Burn Unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch between November 2004 and 1 January 2014. One thousand six hundred thirty-one patients did not meet the following inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, burn wounds covering ≥30% of the total body surface area (TBSA), treatment with at least one surgical skin grafting procedure, and consent to participate in data collection (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All patients meeting the inclusion criteria provided freely tendered consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX). The treatment protocols were stable during the study period, as determined by stability in the length of hospital stay (LOS) (0.5 days per percent TBSA burned), morbidity (infections, lung injury, and acute kidney injury), and mortality. Four patients randomized to the propranolol group never received propranolol and were excluded from the study. The data presented here were collected from 69 adult patients with burns who received standard of care established at our hospital and described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Within 48 hours of hospital admission, patients received either standard burn care treatment (control; n = 34) or standard burn care treatment plus propranolol (propranolol; n = 35), which was administered throughout hospitalization to decrease baseline heart rates by approximately 20%. Target dosing was achieved as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. If bradycardia occurred, the following dose of propranolol was withheld. Propranolol administration was re-initiated after 16 hours beginning at one half of the original dose. Thereafter, the dose was titrated back to target levels over the following 48 hours.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Patient enrollment diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13054_2015_913_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                <p>Over the first 24 hours following admission, resuscitation was accomplished per the Parkland formula (4 ml × weight (kg) × TBSA burned (%)) with lactated Ringer’s solution given incrementally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Hypovolemia was treated with crystalloid or colloid fluids based on the individual clinician’s preference. Vasotropes or inotropes were used when patients did not respond to volume infusion or if the patient was in septic shock. Total burn wound excision was performed on all patients within 48 hours of admission. Autograft and homograft skin were used to cover the wounds. Grafting procedures were repeated once the donor site wounds healed (approximately once a week). Therefore, the time in between grafting procedures indicated approximate wound healing times. Patients were discharged once wounds were deemed to be 95% healed.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>One of the most significant contributors to decreased morbidity and mortality following severe burn injury has been the advent of early operative burn wound excision executed within the first 48 hours following burn injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Delayed excision has been associated with increased wound contamination, graft loss, hospital stay, hemorrhage, sepsis, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although early excision is associated with decreased hemorrhage, patients with severe burn injury often require multiple skin grafting procedures. Consequently, operative intervention is often required when intraoperative hemorrhage is at a peak, during 2 to 16 days postburn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, pharmacotherapeutics that decrease intraoperative hemorrhage may augment hemodynamic recovery following surgical intervention in patients with burn injury.</p>
              <p>In this prospective study, we investigated the effects of propranolol on the cardiovascular system and wound healing in 69 adults with severe burn injury. Demographic and burn injury characteristics did not differ between groups except with regard to TBSA burned. As patients in the control group sustained significantly larger burns over greater percentages of the TBSA, it is expected that these patients would exhibit more operative blood loss during burn excision. However, we have previously shown that, during primary burn excision in children, the area of TBSA burned is not a significant determinant of blood loss. Rather, the area of devitalized tissue excised contributes to approximately 50% of the variability in blood loss during skin grafting procedures. Furthermore, the extent of full-thickness burn injury is associated with significantly more blood loss as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the implementation of a bias due to the significant difference in TBSA burned between groups in this study was not of concern as both groups experienced a similar severity of full-thickness burn (control 45 ± 29% vs. propranolol 40 ± 22%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.48).</p>
              <p>Propranolol significantly reduced the time between grafting surgeries by one week, on average. This data is consistent with results from a study of 79 Iranian patients with moderate burn injury (approximately 30% TBSA burns) in which propranolol improved healing times of both partial and full-thickness burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, it should be noted that the investigators of the aforementioned study excised burn wounds according to a delayed approach, approximately one month after initial burn injury.</p>
              <p>β-adrenergic receptors are found widely in cutaneous fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. Pullar and colleagues reviewed the effects of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor modulation on wound repair and reported modulatory effects on cell proliferation and migration via galvanotaxis, inflammation via neutrophil chemotaxis, wound contraction and re-epithelialization via keratinocyte migration and fibroblast mediation, and angiogenesis via cyclic AMP-mediated vascular endothelial-derived growth factor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In fact, β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor inhibition in a murine model resulted in increased dermal fibroblast function and re-epithelialization during the early stages of wound repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Alterations in microvascular blood flow induced by β-blockade may play a role in wound healing as well. In a rodent model, low (2 mg/kg) and high (20 mg/kg) doses of propranolol resulted in 35% lower cortical regional cerebral blood flow than the control treatment. Additionally, propranolol significantly reduced mean oxygen consumption without effecting oxygen saturation levels compared to the control treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Regarding coagulation, propranolol abolished isoproterenol-induced increases in plasma von Willebrand factor antigen levels but had no effect on tissue factor or D-dimer expression in hypertensive patients. These data suggest that propranolol may protect against endothelial cell damage, as increased von Willebrand factor levels are indicative of vascular injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Here we report significantly faster donor site wound healing times in patients receiving propranolol following burn injury. Ongoing studies of the samples from these patients will allow for elucidation of the molecular effects of propranolol that underlie improved healing after burn injury.</p>
              <p>On average, patients in the propranolol cohort underwent operative procedures with graft areas 1,200 cm<sup>2</sup> larger than those in the control group. The goals of early excision of the burn wound include the removal of all devitalized and necrotic tissue, which if left untreated, would provoke bacterial contamination and impede adequate wound healing. More often than not, an accurate assessment of partial thickness and full-thickness burns cannot be obtained until patients undergo operative intervention. Burn patients are assessed on a case-by-case basis with final evaluation of skin graft area being decided within the operating theater. Error in primary clinical assessment of viable and nonviable tissue likely explains the difference in final graft area required. As estimated blood loss is often an inaccurate and subjective assessment of hemorrhage, we decided to measure blood loss using an objective approach. Perioperative hematocrit levels were plotted against skin graft area, accounting for severity of injury and surgical intervention for each patient. We found that propranolol administration was associated with a 5% improvement in perioperative hematocrit levels during skin grafting procedures of 4,000 cm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, the attenuation of blood loss was even more profound after larger skin grafting procedures. These findings may be attributed to the various effects of propranolol on the cardiovascular system.</p>
              <p>Direct inhibition of β-adrenergic receptors in the heart decreases heart rate, blood flow, and cardiac output. Angiogenesis may be attenuated via vasoconstriction, and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor may limit operative hemorrhage with propranolol administration. Similarly, propranolol enhances upregulation of capillary endothelial cells and apoptosis, further limiting angiogenesis and blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Finally, earlier work by our group has provided evidence that propranolol administration significantly reduces peripheral perfusion via increased leg vascular resistance in adults with severe burn injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, in this work, we observed a reduction in arterial and venous lactate levels in both nonburned and burned adults following two hours of intravenous propranolol administration. β-blockade was thought to have reduced lactate production via inhibition of lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the current study, we found no difference in arterial pH between groups over the first 72 hours following hospital admission. Therefore, decreased chronotropic effects during early resuscitation in patients treated with propranolol did enhance acidosis further than expected by the nature of severe burn injury, as evidenced in the control group.</p>
              <p>Resuscitative efforts with either crystalloid or colloid fluids have long been a subject of debate. One of the limitations of the current study was the omission of comprehensive resuscitation data in our analysis. However, administration of PRBC is likely the strongest contributor to altered perioperative hematocrit levels in adults with burn injury. As no difference in PRBC administration was noted between groups and target hemoglobin levels remained constant among groups, we are confident that resuscitation with various other colloid and crystalloid products follow a similar pattern.</p>
              <p>Finally, it bears mentioning that the findings from our study may not be limited to burn injury. For example, propranolol may attenuate hemorrhage perioperatively in patients on anticoagulant therapy requiring emergency surgical intervention. Alternatively, propranolol may improve wound healing times after bedside or surgical debridement for various diseases. The effect of propranolol on wound healing and hemorrhage in other injury/disease models deserves further investigation.</p>
