                <sec id="abs1">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>There are urgent calls for the transformation of agriculture and food systems to address human and planetary health issues. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture and agroecology promise interconnected solutions to these challenges, but evidence of their impact has been limited.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs2">
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>In a cluster-randomized trial (NCT02761876), we examined whether a nutrition-sensitive agroecology intervention in rural Tanzania could improve children's dietary diversity. Secondary outcomes were food insecurity and child anthropometry. We also posited that such an intervention would improve sustainable agricultural practices (e.g., agrobiodiversity, intercropping), women's empowerment (e.g., participation in decision making, time use), and women's well-being (e.g., dietary diversity, depression).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Food-insecure smallholder farmers with children aged &lt;1 y from 20 villages in Singida, Tanzania, were invited to participate. Villages were paired and publicly randomized; control villages received the intervention after 2 y. One man and 1 woman “mentor farmer” were elected from each intervention village to lead their peers in agroecological learning on topics including legume intensification, nutrition, and women's empowerment. Impact was estimated using longitudinal difference-in-differences fixed-effects regression analyses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 591 households (intervention: <italic>n</italic> = 296; control: <italic>n</italic> = 295) were enrolled; 90.0% were retained to study end. After 2 growing seasons, the intervention improved children's dietary diversity score by 0.57 food groups (out of 7; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and the percentage of children achieving minimum dietary diversity (≥4 food groups) increased by 9.9 percentage points during the postharvest season. The intervention significantly reduced household food insecurity but had no significant impact on child anthropometry. The intervention also improved a range of sustainable agriculture, women's empowerment, and women's well-being outcomes.</p>

                <sec id="abs5">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The magnitude of the intervention's impacts was similar to or larger than that of other nutrition-sensitive interventions that provided more substantial inputs but were not agroecologically focused. These data suggest the untapped potential for nutrition-sensitive agroecological approaches to achieve human health while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Food insecurity and malnutrition are two of the most pressing public health issues of our time. In 2019, 2 billion people experienced food insecurity, and 144 million children aged &lt;5 y were stunted (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Chronic undernutrition in the first 1000 d of life can impair health, cognitive function, and subsequent productivity, as well as increase the likelihood of poor mental health, illness, and mortality later in life (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although agriculture has the potential to improve food insecurity and nutrition, it also contributes to biodiversity loss, land degradation, water and air pollution, and climate change (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These can, in turn, undermine food production and health. Gender inequity, including unequal access to education, assets, decision making, household work, and exposure to violence, is also increasingly recognized as a significant driver of food insecurity and malnutrition globally (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>The drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition, as well as their solutions, may be interconnected. For example, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) house nutrition and agriculture targets under SDG 2 to “end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture” (<xref rid="bib64_342_1616433387502" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recent reports have recognized that improving biodiversity and ecosystem health is essential for a more sustainable food system (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, those working in agriculture and nutrition programs have recognized the importance of addressing gender inequity to improve agricultural productivity and nutritional status (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and those working to improve gender equity have begun to emphasize the importance of addressing food insecurity and economic stressors in gender-specific programming and violence prevention (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions—that is, agricultural interventions with the goal of improving human nutrition (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)—are an example of a solution that recognizes the interconnectedness of agriculture and nutrition. Unlike conventional agriculture interventions whose focus is on increased agricultural production and income, the primary objective of NSA interventions is to use food-based approaches to improve nutrition. Because improvements in women's empowerment—that is, power and control over different dimensions of their lives (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)—are expected to increase the allocation of food and income from these interventions toward children's nutrition (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), some NSA interventions also promote women's empowerment as a way of achieving better nutrition (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>A recent systematic review of NSA interventions suggests that they can improve dietary practices (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). They have also been shown to have the potential to address other relevant causes of malnutrition, such as household food insecurity and lack of gender equity, although there are fewer trials measuring these outcomes. In contrast, the same systematic review found little evidence of NSA impacts on children's nutritional status. Moreover, NSA interventions have been criticized for their focus on the promotion of a biofortified crop, small-scale homestead vegetable production, or small farm animals, which leaves the primary food production system “in place,” ignoring emergent and salient issues of biodiversity, soil and water conservation, and energy use (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Agroecology is another approach to food production, but one that differs from most NSA in that care for the environment is central (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>). Agroecology emphasizes ecological processes in agricultural practices, such as increasing agrobiodiversity; intercropping legumes with staple foods to fix nitrogen; improving soil quality through the incorporation of animal manure, compost, and plant residues (rather than synthetic fertilizers); and using natural predators, botanical sprays, and repellent plants instead of synthetic pesticides for pest management. These strategies have been demonstrated to increase farm productivity and yield stability while reducing the need for external agricultural inputs (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
              <p>Another feature that sets agroecology apart from NSA is the emphasis on addressing power inequities by using a participatory approach. Instead of being reliant on a set of “top-down,” one-size-fits-all technologies and practices, people are encouraged to integrate their knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned from experimentation to decide for themselves which practices to use and share (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Innovations among smallholder farmers are more likely to be carried out when they are both practical and harmonious with local and indigenous social and ecological contexts (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>). By soliciting participation from the broader community, including marginalized populations such as indigenous groups, women, or food-insecure smallholder farmers, agroecological initiatives also seek to ameliorate social inequities (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The reduction of gender inequities in decision making and tasks is particularly emphasized in agroecology (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although there is considerable evidence of the impacts of agroecological practices on agricultural outcomes and the environment, there is a widely acknowledged need for a better understanding of their impacts on nutrition and social equity outcomes (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>). Recent studies have shown some evidence of improved child growth, food insecurity, wealth, and dietary diversity, but research design issues, such as lack of a control group, preclude definite conclusions (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref>).</p>
              <p>Therefore, we designed an agriculture intervention that sought to improve child nutrition (i.e., is nutrition-sensitive) and that emphasized agroecological practices (i.e., participatory sustainable agriculture and social equity). We evaluated the impacts of this nutrition-sensitive agroecological intervention using a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial among rural Tanzanian smallholder farmers. The trial was clustered at the village level because the intervention relied on farmers within the same village advising and learning from each other. The primary outcome was improvements in children's dietary diversity scores (DDSs) and minimum dietary diversity (MDD) (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>). Secondary outcomes were household food insecurity (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and child anthropometry [i.e., height-for-age <italic>z</italic> score (HAZ), stunting, weight-for-height <italic>z</italic> score (WHZ), and wasting] (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We additionally measured 3 other groups of indicators that could shape the primary and secondary outcomes—sustainable agriculture practices, women's empowerment, and women's well-being (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>)—recognizing that there are numerous pathways by which the primary and secondary outcomes may be shaped (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>Singida Rural District, in Tanzania's semiarid central region, has one of the highest poverty rates in Tanzania (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Agricultural and livestock activities are the primary livelihoods, with households cultivating an average of 2.15 acres (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Agricultural activities follow a unimodal pattern (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>); planting is in November and December, and harvesting occurs in May–July.</p>
                <p>Food insecurity is prevalent in the region: in 2016, 49% of households had low household dietary diversity (&lt;3 out of 12 food groups) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Children's nutritional intake is inadequate. Only 6.9% and 4.2% of children aged 6–23 mo in 2014 met MDD (i.e., ≥4 food groups in the prior 24 h) and had a minimum acceptable diet (i.e., meeting both MDD and minimum meal frequency), respectively; one-third of children aged &lt;5 y were stunted (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Gender inequities are pervasive—for example, women spent more than twice the amount of time on household tasks and had less access to productive resources compared with men (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>

                <title>Study participants</title>
                <p>Village selection started with the identification of 33 villages by the Singida Rural District Council. Then, in collaboration with Singida Rural District officers, 22 were identified as candidate sites in October 2015 based on their village leadership's willingness to participate in the study, having &gt;200 children aged &lt;5 y, and not participating in other interventions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref></bold>). Twenty villages were ultimately included, from which 10 pairs were formed based on the number of months of food security, predominant soil type, and proximity to health clinics (see “October 2015” in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Text 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>To identify eligible and interested households, study staff described the study in each of the 20 villages at meetings open to all community members in December 2015. Household eligibility criteria included <italic>1</italic>) being food insecure as defined by the community, <italic>2</italic>) having a child aged &lt;1 y in January 2016, <italic>3</italic>) having access to land and planning to farm in the coming year, <italic>4</italic>) intending to reside in that village for the next 3 y, and <italic>5</italic>) being interested in experimenting with new farming techniques. Village leaders then invited ∼30 eligible households that met these criteria to participate, and their eligibility was confirmed during the first survey in January and February 2016. Ultimately, 591 households agreed to participate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). In each of the 20 villages, 2 “mentor farmers” were elected by fellow study participants in February 2016 (see “End of February 2016” in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Text 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Random allocation of villages to the intervention or control arms was done publicly by mentor farmers drawing slips from a hat in March 2016. The staff who conducted data collection, data entry, and data cleaning were unaware of the villages’ intervention status. However, due to the participatory nature of the intervention and the presence of the lead author in the intervention villages during implementation, full blinding was not possible.</p>
                <p>SNAP-Tz was powered to detect a simple difference of means of 0.3 food groups in children's DDSs [out of 7 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)] at endline using an α of 0.05 and power of 0.90.

                  <p>One woman and 1 man mentor farmer from each of the 10 intervention villages (<italic>n</italic> = 20) learned about sustainable agriculture practices, nutrition, women's empowerment, and participatory learning through 2 sets of activities.

In July 2016, they participated in a 2-week-long training led by Action Aid Tanzania using the Farming for Change curriculum (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The curriculum is integrative, linking agroecology with climate change, human nutrition, gender, and social equity; it is also participatory, focusing on experiential-based learning and theater.</p>

                  <p>Beginning in August 2016, mentor farmers were encouraged to invite both men and women from intervention households to monthly meetings and to visit each household quarterly, at minimum. They were encouraged to share with intervention households lessons learned from their training in any way they thought would be effective and promote experimentation with and exchange ideas and challenges about these new agroecological techniques among intervention households. There was not a standardized set of messages for mentor farmers to discuss because the intervention used a participatory agroecological learning approach with context-specific problem-solving. To facilitate this, SNAP-Tz provided mentor farmers with a bicycle and a small stipend (∼$43 monthly).</p>

                <title>Data collection and operationalization</title>
                <p>Comprehensive surveys were conducted every growing season (January and February) from 2016 to 2019; shorter surveys were conducted every postharvest season (July and August). Surveys tracked the index children (aged &lt;1 y in January 2016) and their parents across time. For most outcomes, data collected in 2016 were treated as baseline, and data collected in 2017–2019 were evaluated for evidence of intervention impacts. To assess the impact on children's diet, household food insecurity, child anthropometry, and women's diet, data on these outcomes collected in January 2017 were also used as baseline values in the regression models. At that point, the intervention had begun, but no crops were yet harvested. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Text 1</xref> for more details on the timing of baseline data collection.)</p>
                <p>The registered primary outcome (NCT02761876) was the index child's diet, measured by DDS (when the child was aged ≥6 mo), and whether a child met the MDD (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). MDD is considered to be met when children aged 6–23 mo consume ≥4 (out of 7) food groups. We used the 2011 WHO guidelines for this [rather than ones ratified in December 2017 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)] because the 4-group threshold was the primary registered outcome. We also calculated the MDD for children aged &gt;23 mo because there is no well-established indicator for dietary diversity in older children. Dietary data were collected by interviewing mothers using an FFQ adapted to the local diet. (More details on all measurements are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>.)</p>
                <p>We also collected data on the following secondary outcomes: household food insecurity and child anthropometry. Household food insecurity was measured by jointly interviewing men and women using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). We used these data to construct 2 indicators: a continuous score, where higher scores indicate greater food insecurity, and a binary outcome that equaled 1 if a household experienced moderate or severe food insecurity and 0 otherwise (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Child anthropometric measurements were made by a trained team of local nurses and nutritionists using best practices (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Using these data as well as information on child age, we calculated HAZs and WHZs and determined their stunting and wasting status (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
                <p>We collected data on plausible mechanisms by which these changes could occur: sustainable agriculture practices, gender equity, and women's well-being (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). These indicators were not included in our trial registration. Indicators of sustainable agriculture practices included crop species richness, an indicator of agrobiodiversity (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>); whether households intercropped legumes and staple foods in any of their agricultural fields; the number of sustainable practices households used to improve soil health (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>); and the number of sustainable pest management strategies used (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). These data were collected by jointly interviewing men and women. Because seeds were distributed to the control group in December 2018, we did not measure sustainable agricultural practices in January 2019 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Text 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>We chose 5 indicators of women's empowerment that would either allow for comparisons to previous studies or were germane to changes in food insecurity and children's diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). We asked women about their participation in decision making in agriculture practices and income allocation using decision-making items included in the Abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Answers were scored 0 if the woman had no say, 0.5 if jointly decided, and 1 if the woman had the final say; we present mean scores. We did not use the A-WEAI cutoff for empowerment because most women reported participating in joint decision making in ≥1 activity, which would have them classified as adequately empowered; further probing during the pilot phase revealed that men generally made the decision, and women acquiesced (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Women's time use in the previous 24 h was tracked using the A-WEAI methodology. We measured the types of help women received from their husbands by asking whether partners had participated in each of 6 tasks that men rarely do, as identified in an iterative pile-sort activity during the pilot study (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Finally, we measured overall empowerment with the 5 domains of empowerment score of the A-WEAI (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
                <p>To assess women's well-being, we used indicators that have been validated either globally or among similar populations. These were Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), adequacy of social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and risk of probable depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). To measure probable depression, we used a cutoff value that has been validated for use among similar populations in East Africa (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>At the baseline survey in January 2016, 591 households agreed to participate in the study (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). The majority were married monogamously, of the Nyaturu ethnic group, and reported farming as their main occupation. Households had ∼6 or 7 members. On average, children's mothers were aged 29.7 y and had ∼5.9 y of formal education.</p>

              <p>SNAP-Tz increased DDSs, our primary outcome, by 0.57 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) food groups in index children. SNAP-Tz raised the percentage of index children who met MDD by 9.7 pp. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that an NSA intervention that included a considerable emphasis on agroecological practices could improve DDSs for young children. The magnitude of the impact is noteworthy. Impacts on dietary diversity in other NSA interventions ranged from 0.11 to 0.68 food groups (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">53–56</xref>). Results from SNAP-Tz are at the upper end of this range and were achieved using fewer external inputs compared with other NSA interventions. As an illustration, an NSA study in Rwanda provided dairy cows and goats (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), whereas another NSA study in Zambia provided seeds twice a year for 4 y, as well as goats, chickens, and agricultural tools (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p>
              <p>We observed a significant impact on 1 of our 2 secondary outcomes. SNAP-Tz reduced HFIAS scores by 1.91 and 2.48 points in the growing and postharvest seasons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). SNAP-Tz also reduced the prevalence of severe or moderate food insecurity by 9.0 pp in the growing season and 12.5 pp in the postharvest season. This is larger than the sole NSA impact evaluation that reported an impact on household food insecurity using the HFIAS. In that study, HFIAS was reduced by 0.4 points (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The 2 agroecological studies that used the HFIAS reported impacts similar to SNAP-Tz; they reduced HFIAS by 3.21 and 2.06 points (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). As has been the case for the majority of NSA interventions (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), we found no impact on any child anthropometric measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
              <p>We measured outcomes along 3 pathways through which SNAP-Tz may have improved children's dietary diversity and reduced household food insecurity: sustainable agriculture practices, women's empowerment, and women's well-being.</p>
              <p>The intervention increased each household's agrobiodiversity by ∼1 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Given that the intervention provided seeds, this increase in agrobiodiversity, although encouraging, is intuitive and similar to other NSA and agroecology interventions (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Although the impact of agrobiodiversity on mothers’ and children's dietary diversity depends on existing agricultural diversity and market access (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), our results suggest that production and dietary diversity are related in this population. Sustainable agriculture practices also increased significantly and by a large magnitude. For example, at baseline, only 5.7% of households intercropped; exposure to SNAP-Tz increased this by 42.6 pp. This is comparable to the effect observed in an agroecology intervention in Malawi, in which intercropping increased from 29% to 93% (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>SNAP-Tz increased women's relative power in income allocation decision making but not in agricultural decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results are consistent with what has been observed in other NSA interventions (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It is possible that this increase in power contributed to the observed improvement in the dietary diversity of children, but such a claim must be made cautiously. The baseline value for this outcome was low (0.36), and it is unclear whether the observed increase (0.07 on a 0–1 scale) was sufficient to alter income allocation decision making in a meaningful way. SNAP-Tz increased the empowerment score according to A-WEAI by 0.15 points. This was driven by increases in the scores for the group membership domain because participation in SNAP-Tz meant that one had joined a group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>).</p>
              <p>SNAP-Tz did not cause women to spend more time on household tasks and child care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is encouraging because NSA interventions have been criticized for increasing time burdens on women (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). It is noteworthy that the intervention increased men's involvement in household activities by 0.36 tasks. However, because there are currently no other studies that assessed the impact of NSA on men's involvement in household work and child care to which we can compare our results, it is not clear whether the magnitude of this impact on male involvement is meaningful.</p>
              <p>In terms of the impacts on women's well-being that we measured, we found that the intervention increased the proportion of women achieving the MDD by 15.2 pp. Other NSA studies that have reported impacts on women's nutritional intake either report no statistically significant impacts on MDD (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) or report impacts on the number of food groups consumed but not on MDD (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The proportion of women reporting adequate social support increased by 13.3 pp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and the proportion of women with probable depression was reduced by 11.6 pp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The effect size on depression is large; for example, a participatory women's group intervention whose primary outcome was to reduce depression found a similar-sized impact (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first NSA intervention, agroecological or otherwise, that has documented an impact on women's mental health.</p>
              <p>Our study has a number of strengths, including randomization of the intervention to reduce the risk of confounding, adequate power, and sufficient duration of implementation. We also collected and analyzed a wide range of data, allowing us to assess—in addition to the primary and secondary outcomes listed in our trial registry—impacts on dimensions of sustainable agriculture as well as women's empowerment and well-being. Limitations include that we did not measure legume yield or household income, which would have allowed for analysis of the income pathway by which children's diet and anthropometric indicators may be shaped, nor do we have data on impacts on soil health. We did not measure indicators of men's empowerment and well-being, which limits our ability to analyze these outcomes. Furthermore, in any cluster-based randomized control trial, there is a risk of spillover from intervention to control localities, which would bias our results toward null impact. Although we cannot test for this formally, field staff observed minimal interaction between individuals living in intervention and control villages. Our analysis relies heavily on self-reports, which makes our results vulnerable to social desirability bias. We took precautions to address this by avoiding leading questions, using different personnel for enumeration and intervention implementation, and assurance of “no wrong answers” throughout the survey. We also measured social desirability bias in July 2018 and found that it was both low and nondifferential between study arms (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Text 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 9</xref></bold>). However, because we did not measure social desirability bias at baseline, we are unable to adjust for it. Finally, we are reluctant to make strong claims about external validity. SNAP-Tz was implemented in only 1 rural area of Tanzania using an agroecological focus tailored to that region.</p>
              <p>In summary, SNAP-Tz, a nutrition-sensitive agroecological intervention, improved the diets of children and improved household food security but did not improve child anthropometric outcomes. It also led to improvements in sustainable agriculture practices and indicators of women's empowerment and well-being, and the intervention achieved all this through the provision of relatively minimal inputs. As such, this study advances our understanding of NSA by demonstrating that such an approach can work when using agroecological practices. This study also advances our knowledge of agroecology interventions by providing evidence of impacts on nutrition and well-being generated using a rigorous study design and empirical methods. These results point to the potential for nutrition-sensitive agroecology interventions to improve indicators relating to sustainable agricultural practices, women's empowerment and well-being, household food security, and children's dietary diversity.</p>
