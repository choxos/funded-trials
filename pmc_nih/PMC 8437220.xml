                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising therapy in cancers with homologous recombination repair deficiency. However, efficacy is limited by both intrinsic and acquired resistance. The Olaparib Combinations basket trial explored olaparib alone and in combination with other homologous recombination–directed targeted therapies. Here, we report the results of the arm in which olaparib was combined with the orally bioavailable ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor ceralasertib in patients with relapsed or refractory cancers harboring DNA damage response and repair alterations, including patients with <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated PARP inhibitor–resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>Germline and somatic mutations had to be deleterious by COSMIC or ClinVar for eligibility. Olaparib was administered at 300 mg twice daily and ceralasertib at 160 mg daily on days 1-7 in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary end points were confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rates and clinical benefit rate (CBR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] at 16 weeks).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Twenty-five patients were enrolled, with median four prior therapies. Five patients required dose reductions for myelosuppression. Overall response rate was 8.3% and CBR was 62.5% among the entire cohort. Two of five patients with tumor harboring <italic>ATM</italic> mutation achieved CR or SD ongoing at 24+ months, respectively (CBR 40%). Of seven patients with PARP inhibitor–resistant HGSOC, one achieved PR (–90%) and five had SD ranging 16-72 weeks (CBR 86%).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Olaparib with ceralasertib demonstrated preliminary activity in <italic>ATM</italic>-mutated tumors and in PARP inhibitor–resistant <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>–mutated HGSOC. These data warrant additional studies to further confirm activity in these settings.</p>

              <p>DNA damage response and repair (DDR) is an essential function to maintain viability in all cells. Homologous recombination (HR) repair is a high-fidelity process used to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), during the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Germline mutations in HR genes and other genes involved in DDR and the genes giving rise to Fanconi anemia significantly increase the lifetime risk of certain cancers. HR and DDR pathway genes mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity (LOH) have been observed in 17%-21% of patients in large, pancancer data sets.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>

              <p>HR deficiency has been shown to be synthetically lethal with inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) leading to the advent of PARP inhibitors in HR-deficient tumors, particularly in <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), as well as breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> TCGA data sets have shown that biallelic HR gene inactivation may be present in other cancer types as well and is associated with genomic features of HR deficiency.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In HGSOC, approximately 50% are characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations of the HR pathway genes, particularly <italic>BRCA</italic> genes.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> HR deficiency has been an important therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. In patients with recurrent disease, PARP inhibitors have been used in patients with tumors harboring <italic>BRCA</italic> alterations with response rates typically exceeding 30%.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Additionally, these agents are now commonly considered irrespective of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation in the second-line maintenance setting, after a response to a platinum-based chemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Recent work has also examined PARP inhibition in the first-line maintenance setting.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> More common PARP inhibitors use has highlighted the importance of both acquired and de novo resistance. The outlook for patients with HGSOC with acquired or de novo HR proficiency is poor so that reversal of resistance is a pressing clinical problem.</p>
              <p>Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family. ATR governs checkpoints that serve to ensure cell survival after replication stress or DNA damage. ATR is recruited to stalled replication forks, where it mediates CHK1 activation resulting in cell cycle arrest in S phase. ATR and CHK1 phosphorylate PALB2 and RAD51, respectively, facilitating HR repair.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> ATR also initiates the cascade of events culminating in G2 arrest following DNA damage. Preclinical data have supported the synergism of ATR and PARP inhibition in <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated PARP inhibitor–sensitive ovarian and breast cancer models.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Mechanistically, PARP inhibition leads to G2 accumulation; the addition of ATR inhibition promotes release from G2 with premature mitotic entry with increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p>ATR inhibition is also a promising strategy to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance in <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated cancers.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> PARP inhibitor–resistant BRCA-deficient cells are increasingly dependent on ATR for genomic stability and survival. Preclinical data suggest that ATR inhibition targets PARP inhibitor resistance through two potential mechanisms, including disruption of BRCA1-independent RAD51 loading to sites of DSB and reversal of BRCA1-independent replication fork protection.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Combined ATR-CHK1 axis and PARP inhibition has been shown to be cooperative in the PARP inhibitor–resistant setting, with synergistic increases in replication fork stalling, DSB, and apoptosis, coupled with compromised HR repair, translating to improved survival in preclinical ovarian cancer models.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Like ATR, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) has both DNA damage–induced checkpoint and repair functions. ATM deficiency is expected to sensitize malignant cells to ATR inhibition, which has been demonstrated both in preclinical models and in clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Additionally, in preclinical pancreatic and lung cancer models, ATM deficiency also sensitizes to PARP inhibition, suggesting that combined ATR and PARP inhibition may be useful.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In contrast, other studies showed low sensitivity of ATM-deficient prostate cancers to PARP inhibition.<sup><xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Although the role of PARP inhibitor monotherapy in ATM-deficient tumors is not fully clarified, combined ATR and PARP inhibition may still provide clinical benefit.</p>
              <p>The Olaparib Combinations (OLAPCO) trial is a basket trial that has explored olaparib alone and in combination with other HR-directed targeted therapies. The objective of this arm of the OLAPCO trial was to assess the efficacy of the combined regimen of olaparib and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib in previously treated patients with DDR-deficient solid tumors.</p>

                <p>For the ceralasertib-olaparib arm of OLAPCO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02576444">NCT02576444</ext-link>), patients with tumor mutations in HR and other DDR genes were identified by tests performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory, either locally at one of the participating sites or at a commercial testing facility, before participation in the trial. These platforms included standard local (including Oncomine<sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> or Oncopanel<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>) or commercial (including Myriad, FoundationOne, or Tempus) platforms. Patients with tumors harboring deleterious mutations in HR genes (including <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>PALB2</italic>, and other genes) and other DNA repair pathway genes (including <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>CHEK2</italic>), as well as mutations in TCA cycle genes implicated in HR defects,<sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> were enrolled.

                <title>Eligibility</title>
                <p>Eligible patients had to have received standard first-line therapy for metastatic cancer (except for tumors for which no first-line therapy exists) with progressive disease at the time of study entry. Other eligibility criteria include measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 and age ≥ 18 years with life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks. Enrolled patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0-1, adequate hematologic function with no features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelomonocytic leukemia, and adequate hepatic and renal function. Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor was required in patients with <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated HGSOC during the second stage of the study, but there was no specification regarding the duration or response to prior PARP inhibition. The number of prior lines of therapy was not restricted on this study.</p>

                <title>Protocol Treatment</title>
                <p>Patients received olaparib 300 mg orally twice a day continuously and ceralasertib 160 mg orally on days 1-7 in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. This regimen was based on the recommended phase II dose of ceralasertib that could be combined with full-dose olaparib that was established during a prior phase I study. Toxicities were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Dose reductions for olaparib were 250 mg (dose level –1) and 200 mg (dose level –2) daily, whereas for ceralasertib, dose reductions were 160 mg for day 1-4 for hematologic toxicities or 120 mg oral daily for day 1-7 for nonhematologic toxicities (dose level –1) and 120 mg oral day 1-4 for hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities (dose level –2). Dose reescalation was not permitted.</p>
                <p>Ceralasertib and olaparib could be reduced in stepwise fashion for anemia, where dose reduction for olaparib was recommended first, followed by a dose reduction for ceralasertib if the adverse event (AE) recurred. Simultaneous reduction was also allowed depending on the severity and duration of anemia. If a dose reduction was required for neutropenia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, olaparib and ceralasertib were reduced simultaneously because of the greater frequency of these events associated with ceralasertib.</p>

                <title>Statistical Design, Sample Size Justification, and Decision Rules</title>
                <p>A two-stage accrual design was used.<sup><xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> A 30% ORR was considered worthy of further study. Initially, 16 eligible patients were to be treated. If there were &lt; 2 responses, accrual would be terminated on the basis of the likelihood of an ORR of ≤ 10%. If ≥ 2 responded in the first stage, the study would continue until 25 patients were treated. This design provided 90% power with a significance level of &lt; .10 (type I error). The second stage was activated with the goal of evaluating more patients with <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated, PARP inhibitor–resistant HGSOC on the basis of an initial signal observed among the first 16 patients.</p>
                <p>Additionally, an early stopping rule for safety was incorporated. If among the first 16 patients, ≥ 4 experienced unacceptable toxicity, enrollment would be terminated early. Unacceptable toxicity was defined as grade 4 hematologic and grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities that failed to resolve to grade 1 despite appropriate supportive care, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. With this design, the probability of terminating the arm early was .07 if the true but unknown unacceptable toxicity rate was 10% and 0.75 if the true toxicity rate was 30%.</p>

                <p>The combined regimen of olaparib and ceralasertib was well-tolerated. Probable or definite treatment-related AEs as judged by the treating investigator are listed in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. All patients had grade 1 AEs that were deemed to be mild and required no dose alterations. These events occurred after many cycles on treatment. Only the most severe grade for each individual patient toxicity is entered. Hematologic toxicity was the most common event as expected from previous clinical trials of each agent. One patient, a woman with germline <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutated HGSOC, who had received eight prior regimens, experienced grade 3 anemia, grade 4 neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia and required two dose reductions for olaparib and one reduction for ceralasertib. A second patient with grade 4 neutropenia also required a dose reduction for olaparib alone. Three more patients were dose-reduced because of anemia. All adverse hematologic toxicities were reversible. Nonhematologic toxicities were rare and all were ≤ grade 2. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Among the two patients who achieved objective response, one patient with <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutated PARP inhibitor–resistant HGSOC required dose reduction but continued to have response to the combination therapy.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The OLAPCO trial is an exploratory basket study that includes several olaparib combinations in genomically targeted patient subsets. In this arm, patients with tumors harboring DDR alterations were treated with combined ceralasertib and olaparib. The regimen used full-dose olaparib along with ceralasertib on the basis of prior phase I data. The ORR was 8.3%, making it a negative trial, although the CBR of 62.5% was promising in this heavily pretreated population. Responses and instances of clinical benefit were observed in subsets of patients with tumors harboring <italic>ATM</italic> mutation and in patients with <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated HGSOC with acquired PARP inhibitor resistance. These findings warrant further investigation in larger groups of patients.</p>
              <p>ATR inhibition has been shown to be synthetically lethal with ATM deficiency in preclinical models, translating to responses to monotherapies that have been reported with agents such as BAY1895344 and M6620.<sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The complete loss of ATM protein is ideally confirmed by protein immunohistochemistry, but this is not yet a standard laboratory test. Genetic testing is not as certain, although LOH can sometimes be confirmed. In this trial, two patients with germline <italic>ATM</italic> mutation and evidence of biallelic loss in tumor had durable clinical benefit, with one patient achieving a CR. Loss of the wild-type <italic>ATM</italic> allele could be identified in these two patients as determined by variant allelic frequency in the tumor when compared with germline control. The activity of PARP inhibition in the ATM-deficient setting has primarily been studied in prostate cancer and is less clear, although responses have been reported.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Ultimately, randomized trials in ATM-deficient cancers will be required to determine whether the activity is driven by ATR inhibition alone or whether the combination contributed to the benefit observed.</p>
              <p>PARP inhibition is now part of the standard armamentarium for HGSOC so that it is critical to develop strategies addressing acquired resistance. This exploratory experience suggests promise for combined ATR and PARP inhibition in this setting. There are several postulated mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance including expression of drug efflux pumps or loss of PARP1 protein expression. Restoration of HR pathway function is also a major resistance mechanism that may occur by somatic reversion or restoration of an open reading frame, epigenetic reversion of BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, express of a hypomorphic protein with residual BRCA function, or by loss of end resection regulation.<sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Additionally, stabilization of replication forks represents another major mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Preclinical evidence supports the importance of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated cancers, where it is used to maintain genomic stability. PARP inhibitor–resistant BRCA1-deficient cells become increasingly dependent on ATR for survival.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Despite the lack of BRCA1, PARP inhibitor–resistant cells regain RAD51 loading to DNA double-stranded breaks and stalled replication forks, enabling both restored HR and replication fork stabilization as resistance mechanisms. ATR inhibition will compromise HR and destabilize replication forks to overcome both resistance mechanisms. ATR inhibition also overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance in <italic>BRCA2</italic>-mutated ovarian cancer models. In general, responses in PARP inhibitor–resistant preclinical models are superior with combined ATR and PARP inhibition compared with ATR inhibition alone.<sup><xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Our results suggest that the ceralasertib-olaparib combination has potential clinical activity with manageable toxicity in <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated PARP inhibitor–resistant HGSOC, with a duration of benefit that exceeded the duration achieved on prior PARP inhibitor monotherapy.</p>
              <p>The current schedule uses full-dose olaparib with attenuated ceralasertib, which may be most appropriate in less heavily treated, PARP inhibitor–naïve patients. In both the ATM-deficient and PARP inhibitor–resistant settings, a schedule maximizing ceralasertib may be preferable. Dose-finding efforts are underway in other clinical trials with olaparib at 100-150 mg twice daily, which may afford substantially higher doses of ceralasertib that may ultimately be critical for maximizing clinical activity.</p>
              <p>Further work will be required for insights into nonresponding patients with tumors harboring DDR alterations. It is possible that <italic>BRCA</italic>, <italic>PALB2</italic>, and other mutations have different functional relevance in certain cancer types<sup><xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> or that routine assessment of LOH will carry high importance. Additionally, assessment of HR function and replication fork stability at baseline will also be important in future studies to better understand clinical outcomes. Such assessments could include an IHC-based RAD51 assay or DNA fiber assays in organoid cultures derived from patient biopsies.<sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Future studies should include planned translational analyses of paired tissue biopsies and serial circulating tumor DNA samples to assess mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance and to identify predictors of response and determinants of resistance to the combination regimen.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. Although we were able to determine biallelic loss in a few of the tumors, we lacked information about the activity of the nonmutated alleles in most cases. In many cases, germline testing was used for eligibility, rather than analysis of tumor DNA. Furthermore, the clinical outcomes were likely limited because the majority of patients were heavily pretreated and were also resistant to prior therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. Finally, higher ceralasertib doses with attenuated olaparib may ultimately be the optimal dosing schedule for this combination.</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations and the limited ORR of 8.3%, we were able to confirm safety of ceralasertib combined with full-dose olaparib and generate signals of promising clinical benefit in both ATM-deficient and <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutated PARP inhibitor–resistant ovarian cancer. Further schedule optimization and testing of larger populations in appropriately powered single-arm and randomized trials are warranted.</p>
