                  <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
                  <p>To compare insulin sensitivity (M/I) and β-cell responses in youth versus adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or drug-naïve, recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>In 66 youth (80.3% with IGT) and 355 adults (70.7% IGT), hyperglycemic clamps were used to measure <italic>1</italic>) M/I, <italic>2</italic>) acute (0–10 min [first phase]) C-peptide (ACPR<sub>g</sub>) and insulin (AIR<sub>g</sub>) responses to glucose, <italic>3</italic>) steady-state C-peptide and insulin concentrations at plasma glucose of 11.1 mmol/L, and <italic>4</italic>) arginine-stimulated maximum C-peptide (ACPR<sub>max</sub>) and insulin (AIR<sub>max</sub>) responses at plasma glucose &gt;25 mmol/L. The fasting C-peptide–to–insulin ratio was used as an estimate of insulin clearance.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Insulin sensitivity was 46% lower in youth compared with adults (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and youth had greater acute and steady-state C-peptide (2.3- and 1.3-fold, respectively; each <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and insulin responses to glucose (AIR<sub>g</sub> 3.0-fold and steady state 2.2-fold; each <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Arginine-stimulated C-peptide and insulin responses were also greater in youth (1.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively; each <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for insulin sensitivity, all β-cell responses remained significantly greater in youth. Insulin clearance was reduced in youth (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Participants with diabetes had greater insulin sensitivity (<italic>P</italic> = 0.026), with lesser C-peptide and insulin responses than those with IGT (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) but similar insulin clearance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.109).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>In people with IGT or recently diagnosed diabetes, youth have lower insulin sensitivity, hyperresponsive β-cells, and reduced insulin clearance compared with adults. Whether these age-related differences contribute to declining β-cell function and/or impact responses to glucose-lowering interventions remains to be determined.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Across the life span, the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes is rising worldwide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This increase has been driven in part by an escalation in the prevalence of obesity, which afflicts no longer only middle-aged and older individuals but also youth (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>Type 2 diabetes and its precursor, prediabetes, are characterized by insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction in youth and adults (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, the progression of dysglycemia appears to be more aggressive in youth (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study provides a unique opportunity to compare the physiologic features that underlie dysglycemia in youth and adults. RISE is evaluating different interventions to prevent the progressive loss of β-cell function in youth and adults with prediabetes or recent-onset type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The three RISE protocols contain many common design elements, including phenotyping of participants using the hyperglycemic clamp to measure insulin sensitivity (M/I) and three different β-cell responses: two acute and one during prolonged stimulation. The present report uses the baseline hyperglycemic clamp data to examine insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in youth versus adults with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Individuals at high risk for IGT and type 2 diabetes (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc18-0244/-/DC1">Supplementary Appendix 2</ext-link>) who met other study inclusion/exclusion criteria were screened with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) test. Youth aged 10–19 years with pubertal development beyond Tanner stage ≥II were eligible for the RISE Pediatric Medication Study if they had a fasting plasma glucose ≥5 mmol/L plus 2-h glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L and <italic>1</italic>) HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≤64 mmol/mol if drug naïve, <italic>2</italic>) HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≤58.5 mmol/mol if on metformin for &lt;3 months, or <italic>3</italic>) ≤53 mmol/mol if on metformin for 3–6 months. Adults were eligible for the RISE Adult Medication Study if they had a fasting plasma glucose 5.3–6.9 mmol/L plus 2-h glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L and HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≤53 mmol/mol. Adults were eligible for the RISE Adult Surgery Study (BetaFat) if they had a fasting glucose &gt;5 mmol/L plus 2-h glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;53 mmol/mol. In both adult studies, individuals with known diabetes for &lt;1 year were eligible if they had never received glucose-lowering medications and qualified otherwise.</p>
                <p>Eighty-eight participants were randomized into the Adult Surgery Study, 267 into the Adult Medication Study, and 91 into the Pediatric Medication Study. Of the 91 pediatric participants, 25 either were on metformin at the time of randomization or had previously been exposed to it. These participants were excluded from the analyses herein to avoid potential confounding by this exposure. All participants gave written informed consent/assent, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines of each center’s institutional review board.</p>

                <title>Anthropometric Measurements</title>
                <p>Anthropometric measurements were performed with participants wearing light clothing without shoes. Waist circumference was measured in a horizontal plane at the midpoint between the top of the iliac crest and the bottom of the costal margin in the midaxillary line using a fiberglass (nonstretching) tape. Height was measured in a fully vertical position with heels together using a calibrated stadiometer. Weight was measured using a calibrated electronic scale, zeroed before each measurement.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>After a 10-h overnight fast, a two-step hyperglycemic clamp was performed. The overall approach is outlined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc18-0244/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>.</p>
                <p>For the first step, the steady-state target blood glucose concentration of 11.1 mmol/L was achieved using an initial intravenous bolus of 20% dextrose (volume in mL calculated as weight [kg] * [200 − fasting blood glucose in mg/dL] * 1.1/180) administered over 60 seconds, after which infusion of 20% dextrose was commenced at a rate calculated as (weight [kg] * 5 * 60)/180). Starting at 10 min after the initial dextrose bolus, the rate of the infusion was modified based on a computerized algorithm combined with bedside blood glucose monitoring every 5–10 min. During this first step of the clamp, arterialized blood samples were drawn through an indwelling intravenous catheter in a warmed hand before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 100, 110, and 120 min.</p>
                <p>For the second step, the target blood glucose of &gt;25 mmol/L was achieved using a second bolus of 20% dextrose administered over 60 seconds (volume in mL calculated as weight [kg] * [450 − current blood glucose in mg/dL] * 1.1/180). The 20% dextrose infusion rate was then increased (typically to the pump’s maximum rate of 999 mL/h) and adjusted based on bedside blood glucose monitoring every 5 min. If the bedside blood glucose was not &gt;22.2 mmol/L by 15 min after commencement of the second step of the clamp, an additional bolus of 50 mL of 50% dextrose was administered over 2 min. Once the target blood glucose of &gt;25 mmol/L was attained for a minimum of 30 min, but no more than 45 min after commencement of the second step, a bolus of <sc>l</sc>-arginine (5 g) was administered over 1 min. Blood samples for subsequent assays were drawn at −5, −1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min relative to the arginine injection.</p>

                <title>Assays</title>
                <p>All blood samples were immediately placed on ice, separated by centrifugation, and frozen at −80°C prior to shipment to the central biochemistry laboratory at the University of Washington. Plasma glucose concentrations for use in end point calculations were measured on these samples by the glucose hexokinase method using Roche reagent on a Roche c501 autoanalyzer. The method’s interassay coefficient of variation (CV) on quality control samples with low, medium, and high concentrations was 2.0%, 1.7%, and 1.3%, respectively. C-peptide and insulin were measured by a two-site immuno-enzymometric assay performed on the Tosoh 2000 autoanalyzer (Tosoh Bioscience, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The interassay CV for C-peptide on quality control samples with low, medium, medium-high, and high concentrations was 4.3%, 3.6%, 3.2%, and 2.6%. The assay has a minimum detectable concentration of 0.007 nmol/L, a standard curve linear to 10 nmol/L, and cross-reactivity of 0.05% with intact proinsulin, 0.02% with the proinsulin fragment containing amino acids 31–65, and zero with insulin. For the insulin assay, the interassay CV on quality control samples with low, medium, medium-high, and high concentrations was 3.5%, 3.0%, 3.3%, and 2.9%. The assay has a minimum detectable concentration of 3.7 pmol/L and the following cross-reactivities: intact proinsulin 2.0%, split 32,33 proinsulin 2.6%, des 64,65 proinsulin (which is &lt;6% of total proinsulin) 39%, and C-peptide zero. All measures are presented in Système International (SI) units. These can be converted to conventional units using standard conversion factors with the exception of insulin, for which 0.134 should be used.</p>

                  <p>Insulin sensitivity (M/I) was quantified as the mean of the glucose infusion rate (M) at 100, 110, and 120 min of the clamp, expressed per kilogram of body weight and corrected for urinary glucose loss, divided by the mean steady-state plasma insulin concentration at these same time points (I) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Urinary glucose loss was the product of the urinary glucose concentration and urinary volume.</p>

                  <p>Acute (first-phase) C-peptide (ACPR<sub>g</sub>) and insulin (AIR<sub>g</sub>) responses to glucose were calculated as the mean incremental response above baseline (average of −10 and −5 min) from samples drawn at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min after intravenous dextrose administration (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Steady-state (second-phase) C-peptide and insulin concentrations were calculated as the mean of the respective measurements at 100, 110, and 120 min of the hyperglycemic clamp (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Acute C-peptide (ACPR<sub>max</sub>) and insulin (AIR<sub>max</sub>) responses to arginine at maximal glycemic potentiation (&gt;25 mmol/L) were calculated as the mean concentrations in samples drawn 2, 3, 4, and 5 min after arginine injection minus the average concentration of the samples drawn 1 and 5 min prior to arginine (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Insulin Clearance</title>
                  <p>The ratio of fasting C-peptide to fasting insulin was calculated as an estimate of insulin clearance (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The rationale for this approach is the equimolar secretion of both peptides and the lack of C-peptide extraction by the liver. Consequently, under steady-state conditions, the C-peptide–to–insulin molar ratio is proportional to the hepatic clearance rate of insulin.</p>

                <title>Data Management and Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>The SAS analysis system (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (The R Foundation) were used for all statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics are presented as percentages, mean ± SD, geometric means, and 95% CIs for nonnormally distributed data; for the geometric means, <italic>P</italic> values from the log-transformed data are presented. Comparisons between groups were computed using ANOVA, χ<sup>2</sup> tests, or Student <italic>t</italic> tests. Nominal <italic>P</italic> values are presented. Except where noted, <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered nominally statistically significant, with no adjustments made for multiple tests.</p>
                <p>Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationship of C-peptide or insulin responses with insulin sensitivity (M/I). The relationship between the steady-state insulin response and M/I was not evaluated because the steady-state insulin values are included in each calculation. All models used natural logarithmically transformed M/I and β-cell response variables owing to the skewed distribution of these data. Prior to taking logs, we added a constant of 1.06 to the ACPR<sub>g</sub> and 10.0 to the AIR<sub>g</sub> because of negative values in these β-cell response variables.</p>
                <p>We were interested in whether the various metabolic responses differed between youth and adults and between those with IGT and type 2 diabetes at baseline. Therefore, for each C-peptide and insulin response variable, a model was constructed including the effect of M/I and both of these group terms. A three-way interaction for M/I by youth/adult and IGT/type 2 diabetes was run first to assess whether the four separate slopes of the response (e.g., C-peptide) on M/I differed, i.e., whether the slopes for adults with IGT, adults with diabetes, youth with IGT, and youth with diabetes were significantly different. In no case was this true, so subsequent models were built including two-way interaction terms for [diabetes status * M/I] and [age-group * M/I]. If both two-way interaction tests were not significant (i.e., the slopes in the two age-groups or diabetes status groups were parallel), a simple model was constructed, including terms for diabetes status and age-group without any interaction variables. Parallel slopes in these regression models indicate that differences in β-cell responses are proportionate across the range of insulin sensitivity.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in youth and adults has been examined separately in cross-sectional studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). RISE is the first large study that included youth and adults and has applied identical, sophisticated, and quantitative methodologies including performance of all assays in a central laboratory, thereby allowing direct comparisons of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity between youth and adults. Using this approach, we report many novel observations that advance our understanding of apparent differences between youth and adults in the progression of dysglycemia (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p>In RISE, insulin sensitivity in youth was 46% lower than in comparably overweight dysglycemic adults. Differences in body adiposity and/or effects of puberty (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) may explain some of this lower insulin sensitivity in youth. Acute C-peptide and insulin responses to glucose and the nonglucose secretagogue arginine were greater in youth, as well as greater than required to compensate for measured differences in insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, C-peptide concentrations measured at a steady-state glucose of ∼11.1 mmol/L were also significantly greater in youth than adults, but the relative difference was smaller than for the acute responses. These observations suggest that in youth, the β-cell is hyperresponsive to acute stimulation by glucose and nonglucose (arginine) secretagogues, releasing greater amounts of C-peptide and insulin from the readily releasable pool (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The difference in response between groups is less evident after prolonged glucose exposure, a condition of continuous stimulation that is more dependent on release of more recently synthesized peptide (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Our findings are compatible with a recent study that used oral glucose tolerance test modeling of pooled data and showed that youth with impaired glucose metabolism were insulin resistant with increased parameters of β-cell responsiveness compared with adults (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In the same study, on the other hand, youth and adults with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes did not differ for insulin sensitivity, while certain, but not all, parameters of β-cell responsiveness were greater in youth (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether the changes in β-cell function and insulin sensitivity over time differ in youth and adults and whether they explain why the disease appears to be more aggressive in youth (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p>It has long been recognized that the first-phase insulin response to intravenous glucose decreases as the fasting glucose concentration increases and that this response is essentially absent in adults with diabetes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In adults who are hyperglycemic, this calculated response can even be negative (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We have extended these observations. First, across the range of fasting glucose concentrations and after adjustment for insulin sensitivity, the first-phase response remains greater in youth than adults, in keeping with β-cells of youth responding more vigorously. Second, we describe for the first time in youth that negative first-phase responses occur, as with adults, in some individuals who are hyperglycemic. Third, for β-cell secretory capacity (ACPR<sub>max</sub> and AIR<sub>max</sub>), there is an inverse relationship with fasting glucose, and these responses are greater in youth than in adults. However, unlike the first-phase response, in both youth and adults, the responses to arginine at maximal glycemic potentiation were measurably greater than zero, even in individuals with the highest fasting glucose concentrations (9.6 mmol/L). This difference in relationships between fasting glucose and the acute responses to glucose and arginine suggests that the lack of a β-cell response to intravenous stimulation is limited to glucose in both age-groups. Further, it suggests the two parameters are measuring different β-cell characteristics.</p>
              <p>Our data also suggest that the liver is playing an important role in regulating glucose homeostasis and that this effect is different in the two age-groups, with a lower fasting C-peptide–to–insulin ratio in youth. This observation suggests that hepatic insulin clearance is reduced in youth, thus allowing a greater amount of insulin to appear in the periphery. We can only provide conjecture on the genesis of this difference. First, it seems likely that there exists an as yet undefined feedback system linking reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity with hepatic clearance, and since youth with dysglycemia have a marked reduction in insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), this feedback mechanism may be contributing to differences in hepatic clearance. The consistent decrease in insulin clearance in youth compared with adults across the range of fasting glucose suggests that glucose is not this putative factor. Second, it is possible that a protective mechanism exists that modulates hepatic extraction in order to mitigate the increased workload on β-cells in circumstances of high secretion, with differential actions in youth and adults or in circumstances of hypersecretion. It is known in adults that hepatic glucose production is more sensitive to insulin than is glucose utilization by the peripheral tissues (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), but whether this is also the case in youth is unclear. Further work is warranted to explore determinants or regulators of insulin extraction in youth versus adults.</p>
              <p>We observed parallel but shifted relationships between insulin sensitivity and β-cell responses in IGT and diabetes, with lower C-peptide and insulin responses in those with diabetes. This is consistent with the concept that hyperglycemia results from impaired β-cell function in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Of note, it is apparent in these data that this difference in β-cell function is not due to differences in insulin clearance as we observed in youth compared with adults.</p>
              <p>There are some limitations to our study. First, we did not directly quantify body fat or its distribution to evaluate possible contributions to the greater insulin resistance in youth. Future assessment of biomarkers of fat mass could shed some light on this issue. Second, we used the hyperglycemic clamp to simultaneously quantify β-cell responsiveness and insulin sensitivity, but this approach did not explore differences in tissue-specific responses to insulin between youth and adults. Third, we used the fasting C-peptide–to–insulin ratio as a surrogate estimate of insulin clearance and did not measure it directly. Fourth, we have focused on the two major β-cell products, C-peptide and insulin; however, there are a number of islet cell peptides of potential interest that we did not measure such as proinsulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), or glucagon. Samples have been stored to allow for the measurement of analytes such as these should funding become available.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found that youth with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes are markedly more insulin resistant and have β-cells that are hyperresponsive to acute stimulation compared with adults with a similar degree of dysglycemia. Further, these β-cell responses in youth were enhanced even after insulin sensitivity was accounted for, suggesting that the workload their β-cells are experiencing is greater than that observed in adults. To the extent that increased workload contributes to β-cell decline (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), these findings may represent fundamental differences between youth and adults in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes or in the rates at which diabetes develops and progresses. The two groups also exhibited differences in insulin clearance that may, in youth, be a compensatory mechanism to provide sufficient insulin to the peripheral tissues to aid in appropriate and similar glucose disposal while simultaneously reducing secretory demand on the β-cell. Whether these observed differences between youth and adults will also result in differences in the response to the same medication interventions (metformin alone or basal insulin followed by metformin) in their β-cell function will be answered by the RISE Study.</p>
