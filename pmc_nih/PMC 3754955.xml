              <abstract>
                <p>Engagement of the CD3/T cell receptor complex in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) T cells involves Syk rather than the zeta-associated protein. Because Syk is being considered as a therapeutic target we asked whether Syk is central to the multiple aberrantly modulated molecules in SLE T cells. Using a gene expression array, we demonstrate that forced expression of Syk in normal T cells reproduces most of the aberrantly expressed molecules whereas silencing of Syk in SLE T cells normalizes the expression of most abnormally expressed molecules. Protein along with gene expression modulation for select molecules was confirmed. Specifically, levels of cytokine IL-21, cell surface receptor CD44, and intracellular molecules PP2A and OAS2 increased following Syk overexpression in normal T cells and decreased after Syk silencing in SLE T cells. Our results demonstrate that levels of Syk affect the expression of a number of enzymes, cytokines and receptors that play a key role in the development of disease pathogenesis in SLE and provide support for therapeutic targeting in SLE patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Following recognition of an antigen on the surface of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, the T cell receptor (TCR) initiates a number of signaling cascades that determine cytokine production, cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The initial event, phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the cytosolic side of the TCR/CD3Î¶ chain complex, allows for Zap70 (Î¶-chain associated protein kinase) to be recruited to CD3Î¶. Zap70 becomes activated in this way and promotes the recruitment and phosphorylation of other adaptor molecules responsible of transmitting signals downstream.</p>
              <p>Several studies have shown that TCR signaling is modified in patients suffering from SLE [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Instead of transmitting signals through TCR to CD3Î¶ and Zap70, an alternative pathway comes into play involving FcRÎ³ and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. FcRÎ³ is homologous in shape and function to CD3Î¶ and takes its place in SLE T cells [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and associates with Syk. This alternative FcRÎ³/Syk duet is 100 times enzymatically more potent than the canonical CD3Î¶/Zap70. As a result, following activation, SLE T cells exhibit higher intracytoplasmic calcium flux and cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphorylation [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>To better understand the contribution of Syk in the aberrant phenotype of SLE T cells we examined the effect of Syk on the expression of molecules known to contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE. A two-step approach was followed: (a) Syk was overexpressed in healthy blood-donor T cells to examine whether increased Syk expression creates SLE-like phenotype; and (b) Syk was downregulated, using siRNA, in SLE T cells to examine whether gene expression abnormalities can be corrected. Our results show that Syk contributes significantly to the abnormal expression of a number of molecules associated with the immunopathogenesis of SLE.</p>

                <title>a) Modulation of Syk expression in SLE-patient and healthy blood-donor T cells</title>
                <p>Although it is established that Syk is increased in SLE T cells it has not been previously shown whether increased Syk expression represents a primary or a secondary abnormality in these cells. To determine this we first upregulated Syk expression in healthy blood donor T cells using a SYK expression vector. Following transfection with the expression vector, cells were cultured for 72h and SYK messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured using quantitative PCR. Syk overexpression resulted in significant upregulation of Syk in all experiments performed. Average expression levels more than doubled in these cells in comparison to empty vector transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074550-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). To examine whether this finding translates into higher protein expression levels as well, Syk was measured by flow cytometry. Syk was significantly upregulated in those cells transfected with the SYK-expression vector in comparison to those transfected with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074550-g001">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>

Following 72h of incubation, cells were lysed, RNA extracted and SYK expression levels measured in real-time PCR. SYK overexpression led to a significant increase in its mRNA levels in all four experiments tested (left panel, normalized expression levels shown). To investigate whether this finding translates into protein expression levels as well, whole T cells were used to be analyzed in flow cytometry. Syk protein was found to significantly increase following SYK overexpression in all experiments tested (right panel, a representative plot is shown, plots gated on CD3+ T cells). b) T cells extracted from SLE patients were transfected with either a SYK-specific (siRNA) or a control (control) siRNA and expression levels of Syk were measured using real-time PCR and flow cytometry. The SYK silencing protocol led to a significant reduction in its expression at both the mRNA (left panel) and protein levels (right panel).</p>

                <p>To examine whether any of the abnormalities seen in SLE patients are corrected following downregulation of SYK expression we then used SLE patient T cells and silenced its expression using a SYK-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA).

Expression levels of Syk at the protein level were also found to significantly decrease following SYK silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074550-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). There was no correlation between SLEDAI score and fold Syk change following SYK silencing. These results demonstrate that SYK silencing was successful in downregulating intracellular Syk expression at the gene and protein levels.</p>

                <title>b) SYK affects expression levels of genes associated with SLE</title>
                <p>To determine whether Syk regulates at the mRNA level the production of cell molecules that are known to be aberrantly expressed in SLE we used healthy blood donor T cells and SYK expression was artificially induced using a SYK-overexpression vector. A panel of 36 genes known to play an important role in aberrant SLE T cell function was chosen to be studied. We chose these genes because of their proven association with SLE pathophysiology and our own observations that this panel of genes can reliably differentiate between SLE patients and controls ( [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and unpublished data). We indeed found that overexpression of SYK resulted in upregulation of several of these molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074550-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Most notably, the expression of cytokine IL-21, cell surface molecule CD44, and intracellular molecules PP2A and OAS2 were found to substantially increase in cells overexpressing SYK (fold increase in SYK overexpressing cells over controls: IL-21, 5.7Â±1.5; CD44, 4.2Â±2.2; PP2A, 1.5Â±1; OAS2, 1.5Â±0.3; normalized against GAPDH and CD3Îµ).</p>

              <p>SLE T cells express high levels of Syk and preferentially transmit signals through FcRÎ³/Syk instead of the canonical CD3Î¶/ Zap70 pathway. This rewiring of the TCR signaling complex is associated with profound transcriptional dysregulation of several key molecules in SLE T cells [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Specifically, SLE T cells display upon activation increased calcium flux, tyrosine phosphorylation and actin polymerization [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>We have shown previously that Syk expression is controlled by the transcription factors c-Jun and Ets-2 and is transcriptionally upregulated in SLE T cells [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] primarily due to activated c-Jun. Syk inhibition using siRNA [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or a small molecule R406/R788 [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] resulted in decrease in the calcium flux following SLE T cell activation, but had no effect on normal T cells. Moreover, Syk inhibition decreased the rapid actin polymerization of SLE T cells proving the importance of Syk in SLE T cell activation. The global importance of Syk in SLE was also shown in lupus prone mice, where treatment with R788 resulted in prevention of nephritis and dermatitis [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given these findings we asked whether upregulation of Syk in normal T cells can re-create the phenotype of SLE T cells; and vice versa, whether downregulation of Syk can normalize the expression of key signaling molecules in SLE T cells. We chose to examine the expression of 39 signaling molecules that have been linked to SLE T cell phenotype. Of those molecules, four were most profoundly and consistently affected by Syk overexpression and downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074550-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Specifically, overexpression of Syk resulted in upregulation of IL21, CD44, PP2A and OAS2. Silencing of SYK, on the other hand, resulted in downregulation of these molecules. Findings were consistent at both the mRNA and protein levels for all molecules tested. Out of the two CD44 receptor molecule variants most highly associated with SLE (v3 and v6) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] v6 was found to be primarily affected by changes in Syk expression levels.</p>

                  <title>Schematic representation of the proposed role of Syk in SLE.</title>
                  <p>Syk promotes the upregulation of a number of cytokines, receptors and enzymes that play a key role in SLE immunopathogenesis. It affects expression levels of CD44, primarily variant v6, involved in T cell migration; IL-21, involved in antibody production; OAS2, involved in type-I interferon responses; and PP2A, involved in the regulation of IL-2 production.</p>
                </caption>
                <graphic xlink:href="pone.0074550.g005"/>
              </fig>
              <p>A number of previous studies have shown the importance of the above molecules in SLE. IL-21, has been found to play an important role in T cell-dependent B cell differentiation into plasma cells and the production of antibodies in SLE [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence Syk overexpressing SLE T cells can provide increased help to B cells to produce pathogenic autoantibodies, a key feature of the disease.</p>
              <p>Expression of CD44, a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion is increased in SLE T cells, allowing for increased adhesion and migration [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CD44 splice variants v3 and v6 in particular, are upregulated in SLE T cells and their expression correlates with disease activity [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. T cells in kidneys of SLE patients have been found to express CD44 suggesting that these molecules may allow T cells to migrate abnormally into kidneys in them [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore Syk not only controls actin polymerization upon SLE T cell activation, but also by enhancing CD44 expression may lead to faster adhesion and migration of T cells to tissues. Although both v3 and v6 variants are associated with SLE, we found that mainly variant v6 is regulated by Syk. This finding may demonstrate a variable role of Syk in the expression of these two splice variants and points towards an important role for CD44v6 in the pathogenesis of SLE.</p>
              <p>PP2A (protein phosphatase 2), a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates a number of cellular processes, plays an important role in SLE. SLE T cells express abnormally high levels of PP2A, which leads to decreased expression of interleukin-2 upon T cell activation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As IL-2 is important for Treg function, increased expression of PP2A may be in part responsible for defective Treg function in SLE [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. PP2A also regulates the expression of CD3Î¶ and FcRÎ³, leading to TCR rewiring [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and further enhancing Syk recruitment to the TCR/FcRÎ³ complex. Moreover, PP2A-transgenic mice display increased expression of IL-17 and increased susceptibility to immune-mediated glomerulonephritis [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, Syk by controlling at least in part the expression of PP2A, may regulate the composition of TCR and tilt the balance of T cell activation towards the pro-inflammatory Th17.</p>
              <p>Finally, OAS2 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase) is an interferon-induced molecule that is involved in the innate immune response towards viral infection. OAS2 activates latent RNase L which is involved in the degradation of viral RNA. Along with several other interferon-inducible molecules, OAS2 has been found to be significantly upregulated in SLE [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These molecules represent the, so-called, âinterferon-signatureâ in SLE and are thought to be the result of high levels of type I Inteferons (IFNs) in these patients. Type I IFNs play an important role in the promotion of inflammatory responses; they prevent activated T-cell death and contribute to the generation of effector cells during viral infections [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They have also been found to play a role in the process of CD8 T cell-dependent generation of autoantigens [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Exactly how Syk affects the expression of these molecules remains to be determined. Previous studies suggest some possible links: Syk has been found to associate with adaptor molecules Vav1, phospholipase CÎ³1 (PLCÎ³1) [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in the process of regulating the production of cytokines and other molecules. Vav1 is a molecule known to activate NF-ÎºB and, a member of the NF-ÎºB family, c-Rel, has been found to activate transcription of IL-21 in T cells [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finally, p38, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (which includes ERK) has been found to be involved in the expression of CD44 in monocytes [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study, we focused on determining the effect of Syk on resting T cells as we have previously shown the effect of Syk overexpression/knockdown on the activation of T cells [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the effect of Syk on the expression of molecules that are produced by T cells upon activation (such as IL-2 or CD40 ligand) cannot be fully assessed.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our data show that overexpression of Syk in healthy T cells recapitulates at least part of the SLE T cell phenotype. Syk overexpressing T cells may provide more help to B cells through IL21, have enhanced migration to tissues by upregulating CD44 and produce proinflammatory rather than counterinflammatory cytokines. Inhibiting Syk in SLE T cells leads to the opposite effect, further underscoring Sykâs potential as a therapeutic target in SLE.</p>
