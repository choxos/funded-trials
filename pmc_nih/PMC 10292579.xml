              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">Informal caregivers of adults living with dementia face ongoing challenges [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Informal caregivers are family members or friends who provide support and home care for their care partners. Caregiving impacts caregiver health, emotional well-being, family responsibilities, relationships, finances, and career, which in turn may hinder their ability to maintain their caregiving role [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Dementia caregiving is particularly complex due to the frequent need to manage behavioral disturbances and provide constant supervision that allows for little respite [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Dementia caregivers experience high rates of depression, stress, and other adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and they are more likely than caregivers of adults without dementia to report negative effects of caregiving [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P7">Despite sizeable research on informal caregivers, less attention has focused on the experiences of rural caregivers [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. According to United States (U.S.) Census data, 20% of the population lives in rural areas [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and 18% of rural residents are 65 and older compared to less than 14% of urban residents [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One in 4 rural adults are caregivers, and nearly 10% provide care to someone with dementia [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Rural caregivers face unique challenges related to aging in place. Rural areas are characterized by lower rates of personal income, educational attainment, and health insurance coverage than urban areas [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On average, rural populations have less access to public transportation, social services, health care services, and higher speed or broadband internet services [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, rural caregivers are less likely to have access to support groups, home care or nursing agencies, and other paid help to assist with caretaking responsibilities [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rural dementia caregivers feel the impacts of these challenges, reporting higher rates of ill health and financial distress from caregiving than urban counterparts [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Rural residents also report personal and community assets (e.g., resilience, local networks) that may be unique sources of strength [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for interventions that can reach and support rural dementia caregivers [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">In systematic reviews, dementia caregiver self-management support interventions have been shown to improve caregiver well-being [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Many are resource intensive and more appropriate for urban settings where health professionals are more readily available [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Most support interventions are structured for one-on-one delivery through home visits, telephone calls, or counseling sessions by health professionals [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While some have been adapted for delivery by videoconferencing [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or streaming [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], these adaptations require attendees to meet online at the same time or have broadband internet to stream videos. While broadband access has increased to 63% among U.S. rural adults they remain less likely than urban adults to have such access [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, an alternative and scalable delivery modality is needed to reach as many rural caregivers as possible. While rural dementia caregivers have expressed a desire for online programs [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], such support is seldom available.</p>
              <p id="P9">The <italic toggle="yes">Building Better Caregivers</italic> (BBC) workshop is an asynchronous online peer-led group workshop that can be accessed with lower speed internet and is designed to boost self-care and caregiving skills [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Asynchronous delivery allows caregivers to use materials at home when they have time (day or night), to self-pace their learning, and to chat asynchronously with other caregivers through threaded discussion board conversations. While prior studies have demonstrated a positive impact on depression, stress, self-efficacy, and well-being [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the workshop has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). To accelerate the translation of efficacy evidence into practice, we designed a hybrid effectiveness and implementation study to simultaneously evaluate the impact of the BBC workshop on the well- being of rural dementia caregivers and to evaluate its future implementation potential in rural communities.</p>

Partnering organizations participate in twice annual webinars, listserve communications, and smaller group exchanges as described further in the implementation evaluation methods below. These activities support peer-to-peer networking, knowledge transfer, and problem solving.

The acronym represents the domains assessed by the framework – reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. The reach and effectiveness domains focus on the individual level – in this case, rural caregivers. The adoption domain focuses on the setting-level, in this case the partnering organizations. The implementation and maintenance domains encompass both individual (caregiver) and setting (organization) levels.

This approach has been used in a prior self-management study to improve retention [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Randomization with ratios of 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1 to treatment and control are applied depending on the number of caregivers recruited into a cohort during a recruitment period (approximate 3-month period). For example, if 40 participants enroll within a given period a 3:1 randomization (30 to treatment versus 10 to control group) is applied. This approach shortens the wait time between study entry and treatment and control initiation. Approximately 27 participants are necessary to start a workshop.</p>

                  <title>Intervention group: Building Better Caregivers (BBC) workshop</title>
                  <p id="P22">The BBC workshop is an online peer-led group workshop designed for caregivers of persons living with dementia or other form of cognitive impairment [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is a Self-Management Resource Center workshop originally developed at Stanford University for the Veterans Administration [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and is licensed for online delivery by Canary Health. The intervention is based on Self-Efficacy Theory [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and designed to enhance participant self-management behaviors, dementia caregiving skills, and peer social support (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Workshop participants are asked to log on at least 2–3 times a week for 10 to 30 min per time. The workshop can be accessed with lower speed internet (e.g., no broadband) at any time of day. Participation does not require “real time” attendance or video-conferencing (e.g., Zoom).</p>
                  <p id="P23">Upon randomization, participants create screen names to protect their anonymity. Caregivers receive a book [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] by mail during the first week of the workshop to use during the workshop and keep afterwards. The book contains abbreviated information on topics covered in the workshop. Each week the workshop focuses on 2–3 new topics and tools for participants to learn and use (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Caregivers read about these topics and use related tools in their own private learning center. The workshop also uses frequent online conversations that occur on threaded discussion boards where participants can interact, help each other, and provide peer social support. Caregivers post about topics of the week, their questions and caregiving challenges, or other topics, and can respond to posts of others. All posts are visible for everyone in the workshop. Workshop participants receive training on how to contact workshop facilitators.</p>
                  <p id="P24">Workshops are guided by two trained peer co-facilitators (caregivers themselves). Facilitators receive rigorous training including how to address the needs and concerns of rural dementia caregivers, safety concerns such as when and how to activate safety protocols for participants who are at risk for self-harm or harm to others, and how to manage inappropriate post content (e.g., misinformation, abusive comments). Facilitators post prompts on discussion boards that correspond to topics of the week. Facilitators monitor all online interactions and postings daily and check in electronically with individual participants at least once weekly.</p>
                  <p id="P25">The study staff and physician monitor workshop quality, safety, and complete fidelity assessments of each workshop. If facilitators stray from the protocol, they receive immediate feedback and remedial training from a supervisor with advanced training. The supervisor meets weekly with facilitators to review workshop progress.</p>

                  <p id="P26">The modified attention control is similar to that used in REACH II [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and occurs during the same 6-weeks as the workshop. After control participants complete the 12-month trial, they are also offered the workshop. An attention control group was selected because BBC has not been tested in an RCT. An attention control group provides participants with information and modest support; and may help with trial retention. Control group participants receive a mailed handbook [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and two 15–30 min protocolized telephone calls from study staff. The phone call protocol guides staff on what to say and not say, and how to respond to typical caregiver concerns by guiding them to content within the handbook or publicly available resources. Control group components do not include self-management or peer social support activities. Early in the trial, fidelity will be assessed for 50% of calls per cohort until staff demonstrate mastery, and then will taper to a minimum of 20% of calls per cohort. If study staff stray from the protocol, they receive timely remedial training. Study staff are trained in participant safety protocols parallel to those for workshop participants.</p>

                  <p id="P31">We will estimate means and proportions, measures of variability, and confidence intervals of outcomes at baseline and 1.5, 6, and 12 months for participants overall and by group. We will determine whether baseline characteristics are independent of group assignment (randomization check) and attrition (attrition analysis). Outcome measures will be summarized with mean, standard deviation, and median by group and time (0, 1.5, 6, and 12 months). Given that participants enroll in a random manner without knowing what randomization ratio will be applied, we do not expect an effect of randomization ratio on treatment effect. However, outcome measures will be summarized by randomization ratio to assess potential effect of randomization ratio on treatment effect.</p>
                  <p id="P32">The primary hypothesis is that caregivers in the workshop group when compared to the control group will demonstrate lower depressive symptoms and lower stress levels at 12 months. Secondary hypotheses are that caregivers in the workshop group when compared to control group will demonstrate better self-rated health, more exercise behaviors, fewer hospitalizations, lower social isolation, lower loneliness, greater caregiving self-efficacy, lower caregiving burden, and greater caregiving benefits and positive aspects. Secondary hypotheses are that care partners of caregivers in the workshop group when compared to control group will have better general health and fewer hospitalizations. We will also assess these hypotheses at 6 months.</p>
                  <p id="P33">Our primary analyses will assess the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms (PHQ-8 score) and stress levels at 12 months. Depending on the distributions of the outcomes we will use linear mixed effects models (LMM) or generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM). The LMM or GLMM will use all available observations and will assume that data is missing at random conditional on observed data, which is a less restrictive assumption than assuming data is missing completely at random, which is the assumption in complete case analyses. Specifically, a LMM or GLMM will be used to evaluate the group difference over time in PHQ-8 score and stress level, with fixed effects for indicators of intervention group assignment and time, as well as the group-by-time interaction, and random effects for workshop and subjects to account for the correlation within workshop and subjects due to measurements over time. Group-by-time interaction effects will provide the estimated ITT effect of the intervention on PHQ-8 score and stress level over time, where the effects at 12 months will be our primary interests. If there are baseline covariates imbalanced between groups by chance, they will be included in the LMM to control for potential confounding. We expect that correlation within a region will be negligible but will include a random effect for region if it is not.</p>
                  <p id="P34">Secondary analyses will include supplementary analyses on the primary outcomes and analyses of secondary outcomes that are conceptually similar to models described above. Supplementary analyses on the primary outcomes will include assessing effects of randomization ratio on treatment effects, using potential outcome-based approaches to estimate intervention effects while accounting for noncompliance (e.g., complier average causal effect), mediation analyses to understand mechanisms/pathways of the intervention on PHQ-8 score and stress level via and around its effect on intermediate variables (e.g., self- efficacy), assessing moderation effects of baseline covariates on intervention-outcome relations, and sensitivity analyses with different approaches for addressing dropout and missing data (e.g., complete case analysis, multiple imputation, pattern-mixture model).</p>

The sample size and power calculation were powered using the more conservative primary outcome from a pilot study that included both PHQ-8 score and stress level [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Using the more conservative outcome, the PHQ-8 score effect size of 0.27 corresponds to 1.51 group difference assuming a common standard deviation of 5.6 [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The power calculation accounts for the flexible randomization ratio approach. Assuming that randomization with varied ratios will achieve a retention rate of 75% and in case the randomization ratio needs to be controlled for as a categorical variable in the analysis model, 480 (of 640) caregivers retained at trial completion will allow us to detect a partial correlation of 0.13 between the treatment and primary outcomes with a power of 0.82 at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided).</p>

Outcomes explore the type and intensity of caregiver engagement with the workshop, extent to which they receive the workshop as intended, and potential explanations for both. The workshop platform records logins, sections visited, and activities performed each week. Participants who complete four or more of the six weekly sessions are considered to have completed the workshop based on prior research identifying four weeks as the effective dose to achieve workshop impact [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In the 1.5-month survey, caregivers answer implementation questions on how they accessed the workshop (laptop, smartphone, tablet), how easy or difficult it was to enter, navigate, and complete activities, and what aspects of it they used or did not use. We will perform descriptive analyses of platform- and survey-based data. In addition, approximately 60 intervention group caregivers from across Census regions (West, Midwest, South, Northeast) complete 30-min semi-structured debriefing interviews by telephone or video following their 12-month trial completion. They receive $30 in remuneration. Interviews are audio-recorded and transcribed. Implementation-specific questions ask what got in the way (barriers) or helped them (facilitators) participate, how and why they did/did not do particular activities, and suggestions for improvements. We will perform thematic analysis of interview transcripts [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] using Dedoose qualitative analysis software [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The coding team will apply deductive codes (derived from RE-AIM and caregiving literature), identify emergent codes, and meet for discussion. The process of independent coding followed by group discussion will repeat until no further codes or refinements to codes are identified and all members agree on the final codebook. Then the team will code transcripts, resolve discrepancies, and discuss and reach consensus on the qualitative findings of interview themes. Findings will characterize a spectrum of workshop experiences and reasons for better vs. worse uptake.</p>
                  <p id="P39">At the organization level implementation is defined as the extent to which partnering organizations complete activities required for project launch (in the first six months) – and why/why not they do so. The research team uses surveys and facilitated webinar discussions to gather data. The 1-month post project launch survey asks whether partnering organizations are performing specific types of outreach and referral activities (e.g., with caregivers or close contacts) and what types of materials they use (e.g., flyers, social media). Study staff also collect data during 90-min webinars with partnering organizations. Webinars occur twice during the first six months of project launch (implementation phase) and then twice annually thereafter (maintenance phase). Implementation discussion questions focus on what is going well/not going well, suggestions for improvements, and how the COVID-19 pandemic has/has not impacted project activities. Webinars are audio- recorded and transcribed. Study staff will perform descriptive analyses of survey data and thematic analysis of webinar discussion data using methods similar to those described for caregiver data. We will contextualize and integrate organization-level results with caregiver-level findings.</p>

                  <title>Maintenance</title>
                  <p id="P40">Maintenance is defined as the extent to which intervention-related behaviors are maintained. At the caregiver level, 6- and 12-month survey questions ask what learned skills or behaviors caregivers have continued to use (e.g., action planning, managing stress). In debriefing interviews, maintenance questions ask how the workshop impacted them, what aspects have had greatest/least impact and why, and how they are using what they learned in their lives now.</p>
                  <p id="P41">At the organization level, maintenance is defined as continued performance of project activities beyond the first six months. Every six months prior to webinars, organizations complete brief surveys about outreach and referral activities. Then during webinars they discuss survey responses – including insights on effective/ineffective approaches in their areas, challenges encountered (e.g., COVID constraints), and how they are able/not able to address challenges (e.g., meet by zoom). For organizations that discontinue the project, study staff elicit input on the context and reasons (e.g., change in priorities, staff turnover). We will analyze survey, interview, and webinar data as described previously.</p>

              <title>Status to date</title>
              <p id="P42">The original plan was for partnering organizations to assist with recruitment. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic many organizations have been unable to devote resources to recruitment despite remaining engaged (e.g., attending webinars). Our study staff has filled the gap by performing additional recruitment activities. We have contacted 1660 service providers, businesses, and other groups in 50 states. These include area agencies on aging, senior centers, respite centers, faith-based organizations, recreation centers, rural newspapers and radio stations, and other local organizations with ties to rural caregivers, older adults, and communities. Study enrollment is ongoing and currently includes 278 caregivers from all U.S. Census regions – 33% from the West, 26% Midwest, 27% South, and 15% Northeast.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="P43">This hybrid effectiveness and implementation trial will enroll participants through 2022. Findings will determine the effectiveness and implementation characteristics of the <italic toggle="yes">Building Better Caregivers</italic> online self-management and skills-building workshop for rural caregivers of family members or friends living with dementia. If the workshop is shown to be effective, we will have the implementation findings and network of partnering organizations necessary to guide dissemination efforts within large rural regions of the U.S.</p>
