                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Melanoma patients vaccinated with tumor-associated antigens frequently develop measurable peptide-specific CD8+ T cell responses; however, such responses often do not confer clinical benefit. Understanding why vaccine-elicited responses are beneficial in some patients but not in others will be important to improve targeted cancer immunotherapies.</p>

                  <title>Methods and Findings</title>
                  <p>We analyzed peptide-specific CD8+ T cell responses in detail, by generating and characterizing over 200 cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones derived from T cell responses to heteroclitic peptide vaccination, and compared these responses to endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses elicited naturally (a heteroclitic peptide is a modification of a native peptide sequence involving substitution of an amino acid at an anchor residue to enhance the immunogenicity of the peptide). We found that vaccine-elicited T cells are diverse in T cell receptor variable chain beta expression and exhibit a different recognition profile for heteroclitic versus native peptide. In particular, vaccine-elicited T cells respond to native peptide with predominantly low recognition efficiencyâa measure of the sensitivity of a T cell to different cognate peptide concentrations for stimulationâand, as a result, are inefficient in tumor lysis. In contrast, endogenous tumor-associated-antigen-specific T cells show a predominantly high recognition efficiency for native peptide and efficiently lyse tumor targets.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>These results suggest that factors that shape the peptide-specific T cell repertoire after vaccination may be different from those that affect the endogenous response. Furthermore, our findings suggest that current heteroclitic peptide vaccination protocols drive expansion of peptide-specific T cells with a diverse range of recognition efficiencies, a significant proportion of which are unable to respond to melanoma cells. Therefore, it is critical that the recognition efficiency of vaccine-elicited T cells be measured, with the goal of advancing those modalities that elicit T cells with the greatest potential of tumor reactivity.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The immunotherapy of cancer holds promise in harnessing the host immune response to specifically target tumor cells without harming normal tissues. Strategies involve adoptive cellular therapy or active immune induction (commonly referred to as âcancer vaccinationâ). Cancer vaccines may consist of whole tumor cells or tumor lysates, but identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) over the past decade has made possible the use of specific proteins or peptides as cancer vaccines. The anti-tumor potential of TAA-specific CD8+ T cells has been illustrated by the demonstrated capacity of adoptive T cell therapy to reduce tumor size [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While endogenous anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses may already exist in some cancer patients [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], vaccination with TAA-derived peptides, and in particular heteroclitic peptide analogs, increases the frequency of TAA-specific T cell responses to detectable levels in many patients [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Heteroclitic peptide analogs are created by substitutions at anchor residues resulting in increased association of peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consequently, heteroclitic peptide analogs are predicted to be more immunogenic than their native counterparts because of more stable binding at the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Indeed, T cells capable of tumor lysis have been isolated from patients vaccinated with heteroclitic peptide [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the presence of TAA-specific T cells elicited by vaccination often does not correlate with clinical responses [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Various reasons for the paradoxical coexistence of cancer cells and TAA-specific T cells within patients have been proposed [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One possibility is that elicited TAA-specific T cells are not optimally functional in vivo [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another possibility is that T cells inefficient in tumor recognition or lysis are induced by vaccination [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is becoming recognized that antigen-specific T cells may have substantially different requirements for cognate peptide (the peptide that is recognizable to a specific T cell clone) for efficient target lysis [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. âRecognition efficiencyâ (RE) (also known as âfunctional avidityâ) is a measure of the sensitivity of a T cell to different peptide concentrations for stimulation [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We hypothesized that high antigen densities on APCs resulting from vaccination with heteroclitic peptide may paradoxically drive T cells of predominantly low RE, which are not efficiently activated by the endogenous expression levels of native peptides on tumor cells. Consequently, such T cells would be ineffective in tumor cell destruction. Support for this notion is emerging: T cells with low RE are predominantly expanded in vitro with high peptide concentration [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, in vitro stimulation of T cells from healthy donors with heteroclitic peptides results in expansion of cells with a wide range of RE [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A similar phenomenon may occur in vivo, leading to TAA-specific T cells of low RE depending on the nature of antigen stimulation [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>While isolated T cell clones with low RE have indeed been generated from melanoma patients following heteroclitic peptide vaccination, the proportion of vaccine-elicited T cell responses these cells represent in vivo is not clear. If predominantly high-RE, tumor-cytolytic T cells are generated, then a small fraction of low-RE T cells generated would be of little consequence. However, if predominantly low-RE T cells are generated, then this low proportion of high-RE T cells may be an important factor in the observed lack of clinical effectiveness of current cancer vaccination strategies. To address this important issue, we undertook a systematic examination of the complexity of T cell responses induced by heteroclitic peptide vaccination, and compared these responses to endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses which develop in some patients. Typically, responses to vaccination are examined following in vitro expansion from patient samples, which may alter the composition of cells and consequently not reveal the proportion of cells in vivo having sufficiently high RE to lyse tumor targets. Although staining with peptideâMHC tetramers provides a direct estimate for the number of TAA-specific T cells present in vivo, and intensity of tetramer staining has been employed as a parameter for isolation of high-RE, tumor-lytic T cells [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], staining intensity does not correlate well with RE or tumor-lytic potential [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and cannot be considered a reliable indicator for the functional status of TAA-specific T cells.</p>
              <p>To analyze and compare T cell responses in melanoma patients on a single-cell level, we generated and examined a large number of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones derived from post-vaccination or endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses. Each clone was analyzed for T cell receptor (TCR) variable chain beta (VB) expression, RE, and ability to lyse melanoma targets. Importantly, these clones were generated directly ex vivo through tetramer-guided sorting, which minimizes the selection bias that could be introduced by prior in vitro expansion. Therefore, data from these clones could be taken to estimate the complexity of the responses in vivo.</p>

They were required to have a magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scan of the head and computed tomographic scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showing no indication of disease within 4 wk of therapy to verify that they were clinically free of melanoma. Eligibility criteria included age 18 y or older, creatinine of less than 180 Î¼mol/l, bilirubin of less than 110 Î¼mol/l, platelet count of 100 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/l or more, hemoglobin of 90 g/l or more, and total white blood cell count of 3.0 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/l or greater. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C antibody (Ab), and hepatitis B surface antigen were required to be negative, and all patients were HLA-A2 antigen positive by a microcytotoxicity assay. All patients were required to comprehend and sign an informed consent form approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI; Bethesda, Maryland, United States) and the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Institutional Review Board. Analysis of the patient samples was approved by Stanford University's Institutional Review Board. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were isolated from patients after vaccination with the heteroclitic peptides MART 26â35 (27L) (ELAGIGILTV) and gp100 209â217 (210M) (IMDQVPSFV) at the University of Southern California Norris Cancer Center (Los Angeles, California, United States). Clinical-grade peptides used were provided by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the NCI under an Investigational New Drug application BB 6123 held by the NCI. Immunizations (1 mg of each peptide emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant) were administered every 2 wk for 8 wk, then every 4 wk for 12 wk, and then once 8 wk later. PBMC samples were collected 4 wk after the final immunization and stored at â130 Â°C. Samples were thawed the day before an experiment for overnight culture in CTL medium. The following morning, viable cells were isolated by ficoll density centrifugation, washed, and resuspended to the appropriate concentration in a solution of 90% Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).</p>

In addition, TAA-specific T cell responses could be detected in some patients without vaccination, suggesting the existence of an endogenous anti-tumor T cell response in these patients. For the current study, we selected samples from six melanoma patients from these trialsâfour with vaccine-elicited responses (patients 422, 476, 517, and 520) and two with endogenous T cell responses (patients 132 and 461)âfor detailed analyses of TCR VB usage, RE for the target peptide, and tumor cytotoxicity.

                <title>Vaccine-Elicited T Cells Are Functional Directly Ex Vivo but of Variable Tumor Reactivity</title>
                <p>Patient 422 had the largest detectable TAA-specific CD8+ T cell response (2.5% G209â2M-tetramer-positive) and thus sufficient numbers for examination of lytic function immediately following isolation. To test whether peptide-vaccine-induced T cell responses were functionally active directly ex vivo, T cells isolated by G209â2M-tetramer-guided cell sorting from patient 422 were tested for lysis of peptide-pulsed and melanoma target cells in microcytotoxic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The directly isolated tetramer-positive T cells from this patient specifically lysed T2 cells pulsed with high concentrations (1 Î¼g/ml) of G209â2M and native (G209n) peptides, but not with T2 cells pulsed with a cytomegalovirus-derived, HLA-A*0201-restricted peptide (NLVPMVATV) or melanoma targets. This suggests that while a significant portion of the vaccine-elicited T cells from patient 422 may be functional in vivo, they did not have significant tumor lysis activity.</p>
                <p>To assess the functional status of the smaller TAA-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the other five patientsâwhich were too small for direct cytotoxicity assays after sortingâwe utilized a novel FACS assay for degranulation based on CD107 mobilization [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All six TAA-specific populations exhibited robust functional responses ex vivo, as measured by percentage of G2090â2M- and M26-tetramer-positive cells that mobilized CD107 and/or downregulated the CD3 complex upon incubation with T2 cells pulsed with cognate peptides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t001">Table 1</xref>; 86%-99.6%). In response to melanoma targets mel526 and Malme-3M, which both express gp100 and MART-1 and are HLA-A*0201 positive, the two endogenous TAA-specific responses (samples from patients 132 and 461) also exhibited robust functional responses directly ex vivo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t001">Table 1</xref>; 36.8%â87%), and these responses were specific as they had little response to A375, a HLA-A*0201-positive melanoma cell that does not express gp100 or MART-1 and served as a negative control for antigen-specific killing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t001">Table 1</xref>; 2.7% and 3%). In contrast, the vaccine-elicited responses exhibited much lower reactivity to mel526 and Malme-3M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t001">Table 1</xref>; 23.8%â32.5%). These data demonstrate that all six TAA-specific CD8+ T cell responses were functional ex vivo, but there were significant differences in reactivity to melanoma targets between endogenous and vaccine-elicited responses.</p>

                <p>To confirm and further investigate the differences in tumor reactivity between endogenous and vaccine-elicited responses, we reasoned that analysis of a set of clonal CTL lines that represented the tetramer-positive population would provide an accurate estimate of the complexity of the TAA-specific T cell response in each patient. A large number of clonal CTL lines (more than 200) were generated by FACS of individual G209â2M- and M26-tetramer-positive cells directly from PBMC samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t002">Table 2</xref>). Up to 85% of sorted cells expanded in various sorts (data not shown). Randomly selected expanding clones and the tetramer-positive population from which they were derived were examined for TCR VB expression using TCR VB-specific monoclonal Abs and VB-specific primers in PCR. Diverse TAA-specific T cell responses were found in the four vaccinated patients, with multiple T cells expressing different TCR VB, while the two endogenous responses were less diverse. All but one clone derived from patient 132 expressed VB17, while two dominating T cell populations in patient 476 expressed VB14 and VB17 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t002">Table 2</xref>). The clonality of the dominant populations in these patients was evaluated by PCR fragment length analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t003">Table 3</xref>). Identical length fragments were demonstrated in the four selected clones from 476 BV14+ and 476 BV17+ populations. Identical length fragments were also demonstrated in all BV17+ clones from patient 132. Furthermore, analysis of sorted tetramer-positive cells from patient 476 demonstrated single fragment sizes for BV14 and BV17, which were identical to the fragment sizes generated from the selected clones, arguing for clonality of these dominant populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t004">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>Peptide specificity and CD8 expression of each clone was confirmed by staining with G209â2M- and M26-tetramers and anti-CD8 monoclonal Ab (data not shown). To obtain an accurate reflection of the total T cell population detected with tetramer in each patient, we decided to rigorously examine at least one representative clone for each subpopulation expressing a different TCR VB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t003">Table 4</xref>). Multiple clones were analyzed to determine dominating populations. From patients 132, 517, and 461, for which fewer clones were generated, all clones were included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010028-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>To determine the effectiveness of tumor lysis by the different TAA-specific T cell clones that were propagated, clones were analyzed for their ability to lyse melanoma cell lines mel526 and Malme-3M. A375 cells served as a control for antigen-specific killing. In addition, each CTL clone was examined for antigen-specific lysis of T2 cells pulsed with high levels (1Î¼g/ml) of G209â2M or M26 peptides. âEfficient lysisâ in these experiments was defined as 40% or greater specific release of radiolabel from the target cells; 10% or less specific release was categorized as âlow or no lysis,â and 10% to 40% was termed âintermediate lysis.â All but two of the CTL clones elicited from endogenous anti-tumor responses (from patients 132 and 461) exhibited âefficient lysisâ of both the mel526 and Malme-3M melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, only a few clones from the vaccine-elicited responses (from patients 422, 476, 520, and 517) efficiently lysed melanoma cells. The majority of clones examined from these vaccine-elicited responses either failed to lyse melanoma targets altogether or lysed them with intermediate efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This lack of efficiency in melanoma cell lysis was not due to cellular dysfunction, since each clone efficiently lysed T2 cells pulsed with high levels of relevant, but not irrelevant, peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, the majority of clones derived from endogenous anti-tumor responses (patients 132 and 461) lysed both mel526 and Malme-3M melanoma target cells more efficiently than clones from vaccine-elicited responses (patients 422, 476, 520, and 517) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These findings suggest that TAA-specific T cells elicited by heteroclitic peptide vaccination have different tumor-cytolytic potentials from those which develop endogenously to cancer.</p>

                <title>RE for Native and Heteroclitic Peptides of T Cells from Endogenous or Vaccine-Elicited Responses</title>
                <p>We hypothesized that CTL clones that did not efficiently lyse melanoma targets may be incapable of recognizing the relatively low surface densities of native peptide present on tumor cells. CTL clones selected for analysis of tumor lysis were also assessed for RE for the native and heteroclitic peptides via a ten-log range of dilutions. This is illustrated with clones 132.1 and 476.105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). There were considerable differences in killing of peptide-pulsed T2 cells by these two clones. The differences in RE for G209n native peptide displayed by the two clones highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g003">Figure 3</xref>A correlated with their ability to lyse melanoma cells: the high-RE clone 132.1 efficiently lysed melanoma targets, whereas the low-RE clone 476.105 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In contrast to the differences in RE for G209n peptide, similar assays revealed little difference in RE of the two clones for G209â2M heteroclitic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), suggesting that these clones recognize the native and heteroclitic peptides differently, and that RE for the native, but not heteroclitic, peptide correlates with tumor-lytic potential.</p>
                <p>Similar RE assays were performed for the remaining clones from each patient selected for analysis. In order to compare REs of various CTL lines, each clone was assigned an RE score expressed as the negative log<sub>10</sub> value of the peptide concentration required for 40% specific lysis at an E:T ratio of 10:1. For clones 132.1 and 476.105, these scores were 11.1 and 8.3 for assays with G209n peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and 11.2 and 11.2 for assays with G209â2M heteroclitic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), respectively. We compiled the data on clones from all patients, which showed a correlation between tumor-lytic potential and RE for native peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">5</xref>B). Overall, clones generated from endogenous anti-tumor responses had higher RE for the native peptide than clones generated from post-vaccine responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">5</xref>D). We estimated the composite RE of the overall TAA-specific response (composed of a heterogeneous population of T cells) in vivo by summing the RE of each clone multiplied by its representation in the original mixture (the representation was estimated based on the proportion of TAA-specific cells expressing the same VB as the clone). These composite RE values are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">Figure 5</xref> as horizontal bars for each response. Clearly, the endogenous responses (patients 461 and 132) had a higher overall, and more homogeneous, RE for the native peptide than the vaccine-elicited responses (patients 422, 476, 517, and 520) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">5</xref>D). Importantly, the vaccine-elicited clones also exhibited wide variations in RE even for the heteroclitic peptide, compared to the endogenous responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">Figure 5</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0010028-g005">5</xref>F). This suggests that the variation in RE for native peptides, and hence ability to lyse tumor cells, for vaccine-elicited responses is not merely a reflection of differential recognition of native and heteroclitic peptides by many clones. Rather, variations in RE may be a function of the manner in which these cells were elicited in vivo via vaccination.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To achieve maximal clinical responses, the majority of T cells elicited by vaccination in cancer patients should be capable of responding to tumor targets. We have undertaken the most detailed analysis to date, on a single-cell level, of T cell responses elicited by cancer vaccination and have compared these with endogenous anti-tumor responses. To evaluate the full spectrum of T cells elicited in each patient by vaccination, we utilized tetramers made with the vaccine peptides (heteroclitic M26 and G209â2M) to isolate such cells. CTL clones were selected directly from patient PBMC samples without enrichment in culture to closely reflect the composition of the antigen-specific T cell response in vivo at the time of isolation.</p>
              <p>Our data revealed that T cell populations induced by vaccination were significantly different from endogenous responses: while some CTLs elicited by vaccination could kill melanoma targets, most were inefficient in tumor cell lysis. In contrast, nearly all clones from endogenous responses were efficient at melanoma cell lysis. This difference was related to RE for the native peptide. Clones that did not lyse tumor cells required up to 10<sup>3</sup>-fold higher concentration of peptide for similar levels of lysis of targets compared to T cell clones that were tumor-lytic. Side-by-side comparison of endogenous responses and vaccine-induced responses suggests that low RE TAA-specific T cell responses may be preferentially driven by heteroclitic peptide vaccination. Thus, high doses of peptide and/or the higher levels of expression of heteroclitic peptide on APCs may induce and actively propagate predominantly T cells with RE too low for recognition of physiological levels of the native peptide present on tumor targets. These data suggest an inverse relationship between antigen density and the RE of T cells elicited. This would be an important consideration in design of future vaccine strategies.</p>
              <p>Differential recognition of native and heteroclitic peptides by many T cells may also account for the induction of non-tumor-lytic clones by heteroclitic peptide vaccines, which has been suggested previously [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, our data suggest that epitope density may be the dominant driving factor for RE in vivo. In all of the vaccine-elicited T cell responses, many of the T cells generated were either of low or intermediate RE not only for the native peptide, but also for the heteroclitic peptide, and exhibited no or intermediate lysis of tumor targets. In contrast, nearly all of the clones generated from the endogenous responses were of high RE. This suggests that the high dosage of peptides administered in vaccinations and the increased binding capacity of heteroclitic peptides to MHC moleculesâthe very quality that provides them with increased immunogenicityâdrive the induction of many T cells with low RE for both heteroclitic and native peptides.</p>
              <p>Another implication of this study is that the number of cells measured by current methods, including ELISPOT or staining with MHC tetramers, may not correlate directly with the RE or tumor reactivity of T cell responses to vaccination. For example, of the nine clones analyzed from patient 517, none were efficient in tumor cell lysis, yet these cells were detectable by MHC tetramer staining. T cells with low RE for native TAA do not efficiently lyse tumor, and therefore are unlikely to have an impact on clinical outcome. Furthermore, it may be possible that low-RE TAA-specific T cells may interfere with elicitation of high-RE T cells, either by direct competition for antigen on APC surface [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or down-modulation of peptideâMHC complexes.</p>
              <p>Our data support the notion that not only quantity, but quality, of the T cell response elicited by vaccination may be important for clinical efficacy. There are a number of strategies to increase the magnitude of T cell responses to peptide vaccines. These include using various adjuvants, such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant and immunomodulatory agents, such as IL-12 [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], GM-CSF [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], anti-CTLA-4 Abs [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], or heat shock proteins [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus far, none of these approaches have produced improved clinical outcomes. Our data suggest that in addition to driving higher numbers of vaccine-elicited T cells, strategies to modulate the relative RE of T cell responses are also needed. While the selective activation of high- versus low-RE T cells is relatively easy to manipulate in vitro via stimulation with limiting amounts of peptides, this may be more difficult to control in vivo. It is important to bear in mind that signals needed to drive a de novo naÃ¯ve T cell response may be different from those required to drive further expansion of an activated T cell population [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, a complete vaccination strategy may involve an initial induction phase, followed by progressive shaping of the response to higher RE. Although heteroclitic peptide vaccination may drive T cells of mixed high and low RE, such a strong stimulus may be needed to induce an initial de novo T cell response. Studies in mice suggest that once activated, effector CD8+ T cells may have an increase in RE of up to 70-fold compared to naÃ¯ve cells [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, naÃ¯ve TAA-specific T cells, with inadequate RE to become activated by low densities of native peptides present on tumor cells, may become efficient in tumor lysis upon vaccination with heteroclitic peptide. This notion has support from studies in tolerized mice: vaccination with a heteroclitic peptide analog recruited T cells, which were responsive to secondary stimulation with native peptide [<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010028-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, optimized use of heteroclitic peptide to induce an initial peptide-specific T cell response, followed by selective expansion of the highest RE tumor-lytic T cells may be needed for an effective strategy with clear clinical application.</p>
              <p>In summary, we have demonstrated that vaccination with heteroclitic peptide at high concentrations may drive T cell responses of variable tumor-cytolytic potential in cancer patientsâand that the ability to lyse tumor cells correlates with the T cell's RE for native peptides. This represents an importantâbut not soleâfactor in explaining the lack of correlation between immunological and clinical responses after vaccination for cancer. Importantly, the situation is different in endogenous responses, in which cells are predominantly of high RE. This suggests that the manner in which T cells are elicited in vivo are different in these two settings and may underlie their differences in biology.</p>

                    <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
                    <p>Our immune system protects us against infectious diseases. It can also recognize and destroy early cancer cells before they form tumors. Researchers have been trying to find a way to boost the anti-cancer function of the immune system so that it can kill even established tumors. This is the idea behind developing vaccines for treating cancerâthe vaccine alerts and boosts the patient's immune system and so helps to fight the cancer. The idea of enlisting the immune system against cancer has been around for a long time. There have been some spectacular successes, but it has proven difficult to find vaccines that work in more than just a few patients. And we don't yet understand why vaccines seem to work in some patients but not in others.</p>

                    <title>What Did the Researchers Do?</title>
                    <p>Peter Lee and colleagues are trying to find out why some patients respond to vaccines and others don't by looking at the immune response in vaccinated patients. In this study, using state-of-the art technology, they examined patients who received different vaccines against the skin cancer melanoma. They concentrated on the so-called killer T cells (cytotoxic T cells), which directly attack and kill tumor cells, and analyzed them in great detail.</p>

                  <sec id="sb1a3">
                    <title>What Did They Find?</title>
                    <p>Most cytotoxic T cells produced by patients after vaccinationâincluding vaccination with so-called heteroclitic peptides that had been specifically designed to provoke a very strong immune responseâdid not kill tumor cells very well, but a few of them did. These results provide some explanation as to why cancer vaccines haven't been as successful as many had hoped, but also suggest that if it were possible to get more of the potent T cells or to expand the ones that are already produced with the current vaccines, there would be a stronger anti-tumor response.</p>

                    <title>What Next?</title>
                    <p>How to get effective cancer vaccines remains an open question. But at least technologies such as those used in this study now exist that allow researchers to analyze how the immune systems of different patients react to vaccination and hence can guide the development of better vaccines.</p>
