                <p>Background: Poor health care worker (HCW) interactions with adolescents negatively influence engagement in HIV care. We assessed the impact of standardized patient actor training on HCW competence in providing adolescent HIV care in Kenya. Methods: We conducted pre-post cross-sectional surveys and qualitative exit interviews during a stepped wedge randomized trial. Cross-sectional surveys assessed self-rated competence in providing adolescent services before and after the intervention, and training satisfaction. In-depth interviews with a subset of HCW participants one year after training. Results: Over 90% of HCWs reported satisfaction with the training and there was significant improvement in self-rated competence scores (mean = 4.63 [highest possible score of 5] post-training vs 3.86 pre-training, p &lt; 0.001). One-year following training, HCWs reported using skills in patient-centered communication and structuring an adolescent clinical encounter. Conclusions: This SP training intervention improved self-rated competence and showed sustained perceived impact on HCW skills in adolescent HIV service provision one year later.</p>

              <p>Emerging evidence indicates that AYFS provision, including both trained adolescent health care workers (HCWs) and structural changes like adolescent clinic days, has potential to improve AYA engagement in HIV care in SSA.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Availability of adolescent friendly services including designated spaces has been associated with higher retention and viral suppression among adolescents.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>We collected both qualitative and quantitative data within a 5-year stepped-wedge trial of a standardized patient actor training intervention that had a primary aim of improved retention of AYA in HIV care. Cross-sectional surveys assessed satisfaction with training, and self-rated ability in providing adolescent HIV services before and after the training. To assess application and durability of skills in routine service provision to AYA, we conducted in-depth interviews with 18 HCWs one year after training. The data were collected between 2016 and 2019.</p>

These were followed by HCWs rotating through seven video-recorded SP encounters reflecting adolescent care issues including prevention with positives, family planning, disclosure and adherence, gender-based violence, neurocognitive delay, sexual identity, and depression, followed by a group debriefing session.</p>
                <p>Professional actors were recruited through a local casting agency and received a 5-day training from an SP methodology consultant. The actors were trained on role playing seven case scripts that mimic common issues in adolescent HIV care. Additionally, the SPs were trained on giving immediate verbal feedback, completing feedback forms on various aspects of HCW communication following each encounter. Each actor was assigned a specific case and a common practice case that they had to master and portray with realism by end of the training. Actors had a one-day refresher training just before each training wave to review their case scripts and go through a practice session with the study trainers.</p>

                <p>We trained 95 HCW from 24 HIV care facilities across 4 counties in Kenya, between 2016 and 2019. The training was conducted in 4 waves, 9 months apart. A pre-training period of 6 months was used to recruit HCW for training. Additional recruitment was done before each training wave at facilities that were scheduled for training. Eligible HCWs included nurses, clinical officers, and psychosocial/adherence counselors; were ages 18 and older; and provided HIV services to AYA. We purposively selected 6 HCWs from each training wave for interviews, aiming for equal distribution across cadres and intervention wave, until saturation was reached after three waves.</p>

In addition, HCWs rated case difficulty in communication and medical decision-making (1 = <italic toggle="yes">very challenging</italic> to 5 = <italic toggle="yes">very easy</italic>), realism and relevance of each SP encounter (1 = <italic toggle="yes">very irrelevant/ unrealistic</italic> to 5 = very <italic toggle="yes">relevant/ realistic</italic>).

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>The goal of this mixed methods analysis was to understand how providers trained with the SP intervention used their skills in practice and perceived impact on AYA retention in care. The qualitative component was primary. Quantitative data on self-rated competence were included to enhance qualitative results at the analysis stage. Descriptive variables were summarized using medians, interquartile ranges (IQR) and proportions.</p>
                <p>Pre and post training self-rated competence responses from the Likert scale items were merged, defining “agree” and “strongly agree” as “competent” and “neutral”, “disagree” and “strongly disagree” as “not comptetent", and summarized as proportions for each of the 8 competence domains. Further, the Likert scale was converted to a numeric scale and the pre and post training competence scores reported as means (standard deviation). Generalized estimating equations (correlation structure = independence) compared the difference in mean self-rated competence scores pre and post training. Since HCW were enrolled in the study at different times (waves) throughout the study, we adjusted for wave in the models. We reported mean differences, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), and p-values from Wald tests for each domain and overall score. We adjusted for age at recruitment in all models assessing the effect of training on competence Completed IDI transcripts were uploaded to Dedoose<sup><xref rid="bibr21-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> for analysis. An initial codebook was developed by two coders from the study team based on a subset of transcripts and literature review. Additional codes were that emerged during the coding process were included in the final codebook. Using the final codebook, all transcripts were coded by one coder and then coding reviewed by a second coder. Disagreements in coding were resolved through discussion.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Using content analysis, preliminary themes were arrived at through an iterative process of review and discussion by the two coders then reviewed by the larger study team and further refined.

                <p>Among the 18 participants who took part in the IDIs, 6 (33%) were nurses 5 (28%) were clinical officers and 7 (39%) were adherence counselors. Overall, participating HCWs commended the training for its unique format, noting that the practical skills gained were easy to remember and apply in their day-to-day interactions with AYA clients. They reported utilizing skills gained from the training conducted a year earlier, and that this had an impact on ALHIV's retention in care and viral suppression.</p>
                <p>Three key themes emerged on experiences with the SP training intervention: (1) skills from the SP training that HCW used in practice; (2) impact of the SP training on HCW's attitudes towards ALHIV; and (3) durability of skills from SP training after one year.

              <p>The HCWs reflected on their values during the values clarification exercise and group debriefing sessions, and how those values affected service delivery to ALHIV.

                <title>Facilitators and Barriers to Using Skills in Routine Care</title>
                <p>There were barriers and facilitators to implementation of skills in the day-today care of ALHIV. Existing adolescent friendly services such as adolescent spaces within the clinic and separate adolescent clinic days made it easier for HCWs to use the skills. HCWs in clinics that had strong teamwork and supportive leadership were also motivated to use the skills gained.<disp-quote><p>“One thing we have a specific day for adolescents so that day we specifically …it is for adolescents so one thing …they are in the same age group so if there is a client who has an issue with confidentiality or disclosure and doesn‘t what to be seen with other clients will feel at least comfortable and in that forum.” Clinical officer, Trained 2017</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>On the other hand, the HCWs recognized that there were challenges that they had to navigate in as much as they were motivated to use the skills. These include lack of adolescent friendly spaces to offer adolescents services in and client-provider ratio. Some clinics lack adequate privacy since they have minimal clinic space that is shared among the healthcare workers thus, they do not feel confident and comfortable enough to explore AYA issues.<disp-quote><p> “One of them is that we don‘t have space, one time I could have this space and another time I could have a very congested place to flow with the adolescent‘s.But now you find that we can have that time there but now you might have a special case where by you don‘t want interference and also staffing … it has interfered with this because you find that we are very few and many clients would come and they want the service very quickly.” <bold>Nurse, Trained 2018</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>Perceived impact of training on retention of ALHIV in care and viral suppression After applying the skills gained for about 12 months, HCWs reported that the quality of services offered to adolescents and young adults at the respective clinics had improved. They revealed that these improvements in quality of care may have been one reason for the improved retention in care and viral suppression that they had observed.<disp-quote><p>“Using the skills gained, I have seen improvements in retention, I have seen few deaths since then, I have only heard one case of death, I have seen the suppression (viral) rates have gone up. So, I think it has improved the performances in this clinic and other clinics I go to, we do not have a high VL (Viral Load) right now.” <bold>Counselor, Trained 2018</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>The majority of the participants reported that improved services to AYA clients following use of skills over time may have contributed to ALHIV engaging better with providers, taking charge of their health, and lives including adhering to clinic visits.<disp-quote><p>“Through the motivational interviewing I can say that … there has been a change in everything. In self-esteem, retention because I have actually not lost any adolescent since I started engaging them one on one when I started, I had almost talked to all of them now I started engaging them as a group, yeah, and they look forward to coming to the clinics, even on different sessions. So, I feel that it has impacted their lives.” <bold>Clinical Officer, Trained 2018</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>Participants also noted that as they were putting the skills to use, many AYA appeared more comfortable discussing topics that were previously considered sensitive, such as contraceptive use and other sex related topics.<disp-quote><p><bold> “</bold>So many adolescents were closed up, there was that feeling that something is not adding up. I could not just put my finger on this. After the SPEED training and getting more skills, I am able to navigate and now I can see that it‘s not hard for them to open up to me and tell me any challenge they are going through, ask for advice on anything. So, I get questions about anything from contraceptives, sex, if it‘s okay to have, all those things that were bottled up. “<bold>Counselor, Trained 2018</bold></p></disp-quote></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This analysis demonstrated that SP clinical training bridged an important gap by equipping HCWs with skills and improving attitudes in adolescent care. HCWs gained skills in establishing a rapport, motivational interviewing, using a systematic approach to the clinical visit, and adopting a non-judgmental approach. The training was perceived by HCWs to result in durable impact in their approach to AYA during the year following training. Improved levels of self-rated competence after training among the entire training cohort substantiated the qualitative findings (<xref rid="table5-23259582221075133" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>
              <p>The SP training targeted improving HCW communication with AYA in HIV care including the use of patient-centered communication approaches, conducting a systematic clinical assessment, showing empathy and being non-judgmental, as recommended in Kenyan and WHO Adolescent Friendly Services (AFS) guidelines. Most HCWs reported never having received training in these core skills despite providing adolescent services for an average period of three years. Gaining these skills through the SP training helped them communicate and interact better with adolescents receiving HIV care services at the respective clinics. The training approach was useful in helping HCWs gain practical skills and evaluate their own attitudes towards AYA through the feedback sessions. HCW participants were also highly satisfied with the use of SPs. In previous studies, the use of simulation has been shown to improve HCW skills and yield better outcomes for patients/clients.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It was apparent that HCWs providing HIV care to AYA recognized that they have been judgmental and have had negative attitudes towards AYA, since after the SP training they reported that they were now deliberate about being nonjudgmental. Further, HCWs in this study reported that they felt they were able to communicate issues better and AYA seemed more receptive. This was perceived to have some impact on retention in care and viral suppression rates among AYA receiving care in the facilities. These benefits further motivated the healthcare workers to continue using the skills they had gained as they felt they were getting through to adolescents and adolescents also getting more comfortable sharing their issues with them. In another quantitative study in South Africa, kind attitude of HCWs towards adolescents was associated with significant retention of adolescents in HIV care.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-23259582221075133" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Improving empathetic and kind care by HCWs will likely result in better retention of AYA in HIV care.</p>
              <p>Structuring an adolescent assessment helps the provider to comprehensively assess all the aspects of adolescent care needs. This forms a basis to identify and address adolescent needs. Providers appreciated the use of the adolescent checklist as provided for in the Adolescent Package of Care (APOC) as part of national guidelines. They gained confidence and acknowledged that it was possible to do the assessment within a short time. Facility context played an important role in supporting or hindering the use of skills by providers. Factors such as separate clinic spaces or separate clinic days which provide for confidentiality were important to allow providers to apply their skills. This further explains the importance of privacy and confidentiality to both adolescent clients and their providers.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Overall, the SP training intervention was appreciated and endorsed by HCWs and resulted in improved self-reported competence for adolescent-friendly care, as evidenced in our qualitative and quantitative results. SP encounters were perceived by HCWs to have provided sustained impact on HCW skills in adolescent service provision one year later. Given the unique needs of adolescents and the inadequacies HCWs feel regarding their skills talking with ALHIV, simulated patient training could enhance care and, in turn, may support retention and viral suppression among adolescents.</p>
