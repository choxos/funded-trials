                  <p>Can a 12-hour theory-based behavioral intervention culturally adapted for students in
sixth grade in South Africa reduce forced sexual intercourse perpetration among

                  <p>In this secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial that included 1052
South African adolescents, the percentage reporting perpetration of forced sexual
intercourse by 54 months postintervention was 9% in the intervention group and 14% in

                  <p>Scant research has investigated interventions to reduce forced sexual intercourse among

                  <p>A cluster randomized clinical trial, at schools located in a township and a semirural

selected (9 of 17); of 1118 students in sixth grade at these 18 schools who had parent
or guardian consent, 1057 (94%) were enrolled, and those not reporting forced sex

Poisson regression analyses adjusting for gender and clustering within schools were
conducted between August 23, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Recruiters and data collectors,
but not intervention facilitators, were blind to the participants’ intervention

              <p>The prevalence of forced sex is high in South Africa<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and
throughout southern Africa generally.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although most sexual violence studies have focused on
adults, recognition of the problem of sexual violence among adolescents is
growing.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Studies in the
United States<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and Europe<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> highlight the high
rates of experienced forced sex among girls,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> but in southern Africa,
high rates of experienced forced sex have been observed in both girls and boys.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For instance, in a survey of
school-going adolescents in 10 southern African countries, 20% of girls and 20% of boys
reported experiencing forced sex, and 5% of girls and 12% of boys reported perpetrating
forced sex.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Forced sex
experiences during adolescence can have deleterious consequences, including increased risk
of depression,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> suicide ideation,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> substance use,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> early pregnancy,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and sexually

HIV.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Developmentally,
adolescence provides a unique opportunity to promote behaviors that prevent sexual violence
over the life course because during this period gender role differentiation intensifies and
children try out new ways of thinking and acting in intimate relationships.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Reviews of the literature suggest that behavioral interventions can reduce intimate partner
violence (IPV) among adolescents,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> but most studies have not examined sexual violence separate from other
types of IPV (eg, physical and psychological violence). Some have examined the experience or
perpetration of IPV, but not both, and few have examined effects of interventions on
experience of forced sex among adolescent boys in low- or middle-income countries.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Moreover, many studies had weak
designs, short follow-up periods, or high attrition rates.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A recent review<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> asserted that only 3 primary prevention strategies
have reduced sexual violence in rigorous outcome evaluations: Safe Dates,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Shifting Boundaries,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and funding associated with the 1994 Violence Against Women
Act.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In Safe Dates, a
14-school cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 50% of 1566 students in eighth grade
retained at 3-year follow-up, intervention participants experienced less forced sexual
behavior than did no-treatment controls.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In Shifting Boundaries, a 30-school cluster RCT on 2655 students in
middle school randomized to a classroom-based, building-based, combined, or no intervention
group, the building-only and combined intervention participants experienced less sexual
violence than did controls at 6-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Most trials of forced sex interventions have been
conducted in the United States or other high-income countries, which has led to calls for
rigorous intervention trials in low- and middle-income countries.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This article reports secondary analyses of the efficacy of Let Us Protect Our Future, a
theory-based, culturally appropriate, HIV risk-reduction intervention, in reducing the
experience and perpetration of forced sex in a middle-income country, South Africa, where
forced sex is exceptionally common.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In a cluster RCT,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> 18 schools serving students in sixth grade in Eastern Cape Province,
South Africa, were randomized to Let Us Protect Our Future or an attention-matched control
group. The primary outcome analyses indicating the intervention reduced sexual risk
behaviors,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> analyses of the mediation of its efficacy,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and analyses indicating it reduced
sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence among sexually experienced adolescents were
reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The
intervention was developed based on formative data to address not only sexual risk reduction
but also gender issues and rape myth beliefs and included activities to reduce the risk of
perpetrating and experiencing forced sex.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> We hypothesized that the interventions focused on reducing the risk of
forced sex would translate into fewer adolescents reporting perpetrating forced sex or
experiencing forced sex in the intervention group compared with the attention-matched
control group.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This article reports post hoc secondary analyses conducted between August 23, 2017, and
April 30, 2018 of a cluster RCT. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline. Institutional review board No. 8 at the
University of Pennsylvania, the designated institutional review board under the federal wide
assurances of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Fort Hare, approved the
study (trial protocol is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI180083-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Written parent or guardian permission and
adolescent assent were required for participation. As reported elsewhere,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> we conducted the study in an urban
township, Mdantsane, and a neighboring semirural settlement, Berlin, in Eastern Cape
Province, South Africa. Schools serving students in sixth grade from the general population
were eligible. Of 36 schools serving students in sixth grade in the catchment area, 1
serving children with learning disabilities was ineligible, leaving 35 eligible schools, all
agreeing to participate. From 17 matched pairs of schools similar in numbers of students in
sixth grade, classrooms, and classrooms with electricity, including 1 pair consisting of 3
schools, we randomly selected 9 pairs.</p>
              <p>We used a cluster RCT design, reducing the potential for contamination between treatment
groups that would be present were individuals randomized. We enrolled schools over 13 months
beginning in October 4, 2004. The trial biostatistician identified computer-generated random
number sequences to randomize, within pairs, 1 school to the HIV/STD risk-reduction
intervention and 1 to the control group. The project director implemented the assignments.
Recruiters, following a standardized scripted recruitment protocol, announced the study at
the schools and distributed cover letters and parent or guardian permission forms to
students in sixth grade. During recruitment, school personnel, potential participants, and
recruiters were masked to the schools’ randomized intervention assignment. The nature
of the intervention precluded masking the facilitators and participants to the group
assignment during the interventions.</p>
              <sec id="H2-1-ZOI180083">
                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>The Let Us Protect Our Future intervention was developed based on social cognitive
theory<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and the theory of
planned behavior,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> integrated
with qualitative information from extensive formative research with the target
population.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> It included
12 one-hour modules, with 2 modules delivered during each of 6 sessions on consecutive
school days involving games, brainstorming, role-playing, group discussions, and comic
workbooks with a series of characters and story lines. Although the intervention was
primarily designed to reduce sexual risk behaviors, it included several features designed
to address gender issues and rape myth beliefs relevant to perpetration and experience of
forced sex. Formative research suggested that girls were in danger of sexual assault if
they accepted drinks, snacks, gifts, or a taxi ride from a man, who might then see himself
as entitled to have sex afterward; accordingly, the intervention included activities to
reduce this risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> One was a
doll activity to challenge negative attitudes toward women and sexual coercion.
Participants used dolls with changeable clothing to express their views on how young women
dress in music videos, work, and school and considered whether a woman’s clothing is
a legitimate reason to infer that she has bad character and whether a girl who dresses
sexy is asking for sex or deserves to be forced to have sex.</p>
                <p>To increase participants’ skills and self-efficacy to avoid risky situations, we
created the “Long Walk Home” in which participants identified risky situations
and/or men they might encounter on their way to or from school. They traced the safest
paths on a map and brainstormed strategies to reduce their risk of sexual coercion.
Indeed, the scale measuring self-efficacy to avoid risky situations was a significant
mediator of the intervention’s effects on abstinence; particularly among girls
compared with boys.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The
“Stop, Think, and Act” activity reinforced refusal skills and impulse control
beliefs. The “What Is a Relationship” activity reinforced pride in having a
healthy relationship. The “Understanding Risky Situations” activity reinforced
being aware of risky situations and how to plan to avoid them. The “Knowing and
Setting Sexual Limits” activity helped the participants to be able to know and
express their limits to avoid risky behaviors. Finally, participants practiced sex refusal
by stomping a foot and saying “No!” Beyond these activities, the intervention
was implemented in mixed-sex groups of 9 to 16 adolescents cofacilitated by a specially
trained man and woman, and these facilitator pairs modeled egalitarian gender roles in
delivering the intervention.</p>
                <p>The 12-hour health promotion control intervention<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> included activities similar to the HIV/STD
risk-reduction intervention delivered over 6 sessions cofacilitated by a specially trained
man and woman, targeting physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption, behaviors
linked to chronic diseases that are leading causes of death in South Africa.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The interventions were pilot tested in English in Mdantsane,
translated into Xhosa, back-translated from Xhosa to English, pilot tested in Xhosa in
Mdantsane and Berlin, and delivered in Xhosa in the trial.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>We enrolled in the trial students in sixth grade who completed the preintervention
questionnaire and attended session 1 of the intervention. They completed immediate and 3-,
6-, and 12-month postintervention questionnaires by December 15, 2006. Intervention and
data collection sessions were held at the students’ school. The initial informed
assent and parent permission process covered activities through the 12-month
follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Accordingly,
we located the students, then attending more than 200 secondary schools, and gave them
parent or guardian permission forms and cover letters explaining the continuation of the
trial and inviting their parents or guardians to a meeting at which they could ask
questions about the follow-up study.</p>
                <p>We began the 42-month data collection in April 19, 2008, and completed the 54-month data
collection on June 30, 2010.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
As compensation, students received a notebook, a pen, and a pencil for the 3-month
follow-up; a T-shirt for the 6-month follow-up; a backpack for the 12-month follow-up; an
umbrella (for girls) or a cap (for boys) for the 42-month follow-up; and a jacket for the
54-month follow-up. We held the intervention and data collection sessions, except 42- and
54-month follow-ups, at the students’ schools during the extracurricular period at
the end of the school day. We held the 42- and 54-month follow-ups on Saturdays at 1 of
the 18 schools, a centrally located school with suitable plumbing facilities, and provided
transportation to the sessions.</p>

                <p>Participants completed confidential questionnaires containing questions on forced sex
before the intervention and 3, 6, 12, 42, and 54 months after the intervention
administered by data collectors who were blind to participants’ intervention

English and were pilot tested with adolescents from the population.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The forced sex outcomes in this
secondary analysis were not described in the trial registration. We assessed forced sex at
each assessment with measures whose reliability and validity has been established in
previous studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> including pilot studies with Xhosa-speaking adolescents.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> We defined vaginal intercourse as “your penis in a girl’s
vagina” (male version) or “a boy’s penis in your vagina” (female
version). Binary variables were used to assess history of ever perpetrating and
experiencing forced sexual intercourse, with responses coded 1 for respondents not
reporting ever experiencing the event and 2 for those reporting ever experiencing the
event. To assess perpetrated forced vaginal intercourse, participants were asked,
“Have you ever had vaginal intercourse with someone who did not want to have sex
with you?” To assess experienced forced vaginal intercourse, participants were
asked, “Have you ever been forced to have vaginal intercourse against your
will?”</p>

for any subsequent follow-up assessment after being initially reported (eg, incidence of
ever reporting perpetrating or experiencing forced sex over the course of the study) and
operationalized as being absent if and only if forced sex was never reported at any visit.
The model was tested at each of the 5 postintervention assessments. Additional analyses
tested the intervention effect on time-specific incidence adjusting for time. Robust
standard errors were used and an exchangeable working correlation matrix was specified.

95% confidence intervals are reported. Analyses of postintervention perpetration excluded
5 participants in the original sample who reported ever perpetrating forced sex at
baseline, and analyses of postintervention experience of forced sex excluded 7
participants in the original sample who reported ever having such experience at baseline.
In the analyses, participants (4 controls and 3 intervention participants) who were

forced sex × intervention condition at each assessment. <xref rid="zoi180083t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the HIV/STD risk-reduction
intervention reduced self-reported forced sex perpetration at each of the 5 postintervention

incidence, the intervention’s effect in reducing forced sex perpetration was
significant, adjusting for time.</p>

                  <p>One school was ineligible because it exclusively served children who had learning
disabilities, for whom the type of intervention planned was inappropriate. A total of 17
schools not randomly selected were excluded from participation. At 6 schools, there were
too few classrooms to accommodate all of the students who had consent; accordingly, we
randomly selected students as eligible from among those with consent, resulting in 278
students who were deemed ineligible. One student in the HIV/sexually transmitted disease
(STD) intervention and 4 students in the health promotion intervention reported
perpetrating forced sex at baseline.</p>

more efficacious in reducing forced sex among boys than among girls. Among boys, the effect

contrast, among girls, effects were not significant. However, the intervention
condition × sex interaction was not significant in the time-specific
incidence analysis. There were no adverse events.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The results indicated that the intervention reduced self-reported forced sex perpetration
throughout the postintervention follow-up period. The adolescents randomized to the HIV/STD
risk-reduction intervention were less likely to report forcing someone to have sexual
intercourse 3, 6, 12, 42, and 54 months postintervention as compared with their counterparts
in the attention-matched control condition. Boys were more likely to report perpetrating
forced sex than girls, and the intervention was more efficacious in reducing forced sex
perpetration among boys than girls.</p>
              <p>The intervention also showed some promise in reducing forced sex experiences, particularly
among boys. Although the intervention effect on incidence over the 54-month period was not
significant, the HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention participants were less likely to report
experiencing forced sex at 12 and 42 months postintervention compared with the control
group. The reduction in the intervention group at 3, 6, and 54 months postintervention was
not significantly different from the control group in the sample as a whole. However,
significant interactions with sex indicated that at 3- and 6-month follow-up, the
intervention reduced forced sex experience among boys.</p>
              <p>It is perhaps not surprising that the intervention generally had more reliable effects on
forced sex perpetration than experiences. Perpetration of forced sex is more within the
volitional control of the individual than is experiencing forced sex. People can choose to
force another person to have sex or to respect the person’s wish to say no to sex. In
contrast, avoiding being forced to have sex is less within the volitional control of the
individual. There are steps that individuals can take to reduce risk, and the intervention
was designed to give participants the requisite knowledge and skills, but eliminating risk
is substantially more difficult, especially when faced with a determined perpetrator.</p>
              <p>It is notable that boys were more likely to experience forced sex than were girls, a
finding observed in other studies in southern Africa.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although our data do not address the reasons for this,
speculation might include the fact that young adolescent girls’ bodies are more
protected owing to fear of pregnancy and HIV and concern about the family’s ability to
collect lobola (ie, bride price, property [often cattle] a prospective husband gives to the
head of the family of the prospective wife) on her marriage. There is also likely blindness
to the sexual abuse of young adolescent boys, accompanied by the belief that males are not
vulnerable to sexual assault.<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180083r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Two other studies hint at the possibility of reducing sexual assault among South Africans
with behavioral interventions. However, both focused on IPV rather than forced sex more
generally, which can be perpetrated on or by a broader range of people, including not only a
romantic partner but also a family member, a stranger, or an acquaintance. A cluster
RCT<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> that combined a
microfinance program and content on gender roles, domestic violence, and sex and HIV showed
reduced IPV at 12-month follow-up. However, the outcome combined physical and sexual
violence, making assessment of the intervention’s effects on sexual violence
independent of physical violence impossible, and the participants were not adolescents, but
adult women aged 33 to 49 years. Another cluster RCT<sup><xref rid="zoi180083r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> reported that an intervention produced nearly
significant (<italic>P</italic> = .05) reductions in perpetration of physical or
sexual IPV by men; again, physical and sexual violence were combined and most participants
(63%) were aged 18 years or older. Thus, to our knowledge, this RCT is the first to find
that an intervention reduced the perpetration and experience of forced sex in South African
young adolescent boys and girls.</p>
              <p>The strengths of this study include the attention-matched control group, random selection
of schools, high retention rates at long-term follow-up (with over 99% returning for at
least 1 follow-up, including over 92% who returned 4.5 years postintervention), and the
cluster RCT design, which increased internal validity while decreasing risk of contamination
between groups. Another strength is that we assessed sexual coercion as a separate outcome,
not combined with physical abuse as has been done in other studies. Worldwide, many studies
have been faced with methodological challenges in assessing sexual coercion as an outcome,
given its relatively lower prevalence in comparison with other forms of partner violence. In
part, we could detect intervention effects in our sample because the rates of both
perpetration and experiences were high.</p>
              <sec id="H2-5-ZOI180083">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The use of self-reports is a limitation common to all studies of forced sex. Our measure
did not clarify the context including the perpetrators of forced sex experience and did
not assess other forms of psychological abuse, unwanted kissing or touching, and
threatening behaviors, information valuable to designing future interventions. However,
our measures of forced sex were like those used in several studies examining forced sex in
adolescents, and our findings of high reports of forced sexual experience among boys is
consistent with other studies in southern Africa. The magnitude of the intervention
effects in this trial was modest, about a 3% reduction in risk. Future research building
on the present findings might incorporate booster sessions with additional activities
focused on forced sex, which might enhance the intervention’s efficacy. Another
limitation is that the intervention effects may not generalize to the larger population of
South African adolescents or to implementation by teachers in classrooms across South
Africa as opposed to the specially selected and trained facilitators who implemented the
intervention in the trial.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale community-level randomized intervention
trial to show significant effects on forced sex among South African adolescents in the
earliest stages of entry into sexual activity. The results suggest that intervening early,
before sexual debut, can have long-lasting effects on forced sex. Indeed, the fact that
adolescents who received only 12 hours of intervention in sixth grade, when few reported
sexual experience, were less likely to report perpetrating and experiencing forced sex long
after the intervention is extraordinary. Future implementation research must determine
whether the characteristics of the intervention and its effects can be maintained with
implementation in the real world. In addition, future research must identify the causal
pathway that accounts for the intervention’s efficacy in reducing forced sex
perpetration and experiences. Research along these lines is an important next step in
addressing the worldwide public health problem of sexual assault.</p>
