                  <p>HPTN 067 assessed the feasibility of daily and non-daily dosing of open-label emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Factors associated with sex-related PrEP adherence were assessed among men who have sex with men (MSM) randomized to one of 3 PrEP dosing arms in HPTN 067 in New York City. Sex-related PrEP adherence was defined per protocol as at least 1 PrEP tablet taken within 4 days pre-sex and at least 1 additional PrEP tablet taken within 24 hours post-sex, assessed via electronic drug monitoring and weekly interviews. Demographic data and behavioral measures were evaluated for association with sex-related PrEP adherence. Logistic regression for clustered data was used to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Of 176 randomized MSM participants, 59% were Black, 10% White, 25% Hispanic, and 6% other; median age was 31 years. In the multivariable analyses, higher sex-related PrEP adherence was significantly associated with daily dosing arm, older age, employment, and higher PrEP adherence behavioral skills. Lower sex-related PrEP adherence was significantly associated with identifying as Black or Hispanic (compared with White), opiate use, and reporting âI forgotâ as an adherence barrier.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>This analysis identified populations of MSM who might benefit from additional support to optimize PrEP adherence, including those who are younger, unemployed, or opiate users. MSM with lower PrEP behavioral skills may benefit from targeted interventions. Further study is needed to assess racial and ethnic disparities in PrEP adherence, which may reflect broader social and economic inequalities not captured in this study.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for most of the new HIV infections in the United States, with Black MSM, in particular, being disproportionately affected.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention tool with great potential for reducing new infections among MSM.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Whereas PrEP awareness has been increasing in the United States since its initial approval in 2012 and the release of national guidelines in 2014,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the estimates of its use among populations at risk remain low.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Among those who initiate PrEP, the suboptimal adherence has been shown to limit its effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Factors associated with adherence to PrEP are not well understood and may vary in different populations. Some factors that have been identified as potential contributors to suboptimal PrEP adherence include younger age,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> lower education levels,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> unstable housing,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> side effects,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and stigma.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Additional reasons for missing doses reported by PrEP users have included being away from home or busy.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Barriers to long-term PrEP use have included concern over long-term toxicity, the cost of PrEP medication and medical visits, and simply forgetting to take daily pills.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Some studies have noted racial disparities with lower drug concentrations in US Black participants,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which remains poorly understood. It is critically important to understand barriers to PrEP adherence for key populations most affected by HIV in the United States, particularly Black MSM. Understanding the factors associated with PrEP adherence among US MSM can inform future prevention support interventions to maximize the benefit of PrEP.</p>
              <p>This current study uses data from US MSM participants enrolled in the New York City (NYC) site of HPTN 067, the ADAPT study, a feasibility study comparing daily to intermittent dosing regimens of FTC/TDF PrEP for individuals at risk for HIV acquisition. The ADAPT study was also conducted at 2 other sites (Bangkok and Cape Town); each site was powered to be analyzed independently. The New York and Bangkok sites enrolled at-risk MSM and transgender women (TGW), whereas Cape Town enrolled at-risk heterosexual women. Participants at each site were randomized 1:1:1 to one of 3 open-label PrEP dosing strategies: daily, time driven (twice weekly with an additional dose post-sex events), and event driven (pre- and post-sex events). Among MSM and TGW participants in HPTN 067, participants at the US site in Harlem, NYC, had lower adherence in general, and also specifically before and after sex events (termed PrEP âcoverageâ of sex events, or sex-related PrEP adherence), when compared with the other HPTN 067 MSM and TGW cohort in Bangkok, Thailand.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> As reported previously, NYC participants assigned to daily PrEP dosing were able to adhere to pre- and post-sex dosing for 66% of sex events over the 24-week study period compared with 47% for those in the time-driven arm and 52% for those in the event-driven arm. By contrast, Thai participants adhered to pre- and post-sex PrEP dosing for 85% of sex events in the daily arm, 84% in the time-driven arm, and 74% in the event-driven arm (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for NYC vs. Bangkok results). In the placebo-controlled IPERGAY trial for comparison, the self-reported adherence to pre- and post-sex dosing of on-demand PrEP, which would be similar to the event-driven arm in this trial, was 43%.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The current analysis of HPTN 067 data from the New York site was conducted to gain additional insight about factors that may have contributed to low PrEP adherence surrounding sexual events among US MSM. Because the 3 study sites enrolled such different populations, only the NYC participants were included in the current analysis to focus on the issues relevant to US MSM.</p>

              <p>The HPTN 067/ADAPT study procedures have been previously described in detail.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Briefly, the study participants were randomized 1:1:1 to 24 weeks of one of 3 self-administered FTC/TDF PrEP dosing strategies, designed based on the available animal and human data at the time of study initiation,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> including (1) <bold>daily</bold> armâ1 TDF/FTC pill daily; (2) <bold>time-driven</bold> armâ1 TDF/FTC pill taken twice a week, plus 1 FTC/TDF pill within 2 hours post-sex; or (3) <bold>event-driven</bold> armâ1 TDF/FTC pill 24â48 hours pre-sex and 1 additional FTC/TDF pill within 2 hours post-sex. Participant study visits occurred every 4 weeks while receiving self-administered PrEP. The trial was conducted in 3 sites: Cape Town, South Africa; Bangkok, Thailand; and New York, NY, USA. Cape Town enrolled heterosexual young women, whereas the Bangkok and New York sites enrolled MSM and TGW. Each site was powered independently for separate analyses. The trial was performed with informed consent and followed all guidelines for experimental investigation with human subjects required by the institutions with which the authors are affiliated.

                <p>To evaluate the association between sex-related PrEP adherence and covariates among MSM participants, logistic regression for clustered data (generalized estimating equations) with robust standard errors were used. Although the study aimed to enroll both MSM and TGW, only 3 of the 179 randomized participants (1.7%) at the NYC site were TGW, which limited the ability to identify the associations specific for that population. Given this limitation, this study included analyses restricted to the 176 NYC MSM participants. Variables considered in the univariate analysis included randomization arm, age, race, education, employment, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, drug use, perceived drug use as a problem, side effects, PrEP-related IMB scale scores, report of any condomless anal intercourse in the past 3 months, exchange sex, perceived vulnerability to HIV, unrealistic HIV optimism, PrEP optimism, PrEP regimen fit to daily life, not having study pills when away from home, confusion about medication instructions, inability to forecast sex, lack of privacy for taking study pill, concern others would think participant had HIV, perceived efficacy of PrEP, able to take study pills as directed when changes in routine, satisfaction with prescribed schedule, forgetfulness, and whether PrEP schedule was changed by the participant from what was prescribed. All scales were treated as continuous variables.</p>

To assess the potential confounding effect from these CASI variables on the association between race/ethnicity and sex-related PrEP adherence, each variable was added into the final multivariable model respectively, and the odds ratio (OR) for race/ethnicity in the augmented model was compared with the OR for race/ethnicity in the multivariate model to determine whether a meaningful change occurred. ORs and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</p>

Forcing education into the model did not meaningfully change the results (data not shown). Several other factors remained significantly associated (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with sex-related PrEP adherence in the multivariable analysis, including assigned PrEP dosing arm, race/ethnicity, age, employment, reporting âI forgotâ as a barrier to PrEP adherence, and PrEP behavioral skills (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This analysis identified several factors that were associated with adherence to pre- and post-sex PrEP doses among MSM HPTN 067 study participants in NYC, USA. As reported previously for this cohort, daily dosing of PrEP was associated with the highest sex-related PrEP adherence, when compared with either of the non-daily PrEP dosing arms (time- and event-driven arms).<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In this analysis, higher sex-related PrEP adherence was also more likely among participants who were older and employed and who had better PrEP behavioral skills as scored by the study IMB questionnaire. Lower sex-related PrEP adherence of sex events was more likely among Black and Hispanic participants than among White participants, opiate users, MSM randomized to one of the non-daily dosing arms, and MSM reporting âI forgotâ as a factor making it harder to adhere.</p>
              <p>Many of the findings in this study are consistent with the growing literature on PrEP experiences in different populations. Younger age and lower education level have been associated with poorer adherence in previous PrEP studies.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Other social determinants, including income and unstable housing, have also been previously shown to negatively affect PrEP adherence.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Previous studies have had varied findings in terms of the association between substance use and PrEP use/adherence among US MSM, ranging from a positive association, no association, to an inverse relationship. For example, popper use has been associated with higher PrEP uptake in one study of young Black MSM.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> No association between substance use and PrEP adherence was noted in another study,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> whereas the number of substances used (polysubstance use) and the severity of substance use were both associated with lower PrEP adherence levels in a third study.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Of note, the benefit of PrEP for reducing the risk of HIV infection among injection drug users was first published during the conduct of HPTN 067,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> though studies have shown that there is still limited knowledge of PrEP among people who inject drugs.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Racial disparities in PrEP awareness, uptake, and adherence have been described previously among US Black MSM.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Racial differences in PrEP adherence have also been previously noted in PrEP demonstration projects and in large cohorts of PrEP recipients in clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In addition to finding lower adherence to pre- and post-sex PrEP doses among Black MSM, our study also found lower sex-related PrEP adherence among Hispanic MSM participants. In our additional post-hoc analyses, the overall global adherence differences between racial/ethnic groups persisted after adjustment for the numerous variables assessed. Additionally, none of the variables eliminated the adherence difference between Black, non-Hispanic or Hispanic participants and White, non-Hispanic participants. Unfortunately, the study assessments did not specifically ask about perceived discrimination or racism which may have been the contributing factors.</p>
              <p>In this clinical trial setting, lower PrEP adherence was not due to the cost of medication or access to careâissues identified as barriers in other studies,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> as the PrEP was provided by the study and participants were reimbursed for transportation costs. Other adherence barriers not directly measured in this study may have played a role, such as competing priorities, poverty, health literacy, perceived racism, and/or stigma. PrEP-related stigma has been described as an individual's being perceived (or fear of perception) as HIV infected or as promiscuous when taking PrEP.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> PrEP stigma has been reported to affect PrEP uptake and adherence and also to contribute to PrEP discontinuation.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> The research team for this study site was racially diverse and included community members with similar backgrounds to participants, which is recommended for eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> As with other examples of racial health disparities, the findings in this study may reflect the broader context of social and economic inequalities in the United States.</p>
              <p>The finding of an association between behavioral skills and sex-related PrEP adherence is encouraging, as this is something that is measurable and can potentially be improved on with skills building interventions.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Consistent with the IMB model,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> behavioral skills are thought to be the mediator for the influence of information and motivation on behaviorâin this case, adherence to pre- and post-sex PrEP dosing. To assess behavioral skills specific to PrEP use, participants were asked about the ease or difficulty of PrEP pill-taking behavior (swallowing pills), planning and preparation behaviors (having medication on hand when needed), and dosing in specific situations (when drinking alcohol or using drugs, feeling side effects, or routine interruptions). IMB modelâbased interventions to support PrEP-related decision making, uptake, and optimal use may be helpful in promoting PrEP adherence, particularly if situated to also address affective and structural levels of influence.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, reporting âI forgotâ was associated with lower sex-related PrEP adherence. Simply forgetting is one of the most commonly reported reasons for missed PrEP doses<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and also missed doses of other medication.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> In previous studies, however, forgetting was reported at similarly high frequencies for those with higher and lower adherence rates<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and was not correlated with outcomes such as lack of viral suppression in antiretroviral adherence in the treatment of HIV.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Other participant characteristics (including harmful or hazardous alcohol use and less education) were associated with lower sex-related PrEP adherence in unadjusted analyses but did not remain significant as independent predictors in the adjusted analysis. One factor associated with uptake and adherence in previous PrEP trials<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> but not seen in our study was sexual risk.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study includes its focus on one of the populations most at risk for HIV in the United States: young Black and Hispanic MSM living in a high HIV prevalence area.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> This study was conducted in NYC, which remains an epicenter for HIV in the United States. In addition, much of the data were collected via CASI, meant to overcome social desirability.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Another strength of the study was the detailed assessment of adherence. Sex-related PrEP adherence was ascertained using EDM data on pill box opening, which was adjusted by weekly participant interviews to obtain recall of sex events and verification if pill box openings represented ingested medication and/or whether any additional doses not documented by the EDM were taken (eg, whether doses were pocketed).<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Sex-related PrEP adherence measured using the Wisepill electronic monitoring device in HPTN 067 has been shown to be moderately to highly correlated with other objective measures, including plasma and hair FTC/TDF drug concentrations.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> However, Wisepill had its limitations, with 10%â12% of HPTN 067 participants reporting that the Wisepill device was the worst part of being in the study.<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> In addition, Wisepill and interview data were more likely to be missing for NYC participants when compared with plasma for drug concentration. Reasons for missing Wisepill or interview data included loss or confiscation of the device, lack of signal or battery issues, lack of Wisepill use (concern about size, privacy, stigma), and lack of cell phone minutes.</p>
              <p>Additional limitations that should be noted to contextualize our findings include our focus in this study on the MSM NYC HPTN 067 participants given the small number of TGW enrolled and randomized at the NYC site. The number of TGW enrolled was too small to draw any specific conclusions about the predictors of PrEP adherence in that population. In addition, HPTN 067 did not collect detailed information about perceived and experienced racism, discrimination, or stigmaâfactors that may have contributed to the racial and ethnic differences in adherence. Other unmeasured factors such as poverty and structural barriers likely also contributed to the racial and ethnic disparities. Also, although this study cohort represents one of the target populations for HIV prevention efforts in the United States, the findings may not be generalizable to all US MSM. In addition, sex-related PrEP adherence in this study may not necessarily be the same as effective PrEP adherence, based on the protocol-defined intermittent PrEP dosing regimens used in the HPTN 067 study.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Encouragingly, MSM in New York adhered to the open-label PrEP provided through this study. The results highlight specific populations of MSM in NYC who might benefit from interventions to optimize adherence to PrEP, particularly those who are younger, unemployed, Black, Hispanic, or opiate users. Further study is needed to better understand the causes of the racial and ethnic disparities in PrEP adherence seen in this study. To ensure that those most at risk for HIV can benefit fully from PrEP, supportive programs that offer theory-based education and skills building within the context of wrap-around services for a diversity of issues that disrupt daily living (racism, low/no income, low/no employment, unstable housing) may be needed.</p>
