                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Peptide-based vaccination is a rational option for immunotherapy of prostate cancer. In this first-in-man phase I/II study, we assessed the safety, tolerability and immunological impact of a synthetic long peptide vaccine targeting Ras homolog gene family member C (RhoC) in patients with prostate cancer. RhoC is a small GTPase overexpressed in advanced solid cancers, metastases and cancer stem cells.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Twenty-two patients who had previously undergone radical prostatectomy received subcutaneous injections of 0.1 mg of a single RhoC-derived 20mer peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 every 2 weeks for the first six times, then five times every 4 weeks for a total treatment time of 30 weeks. The drug safety and vaccine-specific immune responses were assessed during treatment and thereafter within a 13-month follow-up period. Serum level of prostate-specific antigen was measured up to 26 months postvaccination.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Most patients (18 of 21 evaluable) developed a strong CD4 T cell response against the vaccine, which lasted at least 10 months following the last vaccination. Three promiscuouslypresented HLA-class II epitopes were identified. Vaccine-specific CD4 T cells were polyfunctional and effector memory T cells that stably expressed PD-1 (CD279) and OX-40 (CD134), but not LAG-3 (CD223). One CD8 T cell response was detected in addition. The vaccine was well tolerated and no treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥3 were observed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Targeting of RhoC induced a potent and long-lasting T cell immunity in the majority of the patients. The study demonstrates an excellent safety and tolerability profile. Vaccination against RhoC could potentially delay or prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis formation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Therapeutic antitumor vaccination may provide a safe and long-lasting immunotherapy treatment option for patients with cancer. Many trials are ongoing worldwide, with most recent developments favoring a patient-individual approach.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> It is acknowledged that vaccines should better be administered at an early stage of disease when the immune system of patients with cancer is not yet suppressed. For advanced patients, vaccines could also be applied in combination with for example, surgery, chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> In addition, cancer vaccines should not only be designed for the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), but also of effector CD4 T cells. CD4 T helper cells are crucial for CD8 T cell activation and expansion, as well as for the generation and maintenance of CD8 T cell memory.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> They also display a range of antitumoral effects, such as secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> activation of macrophages or natural killer cells and direct cytotoxicity, which together might be more powerful than the sole tumor killing by CTLs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref></p>
              <p>To stimulate both CD4 and CD8 T cells, vaccines containing either a mix of known HLA-class I and -class II epitopes<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11</xref> or (overlapping) synthetic long peptides (SLPs; 15–35 amino acids (aa))<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 12</xref> can be used. SLPs have been shown to be rapidly and more efficiently processed compared with the whole protein, and to activate CD4 T cells, but also CD8 T cells by cross-presentation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Since peptide processing takes place in vivo, prior knowledge of the precise T cell epitopes contained in the long peptides is not absolutely required, and such vaccines are generally applied to all patients, regardless of their HLA allotype.</p>
              <p>The Ras homolog gene family member C (RhoC) belongs to the Rho GTPase family which comprises RhoA, RhoB and RhoC (85% sequence homology), all involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> RhoC was shown to be an important player in tumor cell motility, invasion and metastasis formation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Since RhoC has a limited expression in normal cells but is highly expressed on advanced cancer cells and metastases,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 17</xref> it could represents a suitable target for anticancer vaccination. Immunohistochemical analyzes of tumor samples from patients with prostate cancer (PCa) showed an increase in RhoC expression with advanced tumor stages and a strong correlation with the metastatic status. In addition, patients with RhoC expression have a significantly reduced overall-survival rate, indicating that RhoC could be used as a prognostic marker in PCa.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, reports have demonstrated RhoC expression in cancer stem cells,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> which are also found in PCa.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In localized PCa, the presence of micrometastases has been associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after first-line treatment by radical prostatectomy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Targeting RhoC-expressing cancer cells and/or (micro) metastases by vaccination may therefore improve the clinical course of PCa patients and delay or prevent the onset of second-line therapies such as hormonal deprivation and/or chemotherapy. The immunogenicity of RhoC has been documented by our previous study, where CD8 T cells specific for a RhoC-derived 10mer anchor-modified peptide were found in the blood of melanoma patients. Cloned T cells could specifically kill HLA-A*03 and RhoC expressing tumor cell lines in vitro.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

                <p>The study was an open-label, phase I/II trial. Patients previously treated with RP were identified, informed and followed at Copenhagen Prostate Cancer Center, Department of Urology, University of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet. Vaccinations were administered at Zelo Phase I Unit, DanTrials ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark. All patients gave informed consent. Prior to study entry, patients underwent screening procedures including a full physical examination, and in case of BCR, a metastatic workup with computer tomography and bone scans. For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S1</xref>. The primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the vaccine. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were analyzed in accordance with the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), V.4.03. The secondary endpoint was the investigation of the immunological responses against the vaccine.</p>

                <p>Twenty-four patients were screened and 22 included in the study (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Median time for surgery to study entry was 1.2 years (range: 0.3–12.8). Patients were vaccinated subcutaneously alternating between the right and left upper arms with the vaccine consisting of 0.1 mg SLP RV001 (20aa C-terminal sequence of the RhoC protein: ATRAGLQVRKNKRRRGCPIL; the 16 last aa sequence is found only in RhoC, but not in RhoA/B, and is thus RhoC-specific) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 (1 mL). Patients were vaccinated six times every 2 weeks, then five times every 4 weeks, resulting in a treatment duration of approximately 30 weeks (11 vaccinations in total). HLA-class I and II typing was performed before vaccination (visit 2, Tissue Typing Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen). For in vitro immunomonitoring, blood was taken before vaccination (visit 2), and after the 4th, 6th and 11th vaccinations (visits 6, 8 and 13). Follow-up samples were obtained every third month up to 13 months postvaccination (visits 14–17). The study started in March 2017 and was completed in March 2019. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured by routine clinical testing at every patient visit (median number of PSA measurements from study entry: 15 (range 13–17)). PSA doubling time was calculated using the MSK calculator available online.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In men with measurable PSA at study entry, doubling time was calculated from the first measurable PSA until study entry, and from study entry to end of follow-up. Median follow-up time for serum PSA was 2.5 years (range 2.4–2.7 years). Of note, Patient 015 withdrew from treatment after seven injections, but completed all visits for blood collection, except visit 13.

                <p>The immunological response against the RV001 vaccine was assessed on PBMC samples obtained during the vaccination phase and at all follow-up times for 21/22 evaluable patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). An exemplary IFN-γ ELISpot result (Patient 011) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>. Patients were grouped according to the strength of their T cell response into strong- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>), intermediate- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1D</xref>) and weak/non-responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1E</xref>). In most cases, vaccine-reactive T cells were detected after 4 vaccinations (visit 6). In strong responders, T-cell frequencies reached a plateau at visit 13 (after 11 vaccinations), which lasted for 13 months postvaccination. Weak-responder patients (Patients 007, 015, 016, 017) showed a maximal response mainly at visit 15, 7 months postvaccination. Specific mean spot counts per patient and visit are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1F</xref>. In total, 18/21 (86%) of the patients mounted a T cell response during vaccination and 19/21 (90%) patients during the follow-up (light green). One spontaneous RV001-specific response was detected in Patient 012 PBMCs (visit 2), which was boosted by vaccination (approx. 20 fold) and lasted until the last follow-up visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, Patient 010, classified as non-responder during vaccination, developed a statistically significant response against the RV001 peptide at visit 15, which increased further at visits 16 and 17 (1.4 and 4 fold increase, respectively). Only one RV001-specific response was lost at the last follow-up visit (Patient 007). The high response rate among patients with various HLA allelic products indicates a broad immunogenicity of the vaccine. In addition, T cells were mostly detectable for at least 10 months (visit 16) postvaccination, suggesting the induction of a stable immunological memory.</p>

                <title>Vaccine-specific T cells are mainly polyfunctional CD4 T cells</title>
                <p>Multifunctional flow cytometry analysis was performed next to identify RV001-specific T cells in vaccine responders (n=18). Cells from one visit during vaccination were re-stimulated with the RV001 peptide for 12 hours and tested per ICS. A representative example for Patient 011 visit 13 is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S1A</xref>. Seventeen out of 18 patients (94%) showed a CD4 T cell response against the RV001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>). Patient 007, classified as weak-responder by ELISpot, did not reach the positivity threshold in the ICS. CD4 T cells of strong-responder patients expressed more activation markers (mean sum of CD107a, CD154, IL-2, TNF and/or IFN-γ: 21.7%, 95% CI 8.3% to 35.1%) on RV001 restimulation than CD4 T cells of intermediate-responders (mean sum: 9,0%, 95% CI 3.2% to 14.7%) and significantly more as CD4 T cells of weak-responders (mean sum: 2.4%, 95% CI −3.8% to 9.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>). This supports our previous classification of patients in the three groups according to the ELISpot results. To assess multifunctionality, boolean gating was performed: 81% of the RV001-specific CD4 T cells expressed at least two activation markers and of these, almost half (43%) at least three markers simultaneously. When comparing the three patient groups, especially strong-responders showed a significantly higher frequency of RV001-specific T cells expressing two-three marker combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C</xref>). Among all patients, the three most frequent subsets of RV001-specific CD4 were those expressing CD154 and TNF only (mean: 2.8%, 95% CI 1.3% to 4.3%), CD154+TNF+CD107a (mean: 2.5%, 95% CI 0.8% to 4.3%), or CD154+TNF+CD107a+IFN-γ (mean 1.1%, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.1). On average, 0.49% (95% CI 0.19% to 0.80%) of the RV001-specific cells within the CD4 T cell population express all five markers simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>).</p>

                <p>A long-lasting antitumor immune response is mediated by T-cell memory formation. To address the phenotype of RV001-specific T cells, we examined the differentiation status (CD45RA/CCR7), as well as the expression of OX-40 (activation marker), PD-1 (activation/exhaustion marker), and LAG-3 (exhaustion marker) by ex vivo multiparametric flow cytometry. Gating strategy for Patient 018 is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S1B</xref>. Patients with a strong or intermediate IFN-γ response in the ELISpot were selected. RV001-specific T cells were identified by their TNF expression after stimulation (12 hours). This short culture-step does not modify the expression of the selected markers on T cells (data not shown). A representative overlay of CD4<sup>+</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup> cells (black) on all CD45RA/CCR7 gated CD4 T cells (gray) is shown for Patient 009 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>. RV001-specific T cells were mostly effector memory T cells (CD45RA<sup>-</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup>) and detectable already after the 4th vaccination at visit 6. The response peaked between visits 6 and 13 for all three patients tested (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S3</xref>). PD-1 and to a lesser extent OX-40 (but not LAG-3, data not shown) were expressed on RV001-specific cells. However, median fluorescence intensities did not appear to increase in the course of the vaccination as compared with those of the whole CD4 subset, suggesting that vaccine-specific cells did not especially differentiate towards an exhausted phenotype on repeated vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>).</p>

                <p>Next, we used two human LCLs MGAR and H0301 to identify the presenting HLA-class II allele/s for Patients 001, 003 and 019. According to the four-digit HLA-typing, the HLA-DRB1*13:02 allele was expressed by Patient 001, Patient 003, and by H0301, whereas HLA-DRB1*15:01, -DQB1*06:02, -DPB1*04:01 alleles were shared between Patient 019 and MGAR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S3</xref>). RV001 prestimulated PBMCs were mixed with preloaded (RV001, ATR<sub>15</sub>, or AGL<sub>15</sub>) LCLs for 12 hours. Both 15mers were recognized by CD4 cells of Patients 001 and 003. For Patient 019, only a response against RV001 was detected, while coincubation with ATR<sub>15</sub> or AGL<sub>15</sub> preloaded LCLs led to an increase in IFN-γ, CD154 and IL-2, but did not reach the predefined positivity threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). Based on these findings, we concluded that several epitopes derived from the RV001 sequence are presented by HLA-DRB1*13:02, and possibly by DRB1*15:01, and/or -DQB1*06:02, and/or -DPB1*04:01, three alleles co-expressed in 80% of the HLA-DRB1*15:01<sup>+</sup> patients in the cohort.</p>
                <p>The next step was to identify the presenting allele of the RV001-derived HLA-class I epitope that was recognized by CD8 T cells from Patient 004 (HLA-A*02/A*30<sup>+</sup>, -B*18/B*27<sup>+</sup>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>). PBMCs from Patient 004 visit 15 were prestimulated with RV001, then incubated with either RV001 or with C1R or C1R-HLA-B*27 LCLs preloaded with RV001. A CD8 T cell response (CD107a, CD154, TNF and IL-2 expression) was observed on stimulation with the RV001 peptide or with the RV001 preloaded HLA-B*27 LCL, but not with the non-transfected LCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>). These findings clearly show that a RV001-derived sequence is presented to CD8 cells by the HLA-B*27:05 allele.</p>
                <p>In summary, the RV001 peptide contains at least three different HLA-class II peptides promiscuously presented on various HLA-class II allelic products, as well as one HLA-class I peptide presented by the HLA-B*27:05 allele.</p>

                <p>Clinical response was not a primary endpoint of this phase I/II study, but patients were routinely monitored for PSA serum levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S2</xref>). PSA doubling time is regarded as a surrogate parameter for PCa progression, and can predict the risk of mortality in men with localized PCa.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Three patients progressed biochemically during follow-up (Patients 006, 015, 018), from whom two had BCR at study entry (Patient 006: followed for 24 months, 12 PSA measurements; Patient 018: followed for 52 months, 9 PSA measurements). Patient 006 had a PSA increase from 0.5 to 1.1 µg/L 29 months after study entry, and Patient 018 from 1.1 to 1.5 µg/mL 24 months after study entry. Patient 015, who received only seven vaccinations and presented with a pT2c R+ Gleason score 7 (4+3) PCa, developed BCR with a PSA doubling time of 1.2 years and a final PSA level of 0.28 µg/L 26 months after last vaccination. When comparing the prestudy PSA doubling time to that on study, we observed an increase from 1.3 to 2.1 years for Patient 006 and from 1.95 to 3.8 years for Patient 018. The PSA levels and IFN-γ spot counts are shown for both patients in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S5</xref>. Interestingly, Patient 018 showed stable PSA and IFN-γ spot counts during the observation period, whereas raising PSA at the end of the treatment in Patient 006 was concomitant to a reduction of vaccine-specific cells. Thirteen months postvaccination, Patients 015 and 006 were in BCR (visit 17), however, PSA level in Patient 006 declined the last months on follow-up, and from a clinical perspective, the patient was considered as biochemically stable. No patient developed clinical recurrence.</p>

              <p>Recent cancer vaccine studies targeting the tumor mutanome have demonstrated a high rate of immunological responses as well as encouraging clinical courses.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Such studies are per se individualized, since they target mutations that mostly occur in individual patients. Other vaccine strategies that are suitable for tumors with low level of mutational events focus on non-mutated, tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11 28 29</xref> Prostate tumors generally harbor only few mutations and respond poorly to checkpoint Ab therapy. Clinical studies have demonstrated that vaccination against prostate-associated or overexpressed antigens is safe, immunogenic and can impact clinical course. Most of these trials have been conducted at advanced stages of the disease (castration-resistant metastatic PCa), but few at earlier times, for example, at biochemical relapse.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–31</xref> Immune intervention at BCR, when tumor load is limited and immunosuppression absent or limited, might lead to more favorable clinical outcome. In this context, targeting of antigens associated with cancer stem cells and metastases, like the RhoC protein, could improve tumor control.</p>
              <p>The SLP vaccination against RhoC was safe for all patients over the complete treatment period. Side effects were predominantly injection site reactions and fatigue (grade 1/2). These events are most likely related to the adjuvant and carrier Montanide ISA-51<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and did not necessitate specific medical intervention.</p>
              <p>Immunogenicity of the vaccine was assessed in n=21 patients. Most of these (94%) had developed T cells specific for the RhoC peptide after the 4th vaccination. After a short presensitization, we frequently observed high IFN-γ ELISpot counts (&gt;1000 spots/200.000 cells), indicating excellent immunogenicity of the vaccine in vivo and/or a robust in vitro proliferation capacity. T cell responses were overall stable and were detected almost 1 year after the last vaccination. Vaccine-specific cells were also detectable by ex vivo ELISpot in strong-responder patients (n=4 tested, data not shown). This long-lasting functional immune response indicates the establishment of an immunological memory, which is essential for immunosurveillance of recurrent tumors and/or metastases. We found that antivaccine T cells belonged predominantly to the effector memory CD4 subset and were polyfunctional cells (&gt;80% of RV001 specific CD4 T cells expressed at least two of the activation markers/cytokines tested). They often expressed the cell-surface degranulation marker CD107a, suggesting that at least a fraction of those were cytotoxic effectors. Moreover, ex vivo phenotyping (PD-1, LAG-3) strongly suggests that RV001-specific cells did not shift towards an exhausted phenotype after multiple vaccine applications. During vaccination, Tregs appeared to decrease in the two strong-responder patients, while they increase slightly in the two low/non-responder patients. Altogether, essentially functional T helper cells were induced by the vaccine.</p>
              <p>Although the vaccine contained a single 20mer peptide, we could identify three HLA-class II 15mer RV001-derived epitopes. The high response rate in our patient cohort indicates that these, and possibly further as yet unidentified class-II epitopes, are presented promiscuously on several HLA-class II alleles (including DRB1*13:02). Hence, the RhoC vaccine can be applied broadly, independently of the patient’s HLA allotype. In addition, a CD8 response restricted to HLA-B*27:05 could be observed in one patient. The exact epitope is under characterization, and further HLA-B*27<sup>+</sup> patients will be assessed. Interestingly, RV001-specific CD8 T cells in that patient were polyfunctional, with high levels of TNF and/or CD107a, IL-2, CD154. CD154<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells (also called CD8 helper cells) have been shown to support their own expansion and differentiation and to activate dendritic cells to promote antitumor immunity.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Although the RhoC 20mer contains an embedded HLA-A*03 binding peptide, we did not observe any CD8 T cell response (one single time point tested) in the two patients carrying the HLA-A*03 allele.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Since epitope spreading was shown to be associated with a better clinical outcome,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we also tested CD8 T cell reactivities against epitopes derived from PCa-associated antigens (PSA, PSMA, prostein, TRPP8 and survivin) in five HLA-A*02 patients.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Two individuals responded to 2–3 epitopes before (visit 2), during (visits 6/8) and after vaccination (visits 14/17), and this was increased in one patient after vaccination (data not shown). Such analyzes will be pursued in the ongoing phase II trial.</p>
              <p>CD4 T cells are now widely recognized as key players in antitumor immunity. Their role in dendritic cell and CD8 T activation, and in memory formation are well described.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 35 36</xref> CD4 T cells were also shown to kill HLA-class II positive tumors via granzyme/perforin release or Fas/Fas-L interaction,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 37</xref> and there is also preclinical evidence that CD4 T cells can reject tumors better than CD8 T cells.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> We could not test the HLA-class II expression of PCa tissues in our cohort, but HLA-class II expression has been detected on primary PCa cells and on PCa cell lines, or could be induced by IFN-γ.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> Even in the absence of HLA-class II expression on tumor cells, indirect tumor killing or tumor senescence can be mediated by CD4 T cells, in particular via IFN-γ and TNF,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> or by the recruitment of nitric oxide producing macrophages within the tumor.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Altogether, our phenotyping and functional data indicate that the profile of vaccine induced, RV001-specific CD4 T cells is in line with that of antitumor effectors.</p>
              <p>Vaccine-based studies in mice and patients have started to unravel the contribution of CD4 T cells in tumor control.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 41 42</xref> High rates of polyfunctional CD4 cells, together with CD8 T cells, were detected in melanoma patients vaccinated with a personalized, neoantigen-based SLP vaccine containing up to 20 aa long mutated peptides. Four out of six patients had no recurrence 25 months postvaccination, while the two patients with tumor recurrence achieved tumor regression when treated with an anti-PD-1 Ab.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Case reports document tumor regressions after adoptive transfer of antitumor CD4 cells.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> In mouse models, there is also evidence that CD4 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are more potent than CD8 CAR T cells, as they can kill tumors, and in addition, exhibit long-lasting effector function.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref></p>
              <p>The finding of an increase in PSA doubling time in two patients following vaccination shall be interpreted with caution, as PSA levels were altogether low, and kinetics are influenced by the period over which the PSA values are measured (limited time span in our study) and the number of tests drawn.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> It is estimated that approximately one in four patients undergoing RP will eventually experience BCR. The risk of BCR varies according to preoperative PSA and histopathological findings.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> The individual risk of BCR in the first year following enrolment in this study ranged from 2% to 19% and did not change substantially in the period of follow-up.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p>
              <p>In summary, vaccination against RhoC is a well-tolerated treatment option which induces a long-lasting immune response in the large majority of patients. Vaccine-specific cells are polyfunctional and equipped for an antitumor response. A correlation between the induction of immune responses to RhoC on vaccination and clinical outcome is at this stage premature, but will be examined in a recruiting double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial for PCa patients in BCR (NCT04114825). RhoC vaccination to impair tumor spreading might also synergize with many tumor vaccines (such as those targeting patient-individual tumor antigens) or other therapies, and become a valuable approach for PCa and for further tumor entities.</p>
