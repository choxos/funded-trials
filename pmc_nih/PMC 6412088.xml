                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cellular senescence is a key mechanism that drives age-related diseases, but has yet to be targeted therapeutically in humans. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal cellular senescence-associated disease. Selectively ablating senescent cells using dasatinib plus quercetin (DQ) alleviates IPF-related dysfunction in bleomycin-administered mice.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A two-center, open-label study of intermittent DQ (D:100 mg/day, Q:1250 mg/day, three-days/week over three-weeks) was conducted in participants with IPF (<italic>n</italic> = 14) to evaluate feasibility of implementing a senolytic intervention. The primary endpoints were retention rates and completion rates for planned clinical assessments. Secondary endpoints were safety and change in functional and reported health measures. Associations with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were explored.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Fourteen patients with stable IPF were recruited. The retention rate was 100% with no DQ discontinuation; planned clinical assessments were complete in 13/14 participants. One serious adverse event was reported. Non-serious events were primarily mild-moderate, with respiratory symptoms (<italic>n</italic> = 16 total events), skin irritation/bruising (n = 14), and gastrointestinal discomfort (<italic>n</italic> = 12) being most frequent. Physical function evaluated as 6-min walk distance, 4-m gait speed, and chair-stands time was significantly and clinically-meaningfully improved (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Pulmonary function, clinical chemistries, frailty index (FI-LAB), and reported health were unchanged. DQ effects on circulat.ing SASP factors were inconclusive, but correlations were observed between change in function and change in SASP-related matrix-remodeling proteins, microRNAs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (23/48 markers <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.50).</p>

                  <p>Our first-in-humans open-label pilot supports study feasibility and provides initial evidence that senolytics may alleviate physical dysfunction in IPF, warranting evaluation of DQ in larger randomized controlled trials for senescence-related diseases.</p>

                  <p id="p0010">Targeting fundamental mechanisms of aging has the potential to reduce the severity of multiple age-related diseases. Cellular senescence is a cell fate in which proliferating or differentiated non-dividing cells undergo replicative arrest and develop a pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory, and apoptosis-inducing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells acquire resistance to apoptosis and their own SASP. Senescence is a mechanism that has been shown to drive multiple age-related diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The occurrence of IPF, a chronic, fibrotic lung disease, rises dramatically with advancing age. It is devastating, with a relentlessly progressive course, a median survival of &lt;4 years, and limited treatment options. Aging processes have been implicated in IPF pathogenesis, with accumulation of senescent cells in the lung, fibrosis, matrix remodeling, inflammation, DNA damage, telomere attrition, and alveolar epithelial oxidative stress. Extent of expression of markers of cellular senescence in lungs of patients with IPF is associated with disease severity. Senolytic agents are drugs developed using a hypothesis-driven approach that selectively induce senescent cell apoptosis by transiently disabling the senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs) that defend senescent cells against their own pro-apoptotic environment. The first senolytics discovered were Dasatinib (D) and Quercetin (Q), which, in combination (DQ), cause apoptosis of senescent vs. non-senescent cells in human tissue. DQ alleviates a range of age- and chronic disease-related conditions in mice, including physical dysfunction in progeroid and naturally-aged mice, vascular stiffness in high fat-fed and aged mice, hepatic steatosis, age-related osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disease modelling Alzheimer disease, and premature development of age-related diseases and early death caused by transplanting small numbers of senescent cells into younger mice. Senolytics extend remaining lifespan in old mice. Importantly with respect to human IPF, DQ reduces lung senescent cell burden and restores function in mice with pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin inhalation. Intermittent treatment of IPF and other age-related conditions in mice with DQ is effective despite the short elimination half-life of D and Q (&lt;6 h), likely because senescent cells do not divide and take weeks to over a month to re-accumulate. Senolytics do not need to be present continuously to occupy a receptor or affect an enzyme.</p>
                  <sec id="s0010">
                    <title>Added value of the study</title>
                    <p id="p0015">We report the first clinical trial using DQ or other senolytics in humans. Clinical trial data using senolytics in the context of senescence-associated diseases such as IPF do not exist. Apart from lung transplantation, the extent of alleviation of dysfunction by anti-fibrotics and other interventions for IPF has been disappointing. Here, in a first-in-human, proof-of-concept open-label clinical trial, we tested the feasibility and potential impact of intermittently treating patients with stable mild to severe IPF with 9 oral doses of DQ over 3 weeks. Physical function and clinical parameters were measured before and 5 days after the last DQ dose, well beyond these drugs' elimination half-lives. Fourteen participants were enrolled, completed intermittent drug self-administration, and 100% completed the study. Statistically significant (within-subject) and clinically meaningful improvements in physical function following DQ treatment were seen despite the small number of participants and short study duration. Such improved physical function has not been reported in subjects in the placebo arms of other IPF trials. Although adverse events occurred, they were acceptable and primarily consistent with the underlying IPF diagnosis, study procedures, or known-off target effects of the study drugs (e.g., gastrointestinal discomfort, headache). No changes in laboratory tests suggestive of hepatic or renal toxicity were found, and pulmonary function was unchanged. While effects of DQ on circulating SASP factors were inconclusive in this initial study, correlations were seen between change in function and change in SASP factors.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0025">Occurrence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive fibrotic lung disease, rises dramatically with advancing age [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. It is a devastating disease with median survival of 3.8 years in newly-diagnosed adults over 60 years of age [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Aging is implicated in IPF pathogenesis, including accelerated aging of the alveolar epithelium, denoted by oxidative stress, telomere attrition, DNA damage, inflammation, and matrix remodeling [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Converging evidence suggests that the aging hallmark, cellular senescence, may be a central mechanism contributing to IPF [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cellular senescence is a non-proliferative cell state that can entail a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) comprising cytokines, chemokines, pro-fibrotic factors, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), factors causing stem/progenitor cell dysfunction, and growth factors that impose detrimental effects on the local and systemic environment [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Senescent cells and the SASP may fuel an increasingly pro-inflammatory fibrotic response driving lung deterioration and severe functional decline in IPF. Senescence biomarkers accumulate in the lungs of IPF patients, and higher expression of key senescence biomarkers, such as p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (CDKN2A), DNA damage foci (γH2A.X), telomere dysfunction, and SASP factors are associated with increased disease severity [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0030">Senolytic agents, drugs that selectively induce senescent cell apoptosis, were first developed using a hypothesis-driven approach [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The idea for developing agents to target senescent cells was based on a key study showing that age-related senescent cell burden in mice was reduced by both caloric restriction and a lifespan-extending mutation [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These delays in senescent cell accumulation occurred in tandem with increased healthspan, suggesting that pharmacologically targeting senescent cells might delay onset of senescence-related diseases such as IPF. Our hypothesis-driven drug discovery approach was based on the observations that senescent cells release pro-apoptotic factors as part of their SASP [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>], yet resist apoptosis [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], leading us to test if these cells rely on pro-survival senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs) to defend against their SASP and pro-apoptotic intracellular <italic>milieu</italic>. Several such SCAPs were identified from bioinformatics analyses of senescent vs. non-senescent human cells [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Senescent cells originating from different cell types depend for survival on different SCAPs. We identified which components of these SCAPs are essential for survival of human senescent vs. non-senescent cells in RNA interference studies. Next, we selected agents know to target these SCAP components and found they selectively induce apoptosis in human senescent but not non-senescent cultured cells.</p>
              <p id="p0035">Using our hypothesis-driven drug discovery approach, the first senolytics identified were Dasatinib (D) and Quercetin (Q), which are effective in combination (DQ) when administered to mice [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. D is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical use for treating leukemias and Q is a natural product that targets BCL-2, insulin/IGF-1, and HIF-1α SCAP network components. The DQ combination is effective in eliminating cultured senescent cells originating from several different types of human and mouse cells [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0040">DQ was recently demonstrated to decrease senescent cell burden and the SASP in human tissues within 48 h by selectively causing apoptosis in senescent vs. non-senescent cells in freshly isolated explants [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. DQ alleviates a range of age- and senescence-related disorders in mice, including age-related osteoporosis, hepatic steatosis, neurodegeneration in Tau<sup>+</sup> mouse models of Alzheimer disease, age- and high fat-diet-induced vascular calcification and hyporeactivity, and radiation-induced muscle dysfunction [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>]. In older mice, senolytics delay age-related diseases as a group and substantially increase late life survival [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, senolytics prevent the physical dysfunction, accelerated onset of age-related diseases, and early death caused by transplanting small numbers of senescent cells into young mice [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Importantly with respect to IPF, DQ alleviates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, causing improved pulmonary function, body composition, and physical function [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DQ also decreases the impaired exercise endurance due to aging and progerias in mice [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0045">Collectively, these data highlight the therapeutic potential of senolytic therapies for multiple aging-related diseases and geriatric syndromes, including IPF. Herein, we performed a first-in-human, small-scale pilot clinical trial with the objective to assess the feasibility, acceptability, best methods, and measurement characteristics of potential study outcomes for the senolytic drug combination DQ in older participants with stable IPF. The primary endpoints were retention rates and completion rates for planned clinical assessments. Secondary endpoints were: 1) initial safety estimates and adverse event reports and 2) change in functional and reported health measures. Functional endpoints were the change from baseline in: 1) 6-min walk distance (6MWD), 4-m usual gait speed, timed 5-repitition chair-stands, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and grip strength; 2) pulmonary function: forced vital capacity (FVC); forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1); 3) clinical lab-based frailty index (FI-LAB); and 4) patient reported quality of life, respiratory health, and fatigue. Exploratory associations of change in function with changes in circulating senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors were evaluated.</p>

                <p id="p0050">Intermittent D (100 mg/day) plus Q (1250 mg/day) were orally administered over three consecutive days in three consecutive weeks (i.e., 9 total participant administered dosing days) at two outpatient clinical research centers using a single-arm, open-label design. We measured clinical chemistries before and after DQ and performed rigorous symptom questionnaires weekly for health-related quality of life and off-target effects to obtain preliminary evidence of safety and tolerability. We evaluated potential assessment tools probing function and biological activity of DQ: 1) physical function: 6MWD, 4-m gait speed, timed chair-stands, SPPB, and grip strength; 2) pulmonary function: FVC; FEV1; 3) FI-LAB. We explored associations of change in clinical and functional assessments with biological assays of a set of circulating SASP components assayed in plasma using multiplex discovery platforms. SASP factors that had been associated with frailty (IL6, MCP-1, activin A, apelin) [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>] or had been reported to have prognostic or diagnostic potential in IPF (MMP1, MMP7, osteopontin) [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were further validated by single target enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In addition, non-coding micro (mi)-RNAs released locally and systemically may be associated with inflammation and senescence [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, miRNAs miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p have recently has been acknowledged as part of SASP in a mouse model of lung fibrosis and long-lived dwarf mice [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, miRNA expression suppresses cytokine secretion and may restrain excessive SASP activity in primary human fibroblasts and HUVEC cultures [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and could be modulated by intervention in humans [<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

A total of 17 patients aged ≥50 years with stable IPF were primarily recruited from a study physician's clinical practice (n = 12) or from the community by direct mailings, a hospital-supported website, or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0015">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<italic>n</italic> = 3, WFSM). After comprehensive in-clinic screening, 3 candidates were excluded from the study and the remaining 14 were enrolled. The minority-ethnicity status of the participants was 12 non-Hispanic white and 2 Hispanic white. All study procedures complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the informed consent and study documents were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of WFSM and UTHSCSA and were reviewed by Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) at both clinical sites.

The dose of D selected is based on the FDA-approved dose for chronic administration to patients as effective for inducing apoptosis in human cancer cells. Q is a natural product. DQ was administered in conjunction with stable standard of care (nintedanib, pirfenidone, or none). Nintedanib and dasatinib are both tyrosine kinase inhibitors, though only dasatanib demonstrates senolytic action [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To avoid potential drug-drug interaction, nintedanib was withheld on dosing days with dasatinib, but was resumed on non-dosing days; pirfenidone was maintained.

All samples were spiked-in with 3.5 μL of control Ce_miR39_1, provided by the manufacturer (Lot no. 237024736). cDNA was synthesized using the TaqMan™ Advanced miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied Biosystems, Cat no. A28007) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was carried out using TaqMan micro RNA advanced assay Pre-Amp master mix (Applied Biosystems, cat no.4391128 A) and TaqMan primers for -miR-16-5p (Assay ID 477860_mir), mir-146-5p (Assay ID 478399_mir), and hsa-miR-34c-5p (Assay ID 478052_mir). Expression of MiR-16-5p (assay ID 477860_mir) was used as a reference to normalize qPCR data. Relative expression of target miRNAs to the reference gene in each sample was calculated using an equation (2<sup>A–B</sup>/2<sup>C–D</sup> [A = Ct value of the gene of interest at baseline in the first sample; B = Ct value of the gene of interest in each sample, C = Ct value of a reference gene in the first sample at baseline; and D = Ct value of a reference gene in each sample]).

                <p id="p0155">Circulating SASP factors were evaluated by multiplex, microarray, and targeted ELISA. Substantially larger sample sizes will be needed to definitively evaluate changes in biological markers of senescence and circulating SASP factors in patients with IPF since their circulating SASP factors assayed were not highly elevated initially (Suppl. Tables S3, S4). Though not statistically significant, select SASP proteins, including interluekin-6, matrix remodeling protein MMP7, and metallopeptidase inhibitor TIMP2, showed potential for reduction, with at least 8 participants having decreased circulating concentrations; however serum ELISA failed to confirm findings in IL-6 and MMP7. Moderate correlations were observed between change in physical function, pulmonary function, and FI-LAB and change in SASP factors (23 of 48 SASP factors, <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.50; Suppl. Tables S3, S4). For example, gain in 6MWD was associated with lowered miR34c, improved 4 m-gait speed with MMP8, MMP9, and lowered RANTES, and faster chair-stands with decreased eotaxin, GRO-α, and interleukin-18. Though essentially unchanged with DQ, FEV1 or FVC were associated with lowered MCP-1 and with matrix remodeling proteins. Lowered FI-LAB was primarily associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines. While provocative, these preliminary associations need to be confirmed in a larger population.</p>
                <p id="p0160">These functional and biological effects are generally consistent with preclinical findings in a murine bleomycin model of fibrotic lung disease, which supports our translational approach. Specifically, DQ initiated at disease onset in mice significantly reduced the senescence marker p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression in the lung and collective SASP factors (MCP1, IL6, TNFα, Col1a1, and TGFβ). Biological effects were matched by dramatic improvements in functional outcomes in lung-injured mice administered DQ, including a 54% relative improvement in median treadmill running endurance [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which supports the clinical evidence reported here of meaningful change in physical function, even with modest changes in biomarkers of senescent cell burden.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0165">We report study feasibility in this first-in-human, single-arm, open-label pilot study of the senolytic drug combination, DQ, in participants with mild to severe but stable IPF. The three weeks of intermittent DQ administration was associated with clinically meaningful, statistically significant improvements in physical function. This included improved 6-min walk distance, 4-m gait speed, and 5-repeated chair-stand times. IPF appears to be relentlessly progressive: in large IPF drug trials, no improvements in 6MWD have been observed in the placebo-control arms [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These effects of DQ on physical function in IPF patients are consistent with preclinical findings of marked improvements in treadmill endurance and frailty following the selective ablation of senescent cells in progeroid, naturally aged, and lung-injured murine models [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Follow-up visits were conducted at least 5 days after the last dose of DQ, well beyond the elimination half-lives of D and Q, which are &lt;6 h [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, potential improvements in physical function did not depend on a mechanism that requires continued presence of the drugs (e.g., drug occupancy of a receptor or effects due to acting on an enzyme). Thus, potential improvements in physical function did not depend on a mechanism that requires continued presence of the drugs (e.g., drug occupancy of a receptor or effects due to acting on an enzyme). Rather, the improved physical function appears to depend on a mechanism that causes effects that persist following drug clearance (e.g., epigenetic effects or effects on tissue composition, such as a change in slowly turning-over cell types). However, the primary purpose of our study was not to evaluate drug efficacy: without a control group, the functional improvements we observed must be interpreted with caution and underscore the need for appropriately powered randomized controlled trials.</p>
              <p id="p0170">DQ administration was acceptable and feasible in the older IPF participants in this study. The single-arm open label study of three weeks of intermittent administration of DQ in older adults with stable IPF was successfully completed in all participants at two clinical sites. Drug adherence was imperfect but acceptable; routine dosing reminders and adherence checks by study personnel were seen as essential to ensure drug self-administration according to the intermittent dosing schedule. The senolytic agents were generally well tolerated without notable adverse changes in clinical chemistries. Specifically, there were no evident declines in renal or hepatic function or evidence of cell lysis syndrome. One hospitalization was reported following successful completion of DQ intervention, but the rest of the reported events were generally mild to moderate in severity, reversible, and without clinically significant sequelae. Though the single-arm open-label design precludes comparison of events against a placebo or standard of care control group as would be necessary to definitively evaluate safety and tolerability, we did compare event types and rate reporting to the placebo control arms of published Phase III randomized controlled trials in IPF (Suppl. Table S5). Overall, the majority of events are consistent with reports in these large drug trials in IPF [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], except for potentially higher reporting of cough, nausea, headache, and fatigue in this pilot trial. However, these speculations should be considered with caution, as differences among symptom questionnaires or severity potentially complicates direct comparison with these Phase III trials. We emphasize that physicians should not prescribe senolytics and IPF patients should not take these agents outside of clinical trials, unless and until further studies clearly demonstrate safety and efficacy.</p>
              <p id="p0175">Pulmonary function in this IPF patient population did not change during the course of this preliminary study. However, spirometry on a given day is a reflection of factors affecting lung function over the adult lifetime. For example, FEV1 and FVC can be improved acutely (e.g. with the use of bronchodilators), but for the most part these lung function parameters deteriorate with age and IPF disease course, and it takes the passage of time to characterize changing FVC trajectories. We did not hypothesize that the clearance of senescence cells would have an acute effect on bronchial reactivity, fibrosis, or extracellular matrix destruction. It is likely that in this pilot exploration, the follow-up period is too short and the sample size too modest to assess effects on long-term trajectories, especially in a complex chronic disease such as IPF. IPF etiology and progression is multifactorial, and whether the attendant pulmonary dysfunction is related to fibrosis vs. inflammation vs. other effects of senescent cells remains an open question [<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For example, senescent cell-induced pulmonary dysfunction could be related to small vessel hemostasis due to serpines such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue destruction due to proteases, delayed tissue repair due to progenitor dysfunction caused by senescent cell production of activin A and other factors that cause stem/progenitor cell dysfunction, among other possibilities. Some of these potential mechanisms, each of which has been observed in other contexts, could take much longer to resolve following senescent cell reduction than others. If resolution of pulmonary scarring and fibrosis does indeed occur, it may take considerable time after clearance of senescent cells from the lung. In sum, a longer follow-up period in an efficacy trial that will enroll more participants and include a randomly-assigned control group will be needed to test if there is improvement in pulmonary function.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="p0180">As clearly articulated throughout this report, a limitation in the single-arm open-label design is absence of a standard of care or placebo control arm. However, as this is a pilot study, the purpose was not to establish efficacy of DQ on functional outcomes, but to suggest feasibility and best methods to implement in a randomized, double-blind, controlled efficacy trial of senolytics for IPF or other senescence-associated age-related diseases. The improvements in physical function we found, although statistically significant and clinically meaningful, need to be verified in larger controlled trials. While efficacy and safety estimates should not be over-interpreted, our findings in older adults with stable IPF provide evidence supporting the conduct of such a trial of DQ with changes in physical function as a primary outcome.</p>
                <p id="p0185">Another limitation is in regards to markers of in vivo senescent cell burden for use in clinical trials. It is not feasible to test if senolytics directly cause senescent cell clearance from the lungs of IPF patients given safety concerns about repeated bronchoscopies. Our previous work demonstrated increased senescent cell abundance in lungs of subjects with IPF, including upregulation of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (CDKN2A), which correlated with disease severity [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, p16<sup>INK4A+</sup> fibroblasts and epithelial cells with telomere-associated DNA damage foci (TAFs), another marker of cellular senescence, accumulated in fibrotic regions of honeycomb lung in patients with IPF, together with increased expression of SASP components (including the matrix remodeling proteins and pro-inflammatory factors that were tested in the blood of subjects in the present study) [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, using DQ we did demonstrate senescent cell clearance from lungs of mice with senescent cell accumulation and pulmonary fibrosis caused by inhaled bleomycin [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In exploratory analyses in the present pilot study, changes in circulating SASP factors following administration of DQ were inconclusive, possibly owing to the relatively low levels of these markers of cellular senescence at baseline in the circulation. However, we did find that circulating pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic SASP factors following 3 weeks of intermittent DQ administration were associated with change in physical function, pulmonary function, and FI-LAB scores. These findings need to be evaluated further in ongoing efforts to identify and validate reliable circulating biomarkers of cellular senescence that reflect tissue senescent cell abundance for use in multi-center clinical trials of senolytics, especially for diseases such as IPF in which repeated tissue biopsies are not feasible.</p>

                <title>Drug and dosing considerations</title>
                <p id="p0190">Future trials should evaluate different senolytics and dosing regimens. We used intermittent DQ here because: 1) D and Q have been used extensively for other indications in humans and their safety profiles are understood, 2) DQ was effective in improving function in a mouse model of IPF [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], 3) DQ has been shown to be senolytic in human tissues [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 4) DQ targets a broader range of senescent cells than some other senolytic regimens [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and 5) DQ alleviates physical dysfunction, delays or treats multiple age-related disorders, and extends lifespan in old mice [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that DQ causes selective apoptosis of senescent cells in freshly-isolated human tissue explants [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Alternative senolytic agents are being actively explored, including BCL-2 inhibitors and fisetin. We and others found that agents that target Bcl-xL, including navitoclax (ABT263), A1331852, and A1155463, are senolytic, at least with some types of senescent cells [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, Bcl-xL inhibitors can interfere with neutrophil and platelet viability, sometimes causing severe thrombocytopenia even after small doses [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Fisetin is another agent that we discovered to be senolytic against some human cell types [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Like DQ, fisetin alleviates physical dysfunction in progeroid and naturally-aged mice, enhances healthspan, and increases remaining lifespan in older mice [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. If fisetin proves to be safe and effective in mouse IPF models, it would be a strong candidate to advance into clinical trials, as may be other next-generation senolytics [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="p0195">We used an intermittent dosing strategy for several reasons (see Methods). The development of the senescent phenotype is a relatively long and dynamic process that can take weeks, at least in cell culture [<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, senescent cell clearance by senolytics can occur within 18 h of a brief exposure, and senolytics do not need to be present continuously to occupy a receptor or affect an enzyme [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Rather, they act in a “hit-and-run” manner, which supports the rationale behind intermittent treatment [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To be conservative, we administered three courses of DQ separated by four days. Also, consistently with the above, we found improved physical function 5 days after the last dose of DQ, well after the day or so it takes for these agents to be completely eliminated. A substantial improvement in exercise endurance was also found in mice with pulmonary fibrosis intermittently treated with DQ [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], reflecting emerging evidence that brief or intermittent senolytic treatment results in profound effects that persist long after drug elimination.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p id="p0200">IPF is a disease related to senescent cell accumulation in the lungs that is generally relentlessly progressive and fatal. While it remains to be confirmed if senolytics directly clear lung senescent cells to improve pulmonary function in humans with IPF as occurs in mice [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], our data in this first-in-human trial of senolytics indicate potential for clinically meaningful improvements in physical function. Consistent with the primary objective of this study, we established feasibility of recruitment, adherence, assessments, and methods. These findings constitute preliminary proof-of-concept evidence that interventions designed to target senescent cells may alleviate functional consequences of aging-related diseases in humans, as is the case in mice.</p>
