Mean liraglutide exposure from randomization was 530.2 days. Liraglutide use versus no liraglutide use was associated with significantly lower hazard rates for MACE [0.62 (0.41; 0.92)<sub>95%CI</sub>] and all‐cause mortality [0.50 (0.29; 0.88)<sub>95%CI</sub>]. There was no significant difference in the rate of severe hypoglycaemia with versus without liraglutide use. Multiple sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Diabetes is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular complications are the leading causes of diabetes‐related morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Therefore, understanding the cardiovascular safety of glucose‐lowering treatment regimens is particularly important. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration provided guidance for assessing cardiovascular risk when developing new antihyperglycaemic medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Since this guidance was issued, numerous large‐scale cardiovascular outcomes trials of antihyperglycaemic medications have been conducted.</p>
              <p>The cardiovascular safety of basal insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) and insulin degludec (degludec) was established by the open‐label ORIGIN and double‐blind DEVOTE randomized trials, respectively, both of which included patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> In 2011, the final results from the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial had shown that glargine U100 did not significantly affect the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) versus standard care in people with cardiovascular risk factors and impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) 1.02 (0.94; 1.11)<sub>95% CI</sub>].<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> In 2016, the final results from the Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin Degludec versus Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE) showed that degludec was non‐inferior to glargine U100 with respect to the incidence of MACE (cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction or non‐fatal stroke) in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk [HR 0.91 (0.78; 1.06)<sub>95% CI</sub>].<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>In the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, which included patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk receiving standard care, the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) liraglutide significantly reduced the relative risk of MACE by 13%, the risk of cardiovascular death by 22% and the risk of all‐cause mortality by 15% versus placebo.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Liraglutide also reduced the proportion of patients undergoing treatment intensification with antihyperglycaemic medications, including insulin, and the risks of severe hypoglycaemia and confirmed hypoglycaemia versus placebo.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Based on the results of the LEADER trial, liraglutide was recommended as a treatment option in the treatment guidelines for patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Consensus guidelines support the combination of a basal insulin and a GLP‐1RA as a treatment option for individuals with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> For example, triple therapy, which can include the combination of metformin and a GLP‐1RA with basal insulin (or oral antihyperglycaemic drugs), is recommended if a patient with type 2 diabetes has not achieved his/her HbA1c target after 3 months of dual therapy.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Combining injectable therapies consisting of basal insulin and a GLP‐1RA, usually with metformin (with or without another non‐insulin agent), should also be considered if the patient has not achieved the HbA1c target after 3 months of triple therapy using another regimen,<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> or when blood glucose is ≥16.7 mmol/L, HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥86 mmol/mol) or the patient has symptoms of hyperglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>Clinical studies evaluating insulin and GLP‐1RA combination therapy (both fixed and free combinations) for type 2 diabetes have shown beneficial effects of this regimen on glycaemic control and body weight, or weight neutrality, versus comparators.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Some insulin/GLP‐1RA combinations also allow for reductions in existing insulin doses.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Furthermore, adding a GLP‐1RA to insulin therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of hypoglycaemia, even with improved HbA1c levels.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>The aim of this post hoc analysis was to compare the associations between concomitant liraglutide use versus no liraglutide use and the occurrence of MACE and all‐cause mortality among patients receiving basal insulin (either degludec or glargine U100) in DEVOTE. This analysis was also repeated for the individual MACE components, serious adverse events and severe hypoglycaemic episodes.</p>

</p>
                <p>Briefly, DEVOTE was a treat‐to‐target, randomized, double‐blind, active comparator‐controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial conducted in 20 countries.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> DEVOTE enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes being treated with at least one oral or injectable antihyperglycaemic agent who had HbA1c ≥7% (53 mmol/mol) or, if they had HbA1c &lt;7% (53 mmol/mol), were treated with ≥20 units/d of basal insulin.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged ≥50 years and had at least one co‐existing cardiovascular condition or chronic kidney disease, or if they were aged ≥60 years and had at least one cardiovascular risk factor.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p>
                <p>From November 2013, 7637 participants were randomized 1:1 to receive degludec or glargine U100 in a blinded fashion, both in identical 10 mL vials containing 100 U/mL, added to standard care and administered once daily between dinner and bedtime.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Randomized participants could continue their pretrial antihyperglycaemic therapy, except for basal and premix insulins, which were discontinued at randomization.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p>
                <p>The primary composite outcome was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction or non‐fatal stroke (MACE). DEVOTE was designed to continue until at least 633 MACE (confirmed by a central, blinded Event Adjudication Committee) had occurred.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Overall, the median observation time was 1.99 (0‐2.75) years.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes included the time from randomization to death from any cause (all‐cause mortality), serious adverse events and adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Severe hypoglycaemia was defined, in accordance with criteria recommended by the American Diabetes Association,<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> as an episode requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon or to take other corrective actions.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>

                <p>In these post hoc analyses, HRs comparing concomitant liraglutide use with no concomitant liraglutide use were calculated for the time to the first occurrence of confirmed MACE (primary composite outcome) and for the time to the first occurrence of confirmed individual MACE components (cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction and non‐fatal stroke). The same analyses were also applied to the first occurrence of confirmed all‐cause mortality events, serious adverse events and severe hypoglycaemic events including all randomized participants. These analyses used a Cox regression model that adjusted for treatment (degludec or glargine U100) as a fixed factor and liraglutide use (Yes/No) at any time during the trial as a time‐varying factor, without interaction between the two factors. Thus, these analyses account for patients' liraglutide use in a time‐dependent manner by handling initiation, interruption or discontinuation of liraglutide treatment during the trial. Patients who did not experience the event of interest in a particular analysis were right censored at the end of the trial and contributed to the analysis with event‐free exposure time (Figure <xref rid="dom13677-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Supporting Information).</p>
                <p>Sensitivity analyses were conducted that adjusted for additional baseline covariates, including age, sex, smoking status, race, diabetes duration, cardiovascular risk group, insulin treatment, HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hepatic impairment category and renal impairment category.</p>
                <p>Further sensitivity analyses, conducted for MACE and all‐cause mortality, examined the influence of extending the time window in which patients were considered to be receiving liraglutide after this treatment had, in fact, been discontinued (by 7, 30, 60 or 90 days). This potentially provided more conservative estimates of the effect of concomitant liraglutide use with each prolongation of the time window for liraglutide use, by ascribing potential events occurring (shortly) after a treatment pause to the liraglutide group. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis for MACE and all‐cause mortality was conducted where patients were considered to be liraglutide users from time of first initiation of liraglutide use until the first event or right censoring (until end of trial or lost to follow‐up). These analyses thereby extended the time window in which MACE and/or all‐cause mortality events were considered to be concomitant with liraglutide use, although liraglutide use had been stopped. These analyses are important to assess a potential tendency for patient deterioration leading to changes in concomitant liraglutide use.</p>
                <p>Due to the time‐varying nature of the exposure for the present analyses, patients could be included or excluded from the “concomitant liraglutide use” group at different time points. Therefore, a traditional comparison of baseline characteristics was neither feasible nor appropriate. However, comparing the characteristics of patients who received liraglutide at any time during the trial and patients who never used liraglutide during the trial can provide some information (Table <xref rid="dom13677-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Supporting Information).</p>
                <p>Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to account for the possible impact of concomitant sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitor use on outcomes. For these analyses, patients who used SGLT‐2 inhibitors at baseline were excluded from the concomitant liraglutide use group and included in the no concomitant liraglutide use group.</p>

                <p>Among patients who experienced events while exposed to liraglutide, mean liraglutide exposure from randomization to the first confirmed MACE was 302.1 days. The corresponding value for all‐cause mortality was 348.8 days.</p>
                <p>Concomitant liraglutide use was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACE [HR 0.62 (0.41; 0.92)<sub>95% CI</sub>] compared with no concomitant liraglutide use (Figure <xref rid="dom13677-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="dom13677-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Concomitant liraglutide use was also associated with a significantly lower rate of all‐cause mortality versus no concomitant liraglutide use [HR 0.50 (0.29; 0.88)<sub>95% CI</sub>] (Figure <xref rid="dom13677-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="dom13677-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This observation for MACE was driven by lower rates of all three individual MACE components with concomitant liraglutide versus no concomitant liraglutide use, although only the rate of cardiovascular death was significantly lower [HR for cardiovascular death 0.47 (0.23; 0.96)<sub>95% CI</sub>; HR for non‐fatal myocardial infarction 0.82 (0.49; 1.37)<sub>95% CI</sub>; HR for non‐fatal stroke 0.56 (0.23; 1.37)<sub>95% CI</sub>] (Figure <xref rid="dom13677-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Importantly, all of these results from these analyses were observed while the overall effect of degludec versus glargine U100 seen in the primary analysis was preserved (data not shown).</p>

                    <p>Analyses of major clinical outcomes by time‐varying liraglutide use. Full analysis set (all randomized patients). HRs presented are for time to the first confirmed event (in days), comparing concomitant liraglutide use with no concomitant liraglutide use. HRs are based on a Cox regression model adjusted for treatment and time‐varying liraglutide use at any time during the trial, without interaction. Thus, the analyses are adjusted for patients initiating, interrupting or discontinuing liraglutide treatment during the trial. For one patient who experienced an event occurring on the same day as liraglutide initiation, half a day was added to the day of the event. CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular events; N, number of events; Rate, events per 100 patient‐years of observation</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>These post hoc analyses of data from DEVOTE examined if the use of liraglutide was associated with differences in the occurrence of MACE and all‐cause mortality in users of basal insulin (degludec or glargine U100) with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Pooled data from patients receiving degludec or glargine U100 showed that concomitant liraglutide use versus no concomitant liraglutide use was associated with a 38% lower HR for MACE and a 50% lower HR for all‐cause mortality (both statistically significant), suggesting that the combination of liraglutide and basal insulin may be associated with a cardiovascular benefit. This is in line with the main finding from the LEADER trial,<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> where liraglutide significantly reduced the risks of MACE, cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Similarly, in a post hoc analysis of basal insulin‐treated patients in LEADER, treatment with liraglutide versus placebo resulted in a cardiovascular risk reduction similar to the results from the main trial and was also associated with a 50% reduction in severe hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> In addition, in the present study a range of sensitivity analyses were conducted for these outcomes, including adjusting for additional baseline covariates and extending the time window for liraglutide use. Results from these sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings, suggesting that they are robust.</p>
              <p>There are a number of observations from the LEADER trial that provide supporting context for our analysis. Observations from our post hoc analysis are supported by analyses of LEADER subgroups receiving insulin with or without an oral antihyperglycaemic agent (OHA) at baseline.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> In both of these LEADER subgroups, fewer patients experienced MACE with liraglutide versus placebo, although the differences did not reach statistical significance [HR for insulin with OHA at baseline 0.89 (0.74; 1.06)<sub>95%CI</sub>; HR for insulin without OHA at baseline 0.86 (0.63; 1.17)<sub>95% CI</sub>].<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> However, the LEADER trial was not powered to detect significant differences in MACE in the post hoc analysis because of the smaller number of patients included in these subgroups versus the overall LEADER population.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Additionally, the observation that liraglutide reduced treatment intensification with antihyperglycaemic medications during the LEADER trial, including insulin,<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> complicates the interpretation of these data.</p>
              <p>Our analysis only included those patients treated with liraglutide in DEVOTE and not all GLP‐1RAs. This was primarily because of the small proportion of patients who used a GLP‐1RA that was not liraglutide, which would not have allowed for a meaningful comparison. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefit of some other GLP‐1RAs had not been shown. On this basis, only those patients treated with liraglutide were investigated. In the United States, liraglutide is indicated to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> In addition, treatment guidelines were updated to mention liraglutide as the GLP‐1RA to be used in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> The mechanisms underlying the reduction in MACE with liraglutide have not been fully established, but an antiatherogenic effect may be involved.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Reductions in body weight and visceral fat, improvements in insulin resistance associated with non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis, lipid profiles, anti‐inflammatory effects and reductions in hypoglycaemia and HbA1c may contribute to the cardiovascular benefits of liraglutide.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> Moreover, current guidelines support the combined use of a basal insulin and a GLP‐1RA (both free and fixed combinations) when individuals with type 2 diabetes require treatment intensification.<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Therefore, as more patients use the GLP‐1RA/basal insulin combination, it is increasingly important to understand the cardiovascular profile of these combinations, especially as patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular events. The present analysis revealed a 53% lower HR of cardiovascular death (significant) and a 21% lower HR of severe hypoglycaemia (non‐significant) with concomitant liraglutide use versus no concomitant liraglutide use.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. This was a post hoc analysis, and our data show associations between liraglutide use and treatment outcomes. In addition, as these were subgroup analyses, the 95% CIs for the HRs comparing events of interest with liraglutide use versus no liraglutide use were relatively wide, particularly for the individual MACE components. Hence, the parameter estimates are somewhat imprecise, but the patterns were consistent. Concomitant and non‐concomitant liraglutide use were not randomized groups in DEVOTE. However, various sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the main finding. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses did not account for differences in insulin dose. However, basal insulin doses after 24 months of treatment were comparable in the concomitant and non‐concomitant liraglutide use groups, and therefore this factor would be expected to have a limited impact on the analyses. In addition, as DEVOTE recruited and studied patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, our findings may be more relevant to patients with established cardiovascular disease or patients over 60 years of age with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Concomitant liraglutide use was associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes. Yet, it could be argued that prior to experiencing a cardiovascular event a patient would feel unwell and may discontinue liraglutide, which would disfavour the control group and potentially inflate the effect sizes associated with exposure. However, the sensitivity analysis that applied an extended time window to liraglutide exposure in fact showed that the main findings were robust. Lastly, potential between‐group differences were noted in the baseline characteristics of patients who did or did not use liraglutide during the trial at any time. These differences may be because of socioeconomic factors and treatment goals for individual patients, which were not possible to account for in this analysis. However, the sensitivity analyses that adjusted for a range of additional covariates were consistent with those obtained in the main analyses, suggesting that these factors did not impact the prevalence of these outcomes. Nevertheless, residual confounding cannot be excluded.</p>
              <p>This study also had a number of strengths. This analysis was based on data from a large, double‐blind, cardiovascular outcomes trial, with independent adjudication of cardiovascular and severe hypoglycaemic events. In addition, the sensitivity analyses that adjusted for several baseline covariates and extended the time window for liraglutide use, maximally penalizing liraglutide use, support our main findings. Lastly, the findings from this post hoc analysis are in line with the overall findings from DEVOTE, LEADER, the LEADER subanalyses and also data on cardiovascular risk markers seen with degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira),<xref rid="dom13677-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="dom13677-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> thereby contributing significantly to the body of evidence supporting the combination of liraglutide and basal insulin in a free or fixed combination.</p>
              <p>Overall, results from the present analyses indicate that the use of liraglutide in combination with basal insulin is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk, in terms of a significantly lower risk of first MACE and all‐cause mortality, compared with no liraglutide use. These results, in line with the DEVOTE and LEADER primary results, provide important and novel information for physicians prescribing a combination of insulin and liraglutide that may extend to fixed‐dose insulin and GLP‐1RA combinations.</p>
