                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Opioid-related overdoses and harms have been declared a public health emergency in the United States, highlighting an urgent need to implement evidence-based treatments. Contingency management (CM) is one of the most effective behavioral interventions when delivered in combination with medication for opioid use disorder, but its implementation in opioid treatment programs is woefully limited. Project MIMIC (Maximizing Implementation of Motivational Incentives in Clinics) was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to identify effective strategies for helping opioid treatment programs improve CM implementation as an adjunct to medication. Specific aims will test the impact of two different strategies on implementation outcomes (primary aim) and patient outcomes (secondary aims), as well as test putative mediators of implementation effectiveness (exploratory aim).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A 3-cohort, cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid design is used with the opioid treatment programs as the unit of randomization. Thirty programs are randomized to one of two conditions. The control condition is the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network implementation strategy, which consists of three core approaches: didactic training, performance feedback, and on-going consultation. The experimental condition is an enhanced ATTC strategy, with the same core ATTC elements plus two additional theory-driven elements. The two additional elements are Pay-for-Performance, which aims to increase implementing staffâs extrinsic motivations, and Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation, which targets staffâs intrinsic motivations. Data will be collected using a novel, CM Tracker tool to document CM session delivery, session audio recordings, provider surveys, and patient surveys. Implementation outcomes include CM Exposure (number of CM sessions delivered per patient), CM Skill (ratings of CM fidelity), and CM Sustainment (number of patients receiving CM after removal of support). Patient outcomes include self-reported opioid abstinence and opioid-related problems (both assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline).</p>

                  <p id="Par3">There is urgent public health need to improve the implementation of CM as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder. Consistent with its hybrid type 3 design, Project MIMIC is advancing implementation science by comparing impacts of these two multifaceted strategies on both implementation and patient outcomes, and by examining the extent to which the impacts of those strategies can be explained by putative mediators.</p>

                <p id="Par11">The opioid overdose epidemic remains one of the most urgent public health crises in Americaâs history. According to the most recent National Household Survey of Drug Use and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], about 1.6 million Americans 12Â years of age or older met criteria for an opioid use disorder in 2019. Over 770,000 Americans have died from drug overdoses since 1999, and nearly 70% of all overdoses are due to opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The societal costs of opioid use disorders extend well beyond mortality: opioid use disorders are linked to high rates of morbidity, disease transmission, increased health care consumption, crime and law enforcement costs, and lost productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">Medication for opioid use disorder with methadone or buprenorphine represents the front-line treatment for opioid use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but medication alone is not sufficient for many patients. Even when treated with the newest extended-release formulations of medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], only about 40% of patients stay abstinent from opioids during the first 6-months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and many patients struggle with treatment retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recognizing the need to enhance medicationâs effectiveness, the National Institute on Drug Abuseâs strategic plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the National Institutes of Healthâs Helping to End Addiction Long-term initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have both emphasized the critical need for research to improve implementation of behavioral interventions as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Contingency management (CM; i.e., providing patients with tangible motivational incentives for attaining pre-defined treatment goals) is one of the most effective adjunctive behavioral interventions in combination with medication for opioid use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but one of the least available in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that dispense medication and in other community settings. Surveys of front-line treatment providers suggest as few as 10% use CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These low rates of CM implementation reflect at least four distinct barriers. First, OTP providers are often unfamiliar with CM. In recent interviews with 43 OTP providers in Rhode Island, the investigative team found that only 42% were able to define CM correctly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Second, OTP providers often object philosophically to the idea of incentivizing patients with tangible reinforcers for meeting treatment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An early survey found that over 50% of community providers objected to rewarding patients for attaining abstinence if they were failing to meet other treatment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Third, organizations with a weak implementation climate (e.g., organizational stress, low openness to change) have worse attitudes related to CM implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Fourth, and most critically, organization-level issues such as time and financial investment required to offer reinforcers are major barriers for OTPs seeking to implement and sustain CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a study of 60 OTP providers followed for a year, the investigative team found that those providers who did not implement CM reported organizational-level barriers far more often than provider- or patient-level barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">By far, the most effective large-scale CM implementation effort to date was conducted through the Veteranâs Administration: years after implementation, over 90% of the initial agencies continue to deliver CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The key success factor in this initiative was institutional funding and commitment to ongoing training throughout an integrated system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Efforts to implement CM in OTPs that lack the organization-level resources of the Veteranâs Administration system face a host of additional contextual barriers. For these reasons, multi-level strategies are likely needed to promote CM implementation in OTPs, to address both provider-level (e.g., knowledge, skills, attitudes) and organizational-level (e.g., implementation climate, time, funding) factors.</p>

                <title>Rationale for evaluating implementation strategies</title>
                <p id="Par15">Core to advancing implementation science is the recognition that evidence-based intervention delivery must be complemented by evidence-based implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Just as evidence-based interventions require specification of mechanisms of action and core components, so do implementation strategies. Yet, such specification remains rare in the field of implementation science. The current protocol aims to advance the field, by selecting two specific implementation strategies, enumerating them carefully, and conducting rigorous analysis of their comparative effectiveness.</p>
                <p id="Par16">The Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) network, funded continuously by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration since 1993, represents the longest standing network of intermediary/purveyor organizations to help addiction treatment and recovery organizations to implement evidence-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The New England ATTCâwhich serves the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermontâuses a state-of-the-art training strategy consisting of didactic training, performance feedback, and on-going consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This approach targets provider-level factors (e.g., provider knowledge, skill, and attitudes). The combination of didactic training, performance feedback, and on-going consultation has been tested in multiple studies of staff training models and has been found to be more effective than self-study or individual components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As such, we selected the ATTC strategy as our âcontrolâ implementation strategy, since it is an empirically supported implementation strategy used in routine practice.</p>
                <p id="Par17">The investigative team has demonstrated that receipt of the ATTC strategy is associated with significantly greater odds of adopting CM than didactic training alone: in a study of 60 front-line providers in methadone clinics followed for 52Â weeks, odds of adopting CM were 13.2 times greater in the ATTC condition than the didactic training only condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, it took 4â5Â months for the ATTC strategy to demonstrate superior effects and effects started to diminish after removal of active support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. For this reason, additional strategies may be needed to accelerate and sustain implementation of CM. Prior implementation research by our team supports the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both Pay-for-Performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to improve implementation and client outcomes relative to didactic training, feedback, and on-going consultation. The Pay-for-Performance strategy accelerates implementation via the extrinsic motivation of implementing staff members, whereas the Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation strategy promotes sustainment by drawing on the intrinsic motivation of the broader staff of a treatment organization. Given the urgent need to reduce the number of opioid-related overdoses and fatalities, we developed an enhanced implementation strategy that includes both the extrinsically motivating Pay-for-Performance strategy and the intrinsically motivating Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation strategy.</p>

Consistent with the EPIS framework, both implementation strategies delineate activities across phases (as elaborated in the â<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Implementation strategies</xref>â section). To elucidate factors driving implementation effectiveness, two inner context factors from EPIS that have been found to influence implementation effectiveness across multiple studiesâimplementation climate and leadership engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]âare tested as putative mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>

Consistent with best practices for hybrid trials, a type 3 hybrid trial was selected because CM has robust evidence as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], yet it is underutilized and in need of effective implementation strategies to promote its utilization within OTPs.

For each cohort, the data core at the prime institution will create an urn randomization spreadsheet and research staff will create a spreadsheet listing organizational ID numbers with variables to be entered into the urn. One of the Multiple Principal Investigators, blind to the organizational ID numbers, enters each organization into the urn randomization spreadsheet to determine condition assignment. The urn randomization procedure balances on up to three variables per cohort: the most likely variables will include number of patients served, state in which the OTP is located (to account for disparate regulations across states), and percent of patients receiving different medications. Specific variables will depend on the characteristics of OTPs enrolled (e.g., if all the OTPs in a specific cohort dispense methadone then that variable would not be entered into the urn). OTPs, OTP staff, and CM trainers will not be blinded to study condition, but OTP patients and CM rating staff will be.</p>

Eligible patients will be adults (18Â years of age or older) who were newly inducted on medication for opioid use disorder within the past 30Â days and are currently receiving treatment at a partner OTP. The study focuses on newly inducted patients as opposed to those established in treatment because the need is highest among these patients: drop-out rates and missed medication doses are higher during the first 6Â months of treatment (i.e., the âinduction phaseâ) than any subsequent period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

                <title>Prize-based CM intervention</title>
                <p id="Par33">The prize-based CM intervention implemented in this protocol is the evidence-based, lower-cost prize model pioneered by Nancy Petry and colleagues, which has been tested throughout the National Institute on Drug Abuseâs Clinical Trial Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and used in the Veteranâs Administration implementation effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The Petry model uses prizes of varying magnitude to reinforce patient behavior and has been shown to be effective when targeting abstinence, attendance, and other treatment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Based on qualitative feedback with 11 OTPs using user-centered design principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], this study uses a customizable CM protocol targeting attendance, in which each OTP can develop an organization-specific definition of patientsâ weekly attendance goals. The attendance target must include verifiable clinical encounters such as receipt of medication doses, completion of individual counseling sessions, and/or completion of group counseling sessions. The target may vary by stage of treatment but must be consistently applied to all patients within an OTP. For instance, one OTP might choose to define the weekly target as attendance at one group counseling session and one individual counseling session for the first month of treatment, and then only one group counseling session for the second month of treatment. The flexible, collaborative design approach used in this protocol has previously been shown to support sustainment of CM in the OTP setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">Patients will earn prize draws weekly for meeting the attendance target. Draws start at one for the first demonstration of the attendance target and increase by one for each consecutive week that the behavioral target is attained. Failure to attain the benchmark resets draws to zero, with draws returning to one for the next on-target week and again escalating by one for every week in which the target is met. Patients will receive prize draws for up to 12Â weeks. This progression yields a maximum of 78 prize draws (1â+â2â+â3â+â¦+â12). Patients draw from fishbowls containing 500 slips of paper; 250 have encouraging phrases but are not associated with a prize, 209 state âsmall prize,â 40 state âlarge prizeâ and one states âjumbo prize.â Based on these probabilities and magnitudes of $1â2, $25, and $100 for the three respective prize levels, each draw has an average cost of $2.83. Thus, for a 12-week protocol, the average expected maximum for patients consistently meeting the attendance benchmark is about $220 in prizes (78 drawsÂ ÃÂ $2.83/draw).Â Counselors will be given 14Â weeks to complete the 12-week protocol to accommodate for excused absences and/or extenuating circumstances (12 session maximum). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the resources needed to conduct CMâfishbowl, prize menus, photos of the prizesâwere provided to OTPs electronically so that CM could be delivered remotely as needed.</p>

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ATTC team successfully adapted the training into a series of three 1â2Â h virtual training sessions (1Â h of which is self-paced and 4Â h of which are delivered synchronously), which will be offered as an alternative if social distancing orders prohibit in-person training. The didactic workshop is required for CM counselors and recommended for leaders. Continuing education credits are provided for completion of the training workshop.</p>
                    <p id="Par39">The first half of the workshop consists of didactic instruction in CM principles, review of videotaped exemplar CM sessions, and small group discussion of how to develop a CM implementation plan. During the second half of the workshop, the trainer provides live demonstrations of CM delivery and providers break into pairs to complete role plays using standardized patient scenarios. Role-plays cover a range of possible scenarios including situations in which CM providers would have to describe CM to a new patient, provide reinforcement to a patient meeting the attendance target, and withhold reinforcement from a patient who did not meet the attendance target. Participants also practice scoring CM sessions for fidelity with the CM Competence Scale (described further in â<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Performance feedback</xref>â section). At the end of the training, attendees complete a 20-item CM Knowledge Scale modeled after the tool used in the Veteranâs Administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which requires attendees to demonstrate an a priori CM knowledge criterion of 75% regarding application of CM principles to case vignettes.

As outlined in the scale, a CM session is expected to contain six key elements: (a) inform patient of reinforcement (i.e., number of draws) earned; (b) inform patient of reinforcement possible at the next session; (c) administer the appropriate number of fishbowl draws; (d) assess patientâs desire for prizes; (e) compliment or praise patientâs efforts toward attending treatment; and (f) tie attendance and the CM program to abstinence and other treatment goals. Providers are also expected to convey three general skills: (a) demonstration of general competence, expertise, and commitment; (b) maintenance of session structure; and (c) empathy. Items are scored on 7-point Likert scales: an average score of 4.0 out of 7.0 across the nine items is considered an adequate fidelity score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and serves as the a priori skills-based criterion demonstrating initial readiness to deliver CM.</p>
                    <p id="Par41">Following the CM workshop, all OTP counselors who intend to provide CM receive performance feedback on one practice case. Counselors have 1Â month following the workshop to submit an audio recording of a role-played CM session via encrypted email. Role-plays use a standardized patient scenario and are rated by blind coders for fidelity using the CM competence scale. CM counselors who demonstrate fidelity as indicated by an average score of âadequateâ on the CM Competence Scale receive positive performance feedback. Those counselors who do not demonstrate satisfactory fidelity are given corrective feedback and OTP leaders are encouraged to provide additional training. OTP leaders receive copies of the summary reports distributed to counselors at their OTP to gain familiarity with using the CM Competence Scale as a supervision tool.</p>

Each report takes 2â3Â min to complete and collects: date of the CM session; target number of sessions patient needed to attend to earn prize draws; actual number of sessions attended; number of CM draws administered; and specific draws received (e.g., praise, small prize). It also contains the first 6 items of the CM Competence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], which counselors complete as a self-reported fidelity check. Data input into the CM Tracker yield a user-friendly dashboard for counselors that shows each patientâs progress through the CM intervention, summarizes fidelity of CM delivery, and automatically calculates the number of draws earned and number of draws anticipated in the next session. In parallel, leaders receive a user-friendly summary to quickly monitor their counselorsâ delivery and fidelity of CM.</p>

These meetings are facilitated by a trained facilitator who is external to the OTP. In accordance with its guiding theory, framework, and principles (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ISFstrategy.org">www.ISFstrategy.org</ext-link> for more information), each strategy meeting seeks to engage the OTPâs staff working on the project (i.e., the leaders and counselors who consented to participate), focus them on the projectâs key preparation-phase outcomes (e.g., completing the didactic training, demonstrating CM proficiency), evoke from them the pros and cons of implementing CM, and plan how best to successfully transition from the preparation phase to the implementation phase. The Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation strategyâs decisional balance and past implementation effort exercises (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ISFstrategy.org/tools-resources/">www.ISFstrategy.org/tools-resources/</ext-link>) are introduced and used as part of the preparation phase meetings, and are used during subsequent phases based on the OTPs needs. Near the end of the Preparation phase, each OTP is offered a longer 2Â h CM process walkthrough meeting with the facilitator, which can be held either in person or virtually.</p>
                  <p id="Par51">Each month of the implementation phase, the OTPâs leaders and CM counselors continue participating in 30â60-min virtual strategy meetings with their facilitator. Although introduced briefly during the preparation phase, it is during each of the implementation phase meetings that the Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation Strategy Workbook and embedded exercises (e.g., the performance review, evaluation, and planning exercise; implementation climate evaluation exercise; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ISFstrategy.org/tools-resources/">www.ISFstrategy.org/tools-resources/</ext-link> for demos) are used to help engaged, focus, evoke, and plan how best to maximize CM implementation both during the projectâs implementation phase and beyond (i.e., the projectâs sustainment phase).

For example, the facilitator seeks to help leadership evaluate a range of options to financially support CM, including strategies to increase OTP revenue (e.g., fund-raising, seeking grant support, improving insurance collection rates, increasing patient fees, increasing patient flow), strategies to decrease OTP costs (e.g., improving operational efficiency, renegotiating contracts), and strategies to decrease the CM-related costs (e.g., seeking prize donations).</p>

As such, our investigative team developed a staff turnover plan as part of the initial funding proposal that focuses on training as many counselors as possible, ensuring training materials are transferrable, and developing clear skills-based metrics for study participation.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Provider turnover research conducted by the investigative team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] estimates an annual turnover rate of approximately 30% among substance use disorder front-line counselors and 20% among OTP leaders. OTPs are asked to nominate up to two leaders and five counselors to provide assessment data, but there is no upper limit on the number of leaders and counselors who can attend the didactic training, consultation calls, or strategy meetings. All didactic training and consultation activities are video- or audio-record so leaders have easily transferrable, low-cost training materials; this is consistent with usual practices at the New England ATTC, which routinely records training events. Recommended training of replacement counselors consists of watching/listening to recordings of didactic training sessions. Most critically, replacement CM counselors are required to attain the same a priori benchmarks on the CM knowledge test and CM Competence Scale as initial counselors, before they are approved to implement CM. Any time a role-play or knowledge test is submitted by a replacement counselor, leaders from that OTP are copied on the performance feedback to ensure they are familiar with the training and replacement process.</p>

For each mediator, the average correlation within group (r<sub>wg</sub>) will be computed to determine whether aggregation of staff level responses to the organizational level is warranted. Values of r<sub>wg</sub> range from ââ1.00 to 1.00, with values â¥â0.60 representing acceptable agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Exploratory analyses will apply a mediation approach building on the work of Preacher and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. As part of this approach, the outcome will be regressed on the condition variable (ATTC vs. enhanced-ATTC) in a multi-level path model. In addition, the outcome will be predicted by both condition and the group mean centered mediator (e.g., implementation climate). Third, the mediational effect will be estimated as the confidence intervals of the bias-corrected bootstrapped product term of the effect of condition on the mediator and the effect of the mediator on the outcome variable at the between-group level. This method allows the between-group mediation effect to be partitioned from the within-group mediation effect.</p>

                <p id="Par74">Power analyses were conducted to determine sample sizes and estimated power to test the effect of enhanced-ATTC, relative to ATTC, on the three implementation outcomes and two patient outcomes.

Repeated measures analyses assume patient attrition of 20% and auto-correlations of 0.7.

Adverse events are reported to the Multiple Principal Investigators within 24Â h. Adverse events are reported to the institutional review board within 1Â week of the Multiple Principal Investigatorâs awareness of the event, with serious adverse events reported within 24Â h. On an annual basis, the Board makes recommendations about trial continuation based on a detailed report summarizing trial progress, interim analyses of trial outcomes conducted by a statistician blind to treatment condition, and a running list of adverse events. An OTPâs participation in this protocol ceases after completion of the sustainment phase. No provisions for ancillary or post-trial support are planned, though OTPs can request technical assistance from the ATTC.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par80">This protocol paper describes how two multifaceted strategies for CM implementation are being experimentally tested as part of Project MIMIC. Given the alarming rate of lethal opioid overdoses in the United States, which have continued to increase throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, strategies to advance the implementation and sustainment of effective adjunctive behavioral interventions to medication for opioid use disorder are urgently needed. This protocol is focused on comparing a credible real-world implementation strategy used by the largest intermediary/purveyor organization in the United States to an enhanced version of this strategy that addresses putative mechanisms of change (e.g., implementation climate, leadership engagement) that have been identified as critical components of the implementation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par81">Several design considerations guided this protocol each of which are associated with potential limitations. First, the enhanced-ATTC strategy contains two organization-level strategies that were specifically selected based on their focus on both the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of implementing staff at the partner OTPs. While theoretically driven, if results favor enhanced-ATTC, it will not be feasible to empirically determine whether the results are driven by Pay-for-Performance or Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation. Assuming that the current protocolâs enhanced-ATTC strategy were found to be more effective than the ATTC strategy, subsequent research could seek to both replicate and expand upon the current projectâs results via use of a 2âÃâ2 factorial design comparing: ATTC only, ATTCâ+âPay-for-Performance, ATTCâ+âImplementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation, and ATTCâ+âPay-for-Performanceâ+âImplementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation. Important to note, careful consideration was given to this alternative design for use as part of the current protocol, but a 2âÃâ2 factorial design was not feasible without exceeding the funderâs limits on project costs.</p>
              <p id="Par82">Second, this protocol is focused on OTPs in New England and the demographics of patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder in New England, and of providers delivering it, tends to be less racially and ethnically diverse than in other parts of the United States. The investigative team decided to retain the focus on New England to align with the catchment area of the New England ATTC, yet committed to conducting aggressive outreach and recruitment efforts to recruit as diverse and representative of a sample as possible. Finally, Project MIMIC has a 6-month sustainment phase, which limits conclusions about the longer-term impacts of these strategies.</p>
              <p id="Par83">The limitations of Project MIMIC are outweighed by several strengths including: (a) the rigorous design as a sequential cohort cluster randomized trial, (b) the collection of outcomes from multiple sources and levels including organizational records, data entered into a novel tracking tool, session audio recordings, and patient assessments, (c) focus on the high-need setting of OTPs, (d) large number of organizations with 30 OTPs each enrolling up to seven counselors and leaders, (e) examination of multiple phases of the implementation continuum (preparation, implementation, and sustainment), (f) testing putative mediators, and (g) partnership with a regional training and technical assistance center that can translate the results into action.</p>
              <p id="Par84">Results of this protocol have the potential to inform how the entire network of regional ATTCs funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as other relevant intermediary purveyor organizations, help OTPs to implement effective interventions. Such work could potentially enhance retention in OTPs and thereby enhance the quality of care offered to patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder who are at high risk of lethal overdose and other serious harms. Additionally, findings will help advance the field of implementation science by experimentally comparing different strategies and by exploring the extent to which the impacts of these strategies are able to be explained by implementation climate and/or leadership engagement.</p>
