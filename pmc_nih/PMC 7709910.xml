                <p id="P4">The current study aims to determine the brain areas critical for response to anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in PPA. Anodal tDCS and sham were administered over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), combined with written naming/spelling therapy. Thirty people with PPA were included in this study, and assessed immediately, 2 weeks, and 2 months post-therapy. We identified anatomical areas whose volumes significantly predicted the additional tDCS effects. For trained words, the volumes of the left Angular Gyrus and left Posterior Cingulate Cortex predicted the additional tDCS gain. For untrained words, the volumes of the left Middle Frontal Gyrus, left Supramarginal Gyrus, and right Posterior Cingulate Cortex predicted the additional tDCS gain. These findings show that areas involved in language, attention and working memory contribute to the maintenance and generalization of stimulation effects. The findings highlight that tDCS possibly affects areas anatomically or functionally connected to stimulation targets.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="P5">Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a progressive loss of language abilities due to neurodegeneration (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Mesulam, 1982</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Language impairments in PPA may affect oral and written language production and comprehension, with the overall patterns of presentation typically classified into three variants: non-fluent variant PPA (nfvPPA), logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA). Classification in one of these variants depends on deficits, but also neuroanatomical distribution of degeneration, and the underlying clinical pathology (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011</xref>). Regarding anatomical distribution of degeneration in the brain, individuals with svPPA tend to have bilateral atrophy in the anterior temporal lobes, which is more severe in the left hemisphere (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Mummery et al., 2000</xref>). The behavioral consequences of this atrophy include impaired word retrieval, object knowledge, and single-word comprehension in svPPA. Individuals with lvPPA have atrophy in the left inferior parietal lobe and the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Josephs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Rohrer et al., 2010</xref>). These individuals tend to present with impaired word retrieval and sentence repetition with production of phonological paraphasias. Those with nfvPPA present with predominantly left frontal atrophy, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pre-motor and supplementary motor areas, and the left insula (Grossman, Mickanin, Onishi, Hughes, D’Esposito, Ding, &amp; Reivich, 1996; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Josephs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Nestor et al., 2003</xref>). Individuals with nfvPPA present with non-fluent speech with agrammatic language production (possibly with apraxia of speech) and impaired syntactic comprehension of complex sentences.</p>
              <p id="P6">Reading and spelling are impaired in specific ways in individuals of different variants, as explained in the next section. There are no disease-modifying treatments for PPA, but several behavioral (that is, language therapy; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Beeson &amp; Egnor, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Rapp &amp; Glucroft, 2009</xref>) and neuromodulatory approaches (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Cotelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Gervits et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini, Frangakis, Gomez, Davis, &amp; Hillis, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) have shown potential to reduce its consequences. The largest study to date using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in PPA looked at the additional effects of tDCS over the left IFG in conjunction to written naming/spelling therapy (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al., 2018</xref>). The effects were encouraging: tDCS improved maintenance and generalization of therapy gains in relation to sham. However, not all individuals benefited equally from neuromodulation. Therefore, the question of which individuals benefit more from therapy and tDCS and how we predict which individuals will profit from neuromodulation remains unclear. In the current study, we aim to determine the relation between relative sparing or atrophy of specific brain areas (indexed by brain volumes) and response to a lexical retrieval intervention (written naming/spelling intervention) combined with transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), compared to Sham. The results may help shape and individualize behavioral and stimulation protocols for individuals with different patterns of distribution of atrophy.</p>

                <title>Spelling and PPA</title>
                <p id="P7">Spelling impairments are prevalent across the three PPA variants, varying in presentation depending on which processing components are impaired (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Neophytou, Themistocleous, Wiley, Tsapkini, &amp; Rapp, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Sepelyak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Shim, Hurley, Rogalski, &amp; Mesulam, 2012</xref>). Correct spelling requires accurate processing in at least one of two processing routes. In the lexical route, a word is spelled by first recognizing the string of sounds that make up the heard word, identifying its meaning, and activating the knowledge of the orthography associated with spelling that particular concept that is stored in orthographic long-term memory. Alternatively, after hearing a string of speech sounds a listener can spell a word based on previous knowledge of language-specific regularities in correspondences between speech sounds and letters (a sublexical process known as phoneme-to-grapheme conversion, PGC). Importantly, this route can only produce correct spellings for regular words with predictable spellings (e.g., ‘bat’) or pseudowords that do not have an established spelling (e.g., ‘gum-prid’). Words with irregular spellings (e.g., ‘yacht’) must be spelled using an intact lexical-semantic route (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Rapp &amp; Fischer-Baum, 2015</xref>). Regardless of which route is used, the string of letters is stored temporarily in short-term memory to remain available as needed, for spelling in written or oral modalities (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Caramazza, Miceli, Villa, &amp; Romani, 1987</xref>). Individuals with nfvPPA tend to have difficulties with PGC at early stages of the disease, while those with svPPA tend to start by having poor lexical-semantic knowledge, and therefore attempt to spell using their intact PCG and produce incorrect, but phonologically plausible word spellings (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Sepelyak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Shim et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P8">Even though there is no disease modifying intervention for PPA, behavioral therapies have resulted in positive therapy outcomes. Patients with lvPPA improve in spelling treated words when treated using a spell-study-spell procedure (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Rapp &amp; Glucroft, 2009</xref>) and phoneme-to-grapheme conversion treatment (<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini &amp; Hillis, 2013a</xref>, 2013b). Another study by <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. (2013)</xref> reports therapy effects in terms of improvement in items that patients failed to name before therapy (remediation set) and maintenance of items in which patients had been successful at naming (prophylaxis set). Patients with both lvPPA and svPPA showed significant improvement for treated words in the remediation set, and those with svPPA showed better maintenance of trained words in the remediation set when compared to untrained words. Hence, the literature indicates that therapy leads to improvement for treated items, but there is little evidence of generalization of effects to untreated items. Studies using tDCS as a treatment adjuvant have yielded more promising results in terms of generalization.</p>

                <p id="P9">Neuromodulation techniques have been combined with behavioral approaches to enhance language performance in a variety of clinical and non-clinical populations. In particular, tDCS is a neuromodulation technique that can have an effect on the excitability of the stimulated brain areas (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Kuo, Polanía, &amp; Nitsche, 2016</xref>). A weak electrical current is administered through the scalp, targeting brain areas functionally associated with the cognitive functions to enhance. Previous literature shows that tDCS can enhance language performance in healthy individuals (e.g., <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Flöel, Rösser, Michka, Knecht, &amp; Breitenstein, 2008</xref>), albeit some studies report null results (e.g., <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Westwood, Olson, Miall, Nappo, &amp; Romani, 2017</xref>). In post-stroke aphasia, greater response to behavioral interventions has also been reported for individuals receiving tDCS, compared to Sham (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">de Aguiar, Paolazzi, &amp; Miceli, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Fridriksson et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P10">In PPA, tDCS paired with oral picture naming therapy results in greater improvement than Sham, for trained (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Cotelli et al., 2014</xref>) and untrained items (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Roncero et al., 2017</xref>), with maintenance of therapy gains reported up to 12 weeks (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Cotelli et al., 2014</xref>).

                <p id="P11">In the written language domain, <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al. (2014)</xref> compared anodal tDCS administered to the left IFG with Sham, both combined with 15 sessions of spelling therapy. Spelling intervention consisted of a combination of training of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion and written naming therapy. Post-therapy improvement in spelling trained items was detected both for sham and tDCS phases. Improvement was greater in tDCS when compared to Sham for untrained items immediately, two weeks, and two months after therapy, and for trained items two months after therapy (but not immediately after or two weeks after therapy). These findings were replicated in 36 participants in the largest randomized sham-controlled clinical trial in PPA to date (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al., 2018</xref>). In the functional connectivity analysis of these tDCS effects, tDCS-related improvement correlated with changes in functional connectivity between the stimulated area (the left frontal lobe targeting the IFG) and other temporal language areas. In particular, tDCS modulated the connectivity between the left IFG triangularis and the left Inferior Temporal Gyrus and between the left IFG orbitalis and the left Middle Temporal Gyrus (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Ficek et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the neural correlates of therapy and tDCS-mediated change may lead us to better targeting of interventions to cause generalization and potentially functional communication changes. In as much as it is important to define the neural mechanisms of tDCS, it is equally important to be able to determine which brain areas are needed to respond to neuromodulation and how atrophy may affect therapy effects.</p>

                <p id="P12">The current literature on anatomical correlates of response to language interventions or language recovery is mostly based on studies with individuals with post-stroke aphasia, not involving neuromodulation. From a behavioral standpoint, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Lazar et al. (2010)</xref> have shown the amount of that aphasia recovery is proportional to initial severity: patients tend to improve to about 70% of their maximal potential recovery. Several studies also attempted to identify anatomical predictors of recovery, mapping the ‘natural history’ of recovery after stroke. For instance, <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Saur et al. (2010)</xref> used a machine learning approach and found that baseline severity and age combined with activation of the right frontal region (largely encompassing the IFG) distinguished patients with good vs. bad recovery with 86% accuracy. <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Hope et al. (2017)</xref> report that oral and written naming changes after stroke are related to structural changes in the right temporal lobe and pre-central gyrus. At the subcortical level, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Forkel et al. (2014)</xref> found a correlation between the volume of the long segment of the right arcuate fasciculus and decrease in post-stroke aphasia severity across a 6-month period. Similar results were reported by <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Marchina, Norton, Wan, and Schlaug (2013)</xref> and <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Hillis et al. (2018)</xref>, for acute stroke. A more recent approach focuses on functional anomaly maps, rather than structural data alone, having the potential to measure the relation between improvement and dysfunction related to a lesion, but in distant areas (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">DeMarco &amp; Turkeltaub, 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P13">Others identified neuroanatomical and neurofunctional predictors in the context of a behavioral intervention study. <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Meinzer et al. (2010)</xref> found that greater improvements in naming treated items after constrained induced (intensive) language therapy could be predicted by the integrity of the hippocampus and adjacent white matter. <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">van Hees et al. (2014)</xref> found that improvement in naming words treated using phonemic cues was predicted by right middle-temporal gyrus amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in resting state fMRI scans collected before therapy. Improvement in naming untreated items after semantic and phonemic cueing therapy was correlated with overall integrity of brain functional connectivity and connectivity within the left temporal lobe (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bonilha, Gleichgerrcht, Nesland, Rorden, &amp; Fridriksson, 2016</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P14">In individuals with non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia, improvements in oral naming of treated nouns were correlated with grey matter volume in the left fusiform, left middle temporal, and right inferior temporal gyri (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Cotelli et al., 2016</xref>). The same study reported that improvement in untreated verbs correlated with grey matter volume in the left middle temporal gyrus. Treatment was restricted to nouns and consisted of repetition and reading of the target, each followed by articulatory suppression and then by an attempt at naming the target. <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. (2013)</xref> also studied the relation between baseline brain volumes and naming scores obtained after therapy using orthographic and phonological cues to facilitate picture naming. They found that individuals with smaller volumes of the left temporal pole presented lower post-therapy accuracy for untrained prophylaxis items (which were named correctly before therapy), indicating more rapid decline in individuals with smaller baseline volumes, or lesser potential for generalization. In addition, greater volumes of the left inferior temporal gyrus were positively correlated with post-therapy accuracy for untrained remediation items (that is, those named incorrectly before therapy), further supporting the authors’ claim that greater potential for generalization may be present in individuals with preserved inferior and anterior temporal areas.</p>
                <p id="P15">A previous study provided evidence that individual anatomical differences may lead to different current distributions and therefore to differential response to tDCS (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">McConathey et al. (2017)</xref> report that baseline performance predicts effects of tDCS in PPA. While baseline performance may be related to overall severity of language impairments or overall severity of degeneration, in the current study we test the hypothesis that brain volumes in the stimulated region and in networks relevant for written naming, spelling and learning may also lead to differential responses to stimulation. Identification of areas associated with improvement after combined spelling and tDCS intervention in individuals with PPA will allow for a better individual tailoring of stimulation in terms of brain areas to stimulate.</p>

Patients were on average 66.4 (± 6.7) years old and reported being at 4.7 (± 3.0) years post-onset of symptoms. Language abilities were mild to moderately impaired at the time of enrollment, as measured by the FTDCDR language item (1.9 ± 0.8) (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Knopman et al., 2008</xref>). The FTDCDR sum across all items was of 7.5(± 4.8) (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for demographic and descriptive statistics). Patients were randomized to either the tDCS or Sham group with equal probability, so systematic biases in baseline variables are unlikely. In any case, we compared the distribution of the tDCS and Sham samples and found no significant differences in type of PPA variant (<italic>Fisheŕs exact test</italic>, p = 0.90), language severity in the language item of the FTLD-CDR (t(27.73) = 0.51, p = 0.62), and pre-therapy scores in the outcome measure for trained and untrained items (trained: t(27.64) = 0.47, p = 0.64; untrained: t(27.92) = 1.35, p = 0.19).

The anode targeted the left IFG, and was therefore placed over the F7 co-ordinate of the 10–20 system (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Homan, 1988</xref>). Furthermore, the accuracy of the pairing of the IFG with the scalp co-ordinate was checked by co-registering this landmark with MRI data using a fiducial marker, separately for each individual.

The combination of a highly accurate diffeomorphic algorithm with the use of multiple atlases minimizes inaccuracies in mapping and segmenting ROIs.

Because not all the above predictors can be fitted at the same time, we used the following forward stepwise selection strategy (i) we forced fitting of the factors <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>pre</italic></sub>, <italic>GA</italic>, throughout; (ii) from the remaining factors, we select the one that provides the largest increment in the cross-validated coefficient of determination (ΔR<sup>2</sup>); if this increment is significantly greater than 0, we include that factor in the model. We repeated (ii) until no remaining factor provided ΔR<sup>2</sup> significantly greater than 0. Hence, factors that are significantly associated with treatment response are predictors of the added effect of left IFG tDCS when compared to Sham. For an ROI selected in the model, we also report the coefficient β standardized to be the change in the tDCS vs Sham effect (as a fraction of its standard deviation) that is associated with one standard deviation change in the ROI volume.</p>

                <p id="P31">For trained words, there was no significant effect of tDCS at the group level on change in letter accuracy immediately or 2 weeks after therapy (immediately after therapy: additional gain, 10.7; SE, 7.8; p = 0.18; 2 weeks after therapy: additional gain, 6.8; SE, 7.2; p = 0.395). A significant effect was found at 2 months after therapy (additional gain for tDCS over sham, 15.7; standard error (SE), 7.5; p = 0.04). For untrained words, effects of tDCS were marginally significant at immediately after therapy (immediately after therapy: additional gain, 3.8; SE, 2.2; p = 0.065), non-significant at two weeks after therapy (additional gain, 2.0; SE, 5.4; p = 0.705), and significant 2 months after therapy (additional gain, 12.4; SE, 5.6, p = 0.04) (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, panels A and B for trained and untrained words, respectively).</p>

                <p id="P32">Immediately after therapy, effects of tDCS on change in letter accuracy for trained words were associated with volumes of the left Angular Gyrus (l-AG; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 13.2%, β = −0.51 p &lt; 0.01). As illustrated in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> (panel B), smaller volumes of the left AG were associated with greater benefit from tDCS than larger volumes, while there is no association in the Sham condition. After controlling for left AG volumes, the left Posterior Cingulate Cortex (l-PCC) volumes were also associated with stimulation effects (ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 14.3%, β = 0.40, p &lt; 0.05). Therapy response under tDCS becomes relatively greater than for individuals receiving Sham as the left PCC volume increases, while the pattern is in the opposite direction for Sham (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, panel C; results are summarized on <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No brain regions predicted stimulation effects at 2 weeks or 2 months after therapy, independently from the initial performance and overall atrophy.</p>

                <title>Predictors of the stimulation effect for untrained words</title>
                <p id="P33">For changes immediately and two weeks after therapy, adding volumetric data to the baseline model did not improve the R<sup>2</sup> of the model. However, two months after therapy the effects of tDCS on change in letter accuracy for untrained words were related to the volume of the left Middle Frontal Gyrus/Dorsal Prefrontal Cortex (l-MFG/DPFC; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 8.9%, β = −0.97, p &lt; 0.001). Individuals with smaller left MFG volumes benefited more from treatment if they received tDCS, compared to those receiving Sham (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel B). After controlling for left MFG volumes, the Supramarginal Gyrus (l-SMG) predicted stimulation effects (ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 4.6%, β = −0.39, p &lt; 0.05). Here too, smaller volumes were associated with better response to treatment in the tDCS condition compared to Sham (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel C). Furthermore, the right posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC; ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 10.3%, β = 0.38, p &lt; 0.05) predicted stimulation effects when volumes of the two other ROIs were accounted for. In this case, larger right PCC volumes were associated with greater benefit from therapy paired with tDCS, compared to Sham (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel D).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P34">In the present study we have identified predictors of the response to tDCS over the left IFG for trained and untrained words in written naming/spelling, after adjusting for pre-therapy scores and global atrophy. For trained words, we detected significant predictors only for immediate stimulation effects, that is, those measured immediately after therapy. However, for untrained words, we detected predictors of long-term stimulation effects, specifically, two months after therapy. For trained words, greater benefit from stimulation was associated with smaller volumes of the left AG, and larger left PCC volumes. For untrained words, greater benefit of stimulation was associated with smaller left MFG volumes, smaller left SMG volumes, and larger right PCC volumes.</p>
              <p id="P35">With regard to behavioral changes, tDCS had significant effects on changes of letter accuracy for both trained and untrained items, particularly at two months after the end of intervention. Hence, stimulation effectively increased the maintenance of therapy effects. Even in the absence of group effects of tDCS for some time-points for either trained or untrained words, asking whether certain patterns of atrophy may be associated with greater response may help to elucidate reasons behind null effects at the group level. The Discussion will focus on the relation between such patterns of atrophy and stimulation effects. For a Discussion of tDCS effects detected in this clinical trial, we refer the reader to <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al. (2018)</xref>.</p>
              <sec id="S20">
                <label>4.1.</label>
                <title>Task-relevant volumetric predictors</title>
                <p id="P36">For several left-hemisphere regions (AG, MFG, SMG), greater benefit for stimulation was associated with smaller brain volumes. A simple explanation would be that more severe degeneration in these areas is equivalent to more severe behavioral deficits, and therefore individuals with PPA with greater atrophy have a greater potential to show significant change. Firstly, we will acknowledge that although the relationship between volumetric reduction and cortical atrophy is intuitive, it may be a confounder, from the technical point of view. Differences in MRI contrast lead to shifts in the gray-white matter boundary as observed in the T1-weighted images, which reflect in increases or decreases of the measured cortical volume. The image contrasts may be affected by uncontrollable artifactual factors (e.g., scan variability) and biological factors (e.g., white matter composition, vascular status). Therefore, the cortical volumetric reduction not necessarily indicates atrophy, but a composition of phenomena that are shifting the gray-white matter boundary. This volume-intensity coupling, a well-known problem in image analysis, certainly makes the intuitive interpretation of our findings harder. Having said that, the intuitive explanation relating volumetric reduction to cortical atrophy is still likely, as the neuroimaging signal can be thought of as an important correlational marker of atrophy.</p>
                <p id="P37">Global Atrophy and pre-therapy scores in the outcome measure were both included as covariates in all models, hence controlling for general effects of severity. An opposite direction of relation between atrophy and effects of behavioral therapy was described by <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. (2013)</xref>, who report that individuals with lower volumes of the left temporal pole presented lower post-therapy accuracy for untrained prophylaxis items (which were named correctly before therapy). This was interpreted as indicating more rapid decline in individuals with smaller baseline volumes, or lesser potential for generalization. Given the negative correlations that we report (that is, smaller volumes associated with greater improvement) we cannot state, like Meyer and colleagues, that greater degeneration equates reduced potential for change. We should also add that the behavioral results of the intervention protocol used in the current study show that participants, as a group, showed gains in letter accuracy and sustained them for both tDCS and sham conditions (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P38">Stimulation may induce a more functional activity pattern in these regions, leading to behavioral improvement. This interpretation is in line with the report by (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Ficek et al., 2018</xref>), that tDCS-related improvement correlates with changes in functional connectivity between the stimulated area and other task-relevant areas. We should consider, however, why a region with smaller volume would be more susceptible to these functional changes towards a more functional activity pattern. This may be linked again to the severity of such dysfunction; that is, regions with greater atrophy may be less functional and therefore show a greater potential for functional improvement. While we included Global Atrophy and baseline scores as general markers of severity, these may not account for regionally specific structural and functional degeneration. Hence, the type of severity predicting stimulation effects may be that of the local structural atrophy and dysfunction, rather than the overall atrophy and general spelling impairment, which are accounted by the baseline variables in the model.</p>
                <p id="P39">Regardless of the exact mechanism of change, the regions identified are structurally connected to the stimulated area, and play important roles in spelling, as discussed next. Ultimately, this leads to the need to consider structural connectivity and network relevance when deciding on stimulation targets. Both the Angular Gyrus and the Supramarginal Gyrus are structurally connected the stimulated IFG via the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-III; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Frey, Campbell, Pike, &amp; Petrides, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Seghier, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, given the large size of the stimulation electrode use, and the current distribution shown on <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, it is likely that the middle frontal gyrus also received stimulation. In any case, this region is connected to the IFG via short association U-shaped fibers (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Barredo, Verstynen, &amp; Badre, 2016</xref>). Hence, even though the amount of atrophy in the IFG did not predict effects of stimulation, the integrity of the regions connected to the left IFG does. Importantly, apart from being anatomically connected to the stimulated area (left IFG) the AG, SMG, and MFG play important roles in processing written language. These results align with the behavioral results reported by <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al. (2018)</xref> that individuals with nvfPPA, who show atrophy in frontal and fronto-parietal regions, show greater tDCS effects.</p>
                <p id="P40">The AG is thought to be involved in mapping visual stimuli to linguistic representations, showing functional connectivity during reading with extrastriate and posterior temporal areas, in healthy but not dyslexic adults (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz, Rumsey, &amp; Donohue, 1998</xref>). It has also been causally linked to semantic processing (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Price, Peelle, Bonner, Grossman, &amp; Hamilton, 2016</xref>). The left supramarginal gyrus has been linked to converting orthographic information to phonology (letter to sound correspondences) when reading words in languages with trans-parent vs. opaque orthography (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Law et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Price, 1998</xref>). While the middle frontal gyrus is typically associated with cognitive control (in particular, inhibition) and visual attention (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Giesbrecht, Woldorff, Song, &amp; Mangun, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Hopfinger, Buonocore, &amp; Mangun, 2000</xref>), it has also been shown to be active during both word and nonword reading (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Borowsky et al., 2006</xref>), therefore potentially supporting attentional demands of reading. It is important to note that, this region has recently been associated with spelling and in particular the orthographic working memory (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Rapp, Purcell, Hillis, Capasso, &amp; Miceli, 2015</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P41">We should also briefly discuss why the left AG predicts the effect of stimulation for trained words, while the other two regions relate to effects of stimulation for untrained words. This may relate to the hypothesized role of these areas in spelling. As stated above, the left AG may be involved in linking specific orthographic representations to semantics (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, potential learning facilitated by enhanced function in this area would be specific to orthographic representations for which there was exposure during training (the trained words). Differently, the left supramarginal gyrus has been linked to letter to sound correspondences (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Price, 1998</xref>), which consist of a set of rules which are applied to many words. In fact, in post-stroke aphasia, generalization in spelling is most often found in studies treating phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Luzzatti, Colombo, Frustaci, &amp; Vitolo, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">de Partz, Seron, &amp; der Linden, 1992</xref>). Finally, the attentional demands of reading associated with the left MFG (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Borowsky et al., 2006</xref>) are also relevant for trained and untrained words. Hence, stimulation induced enhancements in functioning of these last two areas may have an impact in spelling untrained words.</p>
                <p id="P42">An implication of the finding that individuals with smaller left AG, SMG, and MFG areas show greater benefit if receiving tDCS is that these areas may also be effective targets for stimulation, even in individuals with greater degeneration. However, it is also possible that stimulation to the left IFG was effective (as reported by <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al., 2018</xref>) precisely because of its central role in a network, linking areas with different, but important roles in spelling. Hence, stimulating any individual node of that network may not be as effective. Future research may explore differential effects of stimulation to nodes and hubs in functional networks.</p>

                <title>The posterior Cingulate Cortex and its contribution to stimulation effects</title>
                <p id="P43">Left and right posterior cingulate were associated with stimulation effects, for trained and untrained words, respectively. The PCC has been associated with episodic memory retrieval (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Daselaar, Veltman, Rombouts, Raaijmakers, &amp; Jonker, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Konishi, Wheeler, Donaldson, &amp; Buckner, 2000</xref>), with lesion to this region resulting in episodic memory impairment (<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Valenstein et al., 1987</xref>). Other studies also indicate that the PCC is involved in working memory (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Hampson, Driesen, Skudlarski, Gore, &amp; Constable, 2006</xref>) in regulating the focus of attention (for a review see <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Leech &amp; Sharp, 2014</xref>). Given its role in memory and attention, it is thought to support learning (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Pearson, Heilbronner, Barack, Hayden, &amp; Platt, 2011</xref>). It is also an area that is very susceptible to degeneration, showing early accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and reduced metabolic rate in very early Alzheimer’s Disease (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Minoshima et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P44">Why should greater benefit to tDCS then be related to larger PCC volumes? Given the contribution of the PCC to attention, it is possible that individuals with greater volumes in this area simply have a greater ability to attend to therapy stimuli and procedures and, consequently, a greater potential learn. If tDCS can enhance the ability to learn spelling of trained and untrained words, it is logical that this happens to a greater extent in individuals with a greater baseline attention. Importantly, learning requires attention, both for trained and untrained words.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="P45"><xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Tsapkini et al. (2018)</xref> report differences in response to stimulation across PPA variants, with patients with semantic variant PPA showing no additional benefit under tDCS compared to Sham. This may be due to the characteristics of stimulation (stimulation site, polarity, intensity, modality; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">de Aguiar et al., 2015</xref>). However, not only were there limited tDCS effects, but there was also limited generalization in this group. Hence, the lack of a stimulation effect, particularly for untrained words, can also be an indication that the treatment provided is not suitable to yield generalization in individuals with semantic variant PPA, and this way, generalization cannot be enhanced by tDCS. Thus, neuroanatomical predictors of stimulation effects in svPPA should be identified in the context of a behavioral treatment more likely to yield substantial change in behavioral performance, in particular for untrained words. Unfortunately, improvement in spelling of untrained words in svPPA has not been reported in previous treatment studies.</p>
                <p id="P46">Another limitation of the current study is that there may be different reasons why we find a relation between brain volumes and response to tDCS. We discuss that areas functionally relevant for spelling were selected as predictors, which implies that these regions’ functional role is important for obtaining behavioral improvement. However, a relation between the volume of regions connected to the left IFG and the effect of tDCS may also indicate that the volumes of those regions affect current distribution. In this second explanation, the functional role of each region is irrelevant. However, the fact that regions identified are involved in cognitive functions relevant for spelling is unlikely to be a coincidence. Furthermore, the study of <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Ficek et al. (2018)</xref>, reports on changes in resting state MRI data in participants of this same clinical trial. They detect tDCS-related changes in functional connectivity between the left IFG triangularis and orbitalis and the left inferior temporal and middle temporal gyri, respectively. Hence, it is likely that the functional role of regions connected to the stimulated brain areas is relevant to and effected by stimulation effects.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="P47">Greater left IFG tDCS effects were associated with smaller volumes of several areas that are known to have specific contributions to spelling, including in mapping orthographic to semantic representations (left AG), letter to sound correspondences (left SMG), and controlling the attentional demands of spelling (left MFG). In addition, the role of the left and right PCC volumes may suggest that individuals with a greater baseline attention may be at an advantage to benefit from training effects enhanced by stimulation. These findings provide guidance towards the use of tDCS in individuals with PPA, stressing the importance of considering the function of the areas structurally connected to stimulation targets. Future research may inquire whether the above-mentioned areas can be suitable stimulation targets to pair with behavioral interventions for spelling in PPA.</p>
