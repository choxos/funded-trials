                  <title>Question</title>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this mediation analysis of 230 Head Start mothers participating in a randomized clinical trial, those receiving problem-solving education experienced a reduction in depressive symptom episodes. Across an array of plausible theory-based intervention mediators, improvement in perceived stress was associated with both intervention participation and depressive symptom outcomes; however, the mechanism for much of the intervention’s impact on depression remained unexplained.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>Problem-solving interventions may reduce depressive symptom burden, in part, by helping recipients manage stress; successfully scaling such interventions may require expanding intervention components related to stress management and reducing components that are unrelated.</p>

                  <p>A multivariate path analysis was embedded within a randomized efficacy trial (February 15, 2011, to May 9, 2016). Participants were mothers with depressed mood, anhedonia, or depression history (but not in current major depressive episode) at 1 of 6 Head Start agencies. Participants were followed up for 12 months with serial assessments of potential intervention mediators and depressive symptoms.</p>

Based on associations with either PSE participation or depressive symptom outcomes, problem-solving ability, perceived stress, behavioral activation, and problem-focused coping were included in a parsimonious, multivariate path model. In this model, only perceived stress was associated with both PSE participation and depressive symptoms. Participants in the PSE group had adjusted standardized perceived stress change scores that were 11% lower than controls (95% CI, −0.19 to −0.03), and improvement in perceived stress generated an adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.33-0.53) for depressive symptom elevations. Participants in the intervention group also had standardized behavioral activation change scores 15% greater than controls (95% CI, 0.01-0.30) and problem-focused coping change scores 17% greater than controls (95% CI, 0.03-0.31); however, changes in these constructs were not associated with a differential rate of depressive symptom elevations. The direct effect of PSE on depressive symptom elevations (aRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.97) was greater than the mediated effect explained by improvement in perceived stress (aRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98).</p>

              <p>Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These women face a variety of cultural and logistic barriers that impede engagement with mental health services, resulting in health disparities for both themselves and their children.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although much of the clinical research on maternal depression has focused on treatment, a growing body of work has shown that depression can be prevented.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thus, embedding maternal depression prevention strategies in accessible venues, outside traditional medical settings, is a potentially important public health strategy to reduce mental health disparities. In its 2009 report <italic>Depression in Parents, Parenting, and Children,</italic> the National Academy of Medicine endorsed this concept and called for interventions that take place in community-based, family-focused venues.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Responding to this call, our research team recently completed a randomized efficacy trial of problem-solving education (PSE) in Head Start, a federally funded early learning program that provides services for approximately 1 million low-income families each year.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Problem-solving education is a cognitive-behavioral depression prevention intervention, designed specifically for low-income mothers.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Intervention models based on problem solving are well accepted in the fields of depression management and prevention<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and are based on the premise that because daily problems perpetuate depressive symptoms, working through these problems systematically can reduce symptoms and improve functioning.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In our trial, Head Start mothers with subthreshold depressive symptoms who received PSE experienced a 40% reduction in the incident rate of clinically significant symptom episodes over a 12-month period, compared with treatment-as-usual controls.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Although PSE is unique in that it was embedded as a lay-delivered program within a preschool setting, its intervention components are consistent with other successful problem-solving approaches.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> While evidence supporting the effectiveness of these approaches is solid,<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> evidence that sheds light on problem solving’s mechanism of action is not as robust. To our knowledge, prior work suggests only that problem-solving models work by breaking down avoidant coping patterns.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Understanding the mechanisms by which complex behavioral interventions work is important to developing effective intervention strategies that can be adapted to diverse venues and populations.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> By understanding such mechanisms, complex interventions can be distilled into ones that are simpler to implement, have greater potential to stand up to effectiveness testing, and make greater public health impact. For this reason, in the context of our randomized efficacy trial of PSE, we conducted a series of prespecified mediation analyses to understand PSE’s mechanism of action.</p>

                <p>Sessions instructing participants in PSE were one-on-one, workbook-based interactions, adapted from Hegel and Areán’s problem-solving treatment manual.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Sessions were delivered in the home or in the Head Start center; they typically lasted 30 to 60 minutes. Consistent with efficacy trial design, PSE providers were paid study personnel; none, however, had formal mental health training or a degree higher than a bachelor’s. A full course of PSE involved 6 sessions, delivered weekly or biweekly. Each session included 7 steps: defining a problem, goal setting, generating solutions, implementing decision-making guidelines, evaluating solutions, implementing solutions, and evaluating outcomes. The sessions placed equal emphasis on behavioral activation and the specification of a problem; this was designed to allow clients to focus on action planning and to provide a clear future orientation to the interaction. Providers of PSE instruction learned motivational interviewing techniques to promote intervention adherence.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>To estimate intervention effect, we conducted intention-to-treat analyses using a set of binary variables to model the effects of Head Start site.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> We used negative binomial regression to compare rates of depressive symptom elevations over the follow-up period, using an offset to standardize rates according to the number of assessments completed. Consistent with prior work,<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> we adjusted our models for baseline QIDS score. We explored PSE provider effects by estimating regression models to determine variation in participant outcomes across providers. We verified our main outcomes using multiple imputation techniques for missing data.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We conducted all analyses described with SAS statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).</p>
                <p>To evaluate the association between receipt of PSE, potentially mediating factors, and depressive symptom elevations, we constructed initial path models with single mediating variables using Mplus software version 7.3.1 (Muthen &amp; Muthen). The primary purpose of these single mediator models was to present unadjusted estimates to provide a window into the degree of confounding in our subsequent main multivariate models. Receipt of PSE was modeled as a binary indicator variable; mediating factors were modeled as continuous variables; and depression symptom elevation over time was modeled as a count variable with an offset for the number of completed outcome assessments. Thus, the first part of the path model (linking PSE receipt to mediators) represented a linear model, and the second part (linking mediators to depressive symptom elevation) represented a Poisson model.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> To allow for comparisons across mediators, we modeled all mediating variables as standardized change scores, so that each participant had 2 change scores: 1 reflecting the time segment between baseline and 6 months of follow-up and the other between 6 months and 12 months. Depressive symptom elevations that occurred only within concurrent time segments were regressed against standardized change scores in mediator variables. Because there were no differential associations across the 2 time segments, the segments were combined into a single overall model with multiple observations per participant.</p>
                <p>These models allowed us to differentiate and test the statistical significance of the direct from indirect (mediated) effects of PSE on rates of depressive symptom elevations. All path models were adjusted for baseline depression score and Head Start site; our fully adjusted models, constructed using the techniques described by Muthen and colleagues,<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> also accounted for covariance among mediators (thus treating each of the mediating variables as potential confounders for one another). From a fully adjusted multivariate model that contained all theory-based, potentially mediating factors, we retained for further analysis in a more parsimonious model only those mediators that were associated with either receipt of PSE or depressive symptom elevations at the <italic>P</italic> ≤ .10 level. All <italic>P</italic> values were 2-sided.</p>
                <p>Because there was no evidence of variation in outcome by PSE provider, and because imputing missing data did not change our results, we conducted all mediation analyses without adjusting for provider and we did not impute missing data for this purpose.</p>
                <p>We estimated our sample size to provide power to test a clinically significant difference across intervention groups on the composite problem-solving measure and rate of symptom elevations. We did not power the study to detect signal in factors that mediate PSE’s impact.</p>

This difference produced an adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.41-0.90) in favor of PSE. There was no evidence of variation in outcomes by PSE provider.

              <p>A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that depression is a preventable illness.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Among women with young children, successful prevention approaches have primarily involved versions of interpersonal or cognitive-behavioral therapy.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Problem-solving interventions, which are based in part on a cognitive-behavioral model, have a growing evidence base.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Consistent with other depression interventions that have included problem-solving components,<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> recent work has demonstrated that PSE substantially reduces the rate of symptomatic person-time over a full year.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> According to the present study, most of this impact appears to have been a direct effect of PSE on depressive symptoms. However, it also appears that a substantial part of PSE’s effect is mediated through a constellation of other factors, most notably the reduction of perceived stress. Although PSE appears to enhance behavioral activation and problem-focused coping, these intervention targets do not appear to be associated with symptom improvement.</p>
              <p>This constellation of findings is consistent with PSE’s underlying theoretical model, the relational problem-solving model of stress, which posits that improving, or buffering an individual from, daily life stress can improve depressive symptoms.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Gaining understanding into how behavioral interventions work is important for at least 2 reasons: first, understanding the psychological and behavioral targets that such interventions engage can lead to model refinements that maximize effect; and second, understanding mechanisms of action will ultimately allow for the differentiation of core intervention components from adaptable ones, a process critical for intervention implementation. Our specific findings are consistent with prior studies of problem-solving interventions that have improved depressive symptoms in the absence of measurable differences in problem-solving skills.<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180041r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> However, whereas prior work has suggested that problem-solving models work by breaking down avoidant coping patterns,<sup><xref rid="zoi180041r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> we found no signal that PSE engaged that particular intervention target.</p>
              <p>The finding that PSE’s direct effect on depressive symptoms appears greater than its mediated effect can be interpreted in 2 ways. The first is that our measurement strategy could have underestimated the role of stress as a mediating factor. In this case, the Perceived Stress Scale may have incompletely captured the domains of stress we sought to measure. If we had measured a more specific dimension of stress by honing in on stress related to parenting or depression, then it is possible we could have detected a more powerful mediating effect. This argument can be extended to other mediating constructs such as problem-solving ability and behavioral activation, which are difficult to measure with concise, time-efficient scales. The second interpretation is that we have yet to fully understand problem solving’s primary mechanism of action; in this case, some of PSE’s purported direct effect may actually be an unmeasured mediated effect.</p>
              <sec id="H2-16-ZOI180041">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, a mediation analysis by path modeling is not an experimental design. The way to definitively test alternative mechanistic pathways is to compare the effectiveness of different (and often simplified) versions of an intervention; this was beyond the scope of our clinical trial. Second, we did not power the study specifically to detect signal in factors that mediate PSE’s impact; thus, it is possible that our findings concerning behavioral activation and problem-focused coping (which, though statistically significant, are on the border of conventionally accepted levels of statistical significance) may be spurious findings, and that undetected mediation pathways exist even among the variables we tested. Third, although our mediation analysis supports the paradigm that buffering an individual from stress can lessen depressive symptoms, it still leaves unanswered exactly how that buffering occurs in the context of PSE. Our mediation models are specific to the impact of problem solving on depressive symptoms and do not necessarily relate to other, potentially important outcomes related to behavior change, for which behavioral activation or problem-focused coping skills may play a more substantial mediating role.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our study contributes to the literature on problem solving’s role as a pragmatic depression prevention strategy and potentially advances it along the trajectory from efficacy testing to effectiveness testing and implementation. Insight into PSE’s mechanism of action, specifically in the context of an efficacy trial, can plausibly lead to intervention refinements for both PSE proper and other related intervention models. In turn, such refinements can help develop simplified intervention strategies that are more likely to stand up to real-world effectiveness testing, and ultimately to dissemination and implementation.</p>
