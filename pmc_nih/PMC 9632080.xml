                  <p id="Par3">In a per-protocol analysis that included patients who completed the intervention, the treatment group (39) had significantly lower supragingival plaque scores at 6 and 12âweeks compared to the control group (41; <italic>p</italic>â=â0.022). Both groups showed similar improvement in gingivitis score, but neither group had improvement in bleeding score or probing depth. Thirty-eight (29%) patients did not complete the study due to loss of follow-up (17) or early discontinuation of the assigned intervention (21).

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par9">Chronic periodontitis is a multifactorial disease influenced by smoking, diabetes, and oral hygiene. The initiation of chronic periodontitis is preceded by bacteria in the dental plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the imbalanced interaction between subgingival microbiome and the inflammatory response of the host, ultimately leading to tissue destruction and periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Plaque is a bacterial biofilm that colonizes and adheres to the tooth surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], providing protection for the bacteria against mechanical stress as well as antimicrobial agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Biofilm formation occurs quickly but its maturation requires time. The biofilm initiates an inflammatory reaction through the release of endotoxins as well as through initiation of the host immune response involving regulatory mediators such as transforming growth factor-Î²1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and transglutaminase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Using DNA probes to analyze plaques from both periodontally healthy and diseased patients, Socransky et al. categorized bacterial subgroups on a spectrum from healthy to disease-causing bacteria and defined five major bacterial complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Among them, the red complex organisms consisting of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>B. forsythus</italic> (now <italic>T. forsythia</italic>), and <italic>T. denticola</italic> are particularly virulent and have been associated with periodontal breakdown. The presence of red complex bacteria within the sulcus can cause inflammatory reactions and promote the onset of periodontal diseases, presenting initially as gingivitis and then progressing to periodontitis if left untreated.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Non-surgical therapies for the treatment of periodontal disease include scaling and root planning and local delivery of antibiotics, while more invasive surgical options involve resection surgery and regenerative approaches. For these treatment modalities to effectively achieve and maintain periodontal health, they must be combined with adherence to oral hygiene regimens and regular professional maintenance visits. Although these treatment modalities can slow or halt disease progression, the best treatment is prevention. The use of antimicrobial therapies as adjunctive treatments is commonly employed to maintain gingival health or supplement non-surgical or surgical therapies. Toward this goal, Next Scienceâ¢ has developed an oral mouth rinse that is intended to delay the onset of the periodontal disease process by reducing plaque accumulation and slowing disease progression. The test rinse combines CPC and essential oils, as well as biofilm disrupting technology composed of a high osmolarity solution of sodium hydroxide and potassium phosphate monobasic at pHâ9.0. The biofilm disruption effect of this chemistry is achieved by chelation of metal ions in the biofilm extracellular polysaccharide matrix, which cross-link the biofilm together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The essential oils in the test rinse include menthol, eucalyptol, methyl salicylate and thymol. Essential oils have antibacterial activity via alteration of the bacterial cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and have been shown to reduce plaque and gingival bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Cetylpyridinium chloride is a cationic quaternary ammonium compound with antiseptic and surfactant properties, with antimicrobial effects through the disruption of bacterial cell membranes resulting in alterations of cellular metabolism, and eventual cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The test rinse also includes ingredients which chelate metal ions from the biofilm, exposing the bacteria within to the antimicrobial products.</p>
              <p id="Par11">The test oral rinse was previously evaluated in an in vitro study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], in which its effects against the red complex periodontal pathogens were compared to the effects of Listerine<sup>â</sup> and Perioguard<sup>â</sup>. The results showed superior efficacy in reducing the number of red complex bacteria in vitro compared to Listerine, with a greater reduction of both aerobic (supragingival) and anaerobic (subgingival) biofilms compared to Perioguard. Thus, the in vitro data suggest that the test oral rinse may be superior than the current commercially available products in removing or eliminating biofilm and/or preventing accumulation of supragingival plaque. Given its biofilm-disrupting capabilities, the present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the test oral rinse in reducing re-accumulation of supragingival plaque in patients with gingivitis after dental prophylaxis. In addition, the impact of the test rinse on supragingival microbiome was evaluated.</p>

                <p id="Par20">On the morning of each visit, subjects were required to refrain from eating, drinking or performing any oral hygiene efforts. Visits were conducted in the morning to encourage compliance. At screening, baseline measurements for gingival index as proposed by Loe (1967) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the Turesky modification of the Quigley and Hein Plaque index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and probing depths were determined. Plaque samples were collected from the following four sites: mesial surface of maxillary first molar on the left side, distal surface of maxillary first premolar on the right side, mesial surface of mandibular second molar on the left side, and distal surface of mandibular lateral incisor on the right side. At each visit, all four plaque samples were collected from the supragingival tooth surface with a sterile curette and pooled in a single tube. If any of these four teeth were missing, the next adjacent tooth was used to collect the plaque sample. All plaque samples were placed immediately on ice and stored at ââ80âÂ°C until further processing.</p>
                <p id="Par21">At the second visit (within 2âweeks of the baseline visit), a professional prophylaxis was completed by a single hygienist, and then participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either treatment mouth rinse or control carrier rinse. A randomization schedule was provided by the sponsor, and the treatment and placebo products were coded numerically so that the study site staff and the subjects were blinded to the identity of the products. Patients were given standardized toothbrushes and toothpaste and were instructed not to use any additional oral hygiene aids. Flossing, toothpicks, interdental brushes or use of additional mouth rinses was not permitted during the 12-week study. Rinsing was performed twice daily with 20âmL of the assigned mouth rinse. Patients were instructed to rinse for 30âseconds and expectorate. Clinical measurements were repeated following 6 and 12âweeks of mouth rinse use, and supragingival plaque samples were collected from the same four sites at 12âweeks. The primary outcome was improvement in plaque index at 6 and 12âweeks. The secondary outcomes were changes in gingival index, bleeding score, pocket depths, and changes in the composition of supragingival microbiome. Safety assessments included the type, incidence, and severity of adverse events that occurred during the study period.</p>

                <p id="Par27">16s rRNA sequencing analysis of the supragingival microbiome identified 538 unique operational taxonomy units (OTUs) belonging to 10 different phyla. We first compared the temporal trends in species richness and diversity between those who received the test mouth rinse and the carrier control rinse. At baseline, samples from the control and the test rinse treatment subjects had similar levels of richness and diversity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Table</xref>). At 12âweeks, species richness and diversity increased in both groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. We then examined the effects of the test rinse on the overall community structure compared to the control rinse. Differences in community structure was measured using weighted UniFrac distance metric, a distance metric that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness and abundance of OTUs in each sample. The communities of control and treatment groups were similar at baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b; PERMANOVA: Fâ=â1.23, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.284), but diverged over time.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">Several studies have reported the effects of a Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) rinse vs. placebo rinse, an essential oil rinse vs. placebo rinse, and a CPC rinse vs. an essential oils rinse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the clinical and microbiological effects of a mouth rinse that combines CPC and essential oils with a biofilm disrupting formulation. Our results showed that in gingivitis patients, the test rinse significantly reduced re-accumulation of supragingival plaque by depleting the abundant and prevalent members of the supragingival plaque microbiome following dental prophylaxis. However, adverse effects may limit long-term adherence to the rinse.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Our study examined the impacts on the supragingival plaques. There were several reasons for focusing on supragingival plaques. First, gingivitis patients harbor less complex subgingival periodontal biofilm with fewer red complex bacteria, and this study included only patients with gingivitis and excluded patients with periodontal disease. Second, Wunderlich showed that mouth rinses only penetrate an average of 0.2âmm below the gingival margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. If at home use of the mouth rinse is not physically reaching the subgingival environment, it is reasonable to focus on the supragingival plaque where the rinse is in direct contact. Third, even in a clinical setting, irrigation of a pocket (PDââ¥â5âmm) with an irrigating syringe penetrates an average of 1.8âmm subgingivally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. When looking at other oral hygiene aids, toothbrushes have been shown to penetrate an average of 0.9âmm subgingivally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. WaterpikÂ® at a high-pressure setting may deliver solution to an average of halfway between the free gingival margin and the most coronal connective tissue attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These may be an adequate depth for our gingivitis patients, but our study was testing the results of at-home use of the mouth rinse without any adjunctive oral hygiene aids. Thus, future studies on the effects of the test rinse in combination with irrigating syringes or WaterpikÂ® devices may be warranted.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Our results showed that following dental prophylaxis, the test rinse significantly reduced re-accumulation of supragingival plaque with effects sustaining through 12âweeks. The gingival index score also improved but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The reason for similar improvements in gingivitis score between the two groups may be attributed to the prophylaxis that each patient received after the baseline visit, as the benefits of dental prophylaxis for improvement in gingivitis are widely accepted. The frequency of dental visits prior to this study was widely variable and many patients had not had professional cleanings in recent years. Furthermore, Hawthorn effect could have been a contributing factorâhome oral hygiene may have improved because the subjects were aware that they were participating in a dental study and knew that gingivitis and plaque scores were being evaluated.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The supragingival plaque communities have been shown recently to have an organized spatial structure of a consortium consisting of aerobes and facultative anaerobes in a distinctive community called âhedgehogâ based on combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging FISH analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this hedgehog structure, filaments of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. (primarily <italic>C. matruchotii and C. durum</italic> in most individuals) are densely packed at the base serving as the foundation or a nucleating species to bind to a biofilm on the tooth surface containing <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces</italic>. These <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> filaments extend out through an annulus in the middle layer that is occupied by elongated filaments of <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic>, and <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic>, and the distal tips of the <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> filaments are surrounded by cocci including <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas,</italic> as well as <italic>Haemophilus</italic>/<italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> and <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> to form âcornbobâ structures. Interestingly, our microbiome analysis showed that nearly all microbial taxa that were differentially depleted in the treatment group were also organisms previously identified in the hedgehog structure (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Thus, our microbiome data demonstrate that the test rinse reduced the re-accumulation of supragingival plaques by depleting members of the hedgehog consortium in the plaque microbiome. Moreover, Unifrac analysis showed that the supragingival plaque microbiome in the treatment group shifted substantially compared to the controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), with the two groups diverging significantly at 12âweeks. We note that several microbial taxa associated with gingivitis and periodontitis, including <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia,</italic> and <italic>Treponema socranskii,</italic> were enriched in the treatment group. The significance of this observation is unclear, but suppression of dominant members of the hedgehog consortium by the test rinse may have led to the over-representation of previously low abundant organisms in the plaque microbiome. It would be important in future studies to determine whether enrichment of these putative periodontal pathogens and the microbiome shifts induced by the test rinse are beneficial for the maintenance of oral health, or are harmful for progression toward disease. Furthermore, as several biomarkers (e.g. TGF-Î²1, transglutaminase 2, NLRP3) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], it would be of interest to evaluate the effects of the test oral rinse on these early biomarkers.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The study had several limitations. First, a significant proportion of patients (10/59 or 17% in the treatment group and 6/59 or 10% in the placebo group) discontinued the study due to adverse effects. This is a potential drawback that may limit long-term adherence to the oral rinse. Second, the study was conducted in participants with gingivitis, and thus its effect on preventing gingivitis in patients without gingivitis and changing the microbiome of their supragingival plaque could not be ascertained. Third, the study follow-up was limited to 12âweeks, and thus it was not possible to determine any long-term preventive or therapeutic effects of the test rinse.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par34">A rinse combining CPC and essential oils with a biofilm disrupting chemistry reduces re-accumulation of supragingival plaque and the associated supragingival microbiome following dental prophylaxis. However, the test rinse did not improve gingivitis score significantly compared to carrier controls. Future research should evaluate the long-term effects of the test rinse in reducing or preventing gingivitis, and determine whether the combination of these ingredients is more effective than either the CPC rinse or essential oil rinse alone and how each component impacts the supragingival microbiome.</p>
