                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">It is critical to assess implementation fidelity of evidence-based interventions and factors moderating fidelity, to understand the reasons for their success or failure. However, fidelity and fidelity moderators are seldom systematically reported. The study objective was to conduct a concurrent implementation fidelity evaluation and examine fidelity moderators of CHORD (Community Health Outreach to Reduce Diabetes), a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled trial to test the impact of a Community Health Workers (CHW)-led health coaching intervention to prevent incident type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in New York (NY).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We applied the Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity to assess implementation fidelity and factors moderating it across the four core intervention components: patient goal setting, education topic coaching, primary care (PC) visits, and referrals to address social determinants of health (SDH), using descriptive statistics and regression models. PC patients with prediabetes receiving care from safety-net patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) at either, VA NY Harbor or at Bellevue Hospital (BH) were eligible to be randomized into the CHW-led CHORD intervention or usual care. Among 559 patients randomized and enrolled in the intervention group, 79.4% completed the intake survey and were included in the analytic sample for fidelity assessment. Fidelity was measured as coverage, content adherence and frequency of each core component, and the moderators assessed were implementation site and patient activation measure.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Content adherence was high for three components with nearly 80.0% of patients setting ≥ 1 goal, having ≥ 1 PC visit and receiving ≥ 1 education session. Only 45.0% patients received ≥ 1 SDH referral. After adjusting for patient gender, language, race, ethnicity, and age, the implementation site moderated adherence to goal setting (77.4% BH vs. 87.7% VA), educational coaching (78.9% BH vs. 88.3% VA), number of successful CHW-patient encounters (6 BH vs 4 VA) and percent of patients receiving all four components (41.1% BH vs. 25.7% VA).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The fidelity to the four CHORD intervention components differed between the two implementation sites, demonstrating the challenges in implementing complex evidence-based interventions in different settings. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring implementation fidelity in contextualizing the outcomes of randomized trials of complex multi-site behavioral interventions.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">The NationalInstitutes for Health recommends fidelity measurement in health behavior studies because without the knowledge of implementation fidelity, it may be impossible to draw correct inferences about the effectiveness of or to replicate an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Erroneous inferences may lead to invalid conclusions about the relationships between the intervention components and outcomes, especially in pragmatic studies of complex behavioral interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, most pragmatic trials do not report systematic assessment of implementation fidelity and very few assess how participant and contextual factors may influence fidelity. For example, a review found that only 3.5% of complex behavioral interventions for drug abuse adequately addressed intervention fidelity to planned core intervention components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">CHORD (Community Health Outreach to Reduce Diabetes), launched in 2017, is a cluster-randomized, pragmatic trial that tests a Community Health Worker (CHW) driven intervention to promote healthy lifestyle changes to reduce the incidence of Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) among pre-diabetic patients cared for in two safety-net primary care sites that serve veterans, or uninsured and Medicaid populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We sought to improve the understanding of subsequent CHORD trial results, as well as to learn about how contextual factors affected implementation of the CHORD intervention, by assessing fidelity to its four core components across the study’s two participating sites.</p>
              <p id="Par20">By reporting on the fidelity of the CHORD study implementation, our study attempts to fill a gap in systematic documentation and reporting of implementation processes of complex behavioral interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to clarifying causal mechanisms, assessment of implementation fidelity can provide critical information to guide future implementation of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Examining implementation fidelity is particularly necessary for multicomponent, complex behavioral interventions because of their higher likelihood of deviation from the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Few studies conduct concurrent fidelity assessment as opposed to retrospective. Concurrent process evaluations are important as they can capture implementation experiences in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By building in the collection of fidelity measures and moderating factors in CHORD implementation, this study seeks to address this gap in the literature. Moreover, the study responds to the general calls for conducting quantitative evaluations of fidelity in intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the logic model for the CHORD intervention. Evidence supports engagement of CHWs by safety net primary care practices for improving health, knowledge, behaviors and outcomes for underserved communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The CHORD CHWs deliver evidence-based lifestyle interventions known to prevent DM among people with prediabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. CHWs are trusted members of the community who share lived experience and are familiar with community resources and norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Culturally congruent CHWs can bridge gaps between communities and health care systems to facilitate positive behavioral and lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The evidence-based lifestyle interventions implemented in CHORD were based on guidelines from the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) with a focus on healthy eating and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. People with prediabetes who participated in such a structured lifestyle change program reduced their risk of DM by 58% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Logic Model and the Theory of Change of the CHORD Intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2023_15477_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par22">CHORD is a complex behavioral intervention, where CHWs facilitate patients’ adoption of guideline-based lifestyle changes by using four behavioral intervention components: patient goal setting; education topic coaching; facilitating primary care (PC) visits; and referrals to address social determinants of health (SDH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We assessed fidelity to these four behavioral intervention components and examined factors affecting implementation fidelity using the Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity (CFIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The overarching purpose of this analysis is to inform researchers and program implementors about the level of fidelity achievable of an intervention such as CHORD in the context it was implemented.</p>

                <title>Trial participants and description</title>
                <p id="Par23">The CHORD trial’s priority population was patients with prediabetes receiving care at two PC clinics, the Manhattan campus of the VA NY Harbor Healthcare System (VA), and Bellevue Hospital Center (BH) of New York City’s municipal hospital system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Protocol details have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This study was approved by the New York University Langone Health and the Veterans Affairs Institutional Review Boards and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03006666) on 30/12/2016. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants in the study. All the procedures were followed in accordance with the relevant guidelines (eg. Declaration of Helsinki) along with the rest of the ethical declarations. Findings were reported in accordance with the StaRI checklist for implementation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par24">Briefly, all PC clinicians within each site were randomized to intervention or usual care. Eligible patients were seen by one of the study clinicians (at least 1 PC visit in the past 2 years at the VA or at least 3 PC visits in the past 2 years at BH), were between ages 18–75 years, had ≥ 1 glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 5.7–6.4% at baseline, no prior DM diagnosis, and ability to communicate in English or Spanish. Two CHWs, members of the study team assigned to each site, consented and enrolled eligible intervention patients, who then completed an intake survey, and began a 12-month intervention during which at least monthly encounters were planned between the CHW and patient. The two CHWs at each site made up to ten attempts to call and enroll each intervention group patient. A successful encounter was defined as when the CHW was able to speak with the patient in-person or by phone, or when a letter or a text message was delivered (no evidence of failure to deliver was apparent). During these encounters, CHWs delivered one or more of four core intervention components.</p>

                <title>Implementation of CHORD behavioral components</title>
                <p id="Par25">In the first component, CHWs established individualized goals with each patient and completed a 6-item, Patient Activation Measure (PAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These goals were then translated into a health action plan (HAP) tailored to each patients’ goals, PAM score, and preferences. Second, using the HAP, CHWs chose among 22 educational topics organized into 5 modules (prediabetes, healthful eating, MyPlate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and plate portions, physical activity, and stages of change) to conduct education sessions with patients, and provide information packets. Third, CHWs called or met patients before and/or after PC visits to encourage them to discuss diabetes prevention with their clinician or to review their after-visit summaries regarding diabetes. Finally, CHWs facilitated referrals as needed to hospital or community-based programs to help support behavioral change or address identified social needs.</p>

                <p id="Par28">Data on the CFIR implementation fidelity elements identified above were collected from the start of the CHORD trial (December 2017) until October 2019, using standardized Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] forms completed by CHWs for each patient to record their demographics, information on outreach, enrollment, and intake, and weekly logs on encounters.

                <p id="Par33">Fidelity measures of coverage, content and dose were reported using applicable descriptive statistics including percentage for categorical variables or median with inter-quartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous or count variables. To evaluate fidelity moderation, we computed unadjusted <italic>p</italic>-values from Chi-square or Mann–Whitney U test and adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values from regression models that controlled for patient gender, language, race, ethnicity and age. To assess moderation by PAM score, we dichotomized the score as above or below the median score. As a sensitivity analysis, we also compared patients with a total maximal score of 24 vs. &lt; 24. The first regression models treated PAM score as the primary independent variable, and the second set treated clinical site as the primary independent variable. Each set of models included separate models for each fidelity measure as the dependent variable. Logistic regression models were used for binary measures of coverage and content adherence (received or not received the intervention component). Linear regression models were used for fidelity measures of dosage that were continuous, and negative binomial regression models were used to model the fidelity measure of dosage that was a count variable.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par40">In the CHORD study, we hypothesized that trained CHWs, through individualized goal setting, educational coaching, and facilitated referrals, would support positive lifestyle changes and prevent the onset of diabetes among patients with prediabetes. However, an intervention may not affect lifestyle change if it deviates from its protocol during implementation. In this concurrent process evaluation of the CHORD intervention, we examined implementation fidelity and fidelity moderators. Our analysis demonstrated moderate to high (depending on intervention component) rates of implementation fidelity of CHORD, and moderation by implementation site. The level of implementation fidelity achieved in this intervention is likely to be sufficient to justify inferences drawn about the impact of the intervention on the outcomes. However, with less than 100% adherence and the variability observed in these components, as is likely common in complex behavioral interventions, the analysis of CHORD outcomes will provide an opportunity to explore the relative importance and impact of each of these components, accounting for their degree of implementation fidelity. Our use of quantitative methods for fidelity assessment will allow us to use these measures in outcome data analyses to determine the role of fidelity in observed outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">We found that CHWs completed an intake with nearly 80% of the patients enrolled in the intervention arm, and three of the four core components (goal setting, education and PC visits) were delivered to nearly 80% of the patients. Even though coverage and content adherence were moderate to high, there was high variability in the dosage. While the fourth core component in our intervention, referrals for social determinants of health and promoting access to healthy lifestyle choices, was delivered to only 45% of the patients, a quarter received 3 or more referrals. As referrals were designed to be tailored to each patient’s circumstance, the dosage of referrals cannot be directly associated with outcomes as more referrals are not necessarily better. Further, we do not know if the remaining 55% patients who did not receive a referral needed one.. We strived to deliver all core components for each patient, but we had not established, a priori, thresholds for adherence for core components among study participants. Our analysis explores the extent to which we attained implementation success as measured by percent of patients for which the core components were delivered. An implementation fidelity analyses of a randomized trial delivering a complex care continuum intervention for frail elderly people in Sweden also reported high variability in the adherence to intervention components. On a 4-point scale (never, seldom, sometimes, often, always), while most components were reported to be ‘always’ delivered, several were only ‘seldom’ delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In another study implementing a program to promote care aide involvement in formal team communications about resident care, the adherence was comparable to our study. Nearly 63% of the units participated in all three workshops and nearly 80% of the units participating were delivered the inter-team activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, some measures were higher than our study – 93% of the units in this trial completed goal setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In another trial implementing a complex behavior change intervention to enable participants living with long-term musculoskeletal pain to improve their quality of lives, although the median score on adherence to components ranged from 1.67 to 2.00 on a scale of 0 to 2.00, overall course score of 2.00 showed 100% adherence to these components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Higher fidelity in interventions such as those targeting pain can be explained by the nature of the intervention. According to CFIR, the relative advantage of the intervention plays a key role in implementation success: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] “If users perceive a clear, unambiguous advantage in effectiveness or efficiency of the innovation, it is more likely the implementation will be successful….benefits of the innovation must be clearly visible (observable) to assess relative advantage” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The benefits of our intended outcome, diabetes prevention in patients with pre-diabetes, are more intangible and hence could have reduced patients’ motivation to participate fully in the intervention components.</p>
              <p id="Par42">We assessed the role of patient motivation in our study by examining moderation of fidelity measures by PAM score. Null findings on moderation by PAM score was unexpected because patient activation measured by PAM scores has been found to be positively associated with engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors and exhibiting readiness to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. PAM score at intake might be limited in its representation of the concept of ‘participant responsiveness’ as defined in the CFIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patient activation might not be directly associated with the perception of patients about the effectiveness of an intervention in improving health, even though they value health. Finally, using an adapted, shortened version of the PAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], may not have fully measured this construct of activation.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The pragmatic nature of the CHORD trial permitted and promoted continuous adaptations. While this improved the meaningfulness of our intervention, it resulted in deviations from the original intervention protocol, decreasing fidelity. We adapted implementation in response to ongoing developments and situations. For example, the recruitment and follow-up process changed significantly after BH adopted a new EHR system in the second year of the CHORD trial. Provider communication and follow-up was adapted to align with their work schedule. In five cases, CHWs delivered education sessions before establishing goals as an engagement strategy to demonstrate how the intervention could be useful and encourage patients to set goals. In addition, the number of patients with a successful encounter was less than the number of patients who completed at least one goal or the number of patients who received coaching on at least one education topic. This occurred because for some patients, CHWs completed intake, established goals and provided some education in the same intake visit, but were unable to follow-up with the patient after repeated attempts, resulting in patients with goals and education but few successful encounters. The median number of successful encounters was 5 and about 10% patients had 12 or more successful encounters. As the CHORD protocol planned at least monthly contacts between a CHW and patient, these findings suggest that CHWs divided their time between meeting motivated patients less frequently and checking-in more frequently with patients who perhaps had more complex social needs. All these adaptations could have impacted our fidelity. Future analysis will focus on sharing these adaptations or natural deviations in implementation of a pragmatic trial.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Our finding of moderation by the implementation site underscores the need to account for site-based differences in patient characteristics such as their social risk profiles, when implementing evidence-based interventions. Although BH and VA are both safety-net settings, they differ in terms of their patient populations.BH is the flagship of New York City’s large, municipal hospital system, and serves a diverse, multicultural and multilingual population with high numbers of poor and racial/ethnic minorities, many of whom are uninsured or on Medicaid. VA NY Harbor is smaller, and provides care to veterans (mostly older, White, male, and English speakers) and is funded federally. Variation in the complexity of patient populations have historically necessitated innovation, and the differences in fidelity at the two sites could be reflecting such adaptations by CHWs to meet the needs of their patient populations. Earlier studies have found different implementation fidelity across different organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], without any impact on outcome differences at patient-level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These findings, including ours, suggest that an effective implementation fidelity might be based on the local organization’s conditions and therefore might require implementors to consider local adaptations when scaling-up evidence-based behavioral interventions. It is also important to note that, while our use of implementation site to measure ‘context’ reflects different healthcare ecosystems in terms of the patients served, neither of these clinical sites nor the scope of our analysis fully measures ‘context’ as conceptualized in the CFIF. A comprehensive assessment of patients’ social environments is an important consideration in a CHW-led intervention such as CHORD, which relies on patients’ achieving behavior change in the conditions of their everyday lives.</p>
              <p id="Par45">These differences in patient populations at the two sites could also explain the different participation rates at the two sites. Utilizing CHWs as a healthcare workforce is an equity-oriented approach to improving healthcare access and health outcomes among underserved populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Given their purpose, training and demographic composition (belonging to racial-ethnic minority groups), it is not surprising that the patients who enrolled in our CHW-led intervention were more likely to be Spanish speaking, Black, Hispanic, and seeking care at Bellevue hospital – these population subgroups have historically been excluded or marginalized from healthcare systems and face challenges in accessing resources to live a healthy life. Our CHWs were also either black or Hispanic, and those at the VA were veterans.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p id="Par46">First, as a pragmatic trial, the CHORD implementation did not start or end on fixed days, because CHWs maintained continued contacts with their patients. As a result, some interventions, such as referrals, were delivered outside of the intervention period. We included them in this analysis if they were recorded by CHWs. Second, fidelity measures can be intervention specific. Therefore, the measures used in this study might not directly translate to other complex interventions. Third, one important aspect of implementation is how well the participants engage with the intervention. In our study, while we measured the delivery of core components from the perspective of CHWs, we could not assess the extent to which delivered interventions were received by patients. Fourth, with two CHWs per site, differences in approach and skill by the CHWs, despite their uniform training and monitoring, may have contributed to the differences by site. Fifth, with four CHWs, we did not have enough variation in race/ethnicity to track patient enrollment by the concordance of their race/ethnicity with that of CHWs’. Sixth, we report fidelity measures across the three waves of CHORD implementation, but do not examine changes in fidelity over time. Finally, while we report on fidelity delivery, our study did not measure fidelity receipt or fidelity enactment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or assess qualitative aspects of fidelity, such as the quality of goal setting or the comprehensiveness of education sessions beyond the coverage of the required education modules.</p>

Moreover, the study responds to the general calls for conducting quantitative evaluations of fidelity in intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Use of real time data reported by the key implementors, the CHWs, adds to the validity of our analysis. Lastly, our study empirically tested the CFIF and found that the framework is a useful tool for conceptualizing and organizing measures of fidelity and their moderators. However, our process evaluation suggests that to standardize quantitative fidelity assessments, the field will benefit from further guidance on “how-to” quantitatively measure fidelity moderators.</p>

Analyses of implementation fidelity of complex interventions such as this trial, advances the field of implementation science.
