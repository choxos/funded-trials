                  <p>To determine the longer-term effects of metformin treatment and behavioral weight loss on gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).</p>

                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>We conducted a 3-parallel-arm, randomized trial. We enrolled overweight/obese adults who had been treated for solid tumors but had no ongoing cancer treatment and randomized them (<italic>n</italic> = 121) to either <italic>1</italic>) metformin (up to 2,000 mg), <italic>2</italic>) coach-directed behavioral weight loss, or <italic>3</italic>) self-directed care (control) for 12 months. We collected stool and serum at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 114), 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 109), and 12 months (<italic>n</italic> = 105). From stool, we extracted microbial DNA and conducted amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. We measured SCFAs and other biochemical parameters from fasting serum.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Of the 121 participants, 79% were female and 46% were Black, and the mean age was 60 years. Only metformin treatment significantly altered microbiota composition. Compared with control, metformin treatment increased amplicon sequence variants for <italic>Escherichia</italic> (confirmed as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by metagenomic sequencing) and <italic>Ruminococcus torques</italic> and decreased <italic>Intestinibacter bartlettii</italic> at both 6 and 12 months and decreased the genus <italic>Roseburia</italic>, including <italic>R. faecis</italic> and <italic>R. intestinalis,</italic> at 12 months. Effects were similar in comparison of the metformin group with the behavioral weight loss group. Metformin versus control also increased butyrate, acetate, and valerate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Behavioral weight loss versus control did not significantly alter microbiota composition but did increase acetate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Increases in acetate were associated with decreases in fasting insulin. Additional whole-genome metagenomic sequencing of a subset of the metformin group showed that metformin altered 62 metagenomic functional pathways, including an acetate-producing pathway and three pathways in glucose metabolism.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>Metformin, but not behavioral weight loss, impacted gut microbiota composition at 6 months and 12 months. Both metformin and behavioral weight loss altered circulating SCFAs at 6 months, including increasing acetate, which correlated with lower fasting insulin. Future research is needed to elucidate whether the gut microboime mediates or modifies metformin’s health effects.</p>

              <p content-type="flushleft">Emerging evidence indicates that the biologic effects of metformin, the most commonly used glucose-lowering drug worldwide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), originate in the intestine. The intestine is the primary reservoir for metformin, with accumulation in the jejunum 30–300 times that of the plasma (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). When metformin is administered intravenously, bypassing the intestine, it does not lower glucose (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, a delayed-release oral metformin, that delivers the drug to the lower bowel with lower plasma exposure, has a greater glucose-lowering effect than extended-release metformin, providing further evidence for gut-mediated mechanisms of metformin (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>The gut-mediated health effects of metformin may specifically stem from alterations in the gut microbiota. Following a seminal study by Cabreiro et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), which demonstrated that metformin extends the life span of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> by altering folate and methionine production by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, cross-sectional studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), single-arm studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and a short-term trial (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have provided evidence that metformin impacts gut microbiota composition. In particular, human studies have shown that metformin consistently increases the abundance of <italic>E. coli</italic> and decreases <italic>Intestinibacter bartlettii</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In mice, broad-spectrum antibiotics abrogate metformin’s microbial effect (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). There is also evidence that metformin increases short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in humans (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Yet, an outstanding and salient question for research and clinical applications is whether metformin’s effects on the microbiome and SCFAs are transient or persist long-term and whether they play a role in metformin’s health effects.</p>
              <p>We conducted a randomized trial to examine the effects of metformin treatment and the effects of behavioral weight loss on gut microbiota composition and SCFAs over 12 months in overweight and obese adults. We hypothesized that consistent with findings of shorter-term trials, long-term metformin treatment alters gut microbiota composition by increasing the abundance of <italic>E. coli</italic> and decreasing <italic>I. bartlettii</italic>, resulting in increased circulating SCFAs. We compared participants randomized to metformin with <italic>1</italic>) participants randomized to a self-directed care arm (control) and <italic>2</italic>) participants randomized to a behavioral weight loss arm. The latter comparison allowed us to examine whether metformin’s effects differed from the effects of behavioral weight loss, which we hypothesized would also alter microbiome composition and circulating SCFAs, consistent with results of similar prior research (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>

From August 2015 through December 2016, we recruited, from the Baltimore metropolitan area, overweight or obese adults (BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who had a history of a malignant solid tumor diagnosis and completed cancer treatment &gt;3 months prior to enrollment. The major exclusion criteria were medication-treated diabetes, nonfasting blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L or HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥7%, current or prior regular use of metformin within the past 3 months, and significant renal disease or dysfunction, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;45 mL/min. Eligibility was determined by Web, phone, and in-person contacts (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
                <p>We enrolled 121 participants and randomized them to one of 3 arms: <italic>1</italic>) metformin treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 42), 2) coach-directed behavioral weight loss (<italic>n</italic> = 39), and 3) self-directed care (control group) (<italic>n</italic> = 40).

The enrollment process involved a telephone contact, an in-person visit during which we collected baseline data, and a second in-person visit at which we notified participants of their assigned group. We asked participants to make in-person follow-up visits 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. At each of these visits, we measured weight on a high-quality, calibrated digital scale, with the participant wearing light, indoor clothes and no shoes. We measured height once at study entry.

Extracted DNA was quantified with the Quant-iT High-Sensitivity dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). PCR amplification was performed with the Thermo Phusion Hot Start II DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1–10 ng extracted DNA. Samples were denatured for 2 min at 98°C, after which were 30 cycles of the following: 98°C for 20 s, 55°C for 15 s, 72°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 10 min. After PCR, libraries were prepared with use of the standard operating procedures described by Kozich et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Ten µL PCR product was used to normalize the SequalPrep Normalization Prep Plate Kit (cat. no. A1051001; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to 1–2 ng/µL, and 5 µL was pooled from each normalized sample into a single library per 96-well plate. The DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator Kit (cat. no. D4013; Zymo Research) was used to concentrate library pools. For quality control steps, a dilution series for each pooled library was first performed and the Agilent bioanalyzer and high-sensitivity dsDNA assay (cat. no. 5047-4626) was used to analyze approximate fragment size and verify library integrity. The QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN; cat. no. 28706) was used to purify pools with unintended amplicons. The KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (cat. no KK4824) was used to determine pooled library concentrations. Library pools were diluted to 4 nmol/L and denatured with 2.0 N NaOH. Pools were loaded at 8 pmol/L with a PhiX spike-in of 20%. The 16S rRNA V4 region of purified libraries was then paired-end sequenced with the 500-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit (cat. no. MS-102-2003; Illumina, San Diego, CA) with use of an Illumina MiSeq and primers and sample-specific barcode demultiplexing as described by Kozich et al.

Following inspection of aggregate positional sequence quality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14340419">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>), we trimmed forward and reverse reads before position 15 and after position 220 (5′ and 3′ ends, respectively) to omit severe drops in quality due to end effects. We applied filters to remove individual reads from the data set if they contained any Ns, mapped to any part of the PhiX genome, or were predicted based on quality values to have a maximum expected error &gt;2 (filterAndTrim function).</p>

                  <p>We calculated error model estimation on a randomly selected subset of ∼1 million bases from the run using the learnErrors function. We applied this aggregate model to every sample during final pooled amplicon sequence denoising via the dada function with other parameters set to default values. We performed pooled chimera detection and removal via the removeBimeraDenovo function (5153525 nonchimeric sequences out of 7108481 merged denoised sequences [∼72.5%]). We classified the taxonomy of each ASV independently via SINTAX using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP), version 16, of the 16S rRNA gene sequence database (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) as distributed on the USEARCH website.

                  <p content-type="flushleft">To further characterize metformin effects on microbiome species and function, we selected a subsample of eight participants in the metformin arm who were able to tolerate at least 500 mg/day metformin at the 6-month visit and were matched on sex (four male, four female), and we performed whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing on their stool samples collected at baseline and the 6-month visit. Shotgun sequencing was done on the same samples with Illumina NextSeq technology. Approximately 18.64 gigabases (Gbases) were generated with 150 × 2 paired-end reads. Each sample yielded a median of 1.03 Gbases. After sequencing, reads were separated according to the barcode used in the library preparation. Initial quality evaluation was done with FastQC, version 0.11.5. Processing took place in three steps: paired-end read joining, removing of contaminants, and trimming. Paired-end reads were joined with use of FLASH, version 1.2.11 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Reads that mapped to the human genome were removed. Finally, sequences were trimmed according to their quality values with Trimmomatic, version 0.36, using custom parameters (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Joining the paired reads reduced the library size by 24.5%. Approximately 0.18% of the stitched reads mapped to the human genome and were removed. Read trimming using quality filters removed 6.03% of the screened reads. At the end of quality control, the median number of quality-filtered reads per sample was 563,328. Spearman correlations between microbiome signatures identified by shotgun and 16S rRNA sequencing were high: genera, range 0.52–0.99; species, 0.72–0.91; and α-diversity metrics, 0.63–0.66.</p>

Quantitation was performed with a weighted least squares regression analysis generated from fortified calibration standards prepared immediately prior to each run. SCFA data below or above the limit of quantitation were extrapolated beyond the lower or upper limit of quantitation. Coefficients of variation were all below &lt;7%.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p content-type="flushleft">In our randomized trial of racially diverse overweight and obese cancer survivors, metformin affected long-term gut microbiota composition, increasing <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>R. torques</italic> and decreasing <italic>I. bartlettii</italic> and <italic>R. intestinalis</italic> at 6 and 12 months postrandomization. The effects of metformin on <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>I. bartlettii</italic>, and <italic>R. intestinalis</italic> were consistent in comparisons with effects among subjects in the self-directed control arm (who did not lose weight) and the behavioral weight loss arm (who lost an amount of weight similar to that of the metformin arm), suggesting that the metformin effects are independent of weight loss. Metformin also altered 62 functional pathways, including acetate production and glucose metabolism, and increased serum SCFAs butyrate, acetate, and valerate at 6 months, but these SCFA effects did not persist at 12 months. Coach-directed behavioral weight loss, which resulted in a mean loss of 3.5 and 2.7 kg at 6 and 12 months, respectively, had negligible effects on the gut microbiome and increased acetate at 6 months but not 12 months.</p>
              <p>Our results add to multiple lines of evidence (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) suggesting that the provenance of metformin’s physiologic effects may derive from changes in gut microbiota. Notably, our trial shows that metformin affects microbiota composition over 12 months of treatment. Our finding that metformin advantages <italic>E. coli</italic> growth and disadvantages <italic>I. bartlettii</italic> is consistent with findings of cross-sectional studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), single-armed trials (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and one short-term randomized trial (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Functional analysis of <italic>I. bartlettii</italic>, formerly known as <italic>Clostridium bartlettii</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), shows that it is able to degrade fucose, hinting at indirect involvement in mucus degradation. Interestingly, consistent with the pattern seen in our study, pigs susceptible to colonization by enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia</italic> spp. had lower abundance of <italic>I. bartlettii</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In a recent flux balance analysis, <italic>I. bartlettii</italic> was associated with substantial (&gt;50%) alterations in propionate metabolism, whereas in the same study <italic>E. coli</italic> was associated with substantial (&gt;50%) alterations in butyrate and vitamin B2 metabolism. <italic>Escherichia</italic> spp. have also been linked with pathway changes in lipopolysaccharide production among other pathways (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Most recently, using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in participants from three separate cohort studies, Vila et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) found that <italic>E. coli</italic> was the major contributor to the functional changes associated with metformin use.</p>
              <p>Pertinent to our findings on metformin and SCFAs, Forslund et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) demonstrated enhanced butyrate and propionate production potential in metformin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes. This finding was corroborated by a trial by Wu et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), who found that metformin increased fecal concentrations of butyrate and propionate in men over 6 weeks. Zhernakova et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) also observed higher fecal SCFAs, namely, propionate, in 15 metformin users compared with 9 nonusers. Our findings extend this work, showing that metformin increases SCFA-producing <italic>R. torques</italic>, increases SCFA-production pathways, and impacts serum acetate and butyrate at 6 months. However, the effect of metformin on these SCFAs was diminished at 12 months. The cause of the waning effect on SCFAs, and its relevance to health, requires more research. We postulate that it may be due to compensatory use of SCFAs as alternative fuel during prolonged negative energy balance (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
              <p>Of note, we observed that increases in serum acetate correlated with reductions in fasting insulin. This finding is consistent with prior research (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), including ours (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and the pathways through which acetate influences insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism are a topic of active investigation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In our study, we also found that metformin-induced increases in <italic>E. coli</italic> correlated with increases in serum acetate along with decreases in fasting insulin, raising the possibility that specific <italic>E. coli</italic> strains may increase acetate production and, in turn, improve insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, acetate was increased and insulin was decreased at 6 months in the behavioral weight loss arm, suggesting that these concomitant changes may not be unique to the microbial effects of metformin.</p>
              <p>Unlike in other studies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), baseline abundance of <italic>E. coli</italic> or change in abundance of <italic>E. coli</italic> was not associated with diarrhea in our study. Forslund et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) found that metformin enriched virulence factors and gas metabolism genes attributable to increased <italic>Escherichia</italic>. We did, however, find that metformin decreased <italic>I. bartlettii</italic>, which is folate spore forming and resistant to stomach acid. Future trials are needed to determine whether giving <italic>I. bartlettii</italic> as a probiotic in conjunction with metformin could reduce gastrointestinal side effects (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>
              <p>There are numerous strengths of our trial. Our randomized trial is the largest and longest randomized trial of metformin on the gut microbiome, and it is the first trial to examine the effects of metformin on the microbiome and SCFAs beyond 6 months. Other strengths are that we enrolled a diverse population, with 46% Black participants, and we had a high retention rate. Our study also has limitations. Approximately 30% of participants randomized to metformin reported that they were not able to tolerate the drug at the follow-up visits. The primary reason why participants were not able to tolerate metformin was gastrointestinal side effects, which is consistent with the literature: that up to 30% of treatment-naïve individuals experience have digestive disorders (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Including these participants in our primary analysis likely attenuated the effects, as evidenced by analyses restricted to participants on metformin who took at least 500 mg/day. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the results may not generalize to a noncancer population, although the mean interval between end of cancer treatment and trial start date for participants enrolled was ∼9 years and thus the influence of cancer treatment on gut microbiota is likely minimal—if there is any at all. Also, our population had a high average BMI and did not have type 2 diabetes; research is needed to determine whether the results generalize to participants with lower body weight and dysregulated insulin. Finally, the negligible effects of our behavioral weight loss intervention on the gut microbiota may be due to lack of extreme diet modification or to a long-term resilience of the microbiota despite changes in diet and weight, as recently observed (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We also cannot rule out that smaller effects were missed because of limited statistical power.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, results from our randomized trial extend evidence about the longer-term effects of metformin and modest behavioral weight loss on gut microbiota and serum SCFAs. Consistent with prior shorter-term trials, metformin altered gut microbiota composition—increasing <italic>E. coli</italic> and decreasing <italic>I. bartlettii</italic>—at 6 and 12 months of follow-up and these effects were distinct from behavioral weight loss, which had negligible effects on microbiota in our trial. Moreover, the increases in <italic>E. coli</italic> were correlated with increases in serum acetate, which correlated with decreases in fasting insulin, suggesting that microbiota changes may play a role in metformin’s effect on insulin regulation. Whether heterogeneity in microbial effects corresponds to long-term clinical outcomes is still unknown and should be investigated in larger studies. Nevertheless, our study helps to elucidate the biologic mechanisms by which metformin affects health outcomes and identifies microbes that could be future targets for the prevention of metabolic disorders or gastrointestinal symptoms known to affect drug tolerability.</p>
