              <abstract>
                <p>Although intensive glycemic control improves outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), iatrogenic hypoglycemia limits its attainment. Recurrent and/or antecedent hypoglycemia causes blunting of protective counterregulatory responses, known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF). To determine whether and how opioid receptor activation induces HAAF in humans, 12 healthy subjects without diabetes (7 men, age 32.3 ± 2.2 years, BMI 25.1 ± 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in two study protocols in random order over two consecutive days. On day 1, subjects received two 120-min infusions of either saline or morphine (0.1 μg/kg/min), separated by a 120-min break (all euglycemic). On day 2, subjects underwent stepped hypoglycemic clamps (nadir 60 mg/dL) with evaluation of counterregulatory hormonal responses, endogenous glucose production (EGP, using 6,6-D2-glucose), and hypoglycemic symptoms. Morphine induced an ∼30% reduction in plasma epinephrine response together with reduced EGP and hypoglycemia-associated symptoms on day 2. Therefore, we report the first studies in humans demonstrating that pharmacologic opioid receptor activation induces some of the clinical and biochemical features of HAAF, thus elucidating the individual roles of various receptors involved in HAAF’s development and suggesting novel pharmacologic approaches for safer intensive glycemic control in T1DM.</p>

              <p>Intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has been clearly shown to reduce many diabetes-associated complications, and thus achievement of near-normal glycemia is an important management goal (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, despite clear clinical benefits, intensive therapy is associated with an increased risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, with a threefold increase in severe hypoglycemia reported in the intensively treated group in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and even higher rates reported more recently among patients with T1DM by the U.K. Hypoglycemia Study Group (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite medical advances in diabetes management, the problem of iatrogenic hypoglycemia has not been ameliorated (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and remains both a clinical challenge and a costly public health problem. Indeed, there are an estimated nearly 100,000 emergency department visits and 30,000 hospital admissions for insulin-related hypoglycemia yearly in the U.S. alone (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, hypoglycemia per se causes morbidity and may even be fatal, with 6–10% of deaths in patients with T1DM attributed directly to hypoglycemic events (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>Patients with T1DM are at particular risk of frequent hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin treatment because they demonstrate blunted hormonal counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, it has been well established in both subjects without diabetes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and those with T1DM (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) that stressors such as recurrent hypoglycemia or exercise lead to blunting of protective glucagon and sympathoadrenomedullary counterregulatory responses as well as deterioration of hypoglycemia awareness and recovery, conditions known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and exercise-associated autonomic failure (EAAF), respectively (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although the exact mechanisms underlying the development of HAAF and EAAF have not been fully elucidated, central nervous system (CNS) signals mediating the counterregulatory response have been implicated in its pathogenesis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Robust data point to a key role of the endogenous opioid system in the development of HAAF and EAAF. Many kinds of stressors, including hypoglycemia and exercise, precipitate release of endogenous opioids, such as β-endorphin, that can mediate autonomic and sympathoadrenomedullary responses in humans and animals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>In fact, it has been proposed that HAAF and EAAF may represent a form of stress habituation to recurrent hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), possibly as a defensive adaptation, particularly since most features of HAAF are reversible after a 2–3-week period of scrupulous hypoglycemia avoidance (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). One can speculate that this may have been an evolutionary protective mechanism during times of famine or prolonged exercise. Furthermore, opioid receptor blockade with naloxone infusion during experimental hypoglycemia prevents the development of HAAF in subjects without diabetes and ameliorates HAAF in subjects with T1DM (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similarly, naloxone infusion during antecedent exercise prevents development of EAAF in humans without diabetes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and the magnitude of β-endorphin release during exercise is inversely correlated with catecholamine release during subsequent hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that central release of endogenous opioids during hypoglycemia or exercise may suppress the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia. However, the fact that naloxone has therapeutic effects in HAAF and EAAF does not provide conclusive evidence that opioid action underlies these conditions. Thus, detailed mechanistic studies clarifying the importance of the opioidergic system in the development of HAAF are warranted. We therefore examined whether pharmacologic activation of μ-opioid receptors with morphine over a time course comparable to a bout of hypoglycemia or exercise would precipitate HAAF in humans.</p>

                <p>We studied 12 healthy volunteers without diabetes (7 men, 5 women, age 32.3 ± 2.2 years, BMI 25.1 ± 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 5.4 ± 0.1%). All were in good health and taking no medications and had no history of hypoglycemia or family history of diabetes. Each subject participated in two different sets of studies, in random order, with an interval of at least 5 weeks between studies. All studies were performed after an overnight fast. Each set of studies consisted of two consecutive days. Day 1 in each set consisted of two 120-min infusions of either normal saline (control) or morphine (0.1 µg/kg/min), separated by a 120-min break during which subjects received a small snack (15 g of carbohydrate). Subjects remained euglycemic throughout day 1 in all studies. Continuous cardiac monitoring, respiratory monitoring, and capnography to monitor the partial pressure of expired carbon dioxide were used throughout all day 1 studies (Waveline EZ Monitor with Sidestream CO2 Sensor; DRE Med, Louisville, KY). Day 2 was identical in all studies and consisted of a hyperinsulinemic stepped hypoglycemic clamp, with quantification of hormonal responses and glucose kinetics. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and informed written consent was obtained in accordance with the Institutional Review Board policy. Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Center for each experiment.</p>

                <p>At 0800 h on the study day, all subjects had two indwelling catheters inserted. One was placed in an antecubital vein for infusions, and the second was placed in a retrograde fashion in a distal hand vein of the contralateral forearm for blood sampling.

                  <p>To determine to what extent opioid receptor activation is responsible for the etiology of HAAF, the peak epinephrine responses to morphine were compared with the peak epinephrine responses to three episodes of hypoglycemia per se in an additional <italic>n</italic> = 6 healthy control subjects without diabetes (6 men, age 45.0 ± 7.1 years, BMI 25.6 ± 2.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), following a study design previously reported to induce hypoglycemia-induced elevations in β-endorphins and HAAF (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). On day 1, the subjects underwent two 2-h episodes of hyperinsulinemic (∼1.5 mU/kg ⋅ min) hypoglycemic (target glucose 54 mg/dL) clamp studies, separated by a 2-h break with a small snack. This was followed by a third, comparable hypoglycemic episode on day 2. Respective peak epinephrine levels were 1,005 ± 292 pg/mL for the first clamp, 859 ± 226 pg/mL for the second clamp, and 542 ± 220 pg/mL for the third clamp, demonstrating a significant reduction in peak epinephrine concentrations during the third versus the first hypoglycemic clamp (<italic>P</italic> = 0.039). Therefore, whereas morphine administration on day 1 caused an ∼30% reduction in epinephrine concentrations during mild hypoglycemia on day 2, two episodes of moderate hypoglycemia on day 1 caused an ∼45% decrease in epinephrine concentrations during moderate hypoglycemia on day 2. Collectively, these studies suggest that opioid receptors play a significant role in the development of HAAF. However, opioid receptor activation likely does not explain the entire phenomenon, and it is also possible that pharmacologic effects of morphine have contributed to the current findings.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite many recent therapeutic advancements in the management of T1DM, including the development of insulin analogs, insulin pumps, and continuous glucose monitoring, maintaining near-normal glycemia remains an elusive goal for most patients, in large part owing to the risk of hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Patients with T1DM are susceptible to hypoglycemia due to defective counterregulatory responses characterized by the following: <italic>1</italic>) deficient glucagon release during impending/early hypoglycemia; <italic>2</italic>) HAAF and EAAF that blunt the sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia after repeated episodes or exercise as well as diminishing other counterregulatory responses; and <italic>3</italic>) hypoglycemia unawareness, lowering the threshold for symptoms that trigger behavioral responses (e.g., eating). Thus, the risk of hypoglycemia in T1DM impedes the use of ideal insulin treatment and leads to suboptimal glycemic control (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>We therefore designed these studies to better understand the physiologic or maladaptive mechanisms whereby HAAF develops, specifically through the activation of opioid receptors. These studies provide data that antecedent morphine infusion can reproduce some of the key features of HAAF and EAAF in humans without diabetes. The morphine infusion rate was selected based upon the relative potency of morphine and β-endorphin for the opioid receptor (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), observed relationships between plasma morphine levels and intravenous infusion rates (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and plasma β-endorphin concentrations observed during hypoglycemia in humans (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Epinephrine responses at the lowest level of hypoglycemia (60 mg/dL) were blunted in healthy subjects who had received low-dose morphine infusions the day before the hypoglycemic clamp, compared with paired hypoglycemic clamps performed the day after normal saline infusion. Similarly, the glucose infusion rates required to maintain blood glucose levels at the target level during the 70 and 60 mg/dL glucose steps were higher after subjects had received morphine the day before the clamp.</p>
              <p>Assessment of hypoglycemic symptoms also revealed fewer symptoms at 60 mg/dL hypoglycemia on the day after morphine infusion. Taken together, these data support the ability of μ-opioid receptor activation with morphine to reproduce some key biochemical and clinical features of HAAF in humans without diabetes, and represents an important model through which mechanisms of autonomic failure may be studied in humans without inducing repeated episodes of hypoglycemia per se. Importantly, there were changes in EGP and glucose infusion rate that preceded the changes in hormone levels, suggesting that direct brain sensing of glucose regulates glucose production. This is consistent with our previous work indicating that activation of central K<sub>ATP</sub> channels directly regulates glucose production in humans (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, opioid receptor activation has allowed us to mimic stressors known to induce HAAF (i.e., hypoglycemia and exercise) while excluding the majority of factors associated with such stressors. Different mechanisms are likely involved in the regulation of catecholamine and glucagon release in response to hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Endogenous opioids are secreted by the proopiomelanocortin neurons of the pituitary gland (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) in response to a variety of stressors, including hypoglycemia and exercise (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). CNS signals that mediate the response to hypoglycemia may be of major importance in glucose counterregulation. In the CNS, opioids likely contribute to the development of HAAF via activation of opioid receptors localized to areas in the thalamus and hypothalamus responsible for glucose sensing, including the ventromedial hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, and dorsal medial thalamus (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Administration of an endogenous opioid (β-endorphin) directly into the rat brain was shown to inhibit hypothalamic responses to hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In parallel, accumulating evidence suggests that endogenous opioids produced peripherally by the adrenal medulla may lead to glucose lowering in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, both by increasing glucose uptake and decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Finally, various studies have demonstrated that β-endorphin can modulate glucose homeostasis by its action on insulin release (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In vitro, β-endorphin (which primarily targets μ-opioid receptors) inhibits insulin release from isolated islets (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and in vivo, β-endorphin also attenuates insulin release when administered by intravenous infusion (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>
              <p>The glucose-lowering effects of β-endorphin in a T1DM–like diabetic rat model are due to an increase in GLUT4 gene expression, leading to higher glucose utilization and decreased PEPCK gene expression, leading to a decline of hepatic gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that β-endorphin release from the adrenal gland is activated by α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>); phenylephrine stimulation caused an increase in β-endorphin concentrations, whereas α-antagonist administration resulted in a decrease in β-endorphin levels (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Endogenous opioids, in turn, induce suppression of catecholamine release from the adrenal gland, suggesting secretory negative feedback between adrenal catecholamine release and opioid secretion (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Importantly, this opioid effect on the adrenal medulla is reversed in vivo with naloxone administration (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that modulation of the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia occurs both centrally and peripherally and that the opioid system plays a pivotal role in both locations.</p>
              <p>Of note, these studies in human subjects were unable to determine the exact location(s) at which morphine acts in order to modulate hypoglycemia counterregulation. Furthermore, although morphine interacts predominantly with the μ-opioid receptor, it also may act as a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist. Thus, our results provide new insight into the role of the opioidergic system in the physiologic and clinical response to hypoglycemia in humans.</p>
              <p>Previous work in human subjects has demonstrated that opioid receptor blockade with naloxone results in modulation of HAAF/EAAF (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As this does not provide direct evidence that opioid action underlies HAAF, the current mechanistic studies elucidate a role for the opioidergic system as a target for therapy in HAAF. However, given that only some features of HAAF were recapitulated in healthy humans using opioid receptor activation, it is clear that other important pathways are involved in the development of the full spectrum of HAAF’s biochemical and clinical elements. Recent data show that adrenergic receptor blockade also prevents antecedent hypoglycemia’s ability to attenuate the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This is of particular interest since opioidergic and adrenergic receptors show close functional interactions. Both morphine and norepinephrine induce major inhibitory effects in brain neurons and peripherally by activating G protein–coupled receptors (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Additionally, heterodimerization of these receptors may activate common signal transduction pathways or confer them with new functional properties that are different from the original receptors (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Thus, isolating the role of the opioidergic system in HAAF should lay the foundation for further physiologic studies examining the other key receptors involved and their interactions in the development of HAAF.</p>
              <p>Although experimental HAAF has been shown to be prevented in healthy humans and improved in subjects with T1DM by acute administration of intravenous naloxone during antecedent hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), long-term administration of opioid receptor blockade and its effects on hypoglycemia counterregulation are still under investigation. Intriguingly, a recent pilot study in subjects with T1DM showed no effect of short-term oral naltrexone treatment on hypoglycemic symptoms or counterregulatory responses (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). At chronic low doses, naltrexone may have anti-inflammatory effects and result in an increase in opiate binding sites and thus supersensitivity to opioid agonists (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is also possible that differences in opioid responses or function secondary to long-standing T1DM may explain why opioid activation induced features of HAAF in healthy individuals in our studies, and long-term opioid antagonism did not reverse HAAF in patients with T1DM and impaired hypoglycemia awareness. This underscores the significance of the current studies of opioid agonists to clarify the opioid receptor’s specific contributions in HAAF. Larger studies of greater duration or clinical studies in which oral naltrexone is given acutely at the time of hypoglycemia will need to be performed to clarify the clinical role of opioid receptor antagonists in HAAF and to tailor effective therapies for HAAF.</p>
              <p>It is intriguing to consider the evolutionary pressures that might have promoted the development of HAAF in humans, and what teleologic advantage(s) it might confer. HAAF could have provided an adaptive mechanism of survival during times of famine or prolonged exercise to minimize the intense energy demands of mounting a full counterregulatory response to every drop in blood glucose level. Intriguingly, it has been shown that in patients with diabetes, treated with insulin, glucose uptake within the brain is increased during periods of hypoglycemia. Maintenance of CNS glucose concentrations may prevent systemic counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia, which may be considered a physiologically useful adaptation to preserve brain function in the presence of episodic hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p>
              <p>Thus, we report the first studies in humans demonstrating that pharmacologic opioid receptor activation can experimentally recapitulate some features of HAAF, without using stressors such as hypoglycemia or exercise to induce HAAF. These studies provide a model for studying HAAF in humans and offer a key step in elucidating the individual roles of various receptors in its development. A full understanding of the physiologic basis of HAAF is crucial to tailor appropriate therapies for patients with recurrent hypoglycemia.</p>
