              <p>Along with insulin therapy, intravenous fluid administration to expand intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular volume is a key component of the acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Saline (0.9% sodium chloride, also called<italic> normal saline</italic>) is the most commonly used fluid for this purpose and the primary fluid recommended in current DKA clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The chloride concentration in saline (154 mmol/L) is higher than that in human plasma (94-111 mmol/L), which can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, especially when administered in large volumes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Although the clinical outcomes of saline infusion remain incompletely understood, accumulating evidence suggests that saline may increase the risk of kidney injury and impair recovery from severe illness, possibly because of the induction of metabolic acidosis.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Balanced crystalloid solutions, including Ringer lactate and Plasma-Lyte A (Baxter Inc), contain chloride concentrations similar to those in human plasma and do not induce metabolic acidosis.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Therefore, treatment of DKA with balanced crystalloids rather than saline may lead to faster resolution of DKA.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, balanced crystalloids also have theoretical risks in the treatment of DKA, including alkalosis and hyperkalemia, and the comparative effects of balanced crystalloids and saline in this setting are not well understood.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In this subgroup analysis of 2 large pragmatic, cluster randomized clinical trials,<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> we compared balanced crystalloids vs saline for the acute management of adults with DKA.

Together, these trials enrolled 29 149 adult patients using broad eligibility criteria. In a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover design, patients were assigned balanced crystalloids (clinician’s choice of Ringer lactate solution or Plasma-Lyte A) vs saline according to calendar month (eFigure 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200810-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Clinicians were instructed to use the assigned fluid type for fluid administration when volume expansion, fluid resuscitation, or an isotonic or near-isotonic fluid was desired. Assigned fluid type was controlled by the trial protocol in the ED, ICUs, and operating rooms, but not on the general hospital floors. Fluid assignment was the same in the ED, medical ICU, trauma ICU, and surgical ICU. Fluid assignment in 2 ICUs that admitted a low number of ED patients (neurologic ICU and cardiac ICU) was opposite of the ED (ie, these ICUs were assigned to saline when the ED was assigned to balanced crystalloids); these ICUs on an opposite schedule compared with the ED were not included in this DKA subgroup analysis. Data were collected from the electronic medical record. Data on race, ethnicity, and sex were based on patient self-report. Patient race was categorized as White or non-White. The non-White category included 46 Black participants and 2 participants who self-reported their race as neither Black nor White.</p>

Recommended DKA management at the study hospital followed the American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement on the Management of Hyperglycemic Crises.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This included administration of insulin by continuous intravenous infusion (insulin drip) to patients with an anion gap greater than 12 mEq/L, measurement of electrolytes every 2 hours during active DKA management, and discontinuation of the insulin infusion and transition to subcutaneous insulin when the anion gap decreased to less than or equal to 12 mEq/L. Blood samples for electrolyte measurements were collected by clinical personnel in lithium heparin vacutainers, and plasma concentrations were measured in the clinical laboratory. By hospital policy, patients receiving a continuous insulin infusion were managed in the ED or an ICU. Patients with DKA in the ED who did not require continuous insulin infusion after admission could be admitted to a general hospital floor outside the ICU according to the treating clinician’s discretion.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution, defined as the time elapsed between ED presentation and resolution of ketoacidosis, using the following criteria for resolution of ketoacidosis from the American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement on Hyperglycemic Crises<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>—plasma glucose less than 200 mg/dL and 2 of the following: plasma bicarbonate greater than or equal to 15 mEq/L, venous pH greater than 7.3, and anion gap less than or equal to 12 mEq/L. Patients discharged from the hospital without meeting laboratory criteria for DKA resolution were classified as having DKA resolution at the time of hospital discharge.</p>
                <p>The secondary outcome was time to discontinuation of insulin infusion, defined as the time between initiation and final discontinuation of intravenous insulin infusion during the hospitalization for DKA. Patients who never had an insulin infusion started were coded as 0 for time to discontinuation of insulin infusion.

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The primary analytical approach was an intention-to-treat analysis comparing outcomes between patients assigned to balanced crystalloids vs those assigned to saline. Plasma electrolyte concentrations during the first 72 hours of care after ED presentation were compared between groups using a univariate generalized additive model smoothing function.</p>
                <p>Time to DKA resolution (primary outcome) included both right-censored data (death prior to DKA resolution) and left-censored data (DKA resolution defined by hospital discharge rather than laboratory criteria), and thus was analyzed using statistical methods for interval-censored outcomes. In an unadjusted analysis, a 2-sample weighted log-rank test was used to compare differences in cumulative incidence of DKA resolution between the balanced crystalloid group and saline group.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Next, time to DKA resolution was evaluated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model in which the covariance matrices for the regression coefficients were estimated via 1000 bootstrap replications.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The model included time to DKA resolution as the dependent variable, intervention group (balanced crystalloids vs saline) as the main independent variable, and the number of days elapsed between the beginning of the trial (January 1, 2016) and the patient’s ED presentation as a covariable. The trial included 1 cluster (all ED patients were on the same allocation schedule) and multiple periods. Hence, the model was not adjusted for clusters and was adjusted for period effects by including days elapsed since the beginning of the trial as a covariable.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Adjusted hazards ratios (aHRs) were reported with the saline group serving as the referent, with an aHR greater than 1 indicating shorter time to DKA resolution for the balanced crystalloids group.</p>
                <p>Time to discontinuation of insulin infusion (secondary outcome) included right-censored data (death prior to discontinuation). A Kaplan-Meier plot was used to illustrate the cumulative incidence of insulin infusion discontinuation with a log-rank test used to test the unadjusted difference between the balanced crystalloid group and saline group. A multivariable proportional hazards model was also constructed using the same approach as the primary outcome.</p>
                <p>Additional outcomes were analyzed with multivariable regression models adjusting for time elapsed from trial initiation to ED presentation (eTable 2 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200810-1-s">Supplement</xref>).</p>
                <p>Because this study is a subgroup analysis of completed clinical trials, the sample size was determined by the number of patients enrolled in the primary trials; power was not prospectively calculated for this analysis. The unit of analysis was each DKA hospitalization. While recognizing this study was a subgroup analysis and interpretation must consider this design, we considered a 2-sided <italic>P</italic> &lt;.05 to denote statistical significance, and no adjustments were made for multiple testing.

                <title>Population</title>
                <p>During the 15-month study period, 271 patients treated in the ED received an <italic>ICD-10-CM</italic> code for DKA; 172 of these patients met the study eligibility criteria and were included in this analysis (eFigure 2 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200810-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Among the 172 patients in the study population, median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 29 [24-45] years, 90 (52%) were women, 142 patients (83%) had type I diabetes, median (IQR) hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> was 10.9% (9.2%-13.1%) (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), median initial plasma bicarbonate concentration was 11 mEq/L, and a missed medication dose was the most common reason for DKA. Baseline characteristics in the balanced crystalloid group and saline group are presented in <xref rid="zoi200810t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The primary reasons for excluding patients who had an <italic>ICD-10-CM</italic> code for DKA were not meeting the laboratory case definition for DKA (65 patients) and transfer from an outside hospital (23 patients). According to the SALT-ED and SMART cluster-crossover schedule, 94 patients were assigned to balanced crystalloids during 8 months and 78 patients were assigned to saline during 7 months.</p>

                <p>The selection of isotonic crystalloid type (balanced crystalloids vs saline) was controlled by the trial protocols in the ED and ICU. During treatment in the ED and ICU, the median (IQR) volume of isotonic crystalloids administered was 4478 (3000-6372) mL. Adherence to assigned crystalloid type was high (<xref rid="zoi200810t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). By total volume, 85.3% of crystalloid administered in the balanced crystalloids group was balanced crystalloids and 96.7% of crystalloid administered in the saline group was saline. By volume, Ringer lactate solution accounted for 96.9% of balanced crystalloids used in this study, with Plasma-Lyte A accounting for the other 3.1%.</p>

Plots were created with locally weighted scatterplot smoothing. Patients were censored at the time of hospital discharge or death. Separation of 95% CIs for chloride and bicarbonate suggest significant differences between the balanced crystalloids and saline groups. SI conversions: To convert bicarbonate to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0; chloride to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0; creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4; glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555; sodium to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0; potassium to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0.</p>

                    <p>Graphs show cumulative incidence of resolution of DKA (A) and discontinuation of insulin infusion therapy (B), with time 0 defined as emergency department (ED) presentation and initiation of insulin infusion, respectively. The cumulative incidence probabilities for DKA resolution were calculated using the Turnbull nonparametric method. Displayed <italic>P</italic> values were calculated with a log-rank test. Twenty-six patients (15 in the balanced crystalloids group and 11 in the saline group) were discharged from the hospital without meeting the laboratory definition of DKA resolution; these patients were considered to have DKA resolution at the time of hospital discharge.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this subgroup analysis of 2 cluster randomized clinical trials of adults presenting to the ED with DKA, treatment with balanced crystalloid solutions (largely lactated Ringer’s) was associated with more rapid resolution of DKA and discontinuation of insulin infusion than saline. According to the median values, balanced crystalloids were associated with an absolute reduction of about 4 hours and a relative reduction of approximately 20% to 30% in the time to DKA resolution and discontinuation of insulin infusion. There was no subgroup or outcome in which saline appeared superior to balanced crystalloids. These results suggest that balanced crystalloids may be preferred over saline for the acute management of adults with DKA.</p>
              <p>A hallmark of DKA is the accumulation of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), resulting in an anion gap metabolic acidosis.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Saline infusion leads to a nonanion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to a supraphysiologic chloride concentration and strong ion difference of zero.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> As plasma chloride concentration increases, the other primary anion in plasma, bicarbonate, is lowered to maintain electroneutrality, which results in acidosis. Thus, treatment of DKA with saline could result in an iatrogenic acidosis that exacerbates metabolic acidosis caused by DKA itself. Balanced crystalloids contain physiologic concentrations of chloride and additional anions that metabolize into bicarbonate (sodium lactate in lactated Ringer’s and acetate in Plasma-Lyte A), which lead to neutral or mildly alkalizing effects when infused.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> These composition differences between balanced crystalloids and saline are the likely mechanism for shorter time to DKA resolution observed with balanced crystalloids in this study.</p>
              <p>Current DKA clinical practice guidelines recommend saline as the fluid of choice for volume expansion,<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> but they also acknowledge a paucity of evidence comparing saline with balanced crystalloids in this population.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> We believe that the results of this study add to the accumulating evidence suggesting balanced crystalloids are better resuscitation fluids than saline for many patients<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and may have particular benefits for patients with DKA.</p>
              <p>The median reduction in time to DKA resolution with balanced crystalloids in our study was small. However, DKA is common.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Saline and balanced crystalloids are both widely available and similar in cost,<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and the safety of administering fluids with a tonicity lower than saline in DKA is established.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Therefore, no particular barrier exists to optimizing clinical care for DKA patients by incorporating use of balanced crystalloids. Consistent implementation of interventions that deliver small improvements in outcomes for common conditions can translate into substantial improvements in population health and health system function.</p>
              <p>Four recent small trials compared balanced crystalloids and saline in patients with DKA.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Consistent with our results, each of these trials found point estimates favoring faster DKA resolution with balanced crystalloids, although small sample sizes led to low power.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Mahler et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> randomized 45 adults with DKA and found Plasma-Lyte A led to higher plasma bicarbonate concentrations than saline after 24 hours (20 vs 17 mmol/L; <italic>P</italic> = .02). Van Zyl et al randomized 54 adults with DKA and found the median time to reach a pH greater than or equal to 7.32 was 540 minutes with lactated Ringer’s and 683 minutes with saline (<italic>P</italic> = .25). Yung et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> randomized 77 children with DKA and found the geometric mean time to plasma bicarbonate concentration greater than or equal to 15 mmol/L was 6.2 hours with lactated Ringer and 8.6 hours with saline (<italic>P</italic> = .26). Williams et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> randomized 66 children with DKA and found median time to resolution of DKA (defined as pH &gt;7.3, bicarbonate &gt;15 mmol/L, and normal sensorium) was 14.5 hours with Plasma-Lyte A and 16.0 hours with saline (<italic>P</italic> = .47).

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study had important strengths, including (1) immediate assignment of patients to balanced crystalloids vs saline upon ED presentation, which is often absent in trials with patient level randomization; (2) strong adherence with assigned fluid type; and (3) integration of the study intervention into ongoing clinical care conducted by on-duty clinicians, which should increase generalizability. This study had some limitations. First, this study was a subgroup analysis of prior clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although we reported <italic>P</italic> values that have not been adjusted for multiplicity in this secondary analysis, a <italic>P</italic> value does not measure the importance or size of a result. We note that interpretation of findings should focus on effect sizes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Second, the intervention was not blinded. Third, this was a single-center study. Fourth, similar to prior trials,<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> some patients did not meet the American Diabetes Association definition of DKA resolution<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> before hospital discharge; we considered DKA to be resolved at the time of hospital discharge for these patients. Fifth, the study population was initially identified on the basis of <italic>ICD-10-CM</italic> codes, which could have resulted in some patients with DKA not being included in the study if DKA was not properly coded. Sixth, although crystalloid type was controlled by the trial in the ED and ICU, crystalloids administered on the hospital floors after transfer out of the ED and ICU was not controlled. Of note, by institutional policy, all patients were treated in the ED or ICU while receiving continuous insulin infusion; hence, most active DKA management was completed in the ED and ICU. Seventh, Ringer lactate solution was the predominant balanced crystalloid used in the study, and we have insufficient data to compare Ringer lactate with Plasma-Lyte A. Because Plasma-Lyte A has a greater alkalizing effect than Ringer lacate,<sup><xref rid="zoi200810r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200810r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> we hypothesize that time to DKA resolution would be at least as fast with Plasma-Lyte as Ringer lactate. Eighth, although our sample size was larger than those in other trials in this field, the modest sample size led to some imbalances in baseline characteristics and limited our ability to robustly evaluate subgroups and rare clinical outcomes in DKA.</p>
