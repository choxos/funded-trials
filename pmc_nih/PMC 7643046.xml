                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial of 24 participants with major depressive disorder, participants who received immediate psilocybin-assisted therapy compared with delayed treatment showed improvement in blinded clinician raterâassessed depression severity and in self-reported secondary outcomes through the 1-month follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>

                  <p>Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health concern, affecting more than 300 million individuals worldwide. Depression is the number one cause of disability,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and the relative risk of all-cause mortality for those with depression is 1.7 times greater than the risk for the general public.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In the United States, approximately 10% of the adult population has been diagnosed with MDD in the past 12 months,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and the yearly economic burden of MDD is estimated to be $210 billion.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although effective pharmacotherapies for depression are available, these drugs have limited efficacy, produce adverse effects, and are associated with patient adherence problems.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although many patients with depression showed reduced or remitted symptoms after treatment with existing pharmacotherapies,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> approximately 30% to 50% of patients did not respond fully and as many as 10% to 30% of patients were considered treatment-resistant, resulting in average effects that were only modestly larger than the effects of placebo.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Most of the current pharmacotherapies for MDD, including the widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, increase levels of brain monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine (typically by blocking reuptake).<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A growing body of evidence suggests that newer ketamine-like medications exert therapeutic efficacy in MDD through effects on glutamate neurotransmission.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Ketamine hydrochloride, a nonselective <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor antagonist, is the most well-researched of these newer medications. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a single ketamine infusion in rapidly (within hours) reducing depression symptoms and, when effective, lasting from a few days to about 2 weeks.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, ketamine has high abuse liability, and its administration involves moderate physiological risk that requires medical monitoring.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p><milestone-start id="q1"/>The combined serotonergic and glutamatergic action of psilocybin<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (a classic hallucinogen) and the preliminary evidence of the antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy (among patients with life-threatening cancer or patients with treatment-resistant depression)<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> indicate the potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy as a novel antidepressant intervention.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Moreover, psilocybin has lower addiction liability and toxic effects compared with ketamine<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and is generally not associated with long-term perceptual, cognitive, or neurological dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup><milestone-end rid="q1"/></p>
              <p>The substantial negative public health impact of MDD underscores the importance of conducting more research into drugs with rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Current pharmacotherapies for depression have variable efficacy and unwanted adverse effects. Novel antidepressants with rapid and sustained effects on mood and cognition could represent a breakthrough in the treatment of depression and may potentially improve or save lives. Therefore, the primary objective of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD.</p>

              <title>Method</title>
              <p>This randomized, waiting listâcontrolled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research in Baltimore, Maryland. The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this trial (the protocol is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI200060-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>).

                <title>Study Design and Participants</title>
                <p>This trial of psilocybin therapy included participants with moderate or severe MDD episodes, as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5)<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD; a score of â¥17 was required for enrollment).<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Eligible candidates were aged 21 to 75 years who self-reported no current pharmacotherapy for depression at trial screening. To avoid the confounding effects and potential interactions of concurrent antidepressant use, candidates were required to refrain from using antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for at least 5 half-lives before the screening and up to 4 months after enrollment (through the completion of the primary outcome assessment). However, the decision to taper off and/or continuing not to take their medications during the study was made by the individuals and their prescribing physicians and not by study personnel. Additional eligibility requirements included being medically stable with no uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions; having no personal or family history (first or second degree) of psychotic or bipolar disorders; and, for women, being nonpregnant, being non-nursing, and agreeing to use contraception. Individuals with a moderate or severe alcohol or other drug use disorder (including nicotine) in the past year, as defined by <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (Fifth Edition) (<italic>DSM-5</italic>) criteria, were excluded, as were individuals with substantial lifetime use (&gt;10 total) or recent use (past 6 months) of ketamine or classic hallucinogens, such as psilocybin-containing mushrooms or lysergic acid diethylamide (eMethods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI200060-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>Participants were enrolled between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. Recruitment was carried out through flyers, print advertisements, internet forums, social media, and the study website. Of the 870 individuals screened by telephone or electronic screening survey, 70 went on to undergo in-person medical and psychological screening, 43 were disqualified, and 27 qualified and were enrolled in the study. After screening, baseline assessments, and enrollment, 27 participants were randomized to either the immediate treatment group or the delayed treatment group (ie, the waiting list control condition). The use of a delayed treatment control was chosen to differentiate the psilocybin intervention from spontaneous symptom improvement. The delay interval was 8 weeks, after which participants in the delayed treatment group underwent all study assessments and entered the study intervention period. Randomization to the immediate treatment and delayed treatment groups occurred after screening and baseline assessments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="yoi200060f1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants were randomized using urn randomization,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> balancing for sex, age, depression severity at screening (assessed using the GRID-HAMD), and level of treatment resistance (assessed using the Maudsley Staging Method).<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> One of us (F.S.B.), who was not involved in participant screening or enrollment, performed urn randomization using the randPack library, version 1.32.0,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> in the R Statistical Software package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Data analysis was conducted on participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). A previous study of psilocybin<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> found a large effect of a high psilocybin dose (compared with a low dose) on reducing GRID-HAMD scores (Cohen <italic>d</italic>â=â1.30). Assuming a similar large effect size with 24 participants, nearly 100% power was calculated to detect a statistically significant effect of psilocybin on change in depressive symptoms.</p>
                <p>No primary outcome data were missing. Descriptive statistics for demographic and background characteristics for all study variables were calculated and compared between study conditions using a 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and a Ï<sup>2</sup> test for all remaining variables. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with time (baseline, week 5, and week 8) and condition (immediate treatment and delayed treatment) as factors was used to examine changes in the primary depression outcome (GRID-HAMD score).</p>
                <p>Follow-up planned comparisons included independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests to compare week 1 with week 4 GRID-HAMD scores in the immediate treatment condition group (corresponding to the week 5 and week 8 time points in the delayed treatment condition group). Within-participant (nâ=â24) treatment effect was examined using <italic>t</italic> tests comparing GRID-HAMD scores at baseline with scores at week 1 and week 4 postsession-2 follow-up. Rapid and sustained antidepressant effects were examined using <italic>t</italic> tests comparing QIDS-SR scores between baseline and day 1 postsession-1 and between baseline and week 4 postsession-2 follow-up. Effect sizes for the independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests were calculated using the Cohen <italic>d</italic> statistic, and effect sizes for the repeated-measures analysis of variance were calculated using the partial eta squared (Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) statistic. Further primary outcomes included a descriptive analysis of the percentage of participants who met the criterion for clinically significant response and remission in the sample.</p>
                <p>All statistical tests used a <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â.05 to determine statistical significance.

              <p>This randomized clinical trial documented the substantial rapid and enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy among patients with MDD. Although the rapid antidepressant effects of psilocybin are similar to those reported with ketamine,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> the therapeutic effects are different: ketamine effects typically last for a few days to 2 weeks, whereas the current study showed that clinically significant antidepressant response to psilocybin therapy persisted for at least 4 weeks, with 71% of the participants continuing to show a clinically significant response (â¥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score) at week 4 of follow-up. Furthermore, psilocybin was found to have low potential for addiction<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and a minimal adverse event profile,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> suggesting therapeutic advantages with less risk for associated problems than ketamine.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The present findings in patients with MDD are consistent with results of studies that reported on the effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing antidepressant effects among patients with cancer who had psychological distress<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and a small open-label study of patients with treatment-resistant depression.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The mounting evidence of the use of psilocybin as an adjunct to treatment of a variety of psychiatric conditions (eg, depression,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> tobacco use disorder,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and alcohol use disorder<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>) suggests a transdiagnostic mechanism of action. In several studies in patients<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and in healthy volunteers,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> the intensity of mystical-type experiences reported after psilocybin sessions was associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies have suggested that mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences during a psychedelic session predict positive therapeutic effects.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Consistent with these previous studies, the current trial showed that psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type, personally meaningful, and insightful experiences were associated with decreases in depression at 4 weeks (eResults in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI200060-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that psilocybin may decrease negative affect and the neural correlates of negative affect,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> which may be a mechanism underlying transdiagnostic efficacy. Taken together, these findings suggest that further studies into psychological and neural mechanisms across different psychiatric conditions are warranted.</p>
              <p>The present trial showed that psilocybin administered in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours) produced large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects. The effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychopharmacological depression treatment studies.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with literature that showed that combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy were more efficacious in the treatment of MDD than either intervention alone.<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="yoi200060r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Furthermore, given that psilocybin was associated with nonserious adverse effects that were frequently reported as mild-to-moderate headache and challenging emotions that were limited to the time of sessions (eTables 8 and 9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI200060-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>), this intervention may be more acceptable to patients than widely prescribed antidepressant medications that confer substantially more problematic effects (eg, suicidal ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain). The effectiveness of psilocybin therapy after a single or only a few administrations represents another substantial advantage over commonly used antidepressants that require daily administration.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has some strengths. It had a randomized design and used GRID-HAMD as the primary outcome measure that was assessed by blinded clinician raters. The delayed treatment condition controlled for the possible effects of having been accepted into the trial and for the passage of time between screening and initial follow-up assessments. However, the delayed treatment condition did not control for other aspects of psilocybin administration, such as preparation and rapport building, postsession integration meetings, or expectancy effects. Although placebo and active treatment controlled designs are widely used in therapeutic trials,<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> they too have limitations owing to the highly discriminable effects of psilocybin.</p>
                <p><milestone-start id="q5"/>This study has some other limitations. It had a short-term follow-up, a small sample that was predominantly composed of White non-Hispanic participants, and included participants with low risk of suicide and moderately severe depression. Further research with larger and more diverse samples, longer-term follow-up, and a placebo control is needed to better ascertain the safety (eg, abuse potential of psilocybin, suicide risk, and emergence of psychosis) and efficacy of this intervention among patients with MDD. Another limitation is the psychotherapy approach<sup><xref rid="yoi200060r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> that involved session facilitators from a variety of professional disciplines (eg, social work, psychology, psychiatry) and session facilitators without formal clinical training (eg, research assistants and clinical trainees). The type of psychotherapy offered and the characteristics of therapists should be explored in future studies.<milestone-end rid="q5"/></p>

              <p>Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects among patients with MDD. These data expand the findings of previous studies involving patients with cancer and depression as well as patients with treatment-resistant depression by suggesting that psilocybin may be effective in the much larger population of MDD.
