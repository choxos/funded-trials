                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Substance use among adolescents in the U.S. is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes in the long-term. Universal youth-focused substance use prevention programs have demonstrated effectiveness but are often not sustainable due to the significant amount of time, effort, and resources required. We describe a trial protocol for a brief, low-participant-burden intervention to improve substance use-specific parent-child communication through the promotion of family meals and increased parental engagement.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a 13-week intervention. A total of 500 dyads of parents and their 5<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> grade children are recruited from across Massachusetts. Dyads are randomized to the intervention or attention-control condition using block urn randomization, based on child grade, gender, and school. Parents/guardians in the substance use preventive intervention arm receive a short handbook, attend two meetings with an interventionist, and receive two SMS messages per week. Parents/guardians in the control arm receive the same dose but with content focused on nutrition, physical activity, and weight stigma. Participant dyads submit videos of family meals, audio recordings of prompted conversations, and quantitative surveys over an 18-month period (baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 months post-intervention). The primary outcomes measure the quantity and quality of parent-child substance use conversations and proximal child indicators (i.e., substance use attitudes and expectancies, affiliation with substance-using peers, and intentions and willingness to use substances). The secondary outcome is child substance use initiation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Substance use during adolescence in the U.S. is a major public health problem, as the earlier a child initiates alcohol use, the greater their risk for developing substance use disorders [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately 90% of those with substance-related problems started using before the age of 18 [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and compared to those aged 18–25, youth aged 12–17 who use substances are more likely to develop disordered use within a year [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While substance use among high school students has been on the decline in recent years, it is still highly prevalent [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System indicated that nationally, 19.0% of ninth graders had at least one drink of alcohol in the last thirty days and 24.3% and 18.1% had ever used marijuana and cigarettes, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The prevalence of these risky behaviors is higher among twelfth-grade students, as 39.9% had at least one drink of alcohol in the last thirty days and 48.7% and 32.0% had ever used marijuana and cigarettes, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Current vaping patterns in high school students have steeply inclined–more than a quarter of high school students currently vape compared to 11.7% of high schoolers in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given the stress and increased mental health problems among youth [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the COVID-19 pandemic has raised some concerns regarding adolescent substance use, although evidence is limited [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One study of Canadian adolescents reported the proportion of adolescents who reported one or more substance-using days within a period of three weeks pre-COVID compared to 3 weeks during COVID increased significantly from 0.76 to 0.96 (p = 0.02) and from 0.94 to 1.10 (p = 0.01) for alcohol and marijuana, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The adverse consequences of adolescent substance use include an increased likelihood of sexual risk taking, driving while intoxicated, and delinquency [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the prevention of substance use among youth is a national public health priority and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the problem [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>There is a significant need for brief, family-based, substance use prevention programs. During adolescence, the family environment has been recognized as having a profound influence on substance use [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Universal substance use prevention programs (i.e., programs aimed at the general population without regard for individual level of risk [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) that include parents have been shown to be efficacious [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the programs that have been most effective are resource-intensive and require extensive time and effort for program staff and participants [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, an approach to universal substance use prevention is needed that reduces participant and program staff burden and is effective, easily implemented and disseminated, and sustainable.</p>
              <p>Family meals can be a conduit of parent-child communication, which has been associated with decreased substance use in adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In observational studies, the practice of having family meals is consistently associated with a reduced risk of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, as well as with other behavioral problems [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined whether encouraging family meals while building communication skills in parents is an effective strategy for substance use prevention.</p>
              <p>The SUPPER Project (Substance Use Prevention Promoted by Eating family meals Regularly) addresses this gap in knowledge; it is a brief, communication-focused, universal prevention program that utilizes eating family meals and parent-child communication as primary preventive strategies for adolescent substance use initiation. This program uses the “brief intervention model” [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to target parents/guardians (referred to “parents” herein) as facilitators in preventing substance use among their children with a framework that is easily adaptable, has low participant burden, and is resource efficient, thus enhancing sustainability. A SUPPER pilot study (R34 DA031337; PI: Skeer) demonstrated that the project was feasible and acceptable to families and preliminarily efficacious [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the current randomized controlled trial we aim to: 1) determine the efficacy of The SUPPER Project on parent outcomes including higher quality and frequency of parent-child conversations about substance use; 2) examine the effects of the prevention program on proximal child indicators including attitudes and expectancies regarding substance use, engagement with substance-using peers, and intentions and willingness to use substances; and 3) examine the effects of the prevention program on pre-/early adolescent substance use. If shown to be efficacious, the SUPPER Project would offer a brief, evidence-based, low-burden program for families.</p>

              <title>Methods/Design</title>
              <p>The SUPPER Project employs a parallel group randomized controlled trial design. The study aims to enroll a diverse sample of 500 parent-child dyads. Dyads are randomized, with a 1:1 allocation, to receive either the substance use prevention (experimental) condition or an attention-control (comparison) condition focused on nutrition, physical activity, and weight stigma. Dyads are recruited from public and private schools in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. As this is a universal preventive intervention, all families in participating schools who meet eligibility criteria (see ‘Screening and Eligibility’ below) are able to participate. To enhance external validity, an administrative diversity supplement (R01DA045073-02S1) allowed us to additionally focus recruitment efforts on ethnically and racially diverse communities, as well as those with heightened risk factors (e.g., higher prevalence of substance use disorders, gang involvement, etc.). Due to the differences in administration and infrastructure between school districts and individual schools, the process for building relationships with each school varies. In general, school districts are selected based upon their proximity to the Boston-based study team due to the in-person activities involved and their interest in being involved in the research. Permission is first received at a district level to conduct research within the schools. Schools within the district are then contacted and those interested are asked to sign a formal letter of support. Individualized recruitment plans are made with each school utilizing their existing communication platforms (e.g. newsletters, school social media, teacher-parent emails or text messages) and opportunities for in-person meetings with parents (e.g. open houses, school events, parent-teacher conferences) to disseminate information about the study. Information about the study is available to all students; however, schools are given the flexibility to target recruitment to best serve the needs of their communities. A recruitment goal is communicated to each school and progress toward that goal is reported back regularly, which is based on the number of students in each target grade. Interested parents reach out to the study team directly to complete the screening and eligibility process.</p>
              <p>In March 2020, the original recruitment approach was adjusted to accommodate recruitment outside of the context of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most school systems transitioned to remote learning in Massachusetts and the largest school district working with us ceased all school-based research for the remainder of the school year. As a result, all study activities were modified for remote delivery and travel was no longer required for the study team; therefore, the scope was broadened to include schools in the Eastern region of the Massachusetts, and later, across the state. Various strategies were used, including working with an outside recruitment agency to recruit families online, applying snowball recruitment methods by asking participating families to share the opportunity with their contacts, and engaging with community-based organizations currently working with parents to help disseminate the opportunity.</p>

                <title>Screening and eligibility</title>
                <p>Interested parents are screened using a brief online survey that is administered by a research assistant over the phone. To be eligible, parents must be a custodial parent living with their child at least 50% of the time and child participants must be a student in 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, or 7<sup>th</sup> grade and enrolled in school within Massachusetts. During summer-month recruitment (June through August), students entering 5<sup>th</sup> grade and those who just completed 7<sup>th</sup> grade are eligible. Parents and children with a developmental disability or limited proficiency in English or Spanish that would interfere with their independent completion of surveys and study activities are excluded. Only one parent-child dyad per family is allowed. If the parent is eligible and interested in continuing with participation, the research assistant schedules the consent and baseline meeting.</p>

                <title>Consent and baseline meeting</title>
                <p>Baseline meetings are conducted in person at the participant’s home or another place of their choosing, and the participant receives all study materials. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after March 2020, meetings were conducted virtually via web-conference and all study materials were sent via carrier mail. Remote visits were implemented as a permanent option for the remainder of the study. An electronic copy of the consent and assent forms are emailed to the dyad prior to the visit. During the meeting for both in-person and remote options, informed consent/assent are obtained from the participants before beginning data collection. Demographic data from both parent and child are collected via an online survey. Research assistants then review the procedures for using a study-provided iPad to record and upload conversations and family meals that they are to complete and upload independently during the baseline and follow-up visits. Dyads are then asked to complete all baseline study activities.</p>
                <p>Participants complete baseline data collection over a period of four weeks immediately following the consent and baseline meeting to give participants a sense of the time commitment required by the study. Participants are randomized after all baseline data are completed. Dyads that do not complete baseline activities are not randomized.</p>

The project manager assigns the interventionist and sends the participants their respective condition materials. Only the project manager, Principal Investigator, and one Co-Investigator (the biostatistician on the study who conducts randomization) have access to the assigned condition, which is stored separately from the participant’s personal data and any other study-related data.</p>

Participants are encouraged to reach out with questions and to troubleshoot issues with data submissions. To further support participant engagement and retention, the study team sends personalized communication throughout the study period (i.e., greeting cards every three months, text messages at 9- and 15-month follow-up time periods, and a frequently asked questions website). Retention is monitored regularly, and stakeholder and key informant interviews help inform best practices for retaining recruited participants and schools in real time.</p>

                <p>Participants randomized to the experimental condition receive a brief substance use prevention program with two components: live and home-based. After randomization, the parent participant is mailed a packet with the home-based components including a: handbook, magnet, local resources handout, and link to the study website. In addition, the parent receives two text messages per week for thirteen weeks with tips and reminders from the handbook, starting immediately following randomization.

The parent is asked to participate in two live sessions, an approximately one-hour in-person/video session (Session 1) and a 30-minute follow-up phone call (Session 2) with a study interventionist. Session 1 takes place approximately two weeks after receiving the handbook and Session 2 approximately two weeks after Session 1. The purpose of the sessions is to increase parent knowledge in the material covered in the handbook and self-efficacy for having conversations about substance use with their child. Interventionists are trained by the study team using standardized training in a motivational interviewing style and method, general therapeutic techniques, and how to administer an action plan and communicate key points from the handbook. The action plan serves as a guide for the participant to plan their substance use conversations with their child, encouraging them to consider possible barriers, people who could support them, when to have the conversations, and specifically what they would like to say. During Session 1, the interventionist asks the participant to complete a brief questionnaire to assess their knowledge of different key points from the handbook, reviews the handbook’s key points, and helps the participant set a realistic goal and practice for having a conversation about substance use with their child using the action plan as a guide. The interventionist follows up during Session 2 about progress on the action goals, reviews the handbook key points and answers any questions.</p>

Parents receive an additional handout, which delivers guidance for parents on best practices for talking about weight with children in a non-stigmatizing way. The handout was developed using evidence-based practices informed by content experts and a literature review. Text messages focus on key points from the handbook and handout. Sessions with the interventionist use a similar action plan layout to guide parents in setting goals to improve child eating and exercise habits and reduce the occurrence of negative or critical comments about weight from family members. After study completion, control participants can obtain the prevention program materials if desired.</p>

                <p>Interventionists for the intervention arm undergo standardized training in session content and motivational interview style to ensure sessions are delivered consistently and as designed in the protocol. All sessions are audio-recorded for fidelity assessment. The first ten sessions of newly onboarded interventionists are assessed by supervisors. After observing the session, the interventionist and supervisor meet for feedback, support and norming. Once an acceptable level of adherence is met, 20% of sessions continue to be monitored. Refresher trainings are conducted if interventionists are nonadherent.</p>
                <p>To ensure fidelity delivery and receipt of the intervention, five process measures (dose, adherence, quality of delivery, participant responsiveness and cross contamination) were adapted and are monitored at regular intervals throughout the study [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Process measure data are extracted from self-administered and supervisor intervention surveys and participant self-reported surveys.</p>

Cross-contamination is also measured by asking a question in the parent and child survey at the 3- and 18- month assessment point.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The trial is powered on the outcome of parent-child communication about substance use, which was most responsive to intervention in the pilot trial. It is also most relevant for reducing the risk of substance use initiation. Results from the pilot trial showed that among parents who received the intervention, one-half (55% compared to 10% in the control condition) talked “a lot” to their child over the 6-month study period about alcohol, 35% (compared to 15%) talked “a lot” about marijuana, and 30% (compared to 10%) talked “a lot” about other drugs. A total of 400 parent-child dyads yields 80% power to detect one or more differences between experimental and comparison conditions, of 45% in talking about alcohol, 20% about marijuana, and 20% about other drugs, using a two-sided Bonferroni-corrected 1.5% level of significance (to account for testing 3 substances). With regard to the video assessment of quality of parent-child conversations about substance use, using an average standard deviation of 1.0 for the FAsTask from a recently published pilot trial that assessed an intervention for substance use in a sample of young adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], a sample size of 400 yields 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.4 or greater (effect size = 0.4) between conditions at a two-sided 5% significance level. This is a meaningful difference as the ratings for this task ranges from 1 to 9. Accounting for a 20% dropout rate, the size of trial is 500 in total, evenly spread across the three grades, for a total of 400 dyad completers.</p>

                <title>Planned analyses</title>
                <p>The scientific rigor of this trial will be ensured by conducting ongoing data integrity assessments, missing data detection and correction procedures, and proposed data analysis strategies. All forms will be checked for missing data and extreme values prior to data entry. Attrition effects will be evaluated by testing whether systematic differences exist between participants who complete the trial follow-ups versus those who drop out. Differences between the two conditions in demographic composition and all measures collected at baseline will be assessed at regular intervals throughout the duration of the trial. Group differences in these variables at trial’s end will be accounted for in subsequent analyses, using baseline scores as covariates. All analyses will subscribe to the intention-to-treat principle, whereby all participants will be included in the analysis in the group to which they were randomized. Participants who are lost to follow-up or drop out can affect the validity of the group comparisons if: 1) the outcome of interest is related to being lost or dropped, and 2) it is differential between groups. The missing data mechanism will be formally tested [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] to determine whether it is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) or Missing at Random (MAR). For completeness in assessing the effect of missingness, two additional analyses will be conducted: 1) a ‘per-protocol’ analysis among participants who complete all follow-up surveys; and 2) multiple imputation of five data sets using a discriminant function for binary outcomes and Markov chain Monte Carlo for continuous outcomes, assuming the missing data mechanism is MAR.</p>

A test for interaction between conditions and follow-up points using the above models will assess whether there is a differential effect of the experimental condition across time.

              <p>Adolescent substance use is a national problem and while decreasing with some substances, continues to persist and escalate in others [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic has added further urgency to addressing this issue as adolescents may turn to substances to cope or self-medicate during this difficult time [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Currently there is lack of family-based, universal substance use prevention programming to reduce and/or delay substance use initiation among youth that reduce participant burden, are easily disseminated, and sustainable. This protocol outlines the methodology to test the effectiveness of a brief, multi-pronged parent-focused intervention promoting family meals that uses a tailored approach to improve parents’ self-efficacy in communicating with their child about substances. The strengths of this study are: first, rather than solely focusing on quantity of family meals and conversations about substance use, we code qualitative data to measure quality of these interactions; second, we assess these outcomes through observation rather than relying exclusively on self-report; and third, a large, diverse cohort of parent-child dyads to examine study outcomes.</p>
              <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our procedures changed which presented both challenges and benefits. We were able to quickly pivot our recruitment, baseline meeting, and interventionist session procedures to be virtual. Families appeared to transition well to virtual activities, likely due to many of their other work and school activities being moved to the same web-based platforms. Interventionists reported being able to successfully build rapport with parents in virtual sessions.</p>
              <p>Our strategy for recruiting specifically within schools in the Greater Boston area was challenged because the district paused research activities. However, many schools continued to promote the program. Being completely remote allowed recruitment to be extended to families throughout the state, thereby opening the sampling pool and allowing the team to offer more scheduling options to families and to schedule more meetings in a day than previously. An online recruitment agency was employed to disseminate the opportunity state-wide to supplement lulls in school-based recruitment. One limitation to this online recruitment platform was that despite making the recruitment materials and screener available in Spanish, the platform itself is English-only, requiring the Spanish speaker to know enough English to make an account.</p>
              <p>This study will provide significant contributions to the limited literature on the promotion of family meals and open communication [<xref rid="pone.0263016.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as an innovative approach to substance use prevention. Further, because of the brief nature of the intervention and low burden on the participant and program staff, if found effective, it could be easily adopted by schools for implementation.</p>
