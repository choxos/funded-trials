                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In preclinical studies of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ibrutinib improved the antitumor efficacy of the standard of care chemotherapy. This led to a phase 1b clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunologic effects of ibrutinib treatment in patients with advanced PDAC.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Previously untreated patients with PDAC were enrolled in a phase 1b clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov) to determine the safety, toxicity, and maximal tolerated dose of ibrutinib when administered with the standard regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. To study the immune response to ibrutinib alone, the trial included an immune response arm where patients were administered with ibrutinib daily for a week followed by ibrutinib combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided primary PDAC tumor biopsies and blood were collected before and after ibrutinib monotherapy. Changes in abundance and functional state of immune cells in the blood was evaluated by mass cytometry by time of flight and statistical scaffold analysis, while that in the local tumor microenvironment (TME) were assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry. Changes in B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor repertoire were assessed by sequencing and analysis of clonality.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In the blood, ibrutinib monotherapy significantly increased the frequencies of activated inducible T cell costimulator<sup>+</sup>(ICOS<sup>+</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and monocytes. Within the TME, ibrutinib monotherapy led to a trend in decreased B-cell abundance but increased interleukin-10<sup>+</sup> B-cell frequency. Monotherapy also led to a trend in increased mature CD208<sup>+</sup>dendritic cell density, increased late effector (programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1<sup>â€“</sup>) eomesodermin (EOMES<sup>+</sup>)) CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell frequency, with a concomitantly decreased dysfunctional (PD-1<sup>+</sup> EOMES<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell frequency. When ibrutinib was combined with chemotherapy, most of these immune changes were not observed. Patients with partial clinical responses had more diverse T and B cell receptor repertoires prior to therapy initiation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Ibrutinib monotherapy skewed the immune landscape both in the circulation and TME towards activated T cells, monocytes and DCs. These effects were not observed when combining ibrutinib with standard of care chemotherapy. Future studies may focus on other therapeutic combinations that augment the immunomodulatory effects of ibrutinib in solid tumors.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the USA. With a 5-year relative survival rate of ~10.8%, PDAC is aggressive and difficult to treat. When first diagnosed, over 90% of patients have advanced and inoperable disease making systemic chemotherapy the first line of treatment.</p>
              <p>Although the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is a front-line standard treatment regimen for metastatic PDAC,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> overall survival (OS) of patients is improved by only a few months. As such, further improvements in treatment are much needed. In recent years, immunotherapy for solid tumors has seen significant progress and remains an active area of immense interest for treating advanced PDAC, given the highly immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in this disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â€“8</xref> In preclinical studies using both murine pancreatic cancer cell line orthotopic graft and genetically engineered transgenic mouse models, immunomodulation via inhibition of Brutonâ€™s tyrosine kinase (BTK) with an irreversible inhibitor, ibrutinib, in combination with gemcitabine led to superior antitumor effects compared with gemcitabine alone.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> In vivo, BTK expressed by both B cells and Gr1<sup>â€“</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells promoted tumor growth and regulated signaling pathways that impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent cytotoxicity.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>Based on these promising preclinical studies, a phase 1b clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immunomodulation of ibrutinib added to the standard regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced PDAC. Here we report in depth the effects of ibrutinib monotherapy or combination therapy on the immune response in the blood circulation and in the TME. Some of these study findings were reported earlier as a conference abstract.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>

                <title>Clinical study</title>
                <p>Patients with stage IV metastatic PDAC with no prior systemic or investigational therapy for PDAC, an intact primary tumor, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0â€“1, and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal functions, were enrolled into a multicenter, open-label, phase 1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov) to study the effect of one time per day, oral ibrutinib in combination with the standard regimen of gemcitabine and albumin bound paclitaxel, in the first-line therapy setting. The study consisted of a 3+3 dose escalation arm (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1A</xref>) to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), safety, toxicity, and antitumor effect of ibrutinib in combination with standard doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Grade 4 hematologic adverse events were expected with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, and support with colony stimulating factor was permitted. Patients were also enrolled into an immune response arm (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1B</xref>) to assess immune landscape changes in response to ibrutinib monotherapy locally in the pancreatic TME and systemically in the blood. In this arm, the patients were administered a 7-day run-in with ibrutinib alone prior to commencement of combination chemotherapy cycles. Pre and post 7-day ibrutinib run-in treatment blood samples and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided primary pancreatic tumor biopsies, at least 5 days before and after 7-day ibrutinib run-in, were obtained for immune response assessment. Being a challenging and invasive procedure, primary tumor biopsies could be collected only from six out of seven patients accrued. Of the collected biopsies, a post run-in biopsy was not analyzable for one of six patients. Changes in the immune landscape induced by combination treatment were studied in both study arms, but in the blood only. Progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-progression, and OS from the date of first dose of protocol therapy, were also determined. Progression was defined as radiographic and/or clinical disease progression or death. Patients were accrued at the University of California San Francisco and Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland. Signed informed consent was provided by each patient. Institutional Review Boards of both institutions approved the study protocols including the collection of biospecimens.</p>

Starting with pre-processed fcs files for singlet, live, RBCâ€“ and platelet-free CD45<sup>+</sup> cells as input, 80,000 cells were randomly sampled from each of the 15 fcs files used as input (corresponding to 15 samples from six patients over three time points) for a total of 1.2 million cells. The channels for CCR7, CD117, CD11b, CD11c, CD123, CD127, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD19, CD25, CD3, CD31, CD33, CD38, CD4, CD45RA, CD56, CD61, CD235ab, CD8a, FcÎµR1Î±, FOXP3, HLA-DR, podoplanin, TCR-Va24-Ja18, TCRÎ³Î´, and VISTA were selected as input for the UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm. For the UMAP algorithm parameters, the defaults were retained: number of neighbors=15, minimum distance=0.01, and collapse outliers=yes. Finally, prior to dimensionality reduction, the values in each channel were normalized to a mean of 0 and SD of 1. Nine cell populations were manually gated on the UMAP plot with cell-specific expression markers. Traditional gating in Cytobank was also used to identify and analyze various cell populations and their functional states.</p>
                <p>For some of the patient blood draws, absolute monocyte counts were collected as part of the complete blood count (CBC) analysis.</p>

After washing off primary antibody in TBST, either anti-rat, anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit Histofine Simple Stain MAX PO horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polymer (Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) was applied for 30 min at room temperature, followed by AEC chromogen (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA). Whole slide digital imaging was performed following each chromogen development. Heat and chemical stripping between cycles and rounds was performed as previously described.

In the immune response arm (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1B</xref>), patients were first given a once-daily ibrutinib alone run-in for 7 days, which was followed by ibrutinib in combination with the standard treatment regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The safety, toxicity, and MTD of ibrutinib when administered in combination with the standard regimen was determined in the dose escalation arm using a 3+3 dosing design. In the immune response arm, the effect of 7-day treatment with ibrutinib alone on leukocytes in the peripheral blood and in the PDAC TME was evaluated. The MTD for ibrutinib was determined to be 560 mg/day (data not shown).

When examining patient-specific responses, only two of five patients had reduced B cells percentages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>, right panel). Since BTK occupancy, a measure of target inhibition achieved by ibrutinib treatment, was evaluated for at least a subset of the patients (<xref rid="SP4" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 4</xref>), correlation of BTK occupancy with changes in leukocyte frequencies was assessed.

Ibrutinib-induced B-cell frequency changes did not correlate with BTK occupancy (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref>, left and right panels).

                <p>Association of BCR/TCR clonality with clinical response was also assessed collectively in patients from both the study arms before and after the start of combination chemotherapy treatment cycles. Clonality in patients that had either progressive disease or stable disease (PDSD) was compared with those who had partial response (PR) at screen, the end of one (C2D1) or two (C3D1) combination chemotherapy cycles (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B, E</xref>). Between the two clinical response groups (PDSD vs PR), BCR clonality was not significantly different before the start of therapy (screen time point) or at the end of one (C2D1) or two (C3D1) combination chemotherapy cycles (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, TCR clonality was lower in the PR patients compared with the PDSD patients at all time points assessed, that is, screen, C2D1 and C3D1 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6E</xref>). Hence, lower TCR clonality in PR patients existed prior to therapy and was maintained during at least two cycles of combination chemotherapy, with the difference at the end of the first cycle, that is, at C2D1, reaching statistical significance. When examining the proportion of newly generated clones at C2D1 over screen, PR patients had significantly higher levels of newly generated BCR clones (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, PR patients had greater proportions of newly generated TCR clones at C2D1 over screen, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Further, median OS trended to be greater in patients that had lower BCR clonality (â‰¤0.01; 9.9 months OS) than in patients with higher BCR clonality (&gt;0.01; 7.74 months OS) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6G</xref>). Similarly, median OS trended to be greater in patients with lower TCR clonality (&lt;0.13; 9.9 months OS) than in patients with higher TCR clonality (&gt;0.13; 7.96 months OS) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6H</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicated that lower BCR and TCR clonality and greater proportions of newly generated BCR and TCR clones were associated with improved clinical outcomes in this study.</p>
                <p>Associations of functional states of blood leukocytes at the end of one cycle of combination chemotherapy (C2D1) with clinical responses for patients in both study arms was also examined. No statistically significant findings emerged due to the small numbers of patients in the study. However, similar trends were observed in functional states of blood leukocytes in the PR patients, as compared with PDSD patients, or in patients that had OS greater than 6 months compared with those with OS less than 6 months (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 7B</xref>).</p>

              <p>This report provides a detailed description of the immunomodulatory effects of ibrutinib monotherapy and combination therapy with the standard regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced PDAC. Although this study is limited in the numbers of patients enrolled, it provides critical clues into the effect of ibrutinib therapy on the immune response, which may inform study design for future clinical trials.</p>
              <p>Although ibrutinib is known to reduce B-cell survival and is Food and Drug Administration-approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment, the effect on B-cell frequency was modest in this study. This might reflect the differential sensitivity of â€˜normalâ€™ non-malignant versus malignant B cells to BTK inhibition. Since ibrutinib is rapidly cleared from the circulation, the mild effect observed on B-cell depletion might also reflect B-cell repopulation between the end of ibrutinib monotherapy and blood and tumor biopsy sampling. Interestingly, consistently increased presence of IL-10<sup>+</sup> B cells, likely Breg cells, in the TME could be an acquired resistance mechanism. While it is possible that the significant increase in Ki-67<sup>+</sup> cells in a B-cell cluster in the blood ibrutinib monotherapy represents Bregs, this cannot be conclusively determined as the CyTOF panel did not evaluate IL-10. A recent single cell RNA sequencing study of pancreatic cancer biopsies reported infiltration of both primary and metastatic tumors with B cells with a much greater infiltration in metastatic tumors compared with primary tumors,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and thus supporting a negative correlation between disease severity and the extent of B-cell filtration.</p>
              <p>In line with previous preclinical findings,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> ibrutinib monotherapy led to increased frequency of blood monocytes and a trend towards more mature DCs in the TME. This correlated with increased frequency of ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> activated T cells in the periphery and a trend towards fewer dysfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the TME. Interestingly, the frequency of ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been previously reported to increase with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated protein 4 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, where they are critical for antitumor responses.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> Further, these ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could potentially represent cells that are destined to become tumor tissue resident memory (TRM) cells.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, this could not be confirmed as none of the staining panels included CD103, a marker of TRM cells. Tertiary lymphoid structures, which are densely packed with leukocytes<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and associated with improved prognosis and survival in PDAC,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> were not seen in any of the tumor biopsies. The numbers of cells in the available tissue biopsies in addition to the low <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> numbers were insufficient to draw any significant conclusions with spatial analyses. Sufficient tumor biopsy sample was not available to perform RNA-based analyses, such as by the NanoString platform or by single cell RNA sequencing.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the results observed with ibrutinib monotherapy were distinct from those observed when ibrutinib was combined with chemotherapy. Although a significant increase in peripheral blood monocyte frequency was observed both with monotherapy and combination treatment, neither B-cell frequency reduction nor T-cell activation was observed in the blood with combination therapy, raising questions about how the standard chemotherapeutic drugs in PDAC therapy interact with ibrutinib, an immunomodulatory drug. The blunting of ibrutinib-induced immunomodulation when gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel were concurrently administered may reflect the cytotoxic effects of these chemotherapies on the different immune cells that may have been modulated by the ibrutinib. This might also possibly explain the lack of clinical benefit, as measured by OS and PFS, in the phase III RESOLVE clinical trial for the same combination.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
              <p>As patients with PDAC with a partial clinical response had trends towards lower T-cell clonality prior to the start of treatment with only minor transient effects from combination therapy, this indicated that these patients likely had pre-existing or natural functional tumor-reactive T cells in their peripheral blood as has been reported previously,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30â€“32</xref> but the activity of which was not enhanced by ibrutinib, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel combination therapy. Sufficient tumor tissue was not available to analyze the BCR and TCR repertoire in the TME.</p>
              <p>Similar to findings herein, immune subset analysis of the TME in a phase II trial of acalabrutinib, also a BTK inhibitor, with and without pembrolizumab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, showed increased proportion of Tbet<sup>+</sup> EOMES<sup>+</sup> late effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from baseline in four of seven patients receiving combination therapy as compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy, although also without clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Moreover, in a phase II trial of patients with advanced PDAC, acalabrutinib either alone or in combination with pembrolizumab that also failed to show clinical benefit, reported reduced presence of CD15<sup>+</sup> granulocytic, but not monocytic cells, and evidence of T-cell activation based on increased mean fluorescence intensity of CD69 on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> memory (CD45RO<sup>+</sup>) T cells in the combination arm in the periphery.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
              <p>In conclusion, the current study revealed that ibrutinib monotherapy induced immunomodulatory changes in vivo in patients with PDAC, with some stimulatory (T cell, monocyte and DC activation) and inhibitory effects (increased B<sub>regs</sub>). Our results also demonstrate the significant interaction between ibrutinib and chemotherapy. Future studies will need to define whether other therapies could work synergistically with ibrutinib-induced immunomodulation to enhance antitumor responses.</p>
