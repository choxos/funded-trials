                <p id="Par1">Interim analyses of a phase I study with GSK2857916, an antibodyâ€“drug conjugate against B cell maturation antigen, have previously reported a 60% overall response and 7.9 months progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). We provide updated safety and efficacy results of the BMA117159 trial following an additional 14 months' follow-up. This open-label, first-in-human, phase I study was conducted at nine centres in the USA, Canada and the UK, and included adults with MM and progressive disease after stem cell transplantation, alkylators, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulators. In part 1, the recommended dose of 3.4â€‰mg/kg was identified; in part 2, patients received GSK2857916 3.4â€‰mg/kg once every 3 weeks. Selected part 2 safety/tolerability and efficacy endpoints are reported. Twenty-one (60.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 42.1â€“76.1) of 35 patients achieved partial response or better, including two stringent complete responses and three complete responses. The median progression-free survival was 12 months and median duration of response was 14.3 months. Thrombocytopenia and corneal events were commonly reported; no new safety signals were identified. GSK2857916 was well tolerated and demonstrated a rapid, deep and durable response in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory MM, consolidating the interim analyses conclusions that GSK2857916 is a promising treatment for these patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterised by clonal proliferation of plasma cells within the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While advances have been made in the management of MM in recent years with the introduction of novel therapies such as immunomodulators and proteasome inhibitors, outcomes are poor for those with relapsed and refractory disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, highlighting the need for new treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par3">B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a cell-surface receptor required for the survival of plasma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. BCMA is also ubiquitously expressed on MM cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and its serum levels correlate with response to therapy and overall survival in patients with MM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in patient-derived CD138-positive myeloma cells, but not in other tissues. As such, BCMA has emerged as a very selective antigen to be targeted by novel immune-based strategies for the treatment of MM.</p>
              <p id="Par4">GSK2857916 is a humanised monoclonal anti-BCMA antibody, which is afucosylated and conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin-F (MMAF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Upon binding to BCMA on the cell surface, GSK2857916 is rapidly internalised and the cytotoxic moiety (cys-mcMMAF) is released, leading to direct cell death. Indeed, preclinical studies demonstrated in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity against both myeloma cell lines and primary patient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>

Results of the prespecified interim analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> indicated that GSK2857916, at the identified recommended phase II dose of 3.4â€‰mg/kg, demonstrated favourable PK properties, was well tolerated and had good clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients.

              <p id="Par21">This update of a phase I, first-in-human study demonstrates the high single-agent activity of anti-BCMA GSK2857916 therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. With an additional 14 months of follow-up, we observed more complete responses and a longer progression-free survival compared with interim analyses, showing rapid, deep, and durable responses with GSK2857916. The interim analyses for the study (data cut-off date June 26, 2017) at a median follow-up of 12.5 months indicated a confirmed overall response in 21 (60.0%) of the 35 patients in part 2 of the trial, including one stringent complete response and two complete responses. After over a year of additional follow-up, we found an identical overall response rate in these patients, but responses had deepened over time and the number of stringent complete responses and complete responses had increased from one to two, and from two to three, respectively. Further, our analyses have provided an update on the progression-free survival and duration of response with GSK2857916: the median progression-free survival, previously at 7.9 months, is now estimated at 12.0 months (95% CI 3.1â€“not estimable) with an additional follow-up of 14 months, and the duration of response, not previously estimable at the interim analyses, is estimated at 14.3 months. Overall, these results show a sustained overall response rate, which has deepened over time. Importantly, the median duration of response and median progression-free survival are considerably longer than initially reported at the interim analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Treatment options for MM have increased in recent years and the introduction of novel proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs is significantly associated with prolonged survival in patients with MM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, outcomes remain poor for patients with relapsed and refractory disease, with those refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs having an estimated survival of only 13 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Subgroup analyses in our study revealed an overall response rate of 56% in patients refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators, similar to the rate achieved in the overall population, suggesting GSK2857916 may be a promising treatment option in heavily pre-treated refractory patients.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In 2015, daratumumab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, was approved for patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy or who are double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator, and is currently a recommended therapy option in patients with relapsed/refractory disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Still, with a reported overall response rate of 36%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, most patients fail to respond to single-agent daratumumab, and the outcome of patients following failure of daratumumab therapy is poor, with a reported median overall survival of 5.3â€“8.6 months in two recent retrospective studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, patients refractory to anti-CD38 antibodies become increasingly less responsive with subsequent lines of therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In this study, although the numbers are small, subgroup analysis found an overall response rate of 71% in those without prior daratumumab versus 42.9% with a progression-free survival of 6.8 months in patients refractory to daratumumab. While the response rate is lower in the latter population, it is still an encouraging response for a population of patients who typically respond poorly with any treatments following daratumumab failure. Indeed, a study of patients refractory to anti-CD38 antibody therapies (of which 93.5% were daratumumab-refractory) found the overall response rate of the first treatment regimen after progression with anti-CD38 therapy was 31%, with a median progression-free survival of just 3.4 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In particular, use of elotuzumab-based therapies after failure of anti-CD38 therapy led to a low overall response rate of 21%, while the addition of an immunomodulatory drug to daratumumab treatment resulted in a higher overall response rate (37%) and slightly longer progression-free survival (4.5 months). Therefore, the results of our study suggest GSK2857916 may help to redefine treatment expectations in heavily pre-treated patients refractory to daratumumab. Further studies are required to identify a possible reason for the difference in response rate between prior or no prior daratumumab subgroups, such as analysing the number of prior lines of therapy, cytogenetic risk, and expression of soluble or surface expression of BCMA between groups. Indeed, it is likely that the patients in the study who had received daratumumab had MM for longer and had more refractory disease with more clonal/subclonal evolution.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Immunotherapy is a rapidly developing field in MM. Currently the only antibody-based therapies to be approved are daratumumab and elotuzumab (anti-SLAMF7); in contrast to the target antigens of these therapies, BCMA is specifically expressed on normal and malignant plasma cells, but no other cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Two other antibodyâ€“drug conjugates that target BCMA are also in development, HDP-1 and MEDI2228, and have demonstrated anti-MM activity in preclinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, anti-BCMA bi-specific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are being developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, supporting the use of BCMA as a target in novel therapies. The clinical activity of GSK2857916 compares favourably with those described previously for CAR T cells targeting BCMA. Phase I studies of BCMA CAR T cells have demonstrated response rates of 64% to 96% at effective doses (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> CAR-positive cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and progression-free survival of 11.8 months has reported for bb2121<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, GSK2857916 does not have the risks of cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity present with BCMA CAR T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and it offers the added advantage of scalability and feasibility, including outpatient administration, over CAR T cells.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Our results also demonstrate an acceptable safety profile with GSK2857916. The most commonly reported AEs were cough, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and nausea, all of which were mostly mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2), in addition to corneal events and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with the known toxic effects of other MMAF-linked antibodyâ€“drug conjugates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and were found to be manageable. Studies are ongoing to further characterise and understand the corneal events with GSK2857916 and future studies will also investigate the benefits of convenient cooling eye masks and increasing the duration of steroid eye drop use from 4 to 7 days to mitigate corneal events. Importantly, no new safety signals were identified since the interim analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In conclusion, GSK2857916 demonstrated a rapid, deep, and durable clinical response with a significant progression-free survival in a heavily pre-treated population. New subgroup analyses indicate a benefit for patients refractory to proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, and for those with prior daratumumab treatment. The favourable safety profile and clinical activity of GSK2857916 monotherapy support progress into larger later-phase trials. Future studies may also investigate the use of GSK2857916 as a key component for combination with other therapies and in other MM populations. Overall, our results suggest that GSK2857916 is a promising therapy for patients with relapsed and refractory MM, including those in whom all other standard and available therapies have failed.</p>
