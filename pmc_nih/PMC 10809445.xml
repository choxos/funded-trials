                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Effective, disease-modifying therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain a large unmet need. Extensive evidence suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) is central to AD pathophysiology, and Aβ oligomers are among the most toxic forms of Aβ. CT1812 is a novel brain penetrant sigma-2 receptor ligand that interferes with the binding of Aβ oligomers to neurons. Preclinical studies of CT1812 have demonstrated its ability to displace Aβ oligomers from neurons, restore synapses in cell cultures, and improve cognitive measures in mouse models of AD. CT1812 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated in a placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and phase 1a/2 clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. The unique objective of this study was to incorporate synaptic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as an outcome measure for CT1812 in AD patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The present phase 1/2 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in 23 participants with mild to moderate dementia due to AD to primarily evaluate the safety of CT1812 and secondarily its pharmacodynamic effects. Participants received either placebo or 100 mg or 300 mg per day of oral CT1812 for 24 weeks. Pharmacodynamic effects were assessed using the exploratory efficacy endpoints synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, volumetric MRI, cognitive clinical measures, as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology and synaptic degeneration.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">No treatment differences relative to placebo were observed in the change from baseline at 24 weeks in either SV2A or FDG PET signal, the cognitive clinical rating scales, or in CSF biomarkers. Composite region volumetric MRI revealed a trend towards tissue preservation in participants treated with either dose of CT1812, and nominally significant differences with both doses of CT1812 compared to placebo were found in the pericentral, prefrontal, and hippocampal cortices. CT1812 was safe and well tolerated.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The safety findings of this 24-week study and the observed changes on volumetric MRI with CT1812 support its further clinical development.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par8">Although approximately 6 million people in the US suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the precise mechanism of disease is poorly understood, and development of disease-modifying therapeutics (DMTs) remains a significant challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is a key target for drug development based on extensive evidence of its involvement in the synaptic dysfunction and loss central to AD pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several convergent lines of evidence have suggested that Aβ oligomers are the most toxic form of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The binding of Aβ oligomers to their receptors on neurons is followed by reductions in synaptic protein expression, spine and synapse number, as well as by the loss of synaptic plasticity and failure of new memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in development as DMTs have limited selectivity for Aβ oligomers, and their use is associated with adverse events (AEs) including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">CT1812 is a novel brain penetrant molecule that interferes with the binding of Aβ oligomers to neurons, preventing synaptotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More specifically, CT1812 binds to the sigma-2 receptor and allosterically displaces Aβ oligomers that are bound to neurons. CT1812 dose-dependently displaces Aβ oligomers into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and improves cognitive performance in mouse models of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Early interventional clinical trials studying CT1812 in patients with AD have shown evidence of changes in disease-related biomarkers including increased levels of CSF Aβ oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], reduced levels of CSF synaptic proteins and phosphorylated Tau (pTau), and normalized abundance of other AD-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">CT1812 was generally safe and well tolerated in more than 80 healthy volunteers in a phase 1 placebo-controlled safety study (COG0101; NCT02570997) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a subsequent phase 1a/2 placebo-controlled trial (COG0102; NCT02907567), 19 subjects with mild to moderate AD were safely administered CT1812 for 28 days; all three dose levels (90, 280 and 560 mg/day) were well tolerated and were not associated with any serious AEs (SAEs). All AEs were mild or moderate in nature. Given the short duration of the study, there was no expectation to see improvements in the exploratory cognitive outcomes, however, it is notable there were no differences or acute worsening in any of the treatment groups.</p>
              <p id="Par11">With the recent advent of synaptic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we have begun to evaluate synaptic alterations in vivo. Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is expressed in virtually all synapses and is located in synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J was recently developed as a PET tracer for SV2A and advanced for human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In our recent cross-sectional studies of [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET in AD, we observed widespread reductions of SV2A binding in medial temporal and neocortical brain regions in early AD compared to cognitively normal participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET was highly correlated with cognitive performance, suggesting that synaptic imaging might be a potential surrogate biomarker outcome for therapeutic trials that is well-correlated with clinical measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The present phase 1/2 study (COG0105; NCT03493282) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to AD to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of CT1812 over 6 months with a 6-month optional extension. The primary objective was to determine safety and tolerability in patients with AD. Secondary objectives evaluated the effect of CT1812 on canonical AD and synaptic biomarkers, along with synaptic density, and cognitive and clinical outcomes in the six-month primary study. Here, we report the SV2A and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, volumetric MRI, CSF biomarker, and clinical findings from this pilot study.</p>

                <p id="Par14">The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CT1812 in patients with AD. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of CT1812 on brain synaptic density using the SV2A PET ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J and on brain metabolic activity using FDG PET; on cognitive and clinical outcomes using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – cognition subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog11) and ADAS-Cog13 (derived from ADAS-Cog14), the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study—Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), the mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB); on brain volume using volumetric MRI; and on CSF biomarkers associated with AD including Aβ40, Aβ42, total Tau, pTau, neurogranin, synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25), synaptotagmin, and neurofilament light (NfL). Additional secondary and exploratory objectives and outcome measures are not reported in this manuscript.</p>

                <title>Participants and inclusion criteria</title>
                <p id="Par15">Participants included men and women of non-childbearing potential (50–85 years of age) with a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia due to AD and at least 6 months of cognitive decline, an MRI consistent with AD diagnosis, a MMSE score of 18–26, and either a positive amyloid PET scan or a positive CSF biomarker test consistent with AD. Participants were excluded based on hospitalization or change of chronic concomitant medication within one month prior to screening, a significant abnormality detected on screening MRI (e.g., prior hemorrhage or infarct &gt; 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, &gt; 3 lacunar infarcts, cerebral contusion, encephalomalacia, aneurysm, vascular malformation, subdural hematoma, hydrocephalus, or space-occupying lesion), another primary cause of dementia (such as dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or Down’s syndrome), any significant neurological disease (such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, seizure disorders, or other infectious, metabolic, or systemic diseases that impact the central nervous system), diagnosed depression (unless successfully managed by antidepressants), schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and other unstable medical conditions. Also excluded were participants who had received an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody or BACE inhibitor within 180 days or who had previously received an Aβ-targeting vaccine.</p>

                <title>Study drug administration</title>
                <p id="Par16">Following completion of the baseline procedures, the first dose of study medication or placebo was administered in the clinic and participants were observed for two hours post-dose. Study medication included CT1812 at 300 or 100 mg or placebo, provided as two hydroxypropyl methylcellulose capsules containing CT1812 fumarate salt or lactose monohydrate (placebo). The participants were instructed to take study drug at home each morning with or without food, except on clinic days, when the study drug was taken during the visit. Study treatment was administered orally as a single daily dose (two total capsules per day) for 24 weeks. Participants returned to the clinic for repeat psychometric/neurologic testing, safety studies, and PK and PD sample collection approximately every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks and then every 3 weeks thereafter for the duration of the study.</p>

                <p id="Par17">The safety and tolerability of CT1812 were assessed by collecting vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, physical and neurological examination data, clinical laboratory test results (including hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis-related tests), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and adverse event (AE) monitoring. Blood samples were collected for analysis of CT1812 concentrations in plasma prior to administration of study drug on the day of collection.</p>

                <title>Clinical efficacy measures</title>
                <p id="Par18">The ADAS-Cog14 is a widely used general cognitive measure in clinical trials of AD that assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, language, praxis, and orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A higher score indicates more impairment, a positive change indicates cognitive worsening. The ADAS-Cog11 subscale was the primary efficacy endpoint of this clinical trial.</p>
                <p id="Par19">The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item questionnaire developed by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) to assess the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) by participants with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The ADCS-ADL scale discriminates well between cognitively normal participants and those with AD and it has good test–retest reliability. The scale ranges from 0–78 and a lower score indicates more impairment.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The MMSE is a brief screening instrument, often used in clinical trials to assess dementia severity, and measures several aspects of memory and cognitive functioning including orientation, attention, concentration, comprehension, recall, and praxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The scoring range is 0–30, and a lower score indicates more cognitive impairment. The MMSE was administered at screening to determine eligibility for the trial as well as post-dose.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The CDR-SB Scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging system that tracks the progression of cognitive and functional deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It includes semi-structured interviews with both participants and their caregivers and assesses cognition and function across six domains (memory, orientation, judgement and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Scores for each domain range from 0 to 3 while total scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</p>
                <p id="Par22">All assessments were performed at baseline and 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks.</p>

                <title>Brain imaging</title>
                <p id="Par23">T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to define regions of interest (ROI) and to assess brain volumetric changes. T1 MRI acquisition parameters included a Sag 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence with 2.95-ms echo time, 2300-ms repetition time, 900-ms inversion time, 9° flip angle, and 240 Hz/pixel bandwidth. Images are 256 × 256 × 176 with a pixel size of 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.2 mm. Additional clinical sequences were performed to ensure that participants did not meet any exclusion criteria at screening and did not develop any treatment emergent adverse events, including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). These sequences included axial T2-star gradient echo (GRE), axial T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and axial T2 fast/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE). MRI was collected on a 3 T Trio (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) with a circularly polarized head coil.</p>

                <p id="Par28">Longitudinal analysis of change in brain gray matter volume was conducted by first performing cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation at individual timepoints for each participant using FreeSurfer (version 6.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. ROIs from the FreeSurfer cortical parcellation and subcortical segmentation were used for both PET and MRI analyses performed in native subject space.

To elucidate the effects of CT1812 on imaging outcomes, a composite ROI of AD-affected brain regions was defined (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Individual exploratory brain regions included hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, inferior/middle temporal cortex, anterior cingulum, posterior cingulum, precuneus, prefrontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, lateral occipital cortex, pericentral cortex, and medial occipital cortex (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Prior to the LP, a coagulation panel was obtained to rule out a clotting disorder. Participants were excluded from having an LP if they had an allergy to all local anesthetics (such as lidocaine) and/or had any medical condition requiring treatment with warfarin or heparin. CSF cell counts (white blood cells and red blood cells, with differential if either of the counts was abnormal), protein, and glucose were measured. CSF biomarkers of AD pathology and synaptic integrity were analyzed using validated methods for Aβ40, Aβ42, tau, and pTau with Lumipulse G1200 and G600 chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay; neurogranin and NfL by ELISA; and SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin by IP-LC-PRM-MS.</p>

Baseline scores of each measure were included as covariates. In all primary analyses, treatment differences between CT1812 (pooling 300 mg and 100 mg doses) and placebo were estimated from the model for each visit.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par49">This phase 1b randomized clinical trial demonstrated that CT1812 at doses of 100 or 300 mg was reasonably safe and well tolerated in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to AD with no clear safety differences between CT1812 or placebo treatment groups. In comparison to placebo, CT1812 treatment in the combined active treatment groups had no significant effect on the change from baseline at 24 weeks in [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET-measured SV2A binding as a measure of synaptic density, or in [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET-measured reduction in glucose metabolism in an AD-associated composite region of interest. Interestingly, volumetric MRI analyses suggested a trend (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06) toward tissue preservation in a composite brain region in participants treated with CT1812. In an exploratory analysis of 16 regions, significant changes (<italic>p</italic> ≤0.05) compared to placebo were found in the pericentral cortex, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. While the sample size of the present study is small and there were no treatment differences on the cognitive clinical rating scales or in the CSF biomarkers, changes in ADAS-Cog in the placebo treated group were similar to historical and more recently reported changes from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>

                <title>Safety and tolerability</title>
                <p id="Par50">In this study, the most common TEAEs were headache and dizziness. In all completed studies in AD patients taking CT1812, including this study (NCT02907567, NCT03522129 and NCT03493282) there were no treatment-related SAEs or deaths and the most common TEAEs reported were headache, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, dizziness, liver function test increase, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. While CT1812 was reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD, of note, elevation of liver enzymes that return to normal levels following discontinuation of the drug have been observed in this and other studies. These elevations have not been associated with changes in bilirubin.</p>

                <title>Absence of a treatment effect on synapse density</title>
                <p id="Par51">CT1812 has been shown to restore synaptic protein expression and synapse number in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Aβ oligomers induce reversible spine retraction in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] with a corresponding loss of synapses and synaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The effect of CT1812-induced displacement of Aβ oligomers on oligomer-induced spine and synapse loss in cultured rat neurons has been investigated using the cytoskeleton binding protein drebrin as a marker of synapse number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The addition of Aβ oligomers to neuronal cultures induced synaptic loss of a magnitude similar to that observed using ultrastructural stereology methods in postmortem hippocampus from humans diagnosed with MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Moreover, the addition of CT1812 to cultures one hour after the addition of Aβ oligomers resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of synaptic number to normal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, examination of the expression of the synaptic proteins neurogranin and synaptotagmin-1 corroborated these results. Treatment with CT1812 blocked this loss and restored expression of both proteins to control levels. This suggests that CT1812-mediated displacement of Aβ oligomers from neuronal synapses stops both downstream oligomer-induced synaptic protein downregulation and synapse loss, facilitating synaptic recovery from toxic oligomer insult.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The present study was designed and powered to detect a rapid restoration of synapses similar to that observed in cultured cells with CT1812 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or in transgenic mouse models as has been demonstrated with other therapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We should note that synapse restoration to our knowledge has never been demonstrated in patients with AD with therapeutic interventions, although the technology to measure it in vivo with SV2A PET is a relatively recent development. Another therapeutic agent that demonstrated rapid restoration of synapses in transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] failed to show rapid restoration of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism as a correlate of synaptic activity in a 4-week Phase 1b study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] or slowing of decline in [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism or clinical outcomes in a 12-month Phase 2a proof of concept study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. No therapeutic agent has yet been tested with synaptic density PET in a fully-powered trial of longer duration. Whether the synapse restoration seen in preclinical studies will translate to human AD therapeutic trials remains to be seen. Perhaps only a slowing of synaptic loss is a feasible aim in human AD trials. The testing of that aim will require the incorporation of synaptic PET imaging in trials of longer duration that are fully-powered to detect a slowing of synaptic density loss. Furthermore, additional longitudinal observational experience with SV2A PET is needed as a prelude to such intervention trials.</p>

                <title>Effect of CT1812 on MRI volumes</title>
                <p id="Par53">This 24-week clinical trial demonstrated a trend toward slowing the rate of brain volume loss on the volumetric MRI regional composite. Moreover, in an exploratory analysis of 16 different brain regions, treatment with CT1812 showed a significant slowing in the rate of volume loss compared to placebo-treated participants in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal and pericentral cortices. Brain volume loss has been associated with pathogenetic changes (e.g., the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), as well as specific neurodegenerative changes (e.g., neuronal and synaptic loss) and cognitive deterioration in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Although the composite region measured in this study is not directly comparable to other studies, the relative preservation of brain volume associated with CT1812 treatment compared to placebo in this study may suggest potential beneficial effects of CT1812 on some of these processes. A Phase 2 proof-of-concept study assessing the effect of CT1812 over 18 months (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05531656) will therefore incorporate brain volume measurements as a secondary outcome measure.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par54">The major limitations of this trial, as previously noted, were the small sample and short treatment duration, which were sufficient to detect only a rapid and large restoration of synapses. It is possible that potential benefits of CT1812 could be observed in larger and longer studies. In addition, the power to detect longitudinal changes in brain volume may be improved in future Phase II studies by using an MRI analysis method that creates an unbiased within-subject template space, such as the FreeSurfer Longitudinal Processing Pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par55">Overall, CT1812 was generally well tolerated when delivered daily over a 24-week period in subjects with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. While no significant differences from placebo were seen in cognitive outcomes, [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET or [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, or CSF biomarker outcomes, volumetric MRI findings suggested a trend towards brain tissue preservation following CT1812 treatment. These findings support the continued development of CT1812 for the treatment of patients with AD.</p>
