                <p>No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease. Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation. They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection. Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies. We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus. Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS. The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology. This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe, sometimes fatal respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In order to study the disease and evaluate vaccines and antiviral drugs, animal models that mimic the disease are necessary. However, no single animal model for SARS reproduces all aspects of the disease as it affects humans. SARS-CoV replicates in the lungs of young mice, but they do not show signs of illness. Adaptation of SARS-CoV by serial passage in the lungs of mice resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for young mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by hematological changes and pathological changes in the lungs. Mice infected with MA15 virus die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes, and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations in its genome, which, when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, confer lethality. The MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with this virus in mice reproduces many aspects of severe human disease, including morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The occurrence in late 2002 and early 2003 of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southeast China quickly drew international attention as the disease sickened more than 8,000 people and spread to more than 30 countries within six months. Since the identification of the etiological agent, the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2003, development and characterization of animal models for evaluation of prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been of great interest. Although SARS-CoV has not been associated with a subsequent widespread outbreak since 2002–2003, the potential for such an outbreak remains. Identification of a SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese horseshoe bats (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhinolophus</named-content> species) that are indigenous across Southeast Asia suggests that they may represent a natural reservoir from which viruses may be introduced into the human population [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The course of infection in animal models is abbreviated compared with the course of SARS in humans; however, many aspects of SARS-CoV–associated disease are reproducible in animal models, including age-dependent susceptibility, recovery of SARS-CoV from respiratory tissues and secretions, infection of type I and type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, detection of viral genome in blood and extrapulmonary tissues, and pulmonary pathology (including pneumonitis, edema, necrotic debris, and hyaline membrane formation) [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Clinical symptoms have been reported in some species, but the findings are not entirely reproducible in outbred species. Variability in clinical symptoms seen in outbred species may result from additional factors, including infection with co-pathogens, stress, existence of sub-species of test animals, and use of different virus strains. This variation can be problematic in studies of pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy unless a large enough number of animals are included in each treatment group [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The ideal animal model would demonstrate viral replication in respiratory tissues, histopathologic evidence of respiratory disease, and consistent clinical signs of disease, including mortality. A small animal model in which all of these aspects of virus-associated disease are seen would be desirable because reproducible data can be generated in inbred animals, and larger numbers of animals can be included for statistical analysis of biological outcomes.</p>
              <p>To generate a model that satisfies these criteria, we have serially passaged SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice, resulting in a lethal virus that causes dose-dependent weight loss and mortality associated with higher viral titers in the respiratory tract than are seen with the wild-type virus and with histopathologic findings of severe pulmonary disease. The characteristics of this lethal mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, (MA15), are reported here.</p>

                <p>Adaptation of SARS-CoV (Urbani) was achieved by serial passage through lungs of BALB/c mice as previously described for influenza A and influenza B viruses [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lightly anesthetized mice were inoculated intranasally with 10<sup>5</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per mouse of SARS-CoV (Urbani). Two to three days post-infection (d.p.i.), when peak viral titers are observed, lungs were harvested from infected mice and clarified homogenates were used as inocula for continued serial passage via intranasal inoculation in mice. To screen for virulence in mice, groups of young naïve mice (<italic>N</italic> = 5–8) were inoculated with lung homogenates collected at passage 2, 10, and 15 (P2, P10, and P15, respectively), weighed daily, and observed twice daily for signs of morbidity or mortality. Deaths were not observed following inoculation with P2 or P10; however, increased morbidity, as indicated by weight loss, was noted in P10-inoculated mice at day 3 post-infection (p.i.) (unpublished data). Mortality was observed in P15-inoculated mice; 60% of P15-inoculated mice died or displayed extreme morbidity and were euthanized by 5 d.p.i. Mortality was not observed in mice infected with intermediate passages (P11–P14), and accompanying morbidity was not measured (unpublished data). Supernatant from lung homogenates at P15 contained a heterogeneous virus pool as evident upon sequence analysis of cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification from purified viral RNA (vRNA). Dual peaks were observed on sequence chromatograms at several nucleotide residues, indicating mixed populations in the virus pool. To obtain a clonal population, P15 virus was biologically cloned by three rounds of terminal dilution in Vero cells. Five clones were screened for lethality in 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c mice; these clones caused mortality from 50% to 100%. One clone, designated MA15, resulted in 100% mortality within 6 d. BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 wk, 4 mo, and 13 mo were all susceptible to MA15 infection, with severe morbidity or death occurring within 3 to 5 d following intranasal inoculation.</p>

                <p>In order to identify the mutations in MA15 associated with the lethal phenotype, the sequence of MA15 was compared with that of SARS-CoV (Urbani). The sequence of the initial SARS-CoV (P0) virus was identical to the published SARS-CoV (Urbani) sequence, and six nucleotide substitutions were identified in the MA15 genome compared with that of SARS-CoV (Urbani). All six substitutions were predicted to cause amino acid substitutions. These six mutations were localized to open reading frame (ORF) 1ab (four mutations) and ORFs S and M (one each) of SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030005-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Independent analysis conducted by The Institute for Genomic Research (Rockville, Maryland, United States), under a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) contract, confirmed the same six mutations in the MA15 sequence compared with those in the SARS-CoV (Urbani) sequence.</p>

                <p>The three recombinant viruses demonstrated similar kinetics and levels of viral replication compared with that of SARS-CoV infectious clone (icSARS-CoV), a wild-type recombinant SARS-CoV (Urbani) generated from cDNAs, the biologically derived MA15 virus, and SARS-CoV (Urbani) in in vitro single-cycle growth analyses in Vero E6 cells. At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, viruses reached peak replication (10<sup>7.0–7.5</sup> pfu/mL) at ∼24 h.p.i., with a slight delay in peak titers for rMA15<sub>ORF1ab</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030005-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Northern blot analysis of RNA from infected Vero E6 cells indicated that genomic vRNA and viral mRNA and all eight sub-genomic mRNAs were present in similar ratios for the recombinant viruses and MA15 virus as for SARS-CoV (Urbani) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The level of expression and mobility of the structural proteins (S and N) and an accessory protein (ORF 3a, also called X1) of the recombinant viruses and MA15 virus were comparable to those of SARS-CoV (Urbani), as determined by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Although S, N, and X1 are somewhat reduced in the lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) from icSARS-CoV–infected cultures, this is associated with reduced amounts of total protein added to the well, rather than with any specific reduction in X1 expression. Thus, the recombinant viruses (rMA15<sub>SM</sub>, rMA15<sub>ORF1ab</sub>, rMA15, and icSARS-CoV) and the MA15 virus demonstrate no defects in replication or in RNA or protein expression compared with SARS-CoV (Urbani) in Vero E6 cells.</p>

In order to evaluate whether changes in tissue tropism or levels of viral replication could contribute to the lethal phenotype of the MA15 virus, viral titers in lungs, spleen, liver, and brain of BALB/c mice were determined at various time points following intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV (Urbani) or MA15.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Serial passage of SARS-CoV (Urbani) in the lungs of BALB/c mice resulted in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15 virus) that is lethal for young (6- to 8-wk-old) BALB/c mice. The virulence and lethality of the MA15 virus result from six mutations in the SARS-CoV genome that occurred within 15 passages through BALB/c mice. Introduction of these six mutations into a recombinant SARS-CoV infectious clone, rMA15, conferred a lethal phenotype on the virus for young BALB/c mice. Five of these six mutations (not including the T67A mutation occurring in the non-structural protein [nsp] 9 of ORF 1ab) occur within nsp 5 (two mutations), nsp 13, S, and M. These genes have been reported as ones where sequence evolution occurred during adaptation of SARS-CoV in humans [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The mutations in nsp 9, nsp 5 (H133Y and E269A within the main protease, 3CL<sub>pro</sub>), and nsp 13 (A4V within the helicase protein) do not occur within any known functional domains and do not alter known cleavage sites utilized in the processing of the ORF 1ab polyprotein. Furthermore, the mutations in the MA15 virus do not occur at any specific amino acid positions identified by the Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Only the mutation in S (Y436H) occurs within a known functional domain, the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Other reports have indicated that mutations within the RBM may account for increased affinity of the virus for its cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the Y436H mutation in MA15 virus does not occur at previously identified sites of the RBM and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 interaction, and preliminary findings suggest that the Y436H mutation does not increase binding of the SARS-CoV (Tor2) RBD to murine angiotensin–converting enzyme 2 [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Reports of adaptation of an influenza A virus for increased virulence in mice indicate that multiple gene products may interact or contribute independently to virulence. In one adaptation of influenza A/FM/1/47 (FM-MA), findings indicated that four viral gene segments contributed to increased virulence [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but additional analyses indicated that mutations occurring in at least two and likely three gene products acted synergistically to account for the increased virulence [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recombinant icSARS-CoV produced mild pneumonia identified by X-ray changes in macaques, similar to the clinical disease noted with wild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani) [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, recombinant SARS-CoV bearing the six novel mouse-adapted mutations, rMA15, recapitulated a fatal respiratory disease phenotype in mice, demonstrating the ability of the SARS molecular clones to capture complex disease phenotypes. We generated two other recombinant SARS-CoVs, rMA15<sub>SM</sub> (encoding the two mutations in the S and M genes) and rMA15<sub> ORF1ab</sub> (encoding the four mutations in ORF 1ab). Neither of these was lethal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030005-t002">Table 2</xref>) in BALB/c mice, indicating that SARS-CoV adaptation for BALB/c mice involves mutations in at least two and possibly three genes (S + ORF 1ab, M + ORF 1ab, or S + M + ORF 1ab). Although recombinant viruses bearing two or four of the mutations were not lethal, each had a different phenotype than that of SARS-CoV (Urbani). It is possible that the mutations in S and M contribute to increased viremia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030005-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) and that the mutations in ORF 1ab contribute to increased pathogenicity indicated by weight loss (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030005-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Both quantitative virology and IHC analysis of the lungs of MA15-infected mice indicate extraordinarily high levels of viral replication in pulmonary tissues as early as 24 h.p.i., and the level of replication remains high through day 4 p.i. Unlike SARS-CoV–infected mice, in which viral antigen is detected by IHC staining at modest levels in bronchial epithelium and in alveolar pneumocytes on days 1 and 2 p.i., the bronchial epithelium of MA15-infected mice is replete with viral antigen at day 1 p.i., as are alveolar pneumocytes on days 1 and 2 p.i. By day 3 p.i., viral antigen is rarely detected in the lungs of SARS-CoV–infected mice; in contrast, viral antigen remains abundant in pneumocytes, necrotic debris, and pyknotic cells in MA15-infected mice through day 4 p.i.</p>
              <p>In this model, day 3 to day 4 p.i. seems to be a critical time for the outcome of SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV (Urbani)–infected mice demonstrate a pronounced but transient interstitial inflammation at day 3 p.i. that is absent in MA15-infected mice. This transient inflammation is not associated with significant weight loss but coincides with the beginning of viral clearance from the lungs. In contrast, by day 3 p.i., MA15 virus–infected mice lose weight, and necrotic cellular debris begins to fill the bronchioles and alveoli. By day 4 p.i., MA15-infected mice have lost in excess of 20% of their initial body weight, and several die without other overt clinical signs such as ataxia, paralysis, hunched posture, etc. Viral titers in lungs of MA15-infected mice are up to 1,000-fold higher than those in SARS-CoV–infected mice by 24 h.p.i. and remain higher than peak levels in SARS-CoV–infected mice through day 4 p.i. In situ hybridization further confirms the intense and persistent signal of MA15 (and rMA15) vRNA in lung tissues at day 4 p.i. when vRNA from SARS-CoV (Urbani) and the non-lethal rMA15<sub>SM</sub> and rMA15<sub>ORF1ab</sub> viruses are less abundant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030005-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Objective data related to respiratory distress such as plethysmography and measurement of blood gases could not be collected because of practical and logistical constraints on experiments carried out in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. However, our findings indicate that MA15 virus–infected mice die as a result of overwhelming pulmonary viral infection and destruction of bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes. Viral load in SARS cases was an important determinant of severe disease and death [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the mechanism of disease leading to fatal outcome in human cases of SARS may be different than that observed in MA15-infected BALB/c mice. The mechanism of death following SARS-CoV infection in humans, and particularly the relative contribution of virus-induced damage and immunopathology, are not fully understood. The histopathology documented in the mice infected with the MA15 virus includes a rapid progression and extensive damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030005-g007">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030005-g006">6</xref>B), but it does not show some features such as alveolar edema and hyaline membranes that were reported in many SARS-CoV–infected patients, or in aged mice infected with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This can be explained by the relative virulence of the MA15 strain, and the time p.i. when the lungs were evaluated. Mice infected with the MA15 virus developed severe morbidity and died within 3 to 5 d following infection and did not survive long enough to show progression of the diffuse alveolar damage seen in aged mice or in human patients, who survive for a relatively prolonged length of time before succumbing to complications of the acute infection. In aged mice following SARS-CoV infection, histopathologic changes indicative of progressive diffuse alveolar damage, including proteinaceous deposits around alveolar walls and intraalveolar edema, are seen beginning on day 5 [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>The rapid progression of infection and the extensive and persistent pulmonary replication of the virus are accompanied by viremia and detection of virus in extrapulmonary sites, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the increased pathogenicity of the MA15 virus. A prolonged viremic state or a secondary viremia is seen in mice infected with MA15 and rMA15 that is not observed following infection with the recombinant SARS-CoVs (Urbani), rMA15<sub>SM</sub>, or rMA15<sub>ORF1ab</sub>. The MA15 virus model captures viremia and multi-organ involvement noted in human SARS patients [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, as in all SARS cases, the primary site of infection is the lung.</p>
              <p>Perfusion of tissues harvested from mice in these experiments was not performed, and therefore, we cannot be certain that the detection of vRNA in various extrapulmonary sites in MA15-inoculated mice is not due to virus carried to and remaining in the organs and blood. However, on days 2 through 4 p.i., MA15-specific mRNAs in various tissues are detected at a higher frequency and signal intensity than in whole blood, and the presence of MA15 vRNA in extrapulmonary tissues is detected by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, infectious virus was detected on day 1 p.i. in homogenates of extrapulmonary tissues when RT-PCR of RNA from blood did not amplify any viral specific products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030005-t003">Tables 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030005-t005">5</xref>). Taken together, these observations support a hypothesis that virus is present and replicating at low levels in extrapulmonary tissues.</p>
              <p>In BALB/c mice infected with MA15 virus or SARS-CoV, significant lymphopenia and neutrophilia were observed compared with pre-infection levels. MA15 virus–infected mice had significantly greater lymphopenia and neutrophilia than SARS-CoV–infected mice, reflecting hematological evidence of increased disease severity following MA15 virus infection. MA15 virus–infected mice also had significantly higher levels of ALP than uninfected or SARS-CoV–infected mice. Elevated levels of ALP, an enzyme found in all tissues, but especially concentrated in the liver, may indicate cell destruction in the liver, intestines, or other tissues. Reports of elevated ALP levels in SARS patients are rare [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but neutrophilia and lymphopenia have been reported frequently in human cases of SARS [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although steroid treatment and secondary bacterial infections may be speculated to be the cause of neutrophilia, some patients with SARS had neutrophilia prior to initiation of steroid treatment and in the absence of bacterial infections [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, elevated absolute neutrophil counts at presentation were independent indicators of severe outcome of SARS in human cases [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The definitive causes of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and elevated ALP levels have not been identified in human cases of SARS or in this mouse model.</p>
              <p>The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV MA15 virus will be a valuable tool in evaluating SARS-CoV vaccines and antiviral therapy. Quantitative virology was the only outcome measure available in young BALB/c mice challenged with SARS-CoV (Urbani). Because the MA15 virus replicates rapidly to high titer and is lethal for young BALB/c mice, this virus provides a more stringent challenge than the SARS-CoV (Urbani) virus in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions or prevention strategies. Prophylaxis that is able to rescue MA15-infected mice from a lethal outcome must lower viral burden in lungs very rapidly (e.g., within the first 24 h). Prophylaxis that accomplishes such reduction in the burden of MA15 virus may also reduce the severity of immunopathology that follows. A reduction of immunopathology was demonstrated in a SARS-CoV hamster model when a monoclonal antibody specific to SARS-CoV spike protein administered the day after infection was able to arrest a further rise in viral titer in the lungs [<xref rid="ppat-0030005-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. If similar protection can be demonstrated against challenge with MA15 virus in BALB/c mice, the efficacy of intervention will be well proven.</p>
              <p>Infection of young BALB/c mice with the MA15 virus provides a model that is small and accessible and that can be evaluated extensively at an immunological level. Finally, and most importantly, MA15 virus infection of young BALB/c mice provides many elements that replicate observations in acute (and chronic) cases of SARS infection in humans, including sequence changes during adaptation in several genes (nsp 5, nsp 13, S, and M); viral replication and histopathological changes in lungs of infected animals; viremia; detection of vRNA in extrapulmonary sites, including the intestines; clinical indicators of illness, including mortality; and changes in blood counts, including lymphopenia and neutrophilia. The availability of a molecular clone of the MA15 virus, and the ability to generate additional SARS-CoV recombinant viruses that recapitulate the in vivo phenotype, will allow for detailed probing of the mechanisms mediating SARS-CoV pathogenesis and acute lung damage.</p>

In brief, for each mutation two overlapping amplicons were generated by PCR, joined at primer-introduced BsmBI sites, and ligated into a cDNA of icSARS-CoV using two unique restriction sites that flanked the mutation of interest. PCR reactions were performed with Expand Long Taq (Roche Applied Sciences, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche-applied-science.com">http://www.roche-applied-science.com</ext-link>) in 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and extensions at 68 °C for 1 min using the following primers on plasmids encoding portions of the icSARS-CoV genome: for the mutation at nucleotide position 10384, primer pairs 5′-10124 (<sc>5′-CATGT CATTT GCACA GCAG</sc>) and 3′-10364C (5′-ATTAG GTCTC ATGGC ACAC) and 5′-10384T&gt;A (5′-AGACC TAATT ATACC ATTAA AG) and 3′-11091C (5′-CAAGC ACAAG AATGC GTGC) were used. A second PCR amplification using primers 5′-10124 and 3′-11091C produced a PCR product that was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BglII, Mfe1) and ligated into the icSARS-CoV cDNA plasmid. Similarly, the 10793 mutation was constructed using primer pairs 5′-10124 and 3′-10770C (5′-CTTTC AAAGC AGCAC ACATA TC) and 5′-10793A&gt;C (5′-GAAAG CGCTG CTGCA GAATG) and 3′-11091C, followed by amplification with primers 5′-10124 and 3′-11091C. This PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BglII and Mfe1) and ligated into the icSARS-CoV cDNA plasmid. The 12814 mutation was similarly constructed using the primer pairs 5′-M13R3 and 3′-SARS D mu1(−) (5′-NNNCG TCTCG TTCCA GTTCT GCGTA AATTG TACCT GTACC) and 5′ SARS Dmu1(+) (5′-NNNCG TCTCT GGAAC CACCT TGTAG GTTTG) and 3′ D1500(−) (5′-CCCTG TAGAC GACAT CAGTAC). The two resulting amplicons were joined following digestion (with BsmBI) and purification (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen). The product DNA was digested with BamHI and AclI and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA. The 16177 mutation was constructed using primers 5′-16004 (5′-CATCCTAATCAGGAGTATGC) and 3′-16157C (5′-CACCTACAGCCTGCAAGAC) and primers 5′-16177C&gt;T (5′-GCTGTAGGTGTTTGTGTATTG) and 3′-18044C (CTTTATATCAACGCTGAGGTG). Primers 5′-16004 and 3′-18044C were used to amplify the appropriate fragment that was purified and digested with PflMI and BbvCI, and ligated into an icSARS-CoV cDNA. The 22797 mutation was constructed using primer pairs 5′ #38 (5′-AGAGG AACTG CTGTA ATGTC TC) and 3′ SMAS MuS(−) (5′-NNNCG TCTCT ATGAT TACCA GTTGA AGTAG CATC) and 5′ SMAS SMuS(+) (5′-NNNCG TCTCA TCATAA TTATA AATAT AGGTA TCTTA GACAT GG) and 3′ SARS E 4592(−) (5′-CTAGC ACAAA TGCCA GCTCC). The two resulting amplicons were joined following digestion (with BsmBI) and purification and ligation. The full-length product was digested and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA utilizing restriction endonuclease sites AgeI and SalI. The 26428 mutation was constructed using primer sets 5′ #44 (5′-TGATCCTCTGCAACCTGAGC) and 3′ SMAS MuM(−) (5′-NNNCGTCTCACGGTAATAGTACCGTTGTCTGC) and 5′ SMAS MuM(+) (5′-NNNCGTCTCTACCGTTGAGAAGCTTAAACAACTCC) and 3′ SARS X5(−) (5′-NNNNNTTAATTAATTAATTTGTTCGTTTATTTAAAACAACA). Resulting amplicons were ligated following digestion with BsmBI. The mutation-containing product was digested and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA at SwaI and NdeI restriction sites. In all cases, the final plasmids and the mutations in the plaque-purified viruses were verified by RT-PCR and sequencing.</p>

                  <p>BALB/c mice were infected with SAR-CoV (Urbani), rMA15<sub>SM</sub>, rMA15<sub>ORF1ab</sub>, rMA15, or MA15 virus. Lungs were harvested on days 2 and 4 p.i., and in situ hybridization was performed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. No specific signal was observed with a control riboprobe at any time point, while SARS-CoV–N specific signal was readily apparent within the lungs for all five viruses at day 2 p.i. In contrast, at day 4 p.i., abundant SARS-CoV–specific in situ signal was observed in lungs of mice infected with the lethal MA15 virus or the lethal recombinant rMA15, but not in lungs of mice infected with the non-lethal sub-clones or SARS-CoV (Urbani).</p>
