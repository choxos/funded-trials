                  <p>To the authors' knowledge, information regarding whether daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) reduces central line‚Äìassociated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in pediatric oncology patients and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is limited.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In the current multicenter, randomized, double‚Äêblind, placebo‚Äêcontrolled trial, patients aged ‚â•2 months and &lt;22 years with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT were randomized 1:1 to once‚Äêdaily bathing with 2% CHG‚Äêimpregnated cloths or control cloths for 90 days.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The study was stopped early because of poor accrual. Among the 177 enrolled patients, 174 were considered as evaluable (88 were randomized to the CHG group and 86 were randomized to the control group). The rate of CLABSI per 1000 central line days in the CHG group was 5.44 versus 3.10 in the control group (risk difference, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.05‚Äê4.69 [<italic>P</italic> = .049]). Post hoc conditional power analysis demonstrated a 0.2% chance that the results would have favored CHG had the study fully enrolled. The rate of total positive blood cultures did not differ between groups (risk difference, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, ‚àí0.41 to 5.14 [<italic>P</italic> = .078]). The number of patients demonstrating the new acquisition of resistant organisms did not differ between groups (<italic>P</italic> = .54). Patients in the CHG group were found to be more likely to acquire cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with an elevated CHG mean inhibitory concentration (<italic>P</italic> = .032).</p>

              <p>Central line‚Äìassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and infections due to resistant organisms are prevalent and serious health care‚Äìassociated infections experienced by patients with cancer.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0001" ref-type="ref"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0002" ref-type="ref"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref> Daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) has been identified as a strategy with which to reduce CLABSI and the acquisition of resistant organisms and is recommended in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter‚Äìrelated infections.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0004" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref> To the best of our knowledge, the majority of studies regarding CHG bathing focus on critically ill patients with temporary, nontunneled central venous catheters (CVCs). It is important to study CHG in patients with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients because they often have tunneled CVCs and are likely to experience infections resulting from the translocation of bacteria across mucosal barriers due to graft‚Äêversus‚Äêhost disease, neutropenia, or mucositis. Collectively, these are situations in which topical antisepsis may not impact infection risk. The few studies of CHG bathing performed in patients with cancer did not demonstrate a benefit, but they were retrospective and underpowered.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0005" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>The primary objective of the current study was to determine whether CHG bathing reduces the rate of CLABSI in children with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT. Secondary objectives were to determine whether CHG bathing reduced the acquisition of resistant organisms in this population and whether CHG bathing was associated with the acquisition of cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with elevated CHG minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).</p>

              <title>Materials and Methods</title>
              <p>The current study was a randomized, double‚Äêblind, placebo‚Äêcontrolled trial conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) at 36 centers in the United States and Canada, enrolling patients at high risk of CLABSI. Eligible patients were aged ‚â•2 months and &lt;22 years, were receiving treatment for an oncology diagnosis or were undergoing allogeneic HCT, and had an eligible CVC that was intended to remain in place for ‚â•3 months. Oncology patients were required to have a plan to receive chemotherapy for ‚â•3 months and could undergo autologous or allogeneic HCT during the 3‚Äêmonth period. Eligible CVCs included external tunneled CVCs; for patients with acute myeloid leukemia or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia or those undergoing allogeneic HCT, nontunneled, percutaneously inserted CVCs also were allowed.</p>
              <p>Exclusion criteria were receipt of treatment for a central line infection within the last 14 days, an allergy or hypersensitivity to CHG, severe generalized skin breakdown, a plan to receive prophylactic broad‚Äêspectrum antibiotics or prophylactic antimicrobial central line locks, a plan to receive sorafenib, or being pregnant or breastfeeding.</p>
              <p>The study was approved by the National Cancer Institute's pediatric Central Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRBs at participating institutions. Participants or their guardians provided written informed consent and assent (if appropriate).</p>
              <p>Due to unexpectedly slow accrual, several strategies and protocol modifications aimed at improving recruitment were used (see <xref rid="cncr33271-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref> for details).</p>
              <sec id="cncr33271-sec-0007">
                <title>Randomization and Masking</title>
                <p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to daily bathing with CHG or control bathing using the computerized COG study management system. Due to expected differences in CLABSI rates, randomization was stratified by myeloablative or reduced‚Äêintensity allogeneic HCT, nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT, and an oncology diagnosis with receipt of chemotherapy with or without a subsequent HCT.</p>
                <p>CHG and control products were manufactured by Sage Products LLC (Cary, Illinois) using identical packaging, wipe material, and secondary ingredients. Only the Investigational Drug Service at the coordinating center (Seattle Children's Hospital) knew what product was assigned to each patient.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="cncr33271-sec-0008">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Patients underwent once‚Äêdaily bathing for 90 days with either 2% CHG‚Äêimpregnated cloths or cloths impregnated with mild cleansers (Comfort Bath; Sage Products LLC) regardless of inpatient or outpatient status (see <xref rid="cncr33271-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref> for further details and modifications).</p>
                <p>In August 2016, Sage Products LLC initiated a nationwide recall of a barrier cream cloth (not used in the current study) because of <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex contamination. Other washcloth products manufactured in the same facility also were recalled, including some lots of the study product. All patients and IRBs were notified of the recall, study bathing was stopped (9 patients in the CHG group and 11 patients in the control group), and further enrollment was paused. Enrollment resumed 3 months later with the supply of new study product.</p>
                <p>Adherence was monitored by counting the study cloths remaining approximately halfway through the study (day 45¬±7) and at the end of the study period (day 90¬±7). For patients who discontinued protocol therapy before the end of the study period, adherence data were obtained at the time they discontinued protocol therapy. Daily diaries were used to collect information regarding soap‚Äêand‚Äêwater bathing, nonprotocol CHG bathing, and type(s) of lotion used.</p>
                <p>To assess ease of use and overall satisfaction, patients (or caregivers) were asked to complete a survey at the end of protocol therapy (when the subject completed planned therapy at day 90 or at the time of withdrawal from protocol therapy).</p>
                <p>Skin swabs of the neck and axilla were collected at baseline, at day 45 (¬±7 days), and at day 90 (¬±7 days) to assess the MIC in skin staphylococcal isolates (see <xref rid="cncr33271-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref> for additional detail).

                <p>Blood cultures were evaluated for CLABSI using the January 2015 criteria from the CDC.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref> Study sites submitted clinical and microbiology laboratory reports to a central database. Two blinded investigators (D.M.Z. and A.M.M.) independently used these data and CDC criteria to categorize blood cultures as CLABSI‚Äìmucosal barrier injury (MBI), CLABSI‚Äìnon‚ÄêMBI, non‚ÄêCLABSI contaminant, and non‚ÄêCLABSI secondary bloodstream infection (BSI). The CDC definition for repeat infection time frame was used to determine whether a new positive blood culture was considered a new infection. In addition, an event was categorized as a repeat infection if it occurred outside of the CDC repeat infection time frame but with the same organism(s), within 4 weeks of the previous infection, and in association with the same CVC (there was 1 event that was classified as a repeat infection). Discordant decisions were resolved by consensus.</p>
                <p>To assess resistant organisms, study sites submitted microbiology laboratory reports for all cultures (both sterile and nonsterile) that were positive for a targeted organism during the study period, and in the year prior to enrollment.

                <p>The primary outcome was CLABSI and included both CLABSI‚Äìnon‚ÄêMBI and CLABSI‚ÄêMBI. Secondary outcomes were the total number of positive blood cultures, the acquisition of resistant organisms (resistant organisms identified during the study period that were not identified in the year prior to enrollment), and the acquisition of cutaneous <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> with elevated CHG MICs (cutaneous <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> isolated from a follow‚Äêup swab with a CHG MIC ‚â•4 ug/mL in a patient without a resistant <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> isolated from a baseline swab).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The study design assumed a constant rate of CLABSI of 5 per 1000 central line days in the control group and that patients would be observed for 90 days for the outcome. Under these assumptions, simulation determined that 400 evaluable patients (200 patients per group) would be required to detect a CLABSI rate difference of 2 per 1000 central line days with 85% power and a 2‚Äêsided alpha of .05 using a Poisson regression model. The maximum sample size was increased to 450 patients to account for ineligible patients and the loss of at‚Äêrisk days in some patients because of days without a CVC. Given the lower than expected accrual, another power analysis was performed assuming 174 patients (87 patients in each group), a constant rate of CLABSI of 5 per 1000 central line days in the control group, and that patients were observed for an average of 74 days for CLABSI.</p>
                <p>All primary analyses were modified intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat analyses in that all evaluable patients were included regardless of compliance with the assigned therapy. Participants who discontinued protocol therapy prior to day 90 continued to be observed for primary and secondary outcomes unless consent was withdrawn or the patient died. Patients could contribute multiple events and rates were calculated per 1000 at‚Äêrisk days (days on study with a CVC). Patients whose CVC was discontinued early did not contribute their days without a CVC as ‚Äúat‚Äêrisk days.‚Äù Primary analysis compared the rate of CLABSI between the 2 groups using Poisson regression adjusting for the stratification factor using the duration of days on study with CVC as an offset. Secondary analysis of the primary outcome compared time to first CLABSI using the Kaplan‚ÄêMeier method and log‚Äêrank test. Time to event was defined as time from the initiation of protocol bathing to first CLABSI, last patient contact, or day 90 on study, whichever occurred first.</p>
                <p>Total blood cultures were compared between groups using Poisson regression, similar to the primary analysis. Acquisition of resistant organisms and the acquisition of cutaneous staphylococci with elevated CHG MICs both were compared between groups using a stratified Cochran Mantel‚ÄêHaenszel chi‚Äêsquare test. A post hoc analysis using the chi‚Äêsquare test was performed to compare elevated CHG MICs between groups within each HCT and oncology cohort separately. Only those patients who contributed a baseline swab and at least 1 follow‚Äêup swab (day 45 and/or day 90) were included in the elevated CHG MIC analysis. For skin isolates, descriptive statistics were reported for the total number of isolates, total number of isolates per patient, and CHG MIC.</p>
                <p>Given the early study closure, we conducted a post hoc analysis estimating the probability of favoring CHG assuming the design alternative hypothesis for the remaining unenrolled patients had the study fully enrolled the planned 400 evaluable patients (see <xref rid="cncr33271-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Additional post hoc analyses included the effect of CHG on rates of CLABSI‚ÄêMBI, CLABSI‚Äìnon‚ÄêMBI, non‚ÄêCLABSI contaminant, and non‚ÄêCLABSI secondary BSI separately. An additional Poisson regression of the primary outcome adjusted for the underlying oncology diagnosis (due to potential imbalance) was performed. In addition, given the number of patients who discontinued protocol therapy early and the variations in compliance, we performed a per‚Äêprotocol analysis including only those patients who had a &gt;80% adherence rate at day 45 and day 90 (or when removed from protocol therapy). This analysis considered events and days at risk that occurred up to the last date protocol therapy was used. Product count data were available for 165 patients (94%) (82 patients in the CHG group and 83 patients in the control group), and 111 patients met the adherence rate criteria to be included in this analysis. Limitations of per‚Äêprotocol analyses are acknowledged in the <xref rid="cncr33271-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>
                <p>Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) or R statistical software (version 3.4.2; R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and a 2‚Äêsided <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Due to multiple comparisons regarding elevated CHG MIC outcome, the significance level for these analyses was adjusted using the Bonferroni method so that <italic>P</italic> &lt; .017 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

              <p>Between November 4, 2013, and April 21, 2017, a total of 177 patients were randomized. Enrollment was stopped early due to slow accrual, following the recommendation of the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Board. After excluding 1 unevaluable patient (patient withdrew consent immediately after randomization) and 2 ineligible patients, a total of 174 evaluable patients were included in the analyses (Fig. <xref rid="cncr33271-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

              <p>For the primary outcome, the estimated adjusted rate of CLABSI per 1000 central line days was 5.44 in the CHG group compared with 3.1 in the control group (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.76 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.00‚Äê3.08; <italic>P</italic> = .049]; risk difference, 2.37 [95% CI, 0.05‚Äê4.67]) (Table <xref rid="cncr33271-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). On the basis of the sample size included in the analysis and the observed average of 74 days at risk per patient, there was 44% power to detect the original proposed difference of 2 CLABSIs per 1000 central line days. The results did not change after adjusting for the underlying diagnosis. The estimated 90‚Äêday cumulative incidence of CLABSI was 34.6% (95% CI, 25.1%‚Äê46.4%) in the CHG group and 24.1% (95% CI, 16.1%‚Äê35.3%) in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = .091 using the log‚Äêrank test) (Fig. <xref rid="cncr33271-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The post hoc conditional power analysis showed a 0.2% chance that CHG would have demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the CLABSI rate compared with the control group if the study had fully enrolled. A post hoc per‚Äêprotocol analysis of the primary outcome demonstrated trends similar to those of the intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat analysis and the result was not statistically significant (see Supporting Table <xref rid="cncr33271-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>)</p>

              <p>The number of patients demonstrating the new acquisition of resistant organisms was 13 of 88 patients in the CHG group (15%) and 10 of 86 patients in the control group (12%) (risk difference, 3.10%; 95% CI, ‚àí6.9% to 13.2% [<italic>P</italic> = .540]).

The vast majority of study isolates were coagulase‚Äênegative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, with <italic>S. aureus</italic> accounting for only 3% of the isolates. The number of isolates were 485 isolates and 558 isolates, respectively, for the CHG and control groups.

              <p>The use of CHG for line care was similar between the groups (41% in the CHG group vs 50% in the control group). During the study period, only 9 patients received CHG bathing while in the pediatric intensive care unit (5 in the CHG group vs 4 in the control group).</p>

              <p>In the current study, CHG bathing did not reduce the risk of CLABSI, total blood cultures, or the acquisition of resistant organisms in children with cancer and pediatric HCT recipients with an external CVC. Although the study was closed early due to slow accrual, conditional power analysis of the primary outcome (CLABSI) demonstrated a 0.2% chance that the results would have favored CHG had the study been fully enrolled. In addition, post hoc per‚Äêprotocol analysis demonstrated a trend similar to that of the intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat analysis. Finally, patients randomized to CHG were at a higher risk of acquiring cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with elevated CHG MICs.</p>
              <p>Results from the primary CLABSI analysis favored the control group, although the level of significance was marginal. There are 2 potential explanations. First, as with any statistical test, by design there is a 5% chance of committing a type I error (false‚Äêpositive or the null hypothesis is falsely rejected). In the case that the null hypothesis is true, the result should equally favor the intervention or control group. The second possibility is that there is something about the intervention that directly or indirectly increased the risk of CLABSI; however, we were unable to conceive of a hypothesis that would explain such an effect.</p>
              <p>The finding that CHG failed to reduce CLABSI in patients with cancer and HCT recipients is consistent with what to the best of our knowledge are the 2 existing studies conducted in patients with cancer.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0005" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> Reasons for the differential effect of CHG in critically ill patients compared with oncology and HCT patients may be related to the pathogenesis of BSIs, with translocation of bacteria across mucosal surfaces being more significant in those receiving cancer therapies. However, this hypothesis is not directly supported by the post hoc analysis, in which the effect of CHG against CLABSI‚ÄêMBI and CLABSI‚Äìnon‚ÄêMBI appeared similar. It also is possible that CVCs tend to be temporary in critically ill patients whereas CVCs in patients with cancer and HCT recipients often are tunneled with a cuff and in place for prolonged periods, possibly modifying the potential benefits of CHG.</p>
              <p>In contrast to the findings of the current study, several trials performed in critically ill adults have demonstrated a reduction in BSI with the use of CHG,<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0011" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0012" ref-type="ref"><sup>12</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0013" ref-type="ref"><sup>13</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0014" ref-type="ref"><sup>14</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0015" ref-type="ref"><sup>15</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0016" ref-type="ref"><sup>16</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0018" ref-type="ref"><sup>18</sup></xref> although results have varied among the 4 randomized controlled trials conducted in this population.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0011" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0013" ref-type="ref"><sup>13</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0019" ref-type="ref"><sup>19</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0020" ref-type="ref"><sup>20</sup></xref> Two studies demonstrated a benefit of CHG in reducing BSI<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0011" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0013" ref-type="ref"><sup>13</sup></xref> whereas 2 studies did not.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0019" ref-type="ref"><sup>19</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0020" ref-type="ref"><sup>20</sup></xref> Moreover, a recent cluster randomized trial in non‚Äìcritically ill hospitalized adults did not find a benefit to CHG in their primary analysis, but did find a benefit among patients with medical devices in post hoc analyses.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0021" ref-type="ref"><sup>21</sup></xref> To the best of our knowledge, there exists 1 randomized trial of CHG bathing performed in critically ill children.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0022" ref-type="ref"><sup>22</sup></xref> This was a 5‚Äêcenter, cluster randomized, controlled trial that demonstrated a nonsignificant reduction in BSI associated with CHG bathing in the intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat analysis, but a statistically significantly lower incidence of BSI associated with CHG bathing in the per‚Äêprotocol analysis.</p>

              <p>We also found that CHG exposure was associated with the acquisition of cutaneous staphylococci isolates with CHG MICs ‚â•4 ug/mL. To our knowledge, what constitutes clinically meaningful resistance to CHG and its associated implications remains largely undefined.

              <p>To the best of our knowledge, few controlled trials of CHG bathing have performed systematic assessments for adverse events. Among critically ill adults, Climo et al reported skin reactions in approximately 1.9% of patients in the CHG group versus 3.4% in the controls.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0013" ref-type="ref"><sup>13</sup></xref> Among critically ill children, Milstone et al<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0022" ref-type="ref"><sup>22</sup></xref> reported rashes in 3% of the CHG group compared with 1% of controls; however, only 1.2% of patients had a rash attributed to CHG. Cutaneous adverse events were not reported in the 2 previous oncology studies.<xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0005" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cncr33271-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> We found that cutaneous adverse events occurred in approximately 24% of patients in the CHG groups versus 15% of the control group. Although the frequencies of adverse events at least possibly attributable to the intervention were much lower (10% and 7%, respectively), the rates of cutaneous adverse events were higher than documented in other studies. This may reflect the sensitivity of the skin in pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy or merely indicate a difference in outcome ascertainment.</p>
              <p>The strengths of the current study included the multicenter, double‚Äêblind, randomized design and the blinded central adjudication of the primary outcome. In addition, the inclusion of an outcome that considered cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with elevated CHG MICs provided a balancing measure of potential risk. Its major limitations were the large number of patients who discontinued the study early and the early closure due to poor accrual, resulting in a small sample size and low power to detect hypothesized differences between the treatment and control groups. One reason for the poor accrual was the adoption of CHG bathing as the standard of care at many COG institutions. Although we conducted a post hoc conditional power analysis, it is important to emphasize that the findings may not have reflected the result that would have been observed had the trial been completed as planned. Nonetheless, considering the results of this sensitivity analysis, the likelihood that patients in the CHG group fared better than those in the control group appears to be very small. Other limitations included the fact that we did not have standardized approaches for CLABSI prevention or for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility.</p>
              <p>Although the current study had limitations, the results suggested that CHG bathing did not reduce rates of CLABSI, total blood cultures, or the acquisition of resistant organisms in children with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT. CHG exposure was associated with the acquisition of cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with elevated CHG MICs. Ideally, data from fully enrolled randomized controlled trials would be used to guide practice change; however, at this time, there is no evidence that CHG bathing offers a benefit to children with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT. Developers of clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of CLABSI will need to incorporate the results of this trial into their analysis of the aggregated evidence to determine whether the widely adopted practice of using CHG wipes in pediatric oncology and HCT patients should continue, and hospitals must carefully consider whether the potential benefit of using CHG in patients with cancer outweighs the potential harm.</p>
