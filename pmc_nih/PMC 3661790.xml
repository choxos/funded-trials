                  <p>Type 2 diabetes increases cardiovascular risk. We examined lipid profiles and inflammatory markers in 699 youth with recent-onset type 2 diabetes in the TODAY clinical trial and compared changes across treatment groups: metformin alone (M), metformin plus rosiglitazone (M+R), and metformin plus intensive lifestyle program (M+L).</p>

                  <p>Multiethnic youth with type 2 diabetes received M, M+R, or M+L. Statin drugs were begun for LDL cholesterol (LDL) ≥130 mg/dL or triglycerides ≥300 mg/dL. Lipids, apolipoprotein B (apoB), LDL particle size, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were measured over 36 months or until loss of glycemic control.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>LDL, apoB, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol (HDL) rose over 12 months and then stabilized over the next 24 months. Participants with LDL ≥130 mg/dL or using LDL-lowering therapy increased from 4.5 to 10.7% over 36 months, while 55.9% remained at LDL goal (&lt;100 mg/dL) over that time. Treatment group did not impact LDL, apoB, or non-HDL. Small dense LDL (particle size, ≤0.263 relative flotation rate) was most common in M. Triglycerides were lower in M+L than M, and M+L attenuated the negative effect of hyperglycemia on triglycerides and HDL in females. hsCRP, PAI-1, and homocysteine increased over time. However, hsCRP was lower in M+R compared with M or M+L.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>Dyslipidemia and chronic inflammation were common in youth with type 2 diabetes and worsened over time. Diabetes treatment, despite some treatment group differences in lipid and inflammatory marker change over time, is generally inadequate to control this worsening risk.</p>

          <body>
            <p>The marked increase in type 2 diabetes in adolescents and youth has raised the specter of early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in affected individuals. In adults with type 2 diabetes, the risks of diabetes-specific microvascular complications are largely related to the level of glycemia and duration of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Indicators of atherosclerosis, or macrovascular disease, are already present in youth with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Youth with type 2 diabetes are known to have higher levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol (HDL) and lower levels of HDL than youth without diabetes or youth with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Elevated inflammatory markers have also been reported in adolescents with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, the true prevalence of dyslipidemia and the proinflammatory state in youth and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, the evolution of risk over time, and whether glucose-lowering interventions ameliorate the atherogenic profile are unknown. The TODAY study provides the opportunity to address these critical questions and determine whether three diabetes treatments differentially affected cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
            <p>TODAY was a multiethnic, multicenter clinical trial of newly diagnosed children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes randomized to one of three interventions: metformin alone (M; <italic>n</italic> = 232), metformin plus rosiglitazone (M+R; <italic>n</italic> = 233), or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle program (M+L; <italic>n</italic> = 234) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The primary results have recently been published in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Briefly, of the 699 TODAY participants, 319 (45.6%) reached the primary outcome (loss of glycemic control defined as HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥8% [64 mmol/mol] for 6 months or inability to wean from temporary insulin therapy within 3 months after metabolic decompensation) over an average follow-up of 3.86 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Regarding glycemic control, M+R was superior to M (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006); M+L was intermediate but not different from M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
            <p>We hypothesized that <italic>1</italic>) lipid profiles (LDL, non-HDL, apolipoprotein B [apoB], LDL particle density, triglycerides, and HDL) and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity c-reactive protein [hsCRP], homocysteine, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], and nonesterified fatty acids [NEFA]) would indicate increased CVD risk in youth with recent-onset type 2 diabetes; <italic>2</italic>) in the setting of standardized protocol-driven clinical management of hyperlipidemia in a randomized clinical trial for 36 months (or until attainment of primary outcome, loss of glycemic control), cardiovascular risk change would improve more with M+R and M+L than with M. Associations of race-ethnicity and sex with differences in dyslipidemia and inflammatory markers were also assessed.</p>

                <title>TODAY study design</title>
                <p>The study design has been reported in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Briefly, the collaborative study group included 15 clinical centers, a data-coordinating center, and a central laboratory (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2388/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). At baseline (July 2004–February 2009), eligible individuals were 10–17 years of age with type 2 diabetes diagnosed &lt;2 years at time of randomization and with a BMI ≥85th percentile. During a prerandomization 2–6-month run-in period, all participants received standard diabetes education. After randomization, participants attended clinic visits for purposes of medical management every 2 months in the first year and quarterly thereafter; outcome data were collected at baseline, 6 months, and annually.</p>
                <p>The lifestyle program was designed to work with pharmacotherapy to improve diabetes control in youth through sustained, moderate weight loss (7–10% of initial body weight or the equivalent for youth still growing in height). The program, as previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), consisted of family-based behavioral change delivered in a series of in-person visits during the first 2 years, followed by continued contact at quarterly medical visits. Primary behavior-change targets included energy-balance behaviors (dietary and physical activity) and family involvement/support. A trained interventionist delivered the program one-on-one to the youth and family using materials specifically developed for TODAY (e.g., manuals, booklets, logs, and fact sheets).</p>
                <p>Lipid goals were defined in the study protocol as LDL &lt;100 mg/dL and triglycerides &lt;150 mg/dL. If lipid levels were outside the target range, initial therapy involved dietary counseling. If LDL levels remained ≥130 mg/dL or if triglyceride levels remained 300–599 mg/dL after 6 months of nutrition and diabetes management, pharmacological treatment with atorvastatin was initiated and adjusted to achieve target goals according to an algorithm based on lipid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). If triglycerides were ≥600 mg/dL, fibrate therapy could be initiated at the discretion of the physician. Additional cardiovascular risk factors, including LDL particle density, apoB, NEFA, hsCRP, PAI-1, and homocysteine levels, were measured throughout the TODAY trial.</p>
                <p>The protocol was approved by an External Evaluation Committee convened by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health and by the Institutional Review Boards for the Protection of Human Subjects of each participating institution. All participants provided informed consent, and minor children confirmed assent according to local guidelines. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board convened by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reviewed progress, safety, and interim analyses throughout the study.</p>

                  <p>Measurements of fasting total plasma cholesterol, cholesterol in the lipoprotein fractions, and triglycerides were performed enzymatically on a Roche Modular P autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), standardized to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Reference Methods. HDL was measured after precipitation of apoB-containing particles by dextran sulfate Mg<sup>2+</sup>. LDL was calculated by the Friedewald equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), except if triglyceride levels were &gt;400 mg/dL, in which case ultracentrifugation was performed using the Lipid Research Clinic Beta Quantification procedure. Non-HDL was defined as the difference between total cholesterol and HDL. The interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) were &lt;1.5% for triglycerides and &lt;2% for HDL. LDL physical properties and the flotation distribution of other lipoprotein fractions were determined by a single ultracentrifugation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). LDL buoyancy (relative flotation rate [Rf]) was calculated as the LDL peak fraction divided by the total number of fractions collected. The Rf of each plasma sample calculated by this procedure is highly reproducible with CV &lt;1.8%. Small dense LDL was defined as an Rf of ≤0.263. Immunochemical determination of apoB concentration in plasma was performed on the Siemens Nephelometer BN II (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Newark, DE) using Siemens reagents and in-house–prepared calibrator and quality-control materials.</p>

                  <p>Levels of hsCRP in plasma were measured immunochemically using Siemens reagents (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.) on a Siemens nephelometer autoanalyzer (BNII). Homocysteine levels were measured in plasma samples by enzymatic assay with reagents from Axis Shield Inc. (Bothell, WA) on a Roche Modular P analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Measurement of plasma PAI-1 levels was performed using a quantikine ELISA kit from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The assay sensitivity was 0.15 ng/mL, and it was linear up to 20 ng/mL. The interassay CVs for the high, medium, and low PAI-1 controls were 6.1, 6.4, and 9.5%, respectively. Analysis of NEFA was performed using reagents from Wako Diagnostics (Richmond, VA) on a Roche Hitachi Modular P analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).</p>

                <p>Longitudinal data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models to account for the multiple observations per participant (SAS PROC MIXED and PROC GENMOD, version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Standard cutoffs for risk categories were applied to six of the outcomes (LDL, triglycerides, HDL by sex, hsCRP, apoB, and LDL particle size). Analyses included all data available at each of the four annual visit time points (baseline and 12, 24, and 36 months), as long as prior to attainment of the primary outcome. Variables not normally distributed were log-transformed for testing; descriptive summary statistics and plots are presented using the original scale. HDL was analyzed separately for males and females due to the known differential in levels. Effects of treatment group, visit (time), sex, and race-ethnicity (American Indian and Asian combined into "other" category due to sample size) and their interactions were tested.</p>
                <p>Each lipid outcome was regressed on HbA<sub>1c</sub> with treatment group and the treatment-by-HbA<sub>1c</sub> interaction in the model; the effect of BMI was determined by adding BMI as a covariate adjustment. This analysis included follow-up data only (i.e., months 12, 24, and 36) and removed values collected while the participant was taking a lipid-lowering medication.</p>
                <p>The <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 are identified as statistically significant with no adjustment for multiple testing. The TODAY study was powered for the primary time-to-failure outcome only, although secondary analyses were predefined.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>At baseline, the TODAY cohort had a remarkably high prevalence of dyslipidemia compared with age-matched nonobese youth and adolescents without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). More importantly, over the average follow-up of 3.86 years, LDL, non-HDL, and apoB levels, which changed in parallel, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels all rose over time, and a majority of participants had high-risk (low) HDL levels. The percent of TODAY subjects requiring lipid-lowering drugs according to protocol tripled to 10.7%, with a minority achieving LDL goal. In the TODAY study, the only CVD risk factors that appeared to decline over time were the percentages with high-risk HDL and with small, dense, more atherogenic LDL, largely in the first year of follow-up.</p>
              <p>Overall, none of the three diabetes interventions prevented the worsening of CVD risk factors over time; however, treatment differences were observed specifically in the proportion of small dense LDL particles and in hsCRP and homocysteine levels, all of which were more atherogenic in the M group. In general, the benefits of a lifestyle intervention, similar in design to that used in TODAY, on lipoprotein and other CVD risk factors in adult patients with prediabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) were not seen in the TODAY cohort. The exception was that lifestyle intervention appeared to attenuate the relationship between HbA<sub>1c</sub> and triglyceride levels in the entire cohort and between HbA<sub>1c</sub> and HDL levels in females. Whether this effect was related to a greater decrease, albeit small and transient, in adiposity (lower BMI, percent fat mass, waist circumference, and abdominal height) in M+L is unknown. The adverse effects of rosiglitazone on conventional lipid levels demonstrated in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) were not seen in TODAY.</p>
              <p>Ethnicity and sex had an impact on atherogenic profiles. In all three treatment arms, triglyceride levels in NHB were significantly lower than those in both H and NHW. Among NHB, the percentage with high-risk triglycerides was significantly higher in M than in M+L. These results are consistent with ethnic differences in triglycerides in the general population and suggest triglyceride thresholds regarding metabolic risk may need to be ethnicity-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Mean HDL levels in females were well below their high-risk cutoff of &lt;50 mg/dL, while levels in males were quite close to their cutoff of 40 mg/dL. Males had significantly higher homocysteine values than females. The addition of either rosiglitazone or lifestyle increased LDL particle size in females.</p>
              <p>Limitations of the TODAY study included the variable follow-up over time, although the majority of the cohort had assessments at 36 months. Only three racial-ethnic groups were large enough to provide reliable estimates of their effects. Moreover, the adherence to dietary and exercise management and subsequent statin therapy was likely less in our cohort than is generally seen in adults. Specific adherence data for statin therapy in TODAY are not available. It is possible that worsening lipid profiles were secondary to worsening compliance over time rather than to duration of diabetes. However, while adherence to glycemic control medications waned over time in the TODAY trial, adherence remained &gt;70%; therefore, it is likely that adherence to lipid therapy also remained reasonable in this setting. In addition, hsCRP was higher at baseline in the M group, making it possible that the significantly higher levels of hsCRP after treatment were secondary to randomization effects.</p>
              <p>The deteriorating atherogenic and inflammatory risk profile observed in the TODAY cohort over time, despite intensive intervention in the setting of a randomized clinical trial, suggests CVD will become prevalent in the third and fourth decades of life in adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the overall poor psychological health of affected individuals already reported in this cohort will likely further challenge the ability to deliver effective interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Trials of more aggressive interventions, both pharmacologic and behavioral, to lower CVD risk are necessary in this vulnerable population.</p>
