                <p id="P4">Several PI3KÎ´ inhibitors are approved for the therapy of B cell malignancies, but their clinical use has been limited by unpredictable autoimmune toxicity. We have recently reported promising efficacy results treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with combination therapy with the PI3KÎ´Î³ inhibitor duvelisib and fludarabine cyclophosphamide rituximab (FCR) chemoimmunotherapy, but approximately one-third of patients develop autoimmune toxicity. We show here that duvelisib FCR treatment in an upfront setting modulates both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Decreases in naÃ¯ve and central memory CD4 T cells and naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells occur with treatment, while activated CD8 T cells, granzyme positive Tregs and Th17 CD4 and CD8 T cells all increase with treatment, particularly in patients with toxicity. Cytokines associated with Th17 activation (IL-17A and IL-21) are also relatively elevated in patients with toxicity. The only CLL feature associated with toxicity was increased priming for apoptosis at baseline, with a significant decrease during the first week of duvelisib. We conclude that an increase in activated CD8 T cells with activation of Th17 T cells, in the context of lower baseline Tregs and greater CLL resistance to duvelisib, is associated with duvelisib-related autoimmune toxicity.</p>

              <p id="P5">Despite recent therapeutic advances, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains an incurable disease. In randomized clinical trials, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitors (PI3Ki) improve progression-free and overall survival, but at the expense of significant autoimmune toxicities<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Duvelisib is a potent small molecule oral PI3K inhibitor that targets both the p110Î´ and p110Î³ isoforms<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the therapy of relapsed refractory CLL and follicular lymphoma<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The goal of dual isoform inhibition is to achieve cell autonomous tumor inhibition by blocking p110Î´, while also targeting the microenvironment through p110Î³<sup>3</sup>. The PI3KÎ³ isoform modulates macrophage and T cell function, with mice lacking PI3KÎ³ showing increased CD8 T cell activation and cytotoxicity due to transcriptional activation of NFÎºB and inhibition of C/EBPÎ² in macrophages in the microenvironment<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P6">Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by PI3Ki can be severe in a subset of CLL patients<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. These irAEs are more common in younger, less heavily pretreated patients, and in those with mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IGHV)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We conducted a clinical trial in young fit CLL patients in which we combined duvelisib with FCR therapy (dFCR), with the goal of achieving a high rate of undetectable MRD (uMRD) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The regimen was highly effective, with an 88% overall response rate (ORR) and 66% uMRD rate in bone marrow<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. While the therapy was generally well tolerated, nonetheless irAEs included transaminitis (28% grade 3â€“4), arthritis (9% grade 2), and colitis (6% grade 2â€“3) along with some opportunistic infections. These irAEs can resolve with drug hold, or more rapidly with steroids, suggesting an autoimmune mechanism. In this study, we sought to understand duvelisib immunomodulation by evaluating immune cell subset changes that occurred in patients who developed irAEs in this trial. To accomplish this, we used mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) technology to comprehensively interrogate the effects of duvelisib on T cell subsets in patient samples.</p>

                <p id="P15">To determine the immune phenotype differences between pre- and post-treatment PBMC samples in patients who did or did not develop irAEs, we used CyTOF technology to profile serial PBMC samples from 16 patients at screen (n = 16), C1D1 (n = 16), C3R (n = 14), and 6 mo post FCR (n = 6). The absolute number of CD20lo CD3hi cells studied per patient and timepoint is indicated in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Unsupervised analysis of the CyTOF staining data identified 41 clusters of cells with similar phenotypes after doing equal sampling on all patients and all sample timepoints (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The phenotype of each cluster is provided in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Based on the expression of antibody markers, all 41 clusters were broadly assigned to 8 islands, or major phenotypes, belonging to CD4 T, CD8 T, Tregs, Th1, Th17, double positive T (DP T), double negative (DN T) and non-T cell subsets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We focused initially on the clusters significantly altered in patients with toxicity at the C3R timepoint, since this coincided with the timing of many severe irAEs, approximately 3 months after initiation of therapy. We found five significantly altered T cell clusters specifically in patients with toxicity, as well as three altered in patients both with and without toxicity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The clusters altered only in patients with toxicity, namely c1, c3, c6, c24, and c38, are spatially distinct as shown in the viSNE plot, with c1 and c3 belonging to the CD4 T cell island whereas c6, c24 and c38 belong to the CD8 T cell island. The clusters altered in both sets of patients, namely c7, c15, and c34, are all in the CD8 cluster (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

                <title>Changes in specific CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets associated with toxicity on dFCR</title>
                <p id="P17">In our cohort, for patients with significant immune toxicity, we found that within CD3+ T cells, both naÃ¯ve CD4 (cluster 1) and memory CD4 (cluster 3) T cells, as well as naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells (cluster 7), were significantly decreased at C3R (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>â€“<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Decreases in naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T cells are not directly associated with an autoimmune response but could imply that the naÃ¯ve T cells are differentiating into another T cell subset leading to an autoimmune response. These findings are illustrated visually in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, showing serial viSNEs from prior to therapy, after one week of duvelisib monotherapy and at C3R. The patients with toxicity show clear development of an activated CD8 T cell population expressing granzyme B, seen in clusters 6, 2, 24 and 34 at C3 restage, likely reflecting the effector cells driving toxicity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>â€“<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In contrast, no significant changes were seen with clusters 6, 2 or 24 in our no toxicity patient cohort, but c34 did increase in this cohort as well (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). While cluster 2 analyzed individually showed a borderline significant change (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), it showed a very significant difference between patients with toxicity and those without (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P18">We sought to further characterize the cell populations found to be significantly different in the toxicity patients. We first focused on the CD4 clusters, 1 and 3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). An in-depth analysis of these clusters shows the presence and absence of markers to corroborate the heatmap data. Cluster 1 shows high expression of CCR7, CD4, CD127, CD45RA, CD3 and CD25 giving it a characteristic naÃ¯ve CD4 phenotype (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Cluster 3 is comprised of CD127, CD4, CCR9, CD45RO, CD25, CCR4 antibody markers indicating a CD4 central memory phenotype (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We observe a decrease in both these clusters (naÃ¯ve and central memory) with treatment at C3 restage in our patients developing toxicity. Most of this decrease in Cluster 3 occurs during the week of duvelisib monotherapy, while Cluster 1 decreases during monotherapy and even more after the addition of chemotherapy.</p>
                <p id="P19">To further confirm these findings from the clustering algorithm, we performed manual gating on all our samples at all timepoints. Consistent with the clustering data, we found that naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells (CD45RA+ CD45ROâˆ’ CCR7+) decrease at the C3 restage timepoint in patients who develop toxicity whereas the decrease was not significant in the patient cohort without toxicity (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>). The reduction in CD4 T cells across all samples were most likely due to chemoimmunotherapy treatment (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). The CD4:CD8 ratio (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6C</xref>) also shows a significant decrease in all patients at C3 restage, which is driven by the change in patients with toxicity but not significant in patients without toxicity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P20">To further elucidate the inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio, we analyzed clusters 6 and 2 in particular, the large clusters of activated CD8 T cells that increase with treatment selectively in patients with toxicity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Together with the decrease in the CD4 T cell clusters (clusters 1 and 3), these findings likely contribute to the inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio. Cluster 6 expresses HLA-DR, CD38, PD1, T-bet, CD8a, and granzyme B, giving it an activated CD8 phenotype. Clusters 24 and 34 are small clusters with similar activated CD8 phenotype, also increasing at C3R (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Cluster 2 expresses CD8a, CD16, CD38, granzyme B, T-bet and RORÎ³T, consistent with an activated effector CD8 T cell with Th17 differentiation. During therapy, we observe a migration of cluster 7 to cluster 6 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), implicating the conversion of naÃ¯ve CD8 (cluster 7: positive for CD8a, CCR7 and CD45RA) to activated CD8 cells during therapy. Consistent with this observation, another large cluster of naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells, cluster 4, positive for CD8, granzyme B, T-bet, CD16, CD45RA, and TIGIT, indicative of a naÃ¯ve effector CD8 T cell phenotype (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), also decreases with therapy. Quantification of total CD8 T cells using manual gating shows a significant increase in the entire study population at C3R (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), more significant in the toxicity patients (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8A</xref>). Manual gating also confirms the decrease in naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells (CD45RA+ CD45ROâˆ’ CCR7+) at C3 restage as shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, with lower baseline levels in patients without toxicity (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8B</xref>). This increase in activated CD8 T cells is likely contributing to duvelisib toxicity and is consistent with what has been observed in model systems with the added effect of PI3KÎ³ inhibition.</p>

                <p id="P21">We have previously demonstrated that increased activation of the Th17 pathway is associated with the autoimmune toxicity of idelalisib treatment in previously untreated patients<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Given those findings and the interesting above observation that a significantly increased CD8 cluster in this cohort shows Th17 differentiation specifically in patients with toxicity, we further evaluated the impact of duvelisib on Th17 subsets. The transcription factor regulating Th17 differentiation is RORÎ³T. Consistent with the idelalisib data, with dFCR treatment, RORÎ³T+ (Th17) CD4 T cells increased significantly with treatment at C3 restage and 6 mos post FCR in the entire cohort (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), primarily driven by a significant change in the cohort with toxicity (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9A</xref>). Interestingly, a cluster of CD161, CD8 positive T cells (c15, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) is elevated at screen in patients with toxicity compared to those without and is depleted over time selectively in patients with toxicity. This cluster has similar properties to a previously described CD8 population which is activated, shows Th17 differentiation and is tissue homing in the setting of chronic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.

                <p id="P22">In our prior work with idelalisib, we found that Tregs decrease during therapy, so we assessed changes in Tregs in the dFCR patients. Lower baseline Tregs (CD4+ CD25hi CD127lo) were observed at screening in patients developing toxicity compared to those without (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, in this patient population we saw an increase in Tregs at C3R, which was associated with granzyme B expression that was more significant in patients with toxicity (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9B</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">9C</xref>). Granzyme B expressing Tregs are known to be both activated and more prone to apoptosis than non-granzyme B expressing Tregs, and have been associated with renal allograft rejection<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, suggesting that they may also be implicated in the inflammatory process in this setting.</p>

We investigated the susceptibility to apoptosis of the CLL cells from 12 patients at baseline and after one week of duvelisib treatment (N=8 with autoimmune toxicity, N=4 without toxicity) using BH3 profiling, a functional assay to detect the proximity of a cell to the threshold of apoptosis (priming). Interestingly, patients with higher baseline priming for apoptosis in their CLL cells (by both BIM and PUMA) were more likely to develop immune toxicity (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), and after the 1-week lead-in, these patients had a significant decrease in priming compared to patients without toxicity (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion:</title>
              <p id="P25">Duvelisib is a potent, oral p110Î´Î³ inhibitor with efficacy in relapsed refractory CLL patients and in combination with FCR in our recent trial in previously untreated CLL<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The ability to deliver PI3K inhibitor therapy has been limited by autoimmune toxicity, the mechanisms of which are incompletely understood. We show here that dFCR treatment in an upfront setting modulates both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines in correlative samples banked from patients on therapy. NaÃ¯ve CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells, naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells, and Th1 CD4 T cells all decrease with treatment, while activated CD8 T cells, granzyme positive Tregs, Th17 CD4, and CD8 T cells all increase with treatment. Cytokines associated with Th17 activation (IL-17A and IL-21) are also relatively elevated in patients with toxicity. At baseline we found a trend toward lower Tregs in patients who went on to develop autoimmune toxicity. We therefore conclude that an increase in activated CD8 T cells and Th17 T cells with treatment in the context of lower baseline Tregs in some patients is associated with duvelisib-related toxicity.</p>
              <p id="P26">Duvelisib was given as a single agent for one week, allowing us to isolate the effect of duvelisib alone. Out of the 41 clusters identified using CyTOF, we found significant changes in naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients who developed toxicity, as CD4s decreased while naÃ¯ve CD8s increased during duvelisib monotherapy. While the decrease in naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells is not directly associated with an autoimmune response, it may imply that naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells are trafficking from the bloodstream to affected tissues or are activated and differentiating into another CD4 T cell subset. The increased naÃ¯ve CD8s appear to differentiate into activated memory CD8s by the subsequent timepoint, likely fueling autoimmune toxicity. We also observed a decrease in priming for apoptosis in the CLL cells of patients who went on to develop toxicity. These early effects of duvelisib in the toxicity-prone patients may suggest greater sensitivity of the T cells to the antiproliferative or immunomodulatory effects of duvelisib, combined with a greater resistance of the CLL cells. Greater activation or persistence of CLL cells has been associated with persistent immune dysfunction in CLL, which may explain how this finding could associate with autoimmune toxicity.</p>
              <p id="P27">One of our key findings is that duvelisib was associated with a marked increase in CD8 T cells in patients both with and without toxicity. We have not previously seen this increase in patients treated with idelalisib, suggesting that this is a specific effect of PI3KÎ³ inhibition. Our data are in accordance with previous work by Kaneda et al., who found that PI3KÎ³ inhibition in macrophages led to increased total and CD8 T cell infiltration within tumors in mice<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate increased CD8 T cells in peripheral blood; further work would be required to assess lymph node or tissue infiltration, although we see expression of tissue homing surface markers in this cell population. Interestingly, a subset of these CD8 T cells also demonstrate Th17-type differentiation. We also find that the cytokines most differentially expressed with toxicity are those associated with Th17 response, consistent with our prior observations with idelalisib<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and suggesting that Th17 activation is a significant contributor to PI3KÎ´ inhibitor-related toxicity.</p>
              <p id="P28">Our observation that relatively low Tregs at baseline were associated with development of autoimmune toxicity is potentially consistent with our prior observations that a decrease in Tregs is associated with autoimmune toxicity with idelalisib. Here we actually observed an increase in Tregs in patients with toxicity, but this increase was associated with granzyme B expression, which has been associated with an activated pro-apoptotic phenotype in the setting of transplant rejection<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. This Treg population is also similar to an activated, pro-apoptotic Treg population that we have previously identified and correlated with autoimmune toxicity in our idelalisib study<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Further work will be required to understand and characterize the nature of the Treg population at baseline and how it may be altered over time by duvelisib or idelalisib.</p>
              <p id="P29">Here we show that duvelisib, like other PI3KÎ´ inhibitors, can cause pro-inflammatory immunomodulation and autoimmune toxicity in some patients, with activation of a Th17 phenotype. Distinct from idelalisib, in this cohort we see a significant increase in activated CD8 T cells, likely related to PI3KÎ³ inhibition, without reduction in T regs during therapy. Limitations of our study include the combination with FCR which makes it harder to isolate the effects of duvelisib, and the lack of tissue evaluation or functional T cell studies possible with the trial samples. Moving forward, development of biomarker signatures for toxicity, perhaps baseline Tregs, Th17 activation, naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells, in combination with plasma cytokine levels, could help personalize CLL treatment with PI3KÎ´ inhibitors to avoid toxicity in patients. Our findings also set the stage for designing combination clinical trials that may preserve Treg numbers and function or inhibit pro-inflammatory Th17 responses in CLL patients.</p>
