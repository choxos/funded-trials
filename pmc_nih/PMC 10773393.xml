                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>To reduce obesity-related disparities, reaching economically disadvantaged and/or minority status adolescents to assist them in meeting physical activity (PA) and nutrition recommendations is important. To address the problem, a 16-week intervention called Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life (GOAL) was designed. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to evaluate any effect of the intervention, compared with a control condition, on improving: (1) adolescentsâ % body fat (primary outcome), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), diet quality and cardiorespiratory fitness from 0 to 4 months; (2) body mass index (BMI), overweight/obesity percentage and quality of life from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months; and (3) perceived social support, self-efficacy and motivation from 0 to 4 months with evaluation of any mediating effect on adolescent PA and diet quality. An exploratory aim is to evaluate any effect of the intervention, compared with the control, on improving parentsâ/guardiansâ home environment, MVPA and diet quality from 0 to 4 months; and BMI from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months.</p>

                  <p>Adolescents (fifth to eighth grade) in 14 schools located in underserved urban communities are randomly assigned to the intervention or usual school offerings. One parent per adolescent is enrolled (882 dyads total). Cohort 1 includes four schools (2022â2023). Cohorts 2 and 3 include 5 schools in 2023â2024 and 2024â2025, respectively. The 16-week intervention has three components: (1) after-school GOAL club for adolescents to engage in PA and healthy eating/cooking activities; (2) three parentâadolescent meetings to empower parents to assist adolescents; and (3) GOAL social networking website for parents to share how they helped their adolescent.</p>

              <p>Based on 2017-2020 data, obesity prevalence among 12-year-old to 19-year-old adolescents in the USA was 22.6% for boys and 21.7% for girls.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The prevalence is higher among black than white 12-year-old to 19-year-old adolescents (29.8% and 23.1%, respectively<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); and 10-year-old to 19-year-old adolescents from low-income households (â¤138% federal poverty level) are more likely to have obesity (22.8%) than those of higher socioeconomic status (17.3%<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Without effective interventions, the Healthy People 2030 obesity target of 15.5% for adolescents may not be achieved.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Contributing to the obesity problem and increasing the risk for chronic conditions, 76.1% of high school students do not attain the recommended â¥60âminutes/day of physical activity (PA), 75.0% do not eat breakfast daily, 45.3% eat vegetables &lt;1 time/day, 47.1% eat fruit or drink 100% fruit juice &lt;1 time/day and 14.7% drink sugar-sweetened soda/pop â¥1 time/day.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Further augmenting the risk among adolescents, pubertal changes occur in the years immediately preceding high school that can contribute to insulin resistance.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This information indicates that health-promoting interventions are needed before high school (ie, ages 10â13 years) so that young adolescents can begin to establish healthy behaviours to reduce their risk for adverse outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Given that meeting PA and nutrition recommendations can be difficult for economically disadvantaged and/or minority status adolescents, reaching this population is essential to reduce obesity-related disparities.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> To accomplish this task, we designed a three-component (after-school club for adolescent engagement in PA and healthy eating/cooking activities, parent social networking website and parent meetings), 16-week intervention-based study called Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life (GOAL). Although targeting schools is recommended to reach under-represented adolescents in underserved communities,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the lack of substantial efficacy of school-based interventions in reducing the prevalence of obesity may indicate a need to also target the home by actively involving parents to assist their adolescents.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, optimal approaches to increase parental support for improving under-represented adolescentsâ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and diet quality have not yet been clearly identified.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Addressing this problem is imperative because adolescents who have not yet reached high school still rely on their parents for assistance.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref></p>
              <p>Based on findings from our comprehensive literature search, this study may be the first to include the three components proposed in GOAL in an intervention implemented with individuals from underserved urban areas, as this demographic is at higher risk for obesity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>

                <title>Aims and hypotheses</title>
                <p>This trialâs primary purpose is to evaluate any effect of the GOAL intervention, compared with the control condition (usual school offerings), on improving: (1) adolescentsâ % body fat (%BF; primary outcome), MVPA, diet quality and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) from 0 to 4 months; (2) body mass index (BMI), overweight/obesity (OW/O) percentage and quality of life (QOL) from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months; and (3) perceived social support, self-efficacy and motivation from 0 to 4 months with evaluation of any mediating effect on adolescent PA and diet quality. An exploratory aim is to evaluate any effect of the GOAL intervention, compared with control, on improving parentsâ/guardiansâ (henceforth referred to as parents) home environment, MVPA and diet quality from 0 to 4 months; and BMI from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months.</p>

                  <title>Primary hypothesis</title>
                  <p>From 0 (baseline) to 4 months (immediate post-intervention) and to 13 months post-baseline (9-month post-intervention follow-up (F/U)), adolescents in the GOAL intervention, compared with control, will have greater reduction in %BF (â¥2.3%<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>).</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>GOAL is an individual randomised trial (2019â2026) involving 14 schools in the Midwestern USA. The study was on hold from 2020 to 2021 due to school closures associated with COVID-19 and from 2021 to 2022 due to COVID-related variants and school closures/restricted access to students. In the 2022â2023 academic years, the study was successfully conducted in four schools. Five schools will be included in 2023â2024 and also in 2024â2025.</p>
                <p>Schools are selected based on the following criteria: (1) location in underserved urban community; (2) enrolment &gt;150 adolescents in each school or more than double the number of adolescents needed (n=63/school) in any combination of fifth, sixth, seventh and/or eighth grade; and (3) racially and ethnically diverse student body (currently, targeted schools range between 31% and 100% minority race/ethnicity) including â¥49% enrolled in the free and reduced-price lunch programme. Schools are excluded if administrators are not interested in participating or cannot guarantee availability at 9-month post-intervention F/U.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Before the start of the school year, researchers attend open houses to inform parents and adolescents when an assembly will occur and to distribute flyers about the study. At the beginning of each school year, the project manager (PM) schedules recruitment assemblies so that study team members can meet with adolescents in their respective schools.</p>
                <p>During each assembly, study team members share information about the study and invite adolescents to participate. Adolescents are told that they and one parent will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual school activities and that both parents and adolescents can receive compensation for their time to participate in data collection activities. Adolescents are informed that an adult chosen by the parent is allowed to serve as the support person if their parent is unable to participate.</p>
                <p>Adolescents receive a flyer with a QR link to the assent form, parents to the consent form and both to an eligibility screening tool and baseline survey. Adolescents are asked to share information with their parents. School administrators also send an email (including flyer and QR code) to parents to share study information and invite them to participate with their adolescent. Parents and adolescents are asked to complete forms online within 48 hours if interested in participating. Parents are also invited to participate with their adolescents by researchers present at various school events, such as sporting, registration and conferences. If acceptable to school administrators, the schoolâs social media site (eg, Facebook page), email or text messages are used to inform parents and adolescents about the study and invite them to participate. A link is provided for parents and adolescents to complete forms online. Recruitment also occurs at lunch, during study/library periods and in classrooms or other venues. A 90âs video developed by the researchers is shown at each school. Study flyers are available in classrooms or other areas in the school for adolescents to take home. Strategies used may vary in each school depending on the permission and recommendations from school administrators. Response rates will be recorded. The PM and measurement coordinator (MC) identify adolescents and parents meeting eligibility criteria.</p>
                <p>During the first year (fall 2022), we enrolled 218 adolescents and 211 parents from four schools. Although we did not reach our goal of 63 dyads per school, the recruitment strategies exceeded our demographic target of â¥40% black participants with an enrolment of 146 black adolescents (67.0%). Only forty-eight (22.0%) adolescents were identified as white. Over 60% of parents reported family incomes &lt;US$50â000 per year with 34% having family incomes &lt;US$30â000 per year. Approximately 52.8% of this sample of adolescents was overweight or obese.</p>

The checklist includes items for assessing <italic toggle="yes">dose delivered</italic> or staff adherence to the club protocol and evaluating <italic toggle="yes">fidelity</italic> or the degree that the club reflects the IMB Model and SDT. The IC intervenes as needed with the club manager and coaches to increase interventionist adherence to the club protocol. To evaluate <italic toggle="yes">dose received</italic>, each adolescent completes two multiple-choice items (one to evaluate attention to information provided; one to determine knowledge of skills engaged in) at the end of both the PA session and the healthy eating plus cooking session (four items total/club day).</p>

The within-subject correlation will be modelled using an autocorrelation covariance structure on the residuals. Relevant contrast will be estimated to compare changes from baseline to post-intervention and 9-month post-intervention F/U between intervention and control groups and derive inferences on the intervention effect at each time point. The study biostatistician and data manager will assess if the intervention effect is uniform by sex, race and weight status by including interaction terms of each of the subgroup variables (eg, sex) with group and time variables. Also, they will run subgroup analysis stratified by sex, race and weight status to assess the magnitude of the intervention effect among different subgroups. The statistical significance is set at p value &lt;0.05. There is no interim analysis or early stopping rule.</p>

Similar to the primary analysis, the biostatistician and data manager will test for moderation of each of sex, race and baseline weight status in the effect of intervention on secondary outcomes. Analysis based on the ITT principle will be of primary interest; however, a doseâresponse analysis will be performed to evaluate actual participation in the intervention and if it has an increased effect on outcomes.</p>

              <p>The GOAL intervention is primarily designed to reduce the OW/O prevalence noted among under-represented adolescents. Findings from our pilot study that tested the GOAL intervention indicated the three components were feasible in a school setting and acceptable to parents and adolescents.<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> Conducting this individual randomised trial with a large sample is critical for evaluating the efficacy of the intervention. The multi-year trial will help in refining and strengthening the intervention, identifying key theoretical mediators influencing adolescentsâ PA and nutrition, shedding new light on relationships among the included variables and testing a novel approach for involving parents. Information acquired can be used to design future interventions directed toward promoting health equity among at-risk under-represented adolescents and their parents in underserved communities.</p>
