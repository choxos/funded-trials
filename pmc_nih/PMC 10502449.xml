                <sec>
                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>We report updated clinical outcomes from a phase II study of pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy (PTC) in metastatic esophagogastric cancer in conjunction with outcomes from an independent Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) cohort.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>The significance of pretreatment <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab PET, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics, and tumor HER2 expression and whole exome sequencing was evaluated to identify prognostic biomarkers and mechanisms of resistance in patients treated on-protocol with PTC. Additional prognostic features were evaluated using a multivariable Cox regression model of trastuzumab-treated MSK patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 226). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from MSK and Samsung were evaluated for mechanisms of therapy resistance.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p><sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab PET, scRNA-seq, and serial ctDNA with CT imaging identified how pre-treatment intrapatient genomic heterogeneity contributes to inferior progression-free survival (PFS). We demonstrated that the presence of intensely avid lesions by <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab PET declines in tumor-matched ctDNA by 3 weeks, and clearance of tumor-matched ctDNA by 9 weeks were minimally invasive biomarkers of durable PFS. Paired pre- and on-treatment scRNA-seq identified rapid clearance of HER2-expressing tumor clones with expansion of clones expressing a transcriptional resistance program, which was associated with <italic toggle="yes">MT1H, MT1E, MT2A</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MSMB</italic> expression. Among trastuzumab-treated patients at MSK, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification was associated with improved PFS, while alterations in <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> were associated with inferior PFS.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>These findings highlight the clinical relevance of identifying baseline intrapatient heterogeneity and serial ctDNA monitoring of HER2-positive esophagogastric cancer patients to identify early evidence of treatment resistance, which could guide proactive therapy escalation or deescalation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 20% of esophagogastric cancer (EGC) patients’ tumors carry amplifications of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> or overexpress its product, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). For these patients, the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab and chemotherapy (TC) have been the standard treatment for over a decade (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The combination of these agents with pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody, gained fast-track approval in first-line HER2-positive esophagogastric cancer by the United States Food and Drug Administration based on a 74.4% objective response rate in the Phase III KEYNOTE 811 study with a 22.7% improvement in objective responses versus trastuzumab and chemotherapy alone (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>In addition to providing updated survival results, which build upon concordant short follow-up results seen in INTEGA and PANTHERA, we present expanded biomarker analysis from our antecedent phase II trial (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>). In the phase II cohort, more than half of the patients had developed new non-target “escape” lesions upon progression, either due to loss of HER2 expression or via genomically mediated resistance mechanisms. We hypothesized that escape lesions reflect preexisting tumor heterogeneity between disease sites (intrapatient) and within a disease site (intratumor) that eventually conferred resistance. Therefore, we sought to understand how we can better predict durable responders by using biomarkers derived from integrated clinical characteristics, tumor and plasma genomics, and molecular imaging features generated from patients treated in a phase II trial or in clinically annotated institutional cohorts of HER2-positive EGC patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy with or without PD-1 inhibition (Supplementary Table S1) to identify putative biomarkers of intrapatient tumor heterogeneity and their prognostic significance. Finally, additional paired pre- and on-treatment TC single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to identify a transcriptional resistance program that allowed certain tumor clones to persist despite therapy and may serve as future therapeutic targets.</p>

                <p>Patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> [defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic>:CEP17 fluorescence <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) ratio ≥ 2.0] metastatic esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric adenocarcinoma (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 37) were recruited to an open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm, investigator-initiated, single-institution phase II trial of trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin. The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Institutional Review Board (IRB 16–937) and the trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02954536). Treatment and procedure details have been published (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition to standard response assessment (RECIST 1.1), up to 5 lesions from each affected disease site (i.e., up to 5 lymph nodes, 5 liver metastases, 5 lung nodules, etc.) were measured for “expanded assessment” to better account for response heterogeneity, including lesions smaller than 1 cm at baseline. The phase II protocol was performed in accordance with the protocol and its amendments and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was overseen by the MSK Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p>
                <p>An additional retrospective cohort of patients in the MSK esophagogastric database who received platinum chemotherapy with HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab or zanidatamab) from 2010 to 2022 were manually abstracted for demographic, pathologic, radiographic, and genomic features under a separate IRB-approved retrospective protocol.</p>

                <p>HER2 clinical testing was performed by IHC using the PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu (4B5) assay (Ventana) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) testing using the E1L3N clone (Cell Signaling Technology). MET IHC was performed, when relevant, using Ventana clone SP44. HER2 IHC was considered uniformly 3+ if all pretreatment testing at MSK or outside institutions was interpreted as 3+. Conversely, if pretreatment HER2 IHC was ever interpreted as ≤2+, the patient's tumor was considered 2+/heterogeneous.</p>
                <p>HER2 FISH was performed in cases with equivocal (2+ intensity) HER2 immunohistochemistry staining using HER2 IQFISH pharmDx (Dako) with scoring per clinical guidelines (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).

                <p>A subset of phase II trial patients were additionally consented to investigational PET imaging on MSK IRB protocol 13–165. Whole-body PET/CT scans from mid skull to proximal thigh were performed on days 5 to 7 following intravenous injection of 5 mCi of <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab. All scans were obtained on a dedicated PET/CT scanner (Discovery STE GE Healthcare) using low-dose CT scans for attenuation correction (10–80 mA current) and PET acquisition for 7 to 8 minutes per bed position in 3-dimensional mode and attenuation, scatter, and other standard corrections were applied to generate images using iterative reconstruction. Localization in the tumor was defined as positive if focal accumulation of activity was greater than adjacent background activity and distinct from areas of expected physiologic activity. Volumes of interest were drawn to include lesions on PET images using dedicated software (Hermes Medical Solutions; ref. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and images were independently assessed by a nuclear radiologist. Only lesions computed tomography (CT) measurements per “expanded assessment” as described above were evaluated. Lesion uptake was classified based upon uptake values (SUV) categorized as low (3 ≤ SUVmax &lt; 5), moderate (5 ≤ SUVmax &lt; 10), intense (10 ≤ SUVmax &lt; 15), or very intense (15 ≤ SUVmax; ref. <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>

                <p>Patient demographic characteristics were summarized using descriptive summary statistics and compared between groups of interest using Fisher exact test for categorical data or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the date of treatment until date of first progression or death, whichever occurred first for PFS or date of death for OS. Patients alive and without progression of disease (POD) were censored at their last available scan. PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods and compared between subgroups using the log-rank test. Among patients treated with pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy on-protocol, a landmark time of 9 weeks was used to examine the association between response status and clearance of all tumor-matched ctDNA at 9 weeks with OS and PFS. Patients without the 9-week follow-up were excluded. Univariate PFS analysis was done using Cox proportional hazards model and included all patients who received trastuzumab and chemotherapy with or without PD-1 inhibitor (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 217). The final multivariable PFS model was created by including the main covariate of interest (trastuzumab and chemotherapy with or without PD-1 inhibitor) and adjusting for factors associated with PFS from univariate analysis at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> alteration was not included in the final multivariable analysis since it was highly correlated with <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification status.

Six of 37 patients have not yet progressed, and 5 of these patients are still being treated on-study with a median follow-up time of 44 (range: 41–63) months.

                <p>As pretreatment biopsies of multiple metastatic disease sites are not feasible in routine care, we examined whether noninvasive detection of HER2 expression heterogeneity via <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab imaging could serve as a biomarker of treatment response. Among the 25 on-protocol patients who received a dose of pembrolizumab and trastuzumab “induction” 3 weeks before initiation of concurrent chemotherapy, 8 patients (32%) underwent <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab PET prior to initiating therapy; 7 of 8 patients (88%) had at least 1 PET-avid lesion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Data S2 and S3), including all evaluable patients with high HER2 expression. We observed significant variability in PET avidity between disease sites within patients pre-treatment. Of 47 assessable pretreatment lesions, 31 (66%) were PET-avid (SUV ≥ 3); of these, 48% (15/31) demonstrated intense <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab avidity (SUV ≥ 10; Supplementary Data S2). All 15 intensely <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab avid lesions decreased in size by CT after a single dose of pembrolizumab and trastuzumab, whereas only 9 of 32 non-intensely avid lesions (8%) showed reduction (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.4 ×10<sup>−6</sup> by Fisher exact test; Supplementary Fig. S3). All 4 patients with ≥ 1 intensively avid (SUV ≥ 10) lesion at baseline achieved 6-month PFS (Supplementary Data Table S2; example shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), versus only 2 of 4 patients without intensely avid lesions (SUV &lt; 10; example in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Three of these patients also had plasma ctDNA <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification, and exceeded a 6-month PFS, while the two patients lacking both <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab intense avidity and plasma ctDNA <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification failed to achieve a 6-month PFS (Supplementary Data Table S2). However, 1 patient with low-volume lymph node–only disease lacked PET-avid lesions at baseline yet achieved an 8.7-month PFS. These results, though limited by the small sample size, suggest that <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab PET can noninvasively reveal the intensity and uniformity of HER2 expression, which may correlate with clinical benefit from pembrolizumab and trastuzumab.</p>

                <title>Early ctDNA decline and clearance of ctDNA correlate with PFS</title>
                <p>We previously demonstrated that pretreatment plasma <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification predicts durable PFS (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 11</xref>), and so we next explored the utility of early ctDNA decline as a biomarker of ≥6-month PFS on pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Of patients with tumor-matched (see Materials and Methods) mutations at baseline, 12 of 16 (75%) had a decline in maximum variant allelic frequency (maxVAF) by week 3, and 9 of these patients (75%) achieved 6-month PFS, versus 0 of 4 patients (0%) with rising maxVAF at week 3 (Supplementary Fig. S4; Supplementary Data S3). Plasma ctDNA dynamics were then compared with lesion-level CT scan dynamics. At 3-week CT, no responding lesions were identified in patients lacking <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>-amplified ctDNA (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In contrast, lesions from 5 of 9 patients (56%) lacking <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> tissue amplification responded to pembrolizumab and trastuzumab by 3-week CT, suggesting intrapatient HER2 heterogeneity (Supplementary Fig. S5B; Supplementary Data S3). Only 3 of 10 patients (30%) who achieved both 6-month PFS and decline in ctDNA demonstrated a uniform CT response in all disease sites (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.58), highlighting the discordance of early ctDNA with CT imaging.</p>
                <p>As decline in VAF fails to account for copy number alteration events, we also evaluated clearance of all tumor-matched ctDNA alterations as a biomarker of survival. Of the 23 patients who had tumor-matched ctDNA alterations, the 17 in whom all were cleared by 9 weeks exhibited longer PFS than in the 6 patients who did not (HR 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06–0.53; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). While 13 of 17 patients (76%) who cleared ctDNA achieved 6-month PFS, only 1 of 6 (17%) who failed to clear ctDNA did. This performed similarly to follow-up imaging where phase II pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy-treated patients with uniform CT responses (i.e., all lesions radiographically improving) at 9 weeks (21/35; 60%) had a decreased risk of progression or death (HR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17–0.81; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) compared with patients with mixed responses (14/35; 40%). This suggests that ctDNA clearance may have a role in reducing the need for frequent cross-sectional imaging.</p>

                <p>Of the 31 pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy-treated trial patients whose disease progressed, 19 (61%) developed escape lesions that were not present on baseline CT, including 3 (10%) who developed brain metastases. While all 37 protocol patients had HER2-positive tumors at baseline, only 11 of 21 patients (52%) remained HER2-positive upon progression, corresponding to 9 of 18 (50%) with <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification in tissue and 8 of 21 (38%) in plasma (variation in denominators reflects data availability; Supplementary Fig. S6). There was no significant change seen in tumor mutation burden post-treatment. As site-matched pre- and posttreatment biopsies were not available for these lesions, ctDNA evaluation improved sensitivity to detect baseline and acquired resistance mechanisms. Eighteen of 21 (86%) evaluable patients had tumor-matched ctDNA mutations upon progression (Supplementary Data S1). However, only 49% of plasma NGS alterations could be tumor-matched, as the nonmatched mutations presumably arose outside the sequenced tumor site or via clonal hematopoiesis (Supplementary Table S4). Tissue and/or ctDNA testing identified putative mechanisms of resistance in nearly all patients, including loss of HER2 expression and alterations in <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> (Supplementary Fig. S6). One patient had pretreatment heterogeneity with a HER2−, PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) 100 retroperitoneal lymph node (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S7) which resolved on-treatment, while their esophageal primary tumor was HER2 3+, PD-L1 CPS &lt;1.

We also demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic> S367L, currently a variant of undetermined significance, increases phosphorylation of AKT, suggesting functional relevance (Supplementary Fig. S8).

However, we also identified many clones that expanded despite treatment, suggesting resistance to both trastuzumab and chemotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S10B). To identify a trastuzumab resistance program, gene sets associated with clonal expansion versus contraction were devised using GeneVector on pretreatment expression from patients who received either TC or C (Supplementary Methods). Therefore, the equation [(CAPOX+T_Expanded<sub>T0</sub> − CAPOX+T_Contracted<sub>T0</sub>) − (CAPOX_Expanded<sub>T0</sub> − CAPOX_Contracted<sub>T0</sub>)], allowed us to identify that <italic toggle="yes">MT1H, MT1E, MT2A</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MSMB</italic> expression were associated with CAPOX+trastuzumab resistance (Supplementary Fig. S10C and S10D).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>These results demonstrate that pretreatment tumor heterogeneity, in particular HER2 expression heterogeneity, is associated with shorter PFS among patients with HER2+ EGC treated with trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy. Since our initial clinical publication (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), INTEGA and PANTHERA similarly demonstrated PD-L1 agnostic improved response and survival with the addition of immune checkpoint blockade to chemotherapy and trastuzumab, albeit with shorter follow-up (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>). Although combined PD-1 and HER2 blockade augments trastuzumab efficacy across all 3 studies, our long-term follow-up confirms that preexistent lesion-to-lesion and even intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity remains a major barrier to HER2-targeted therapy efficacy and a negative predictor of survival (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 13</xref>).</p>
              <p>While biopsy of multiple disease sites to assess for HER2 and other molecular heterogeneity is not feasible in clinical practice, we found that noninvasive ctDNA analysis and <sup>89</sup>Zr-trastuzumab molecular imaging can identify patients most likely to have durable benefit on first-line pembrolizumab and trastuzumab therapy. However, these modalities have limitations and require relatively high disease burden for accurate assessment.</p>
              <p>We found that declining tumor-matched ctDNA maxVAF at 3 weeks, after a single dose of pembrolizumab and trastuzumab, predicted 6-month PFS, which demonstrates ctDNA's ability to predict treatment response in EGC, mirroring results in other cancers (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14–17</xref>). While uniformity of 3-week CT response predicted ≥ 6-month PFS, changes in individual lesions were often too small to reliably predict future response. However, several patients with progressive lesions after induction therapy responded to the addition of chemotherapy, highlighting the role for combination approaches in overcoming heterogeneity-driven drug resistance. This may explain why previous studies of targeted monotherapies failed to associate early ctDNA decline with improved PFS (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The observation that ctDNA is an early prognostic biomarker of treatment response may inform future targeted and immunotherapy trials in which therapy escalation or alternate molecularly guided agents are used as salvage in patients with mixed responses resulting from tumor heterogeneity.</p>
              <p>Upon progression, IHC and DNA sequencing of tumor and/or ctDNA identified low HER2 expression or lack of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification in approximately half of tested patients. This was higher than in prior studies, although limited by sample size (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>). In patients with persistent HER2 expression, escape lesions had co-occurring alterations in <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, MET</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, or PI3K-associated genes or were in reservoir sites with poor trastuzumab penetration, such as the central nervous system. scRNA-seq in conjunction with serial ctDNA sequencing illustrated <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> pretreatment subclonal coexpression of a <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, reiterating the correlation between genomic heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance, and the role of ctDNA testing in identifying tumor heterogeneity.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, scRNA-seq suggested that <italic toggle="yes">MT1H, MT1E, MT2A</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MSMB</italic> expression were associated with trastuzumab resistance. <italic toggle="yes">MT1H, MT1E</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MT2A</italic> encode isoforms of metallothioneins, which are found in all tissues and are associated with trace element homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress. While <italic toggle="yes">MT2A</italic> has been associated with chemotherapy resistance (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 22</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">MT1G</italic> expression contributes to P53 activation and improved oxaliplatin cytotoxicity, though this may not be relevant in HER2-expressing EGC as nearly all of these patients have <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">MSMB</italic> encodes microseminoprotein-beta. Microseminoprotein expression is stimulated by hypoxia, which leads to MAPK pathway activation and has been associated with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor resistance in ovarian cancer models (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Further preclinical validation of metallothionein inhibition in overcoming chemotherapy resistance is merited.</p>
              <p>Multivariable analysis of our larger institutional cohort of HER2-targeted patients did not reveal a difference in PFS with or without concurrent immune checkpoint blockade despite impressive results with adding PD-1 inhibitors in multiple trials. Survival outcomes from the phase 3 KEYNOTE-811 trial are expected shortly. Pre-clinically, combining trastuzumab and PD-1 blockade augments HER2-specific T-cell response, promotes T-cell and dendritic cell trafficking, and induces peripheral memory T-cell expansion (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25–29</xref>). Further clinical validation of these mechanisms is needed. While we identified oncogenic <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> alterations as prognostic of inferior PFS, PANTHERA suggested that pretreatment RTK/RAS pathway alterations were associated with improved PFS. This is contrary to our prior findings (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 10</xref>) and likely reflects their liberal definition of oncogenic RTK-RAS alterations (61% vs. 28% of patients), and would benefit from validation in a larger cohort. Both studies identified that <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplification was associated with improved PFS.</p>
              <p>Promising initial phase III KEYNOTE-811 study findings suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and trastuzumab is a transformative treatment for patients with EGC, and mechanistic evaluation of this combination remains ongoing. Here, we identified prognostic pre- and early-treatment biomarkers of durable response. We also confirmed that tumor heterogeneity remains the greatest barrier to precision oncology in EGC, and that preexistent molecular heterogeneity can be identified noninvasively through molecular imaging and ctDNA analysis. Future trials should assess whether noninvasive assessment of mixed response and molecular heterogeneity can dynamically inform adaptive treatment strategies prior to disease progression.</p>

Contraction at the on-treatment timepoint reflects their RECIST response at their initial follow up imaging timepoint, demonstrating that patient 3, who had the highest ERBB2 expression, had the deepest and most durable response. b, Pre- and on-treatment size and fold-change of clones identified in pane a ordered by pre-treatment ERBB2 expression. Clonal expansion was most commonly seen in clones with low ERBB2 expression and was associated with a resistance program derived by GeneVector. c, MT1H, MT1E, MT2A, and MSMB expression were significantly higher in clones expanding despite CAPOX + trastuzumab (TC) versus both contracting clones after TC as well as expanding clones after CAPOX (C) only, suggesting association with therapeutic resistance. d, The resistance program strongly correlated with the CAPOX+trastuzumab clones, and poorly with CAPOX-treated clones, as intended.</p>
