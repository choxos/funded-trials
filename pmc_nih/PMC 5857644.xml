                  <p>Northern Mexico has among the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in the world. This research addresses core gaps in implementation science to develop, test and scale-up CVD risk-reduction interventions in diabetics through a national primary care health system.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The Meta Salud Diabetes (MSD) research project is a parallel two-arm cluster-randomised clinical behavioural trial based in 22 (n=22) health centres in Sonora, Mexico. MSD aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the MSD intervention for the secondary prevention of CVD risk factors among a diabetic population (n=320) compared with the study control of usual care. The MSD intervention consists of 2-hour class sessions delivered over a 13-week period providing educational information to encourage sustainable behavioural change to prevent disease complications including the adoption of physical activity. MSD is delivered within the context of Mexico’s national primary care health centre system by health professionals, including nurses, physicians and community health workers via existing social support groups for individuals diagnosed with chronic disease. Mixed models are used to estimate the effect of MSD by comparing cardiovascular risk, as measured by the Framingham Risk Score, between the trial arms. Secondary outcomes include hypertension, behavioural risk factors and psychosocial factors.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Mexico, accounting for over one-third of all mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The growing threat of mortality from CVD and diabetes in Mexico is devastating, rising by 9.5% in 2010 alone.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> CVD and diabetes are among the top two causes of death in Mexico.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> From 2005 to 2014, diabetes-attributable deaths increased by 26 870 and cardiovascular-attributable deaths increased by 38 564.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Mexico’s National Health Program 2007–2012 states that 33% of deaths among Mexican women and 26% of deaths among Mexican men are caused by these illnesses.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> CVD is the leading cause of early death among people with diabetes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Individuals with diabetes are two to six times more likely to die from CVD than non-diabetics.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking each contributes to high rates of CVD among diabetics.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Secondary prevention of modifiable risk factors for CVD is of primary importance for lowering premature death rates in Mexico.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>

                <p>The Meta Salud Diabetes (MSD) curriculum was designed by El Colegio de Sonora and the University of Arizona as part of ‘Tools and practices to reduce CVD and complications in the diabetic population in Mexico’, a project funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute as part of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases. The MSD behavioural intervention aims to reduce clinical risks for developing CVD among diabetic populations and is implemented in collaboration with the Sonora Ministry of Health. The research study’s two primary objectives are: (1) to test the effectiveness of a CVD secondary prevention intervention among a diabetic population and (2) engage in a study that assesses the implementation of the MSD intervention to identify the strengths and limitations faced by each study affiliated clinical site.</p>

In Sonora, Mexico, the vast majority of adults (82%), are covered by national programmes, approximately 26% are specifically covered by the national health insurance programme—Seguro Popular<italic>—</italic>implemented in 2004 (25.6%).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Seguro Popular aims to provide access to care for families, many of which are low income, who had been excluded from social health insurance in the past.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                <p>Under Seguro Popular, the Mexican Ministry of Health’s Community Health Centers (Centros de Salud) employ registered nurses (RNs) and community health workers (CHWs), whose activities include maintaining a support group for people with diabetes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These self-help groups, known as Grupos de Ayuda Mutua (GAMs) are one of the strategies for secondary prevention in patients with diabetes established by the Mexican Ministry of Health diabetes programme.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The most recent report estimates 8525 GAMs operating across Mexico with over 222 270 patient participants throughout the country.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> National standards and operating procedures are outlined by the Ministry of Health to encourage a standardised delivery of care and outcomes to facilitate national GAM evaluation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Monitoring of the GAMs occurs at the jurisdictional level and those meeting the standards are certified.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Despite governmental protocol and GAM certification, high variability remains across GAMs in group size (which averages approximately 26 individuals), sociodemographics and disease profile of the participants. Each GAM determines meeting frequency, location, as well as the chronic disease self-management, education and skill building offered.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Variability in the GAMs is often due to lack of adequate space, training and educational resources for the GAM coordinators to adequately support patient participants. Despite these challenges, the nationwide infrastructure of the GAMs, embedded within the national health centre system, represents an opportunity for a scale-up of an evidence-based intervention for CVD risk management among diabetics, as many Mexicans access healthcare at these health centres.</p>

                <p>The MSD intervention consists of 2-hour class sessions delivered over a 13-week period (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The MSD curriculum focuses on providing educational information to encourage sustainable behavioural change to prevent disease complications including the adaptation of physical activity. The curriculum places an emphasis on the importance of nutrition and physical activity. MSD components include: (1) educational curriculum delivered in a support group context that encourages individuals with diabetes to make sustainable behavioural changes to better manage their chronic illness, prevent complications and prevent CVD. The curriculum is culturally relevant, context-specific and tailored to meet the needs of the study population; (2) the intervention is couched in a participatory methodology to promote a community of learning with the goal of providing a supportive space for people at risk for developing CVDs and (3) physical activity is a strategic element of the intervention aimed to increase exercise and build supporting social networks within the intervention to help prevent and manage chronic diseases. Physical activity is embedded within each session to foster long-term maintenance of health behaviours and positive emotional well-being.</p>

Stage 1 consisted of the revision of protocols, programmes, and procedures that are specific to meeting the needs of diabetic populations seeking to curtail the development of CVD.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Stage 2 consists of fieldwork to assess the participating health centre sites, the GAMs and the patient populations of each respective health centre.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Stage 3 includes a rigorous literature review to capture the current science on behavioural and lifestyle interventions for nutrition, physical activity, stress management and mental health associated to diabetes, CVD and general chronic disease.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Stage 4 is the final adaptation of intervention materials to integrate diabetes management education.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 28</xref></p>
                <p>MSD is guided by two primary behavioural change theories, the Trans Theoretical Model of Behaviour Change and Social Cognitive Theory.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> These two behavioural change theories assume, respectively, that behaviour modification is a multistage process in which people move through stages of readiness for change, and that they do so in the context of reciprocal relationships with their environment, behaviour and cognition.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> MSD is guided by specific adult learning theories, including meaningful learning theory and popular education.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> Both approaches acknowledge the agency of adult learners to integrate knew knowledge into what is already known and create a cognitive structure that makes sense of their own surroundings and situations.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> Through these approaches, MSD privileges the coconstruction of knowledge among participants and assumes MSD facilitators and participants are colearners. Through meaningful learning theory and popular education, MSD encourages critical thinking about empowerment, personal and collective agency and particularly their right to quality healthcare services. Furthermore, the overarching framework for MSD is provided by salutogenesis, an asset-based model that searches for the origins of health (as opposed to the origins of disease sought by pathogenesis) and specifically addresses the role of stress and what Antonovsky has termed a sense of coherence.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Finally, because of the implementation science focus of our trial, we also draw on the social–ecological model, which supports our ability to assess, systematically, the potential for scale-up of MSD from the interpersonal, organisational, community and systems levels.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
                <p>A health professional within a regularly scheduled GAM meeting delivers MSD. GAMs are facilitated by a variety of health professionals, including a RNs, CHWs, MDs and in some clinical sites an interdisciplinary team of health centre staff, including interns, facilitate GAM meetings. Health professionals who deliver the MSD curriculum receive a 2-day, face-to-face training session in a group setting. Training sessions use didactic and interactive popular education techniques to both demonstrate and provide opportunities for practice and role-play for each of MSD’s 13 sessions.</p>
                <p>Fidelity is documented by MSD research staff observation of most of the 13 sessions at all intervention sites. Fidelity tracks the extent to which the goals of each session are met, instructions for each activity are followed, as well evaluates the level of quality and consistency in facilitation across the intervention sites. The observers are trained in observation techniques that allow them to document the activities of the session, and take detailed notes on how the intervention is received and the quality of interactions between the facilitator and participants and between participants themselves. Following completion of the trial, two research staff will independently review the detailed notes of at least 20% of all the sessions observed. Using a prepared fidelity checklist, the observers will indicate if each objective was introduced and whether all of the information related to the material was covered and all planned activities were carried out in the session. The observers will use a five-point Likert scale to evaluate the quality of the curriculum delivery and evaluate the extent to which the facilitator presented the information in an engaging, consistent and clear manner. In addition, the checklist will rate the extent to which the facilitator engages in interactive activities based on adult learning theories. The checklist includes observations on whether the facilitator focuses on participant learning and encourages them to be interactive; shows compassion to the participants without focusing on personal problems of any one participant; encourages participants to give examples of situations in the curriculum and to ask questions related to their own experience.</p>

                <p>To detect a standardised effect size of 0.4 for the FRS between the intervention and control groups at 3 months with at least 80% power, we calculate a sample size of 480 (n=480) participants. This calculation assumes 12 clusters for intervention arm and 10 for control (clinical site n=22) (inflated by two in intervention arm to account for cluster dropout), 20 participants per cluster on average (inflated from 16% to 25% to account for participant dropout) and an intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.03.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> This is a conservative ICC estimate based on reviews of several studies with clustering where the median ICCs were found to be 0.01–0.02.71,72. This sample size also gives more than 80% power to detect a difference of 20% hypertension rates between the groups, assuming rates of 60% and 40%. If the ICC is smaller, or more health centres are recruited, smaller differences can be detected. The difference in arms for which we powered on is feasible based on an ongoing evaluation study of CVD risk among patients of resource-intensive health centres in Sonora (such as the Unidades de Especialidades Médicas or Medical Specialty Units). A standardised effect size of 0.4 is considered small to medium effect and is likely to be clinically meaningful.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p>

Clinical staff will also be instructed to only provide study information found on the IRB recruitment flyers without providing potential study participants additional information. At least two staff members from each clinic who participate in GAM facilitation attend training on the study intervention in order to implement the MSD curriculum and other health centre staff (including clinic administrators, physicians, nurses and CHWs) meet with research staff to be fully informed of the study logistics and goals.</p>
                <p>Staff within the study clinical sites identify patients eligible for study inclusion screening. The health provider, clinic staff or clinic personnel inform the patient of the study and provide an IRB approved recruitment flyer. Study recruitment flyers are also displayed at participating clinical sites for recruitment. Interested individuals are directed to contact the study staff responsible at the clinical site. Study staff inform the individual of the time and location of the GAM meeting where the enrolment activities and informed consent take place.</p>
                <p>Retention activities include: (1) reminder telephone calls and text messages to participants from research staff; (2) development of a phone chain or text message chain among participants to remind each other about upcoming classes and measurement dates; (3) in person contact with the enrolled participant by clinical and research staff during intervention sessions or routine medical appointments. For both of the two follow-up measures, study staff make three and (4) attempts to contact the participant through telephone calls and or home visits. After the third unsuccessful attempt to make contact with the participant, the study categorises the participant as lost to follow-up.</p>

                <title>Consent</title>
                <p>Each clinic has an assigned clinical site research coordinator. The informed consent process is overseen by the clinical site research coordinator and is responsible for overall enrolment of all subjects. Research staff members will be trained on the informed consent procedure and be responsible for enrolling individual participants. Each individual will provide informed consent prior to being enrolled in the study. Only enrolled participants are engaged in data collection. The outlined informed consent protocol is conducted with every study participant. A research staff member is provided a physical copy of the consent to the individual seeking to enrol in the study. The research staff member reads the consent form loudly and clearly to the individual. After reading the consent form for the individual, the research staff member summarises the contents of the consent form. Following the summary, the research staff member asks the individual if they understood what was read to them and the summary they received and if she/he has any questions about what they reviewed together. If the individual agrees with the content of the consent form and participation in the study, she/he will then be asked to register in the research study’s database. The individual then enters his/her name into the study’s database and provides a signature on the electronic consent form.</p>

                <title>Confidentiality</title>
                <p>The study documents are electronically stored on computers and tablets on encrypted databases on a secure server affiliated with the UA. The computers and tablets are kept in locked storage cabinets when they are not in use at COLSON and/or UA.</p>

                <title>Access to data</title>
                <p>Only the Co-PI’s and Co-Investigators of the study have access to the final trial data set and final list of study sites, and disclosure of contractual agreements that limit such access for investigators.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s5e">
                <title>Dissemination</title>
                <p>On completion of the trial, we will engage major dissemination strategies, including; (1) peer-reviewed publications in targeted journals; (2) scholarly presentations at scientific conferences and public health governance meetings; (3) interactive web-based promotional and training materials and (4) strategic informational and planning meetings with key institutions and centres of the Ministry of Health at the local, state and federal level. We will also leverage our existing partnerships and networks to disseminate findings, including the GACD Research Network, CDC Prevention Research Centers and the US–Mexico Border Health Commission, a binational governance body representative of the USA and Mexican Ministries of Health. Publications and presentations will involve and strengthen early-stage and late-stage binational research team members’ capacity to translate research finding into recommendations for reduction of CVD risk and complications of both Mexican nationals and transnational populations of the US–Mexico border region. Web-based dissemination of promotional and training materials will be critical. El Colegio de Sonora and University of Arizona College of Public Health investigators have extensive expertise and capacity to use the internet to promote and train health professionals, including CHWs, as evidenced by the web portal for the original, UnitedHealth Chronic Disease Initiative funded Meta Salud programme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sitios.colson.edu.mx/metasalud/">http://sitios.colson.edu.mx/metasalud/</ext-link>) with links maintained by the University of Arizona Prevention Research Center website. The existing Meta Salud portal will be leveraged to disseminate research findings and models for sustainability of the MSD programme.</p>
