                <p>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) following lung transplantation is clinically similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because alcohol abuse independently increases the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in at-risk individuals, we hypothesized that donor alcohol use is correlated with an increased risk of PGD. As a pilot study, we collected alcohol use histories using a validated instrument, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test questionnaire, from 74 donors and correlated these with the development of PGD in corresponding recipients. Nineteen percent (14/74) of donors were classified as heavy alcohol users, as defined by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores ≥8. In the 1st 4 days post-transplantation, similar percentages of recipients developed grade 3 PGD on at least 1 day (heavy alcohol user = 29% [4/14] versus lighter alcohol user = 27% [16/60]); however, recipients receiving a lung from a heavy alcohol user were more likely to have multiple and consecutive days of grade 3 PGD, especially in the 1st 48 hours post-transplant. Both median length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were somewhat longer in the heavy alcohol user group (9 versus 7 days and 19.5 versus 17.5 days, respectively). If these preliminary findings are validated in a multi-center study, they would have important implications not only for our understanding of the pathophysiology of PGD but also for the development of novel treatments based on the evolving evidence from experimental and clinical studies on how alcohol abuse renders the lung susceptible to acute edematous injury.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of death in the immediate period following lung transplantation and has an incidence of 15% to 25%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Unfortunately, there are no effective therapies, and even with supportive care, the mortality can be as high as 43%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It had previously been assumed that the factors predisposing to PGD pertain to the surgical procedure or to the allograft recipient.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggests that donor-related risks factors are also important in the development of PGD. For example, it is now recognized that donor characteristics, such as age, smoking and mismatches with the donor in sex or race, contribute to poor recipient outcomes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We recently demonstrated a potential association between elevated donor levels of receptor for advanced glycation end-products and the development of PGD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, other studies have shown that donor biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-8,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> vascular endothelial growth factor<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and certain gene expression profiles<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> are associated with an increased risk of developing PGD. Importantly, because there are no proven medical treatments for PGD, identification of additional biomarkers to accurately identify allografts that are at higher risk for developing this serious condition are needed.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
            <p>The features of PGD represent essentially a <italic>form fruste</italic> of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), which occurs within the unique context of lung transplantation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the past 15 years, a strong independent association between alcohol abuse and ARDS has been identified, and our group at Emory University has been at the forefront of investigating the mechanisms by which alcohol abuse renders the lung susceptible to acute edematous injury. Specifically, alcohol abuse independently and significantly increases the risk of ARDS 2- to 4-fold in critically ill individuals.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Although the mechanisms underlying this association are still being investigated, we have clear evidence from experimental models and clinical studies that chronic alcohol ingestion causes oxidative stress and depletes the pool of the antioxidant glutathione within the alveolar space.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Alcohol-induced oxidative stress causes previously unrecognized alveolar epithelial dysfunction, including increased paracellular permeability, decreased liquid clearance, impaired surfactant production and decreased cell viability.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
            <p>This “alcoholic lung” phenotype is clinically silent in that the physiological perturbations identified in both experimental models and in otherwise healthy alcoholic individuals are not readily detectable without sophisticated measurements and do not manifest as significant lung dysfunction until an acute inflammatory stress, such as sepsis or aspiration, unmasks them. Specifically, alcohol abuse alone does not cause lung injury but rather it significantly lowers the threshold for its development. This previously unrecognized association between alcohol abuse and ARDS/ALI was identified only when prospective studies were done using accurate alcohol use assessments such as the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, this type of prospective investigation has not heretofore been applied in the unique context of lung transplantation and PGD. Therefore, we sought to determine if donor alcohol abuse likewise increased the risk of PGD. As a 1st step and a means of identifying biological plausibility, we demonstrated that chronic alcohol use by the donor exacerbated airway injury in allograft recipients using an experimental rat model of heterotopic tracheal transplantation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We then initiated a single-center pilot study within our Emory Alcohol and Lung Biology Center, in collaboration with the McKelvey Center for Lung Transplantation at Emory University, to collect preliminary data in support of such an association that could stimulate the design and implementation of a larger multi-center study. Such information would have enormous implications for both the selection of lung allograft donors and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate the devastating consequences of PGD.</p>
            <p>We reasoned that this study was important to the lung transplant community, which includes donors, recipients and the tens of thousands of healthcare professionals involved in lung transplantation. Unfortunately, despite advances in lung transplantation techniques and identification of appropriate selection criteria, our ability to predict which lung allograft recipients will develop PGD is at present imprecise,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and our limited understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the development of PGD has frustrated our attempts to identify effective therapies beyond supportive care. In light of recent experimental and clinical evidence revealing the strong and independent association between alcohol abuse and ALI, we felt that there were compelling reasons to examine whether donor alcohol abuse increased the risk of PGD. To address this hypothesis, we initiated a pilot study at Emory University through our Alcohol and Lung Biology Center to study the relationship between donor alcohol use and the development of PGD in lung transplant recipients.</p>

                  <p>Between February 2007 and January 2009 at Emory Hospital in Atlanta, GA, 88 consecutive lung transplant recipients and their lung donors were considered for eligibility. Exclusion criteria included being re-transplanted (n = 4), no consent (n = 2) and improper lung preparation (n = 3). Two subjects received a lung from the same donor; 1 subject was randomly selected for inclusion in the analysis. Therefore, in total, there were 78 eligible lung allograft recipients, of whom 74 had their donor's alcohol use quantified using the AUDIT. All analyses are based on these 74 recipients.</p>

                <p>As this was a single-center pilot study with a limited number of participants, we recognized that it was unlikely that we would be able to identify a statistically significant difference in the incidence of PGD in allograft from donors with or without alcohol abuse unless that difference was very large. Therefore, the primary goal was to make comparisons that could be used to design a larger multi-center trial if our results suggested that donor alcohol abuse could be associated with a clinically meaningful difference in the incidence of PGD. In this context, we planned from the outset to present the descriptive results of this pilot study. Specifically, we report the number and percentage of subjects in each category. In addition, we calculated the odds ratio of developing PGD when receiving an allograft from a donor with alcohol abuse versus receiving an allograft from a donor without alcohol abuse using logistic regression and using a generalized linear mixed model methodology to account for multiple measurements per patient over time. Covariate adjusted odds ratios were estimated by a series of 2-variable models (ie, alcohol status and one of the potentially confounding covariates). Lung transplant donor and recipient demographic and clinical characteristics other than PGD outcomes were examined for their relationship to donor alcohol abuse status (donor and recipient age: Wilcoxon rank sum test; all categorical variables: Fisher's exact test; ICU and hospital LOS: log-rank test). All tests were 2-sided. All analyses were completed using SAS v9 for Windows 7 Enterprise (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

Recipients in the 2 groups were similar for age, racial distribution, indication for transplant, transplant type, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, racial mismatch (African American to Caucasian) and ischemia time. Recipients of lungs from heavy drinkers were more likely to be male (93% versus 50%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.005). A gender mismatch (female to male) was somewhat less likely in the heavy alcohol use group 7% versus 20%, although this difference was not statistically significant.

                <p>Using the consensus ISHLT definitions, PGD grades of 0, 1, 2 and 3 at 48 hours (T48) after lung transplantation occurred in 43%, 27%, 14% and 17% of recipients, respectively.</p>

Additionally, their PGD was more likely to occur on consecutive days. However, these differences between the 2 groups are based on a small number of cases with grade 3 PGD. On each of the 1st 4 post-transplant days, the incidence of grade 3 PGD was higher in the heavy alcohol use group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

                <p>Using a method that takes into account the multiple days of grade 3 PGD measurement on each person, we compared the 2 groups for their odds of developing grade 3 PGD. Without controlling for any potential confounders, the odds ratio was 1.8, with a 95% confidence that the true value falls in the interval 0.6 and 5.6. Controlling either for the donor factors of age, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and smoking or for the recipient factors of diagnosis, race mismatch, gender mismatch, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and type of transplant (bilateral or not) had minimal effect on the odds ratio (range 1.7–1.9). On average, the rate of PGD 3 per day was 22% in the heavy alcohol use group compared with 14% in the lighter use group.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We found that 1/5 of the lung donors at our center in this study had heavy alcohol intake when classified by validated instruments, such as AUDIT. In addition, while the risk of developing grade 3 PGD at least once in the 1st days post-transplantation seemed similar between the 2 groups, the number and duration of episodes of PGD 3 also seem greater when the allograft came from a donor with heavy alcohol use. For example, as disclosed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, PGD 3 lasting 4 days was present in 2/4 versus 2/15 of recipients who experienced any PGD 3. In parallel, we observed somewhat longer ICU and hospital LOSs if the donor had an AUDIT ≥8, and the recipients of allografts from donors with alcohol abuse had more grade 3 PGD at 48 hours post-transplantation. These findings build on previous observations that lung allograft recipients with grade 3 PGD within the 1st 48 hours following transplant had significantly decreased long-term survival, as well as longer ICU and hospital stays, when compared with recipients who had grade 1 or 2 PGD.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>Taken together, our findings in this pilot study are consistent with the multi-center studies showing that alcohol abuse increases the risk of developing ARDS approximately 4-fold in critically ill individuals and raise concern that donor alcohol abuse could significantly increase the risk of PGD following lung transplantation. Our preliminary findings in this single-center pilot study are provocative because they suggest that donor alcohol abuse may have an adverse effect on outcome following transplantation that cannot be predicted by our current risk-stratification criteria. Therefore, we believe that it is imperative for the lung transplant community to perform a larger multi-center study to either validate or refute an association between donor alcohol abuse and PGD because either result will be valuable as we work to improve outcomes following lung transplantation.</p>
              <p>Our findings are consistent with a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence that excessive alcohol use renders the lung susceptible to injury. The initial link between alcohol abuse and ARDS was identified in a retrospective analysis of a clinical database of 351 subjects admitted to an ICU with an acute illness that placed them at risk for ARDS.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This association was later confirmed in a prospective, multi-center study of 220 patients admitted with severe sepsis.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the initial study, the relative risk was approximately 2:1. However, in the latter study in which a validated case definition of an alcohol use disorder was used, the relative risk of ARDS in alcoholic individuals was approximately 3.7:1. Therefore, it is reasonable to be concerned that there is an increased relative risk of PGD following transplantation of lung allografts from donors with significant alcohol abuse and that a larger multi-center study would confirm our preliminary findings in this pilot study. In fact, even if we had determined in this pilot study that donor alcohol abuse significantly increased the relative risk of PGD at the <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 level, we would still need to confirm this finding in a larger multicenter study to ensure that the association was indeed generalizable.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, the AUDIT questionnaire has not been used in other clinical studies of lung donors, particularly to assess whether their antemortem alcohol use was associated with poorer post-transplant outcomes in lung allograft recipients. Although the standardized United Network for Organ Sharing questionnaires given to the surrogates of all potential organ donors include questions about alcohol use, those questions do not allow for specific and accurate classification of alcohol use disorders. Our group and others have used the AUDIT questionnaire in similar studies of critically ill individuals that have identified the increased risk of ALI in patients with alcohol use disorders.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Importantly, in many cases we have relied on surrogates to answer the AUDIT questionnaires for their loved ones, and this use of surrogates has been independently validated by other investigators.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, although the use of the AUDIT questionnaire in the particular context of lung transplantation is unique, its validated use in other clinical studies of critical illness and ALI support its use in this and future clinical studies of PGD and other post-transplant outcomes.</p>
              <p>The main limitation of our pilot study was that it was a single-center study with a small number of alcoholic donors and a moderately small total number of subjects. Therefore, we recognized from the outset that it was very likely that our study would be underpowered to identify a statistically significant association between donor alcohol abuse and the subsequent development of PGD. In addition, donor alcohol use was assessed by donor surrogates. Although this could potentially lead to greater misclassification of alcoholics than with self-reports, if anything one might expect surrogate questionnaires to underestimate the true incidence of alcohol abuse by donors. If so, then the true impact of alcohol abuse could be even greater than estimated by our study. Furthermore, because of the small numbers of subjects in this study, we could not simultaneously control for multiple confounding factors related to both donor and recipient characteristics. Finally, we presented donor alcohol effects only on PGD and length of initial hospital stay; other outcomes, such as infections, oxidative stress, re-hospitalizations and long-term outcomes, were not examined.</p>
              <p>However, if these preliminary findings are validated in a larger multi-center study, they would have important implications. As there are approximately 2,000 lung transplants performed in the United States annually, donor alcohol abuse may be responsible for a substantial number of cases of PGD and its associated morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we believe that this pilot study and its findings are provocative and that the increased risk of PGD in the context of donor alcohol abuse is consistent with extensive experimental and clinical evidence that overwhelmingly implicates alcohol abuse in the development of ALI in other settings.</p>
              <p>The role of donor-derived factors in the pathogenesis of PGD was highlighted by a report of significant association of PGD among shared lung, kidney and heart recipients from the same donor.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Despite optimization of donor and recipient selection criteria and advances in surgical techniques, PGD remains essentially refractory to treatment and is the primary cause of mortality in the immediate post-transplant period.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> As a result, a considerable body of research has focused on identifying donor risk factors that are associated with poor outcomes following transplantation. Elevated donor pre-transplant levels of biomarkers, such as receptor for advanced glycation end-products,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> IL-8<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and vascular endothelial growth factor,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> are associated with increased risk or severity of PGD in recipients in the post-transplant period. This current study suggests that donor alcohol abuse is a factor that may have a greater impact on the risk of PGD than any other single factor identified to date. Therefore, if our results are validated in a larger, multi-center study, they could have important implications not only for lung donor screening but also for the generation of novel therapeutic interventions. Specifically, we could capitalize on the ever-increasing knowledge of the mechanisms by which alcohol abuse renders the lung susceptible to injury to design and test treatments to limit the incidence and/or severity of PGD.</p>
              <p>There is considerable experimental evidence that a link between alcohol abuse and PGD is biologically plausible. For example, in an experimental rat model of transplantation, we determined that tracheal allografts from alcohol-fed donor rats developed more airway obliteration following heterotopic transplantation than tracheal allografts from control-fed rats.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These experimental findings argue that alcohol use, independently of factors such as smoking or other illicit drug use renders the airway susceptible to damage following transplantation. This experimental model in the context of airway transplantation builds on extensive earlier studies from our group on the effects of alcohol on lung epithelial function. For example, we determined that alveolar epithelial type II cells that were isolated from alcohol-fed rats had decreased surfactant production and were more susceptible to oxidant-mediated injury.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We also determined that alcohol ingestion alters alveolar epithelial barrier function <italic>in vivo</italic>, as reflected by increased protein leak across the alveolar barrier and decreased alveolar liquid clearance.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A common mechanism seems to be that alcohol ingestion dramatically decreases alveolar epithelial levels of glutathione, a critical antioxidant within the alveolar space, and increases both endotoxin-mediated acute edematous injury in isolated lungs that were perfused <italic>ex vivo</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and sepsis-mediated ALI <italic>in vivo</italic>.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Importantly, young and otherwise healthy subjects who meet criteria for alcohol abuse also have profoundly decreased levels of glutathione in their alveolar space.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, although chronic glutathione replacement in the alcohol diet in experimental animal models prevents glutathione depletion and thereby maintains alveolar epithelial function,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> it is unlikely that glutathione replacement alone could rescue the alcoholic lung in the context of ALI. For 1 reason, we determined that N-acetylcysteine, the only approved glutathione precursor available for human use, does not maintain the critical mitochondrial glutathione pool during alcohol feeding and does not preserve surfactant production.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This is consistent with previous clinical trials in which N-acetylcysteine therapy was minimally efficacious in patients with established ARDS, although those trials were not directed toward patients with a history of alcohol abuse.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In addition, the glutathione depletion within the airway is just 1 marker of the chronic oxidative damage that prolonged alcohol abuse inflicts on the airway, and this damage cannot be immediately reversed simply by the acute administration of glutathione supplements. Taken together, our experimental and clinical studies have identified that alcohol abuse causes previously unrecognized oxidative stress and epithelial dysfunction within the lung but that clinically significant therapeutic interventions will require a more comprehensive strategy than simple glutathione replacement.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Our data suggest that donor alcohol abuse may increase the risk of PGD following lung transplantation. Although this is at present a preliminary finding from a relatively small single-center study, it is consistent with the clearly established link between alcohol abuse and ARDS and is supported by a large body of experimental evidence over the past 2 decades showing that alcohol renders the lung susceptible to acute edematous injury. The results from this pilot study therefore provide a compelling argument to design and conduct a multi-center study to determine whether there is a true association between donor alcohol abuse and PGD and the magnitude of such an association if it exists. Based on the experimental and clinical evidence linking alcohol abuse to ARDS and ALI, there is in fact every reason to believe that PGD, which is essentially ALI/ARDS in the context of lung transplantation, is associated with donor alcohol abuse. The confirmation (or refutation) of such an association is critical to the lung transplant community and would have important implications for the evaluation and risk-stratification of donor-recipient pairs. Perhaps even more importantly, it would provide novel insights into the mechanisms that predispose a lung allograft recipient to develop PGD and therefore could lead to the design and testing of novel therapies to decrease the impact of this dreaded complication.</p>
