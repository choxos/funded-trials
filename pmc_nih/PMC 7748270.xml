                <p>The RV144 vaccine efficacy clinical trial showed a reduction in HIV-1 infections by 31%. Vaccine efficacy was associated with stronger binding antibody responses to the HIV Envelope (Env) V1V2 region, with decreased efficacy as responses wane. High levels of Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) together with low plasma levels of Env-specific IgA also correlated with decreased infection risk. We investigated whether B cell priming from RV144 vaccination impacted functional antibody responses to HIV-1 following infection. Antibody responses were assessed in 37 vaccine and 63 placebo recipients at 6, 12, and 36 months following HIV diagnosis. The magnitude, specificity, dynamics, subclass recognition and distribution of the binding antibody response following infection were different in RV144 vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients. Vaccine recipients demonstrated increased IgG1 binding specifically to V1V2, as well as increased IgG2 and IgG4 but decreased IgG3 to HIV-1 Env. No difference in IgA binding to HIV-1 Env was detected between the vaccine and placebo recipients following infection. RV144 vaccination limited the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies post-infection, but enhanced Fc-mediated effector functions indicating B cell priming by RV144 vaccination impacted downstream antibody function. However, these functional responses were not associated with clinical markers of disease progression. These data reveal that RV144 vaccination primed B cells towards specific binding and functional antibody responses following HIV-1 infection.</p>

                <p>The RV144 vaccine efficacy trial showed a reduction in HIV-1 infections that associated with binding antibody responses to the Envelope (Env) V1V2 loops but precise mechanisms remain unclear. To evaluate the effect of vaccine priming, we performed a systems serology analysis in 37 vaccine and 63 placebo recipients 6, 12 and 36 months after HIV-1 breakthrough infections. Vaccinees were characterized by strong V1V2-specific antibody responses synergized with V1V2-specific ADCP responses, whereas placebo recipients had stronger IgG3 and gp120-specific responses. The strongest distinguishing feature for vaccinees was IgG4 responses. RV144 vaccination enhanced Fc-mediated effector functions but limited the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies post-infection, which were found in eight placebo recipients but no vaccinee. These data show that RV144 vaccination primed B cells towards specific binding and functional antibody responses, with differences between groups still manifest three years after infection, i.e. on average five years after vaccination. These long-term consequences highlight that imprinting certain functions (while deterring other responses) could offer benefits even for leaky vaccines.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite advances in prophylaxis and treatment, an HIV-1 vaccine is needed to curb the AIDS epidemic [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The RV144 HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial showed a reduction in HIV-1 infections, 59.9% at 1 year and 31.2% at 3.5 years post-vaccination [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RV144 enrolled 16,402 Thai participants who received either a vaccine or a placebo. The vaccine regimen consisted of a canarypox vector prime (ALVAC encoding subtype B gag/pro inserts and a CRF01_AE Envelope (Env) insert) given at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months, accompanied by two recombinant gp120 proteins (AIDSVAX: subtype B MN and CRF01_AE A244) given at 3 and 6 months. A correlates study showed that the decreased risk of HIV-1 infection was associated with IgG binding antibodies (Ab) targeting the variable loops V1 and V2 of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein (V1V2) [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After responses peaked at 26 weeks (measured two weeks after the last immunization), V1V2 binding antibodies waned rapidly over time, which associated with waning efficacy. Notably, the presence of V1V2 binding antibodies and functional antibodies to HIV-1 Env was low or absent 6 months following vaccination in individuals who became infected. The importance of V2-specific responses was corroborated by a sieve analysis which showed that breakthrough sequences from vaccine recipients differed from those of placebo recipients at amino acid (AA) sites 169 and 181 in V1V2 [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, low Env-specific IgA responses or a high IgG/IgA ratio combined with high ADCC responses were identified as a secondary correlate of decreased risk of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These results highlighted the importance of binding antibodies in the effect of RV144, prompting further research into non-neutralizing Fc-mediated functions.</p>
              <p>Comparison of ALVAC/AIDSVAX (RV144) to administration of AIDSVAX alone (VAX003) revealed the importance of the combined regimen [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The RV144 regimen showed that IgG3 antibodies to V1V2 were correlated with a decreased risk of infection. High IgG3 responses also correlated with high ADCC responses suggesting that protection was mediated via Fc effector functional activity. These IgG3 antibodies were not durable; response rates declined from 79% to 0% between peak immunity (week 26) and six months later (week 52), correlating with a decrease in vaccine efficacy. A similar study confirmed that elevated gp120-specific IgG3 responses, relative to other features, distinguished the RV144 vaccine antibody profile [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. IgG3 antibodies against V1V2 were proposed to work in conjunction with IgG1 to induce ADCC and ADCP in RV144, but not in VAX003 [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IgG1 and IgG3 responses are considered conducive to favorable humoral responses, whereas IgG2 and particularly IgG4 can dampen humoral responses [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For VAX003, the high proportion of IgG4 responses was deemed characteristic of a non-efficacious vaccine profile [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>In contrast with the role of Fc-mediated effector functions in the RV144-induced protection [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], only weak neutralizing antibodies were elicited by the RV144 vaccine, which were not linked with vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cross-reactive NAbs arise during HIV-1 infection: approximately 20% of HIV-infected individuals produce NAbs with high breadth and potency [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The isolation of broad neutralizing antibodies from these individuals illustrates the wide range of targets on the HIV-1 Env, including different V2 apex bnAbs such as PG9, PGDM1400, and CAP256-VRC26 [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, since the RV144 vaccine regimen primed B cell responses to V1V2, we wanted to determine whether the development of neutralizing antibodies and Fc-mediated effector functions to V1V2 was accelerated in RV144-vaccinated individuals compared to placebo recipients following infection.</p>
              <p>Here we investigated the impact of vaccination on binding and functional antibody responses following HIV-1 breakthrough infection in RV144 vaccine and placebo recipients. Despite priming antibody responses to V1V2, RV144 vaccination restricted the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies, while Fc-mediated effector functions, especially V1V2-specific ADCP, were increased in vaccine recipients who became infected. This study highlights the impact of vaccination on downstream functional antibody responses in individuals with breakthrough infections.</p>

                <p>To determine the effect of B cell priming by RV144 vaccination on post-infection antibody responses, we characterized responses from 37 vaccine and 63 placebo participants who had received all immunizations (2 ALVAC and 2 ALVAC+AIDSVAX) among the 110 who became infected with HIV-1 CRF01AE viruses. Antibody profiling [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] on 188 samples assessed binding antibody subclass, specificity and magnitude against 52 HIV-1 antigens (24 gp140, 9 gp120, 9 V1V2, 5 V3, 5 other HIV-specific antigens) that included antigens used in the RV144 correlates analysis [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 16 CRF01_AE antigens (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold>). We compared immune responses from vaccine and placebo samples collected at three time points after HIV-1 diagnosis: 6 months (29–266 days; 29 vaccine, 31 placebo), 1 year (295–454 days; 18 vaccine, 39 placebo) and 3 years post-diagnosis (805–1188 days; 27 vaccine, 49 placebo). The distribution of IgG subclasses showed that IgG1 binding antibodies targeting gp140 and gp120 Envs dominated in both vaccine and placebo recipients <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">Fig 1A</xref>)</bold>. Vaccine recipients showed more IgG2 and IgG4 but less IgG3 binding antibodies than placebo recipients for gp120 and gp140 HIV-1 antigens. The IgG subclass distribution for V1V2 or V3 antigens was more balanced than the distribution seen for gp140 and gp120 antigens <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</bold> The dynamics of the binding antibody response from 6 to 36 months following infection (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s006">S1 Fig</xref></bold>) showed significant increases in the proportion of total IgG and IgG1 to Env overtime. The proportion of IgG2 and IgG4 responses decreased over time and specifically between 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. IgG3 responses also declined over time with a steeper decrease between 6 and 12 months after diagnosis particularly among placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s006">S1 Fig</xref>)</bold>.</p>

RV144 vaccine recipients had significantly higher levels of total IgG and IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 binding antibodies to V1V2 compared to placebo recipients at 6, 12 and 36 months post-diagnosis, indicating that the RV144 vaccine primed B cells towards V1V2 (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s007">S2</xref></bold>). Compared to placebo recipients, significantly higher levels of IgG2 binding antibodies were detected to all HIV-1 antigens 6 and 12 months following diagnosis in the vaccine recipients (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g002">2B</xref>)</bold>.

Contrary to the other subclasses, six months after diagnosis, the RV144 vaccine recipients showed significantly lower levels of IgG3 binding antibodies to gp120 and gp140 Envs and V3, but not to V1V2 compared to the placebo recipients (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g002">2C</xref></bold>). The vaccine/placebo difference in HIV-specific IgG3 binding antibodies waned over time and there was no difference between groups by year 3 (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g002">2C</xref></bold>). IgA responses, which had been associated with an increased risk of infection in the RV144 correlates analysis, were low and did not differ between treatment groups (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s007">S2</xref></bold>). In addition, Fcγ receptor engagement of binding antibodies targeting the HIV-1 Env were evaluated using 9 Fcγ receptors (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">Fig 1B</xref>)</bold>. Significant differences in Fcγ receptor engagement were observed for binding antibodies targeting the V1V2 region between vaccine and placebo recipients, likely due to dominant IgG1 responses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>).</p>

We filtered redundant immune features to reduce the number of variables to 221, 286 and 284 at 6 months, year 1 and year 3, respectively. From this subset, we found that an IgG4 gp120/gp140 response was consistently selected as the most predictive feature of the vaccine group by analyzing variable importance through Random Forest (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s008">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). As the high predictive power of IgG4 binding antibodies targeting gp120 or gp140 could mask the effect of other predictors, we performed Random Forest separately for each HIV-1 antigen. Interestingly, for V1V2, more features (instead of a single gp120/gp140 feature) had importance scores above 70% (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s008">S3 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
                <p>Using these selected predictors, we generated exploratory CART trees: at each time point, an IgG4 gp120 response was the most informative feature to classify vaccine and placebo participants <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). At 6 months, the IgG4 to A244Δ11 gp120 provided the best split, classifying 91% of the lower responders as placebo recipients and 96% of the high responders as vaccine recipients. The performance of the model was tested through cross-validation with the training data from month 6, achieving an AUC of 0.88 as well as with separate data from year 1 and year 3, achieving AUCs of 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. Data from years 1 and 3 replicated that a gp120-specific IgG4 response was the most discriminating (year 1: IgG4.gp120YU2 and year 3: IgG4.gp120MNΔ11) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). In addition, a V1V2-specific IgG2 response could further split the treatment groups at year 1, but by year 3, the difference between vaccine and placebo recipients had waned (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). Receiver operator curves (ROC) showed that the CART models performed well (AUC above 0.8) on both training and testing data, showing the lasting effect of the IgG4 priming up to 3 years post-diagnosis. LASSO models confirmed this robust selection of IgG4 responses from 6 months up to year 3 post-diagnosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s009">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Treatment groups were separated into responders (for vaccine recipients) and non-responders (for placebo recipients), using the top two selected immune predictors at all time points (scatter plots in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s009">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). The performance of LASSO models was validated through permutation tests and trained models achieved a significantly higher balanced accuracy compared to group-permutated null models (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s009">S4 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

                <title>RV144 vaccination restricted the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies following infection</title>
                <p>Since increased V1V2 binding responses were observed in the vaccine recipients, we next wanted to determine if B cell priming from RV144 vaccination accelerated the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting V2. One hundred and eighty samples at 12- and 36- months following HIV-1 diagnosis and prior to ART initiation were assessed for their ability to neutralize a panel of 34 pseudoviruses from subtypes A, B, C, D, CRFO1_AE and CRF02_AG using a robotic microneutralization assay [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s002">S2 Table</xref></bold>). The panel of viruses was dominated by subtype B, which was largely dictated by a previous study that could predict the neutralization specificity based upon the neutralization pattern, or fingerprint, of well characterized monoclonal antibodies [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, using this viral panel, we were able to determine the neutralization breadth, potency and specificity of neutralizing antibodies following HIV-1 infection. Forty-five samples from 17 donors were excluded from the subsequent analysis due to the detection of non-specific neutralization of MuLV (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s002">S2 Table</xref></bold>), yielding data from a total of 60 placebo and 29 vaccine recipients. Neutralization breadth and potency strongly correlated with each other and increased with time of infection in both groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Eight (16%) of the infected placebo recipients were able to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies with &gt;70% neutralization breadth three years after HIV-1 diagnosis, whereas none of the individuals who received the RV144 vaccination produced broadly neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing 70% of the viral panel (p&lt;0.04, Fischer’s exact test) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>). When considering a lower threshold of neuralization breadth, only 3 vaccinated individuals (11%) were able to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies that could neutralize &gt;50% of the viral panel compared to 15 (31%) placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>). Lower levels of neutralization breadth were observed as early as year 1 in the vaccine recipients, where none of the vaccine recipients were able to neutralize &gt;50% of the viral panel compared to 13% (5 out of 39) placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>). We analyzed breadth and potency outcomes using multivariate linear regression models at years 1 and 3 and also evaluated the rate of change. The analysis was conditioned on baseline predictors such as sex, age, risk or coinfection status and viral load. Using this model, neutralization breadth at year 1 was reduced among vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients (p = 0.041), but not at year 3 (p = 0.261). Neutralization fingerprinting [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was used to predict the neutralization specificity on samples with &gt;30% neutralization breadth. The membrane proximal external region (MPER) and the CD4 binding site were predicted to be most frequently targeted by neutralizing antibodies measured in both the vaccine and placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s003">S3 Table</xref></bold>). Overall, there was no difference in the frequency of neutralizing antibody specificities between the vaccine and placebo recipients, with both groups having similar frequency of neutralizing antibodies targeting V2. In summary, these data provide evidence that B cell priming from RV144 vaccination did not accelerate the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies following infection, and instead limited neutralization breadth compared to the placebo recipients.</p>

                <p>Since all individuals included in this study were infected with CRF01_AE viruses and the vaccine contained cognate CRF01_AE antigens (A244 gp120 and 92TH023 encoded within ALVAC), we expanded the viral panel to assess neutralization against 14 CRF01_AE viruses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s004">S4 Table</xref>).</bold> We found no evidence that RV144 vaccination augmented the post-infection neutralization response to CRF01_AE viruses. At both time points, breadth and potency did not differ across groups (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s010">S5 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
                <p>In addition, we evaluated the autologous neutralizing antibody responses between vaccine and placebo recipients by generating infectious molecular clones using a CRF01-AE backbone and <italic>env</italic> sequences sampled at the time of HIV-1 diagnosis from 9 vaccine and 14 placebo RV144 recipients. Autologous neutralizing responses were evaluated against 2 to 6 plasma samples, ranging from -500 to 1800 days from the day of diagnosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s011">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Responses were typically weak with no significant difference between ID<sub>50</sub> values observed for vaccine versus placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s011">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Since RV144 vaccine efficacy was genotype-specific, we compared responses against viruses with different residues at position 169 and 181. Because vaccine efficacy was strongest toward viruses with K169 or I181X, we expected that, in the vaccine group, neutralization would be stronger against viruses containing the K169 or I181X variants and lower against the vaccine-resistant variants, i.e. those with K169X or I181. Although overall neutralization responses were low, they tended to be higher against K169 than against K169X (p = 0.074) and higher against I181X than against I181 (p = 0.055) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s011">S6 Fig</xref></bold>), as would be expected from the vaccine efficacy results from the RV144 trial. In addition, stronger binding responses against the CaseA2 protein variant containing K169 were found compared to the wildtype CaseA2 among vaccine recipients, but not when using placebo samples (data not shown).</p>

                <title>B cell priming from RV144 vaccination enhanced Fc effector functions following infection</title>
                <p>Since previous studies have shown that Fc mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) may have contributed to vaccine efficacy in RV144 [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we examined the effect of ALVAC/AIDSVAX vaccination on Fc mediated effector function following breakthrough infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g005">Fig 5A–5J</xref></bold>). NK cell activation was assessed by intracellular staining (ICS) for IFNγ, TNF, and MIP1β to the cognate vaccine antigens gp120 A244 (AE) and V1V2 92TH023 (AE). Elevated antibody dependent NK cell activation was observed in RV144 vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients at year 1 post-diagnosis with higher levels of MIP1β when using gp120 as a target antigen as well as higher levels of IFNγ, TNF, and MIP1β when using V1V2 as a target antigen (all p&lt;0.01) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g005">Fig 5A–5C and 5G–5I</xref></bold>). In addition, B cell priming from RV144 vaccination increased levels of ADCP activity specific to V1V2, while no difference was detected between the vaccine and placebo recipients in ADCP activity to gp120 Env (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g005">Fig 5D and 5J</xref></bold>). The significant differences in NK cell activation and ADCP between the vaccine and placebo recipients waned with time of infection, mainly due to increased functions over time in the placebo recipients reaching levels closer to those of vaccinated individuals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g005">Fig 5A–5D and 5G–5J</xref></bold>). Interestingly, no differences were detected in ADCC responses to gp120 Env between the groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>), but there was a significant difference in trogocytosis to gp120 Env, where the vaccinated individuals exhibited enhanced Fc effector function at both 1- and 3- years post-diagnosis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>). These data indicate that the Fc mediated effector functions were overall enhanced one year after infection in individuals who were primed by vaccination in RV144 compared to placebo recipients.</p>

                <p>To identify if there was a comprehensive antibody and functional profile associated with vaccine recipients, we used PLSDA classification models combining Ab binding features with the four Fc effector functions assayed: ADCC, ADCP, trogocytosis and Ab-dependent NK cell activation. A distinct combination of immune responses defined the vaccine group and separated ALVAC/AIDSVAX vaccine recipient responses from those of placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>). The subset of binding features selected with Random Forest (as described above, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s008">S3 Fig</xref></bold>) (n = 13 at year 1 and n = 7 at year 3) and the 4 Fc effector functions discriminated vaccine participants with a mean balanced accuracy of 90% at year 1 and 70% at year 3 that was significantly different from group-permutated null models (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref></bold>).

In the vaccine group, ADCP-V1V2 responses were associated with V1V2 binding responses, and this was observed broadly across FcγR3, FcγR2 and IgG1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>). V1V2-specific binding and ADCP responses were the only correlations that remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.

Interestingly, the profile associated with V1V2-specific ADCP responses differed from the gp120-specific ADCP profile. As such, gp120-specific ADCP responses were linked to gp140 and gp120 binding responses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>). The high V1V2-specific ADCP responses in vaccinees were linked to the high V1V2 responses which discriminated vaccine from placebo recipients (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref></bold>).

                <p>Next, we determined the Spearman correlations between IgG subclasses and FcγR (Spearman Rho &gt; 0.5, p &lt; 0.05) at each time point to identify whether certain IgG subclasses were specifically associated with Fc effector functions. Only the associations between FcγR and IgG1 or total IgG showed some significant correlations. IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 responses were typically not significantly associated with FcgR binding (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s012">S7 Fig</xref></bold>). Fc effector functions with significant IgG1 associations were ADCP and trogocytosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s012">S7 Fig</xref></bold>), with no other IgG subclass correlated with Fc effector function. In addition, the neutralization breadth seen in the placebo recipients was associated with V3-, gp120- and gp140- specific responses but not V1V2 responses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s013">S8 Fig</xref></bold>); we note that the virus panel includes Tier 1A viruses (eg, SF162 and 93MW965) which are not indicators of potent neutralizing responses. Overall, vaccine recipients were characterized by a coordinated V1V2-specific ADCP response combined with strong trogocytosis linked with gp120 and gp140 binding antibodies following HIV-1 diagnosis.</p>

                <title>B cell priming from RV144 vaccination did not affect clinical outcomes</title>
                <p>The results presented above showed that, following HIV-1 infection, vaccine recipients had distinct immune profiles compared to the placebo recipients. We investigated whether the immune responses measured at peak vaccine induced immunity (two weeks after the last immunization, before infection) correlated with the responses measured after infection. Thirty four vaccinees were included in the RV144 case:controls study and had immune responses measured at peak immunity, a subset of them had experimental results available post-diagnosis at six months (n = 21), one year (n = 18) and three years (n = 24). We found no evidence of a relationship between peak immunity and post-infection measurements for neutralization breadth, ADCC or IgA responses (ADCP and trogocytosis were not measured for the correlates analysis thus precluding comparisons). Beside the small sample size, we note that both the neutralization breadth at peak immunity and the IgA responses post-infection showed very low signal (close to background), possibly explaining the lack of correlation. Binding responses to V1V2 showed some positive correlations especially when IgG3 responses were considered. For example, the pre-infection measurements of IgG3 responses against gp70_V1V2_BCaseA2 were associated with the IgG3 responses against V1V2_A244 measured 6 months post-infection (Spearman Rho = 0.59, p-value = 0). Overall, the small number of participants available for comparison and the time dependence of vaccine-induced immunity (decrease in vaccine-elicited responses over time coupled to the fact that infections occurred at different times after vaccination) complicated the interpretation of the comparison of pre- and post-infection immune responses.</p>
                <p>Since the immune profile differed between vaccine and placebo groups, we investigated a potential impact on clinical markers of disease progression. There were no significant set point viral load or CD4 count differences across vaccine and placebo groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref></bold>). Only weak associations were seen between IgG responses and set point viral load at 6 months with placebo participants (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). Moderate correlations between FcγR3b and set point viral load were observed in placebo participants 6 months after diagnosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s005">S5 Table</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). Fc effector functions were not associated with set point viral load of either vaccine or placebo recipients at year 1 or year 3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g008">Fig 8D</xref></bold>). Likewise, most of the Fc effector functions did not correlate with CD4 counts. Only the Env-gp120-specific NKICS assay showed a moderate association in vaccine participants three years after infection (Spearman Rho = 0.62, p = 0.006) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009101.g008">Fig 8E</xref></bold>). Overall, RV144 vaccine priming of functional antibodies did not impact markers of disease progression for breakthrough participants post HIV-1 infection. Therefore, neither the restriction in neutralization breadth nor enhancement of Fc effector function within the vaccine recipients appeared to affect disease progression.</p>

              <p>In this study, B cell priming after RV144 vaccination impacted the specificity, magnitude, dynamics and subclass distribution of the binding antibody response following infection and promoted Fc effector functions while restricting the development of neutralization breadth and potency. The RV144 vaccine strategy focused antibody responses towards V1V2 following infection, suggesting that memory B cells were recalled, yielding increased levels of V1V2 specific binding antibodies. IgG2 and IgG4 responses were boosted in vaccine recipients, while IgG3 responses were lower in the vaccine recipients compared to the placebo recipients. Over time the difference in binding antibody responses between vaccine and placebo groups declined, except for IgG4 responses whereby vaccine recipients still showed significantly higher responses three years after infection. The predominance of IgG4 responses is reminiscent of what was observed in VAX003 participants compared to RV144 participants [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In VAX003, IgG4 responses increased with additional protein immunizations. Interestingly, VAX003 participants received seven protein immunizations (weeks 0, 4, 24, 52, 72, 104 and 144) while RV144 participants received four immunizations at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24, with proteins included only at weeks 12 and 24. This raises the hypothesis that an additional immunization, like the breakthrough infections observed here, could promote further development of IgG4 responses. Since IgG4 responses are not usually associated with functional effector responses, it will be important to evaluate whether the extra boost included in the HVTN702 Phase III trial triggered IgG4-biased responses and thereby less functional effector responses. The HVTN702 trial, designed as a follow up to RV144, included an additional immunization but failed to show vaccine efficacy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/experimental-hiv-vaccine-regimen-ineffective-preventing-hiv">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/experimental-hiv-vaccine-regimen-ineffective-preventing-hiv</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>Unexpectedly, none of the infected vaccinated individuals developed neutralization breadth, while 16% of the placebo recipients were able to achieve neutralization breadth, similar to previous studies in naturally infected cohorts [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These neutralization differences indicated that the RV144 vaccine recipients were restricted in their development of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, although there was evidence of B cell priming to V1V2, this priming did not yield V1V2 bnAbs following infection (potent cross-neutralizing responses had also not been observed at peak immunity prior to infection). The lack of V1V2-specific breadth could be linked to differences in binding specificities for RV144 elicited V1V2 Abs when compared to V2-specific bnAbs. While antibodies identified in RV144 vaccinees, such as CH59, targeted a core epitope (HXB2 168–171) that is also recognized by prototypic V2-apex bnAbs, these Abs did not share the characteristics of known V1V2-glycan specific bnAbs such as PG9, CH01, PGT145 or CAP256.09. In addition, we found that the neutralization breadth observed in placebo recipients was not mediated by V1V2 features as associations were found only with Env-V3-, gp120- and gp140- specific responses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009101.s013">S8 Fig</xref></bold>), and the analysis of the neutralization specificity showed MPER and CD4 binding site targets with no increased specificity towards the V2 apex in the vaccine recipients. With time of infection, breadth and potency increased within RV144 vaccine recipients, and it is possible that these vaccinated individuals will eventually produce broadly neutralizing antibodies. Since studies of neutralization breadth are often concerned with the identification of bnAbs, there is limited data evaluating the early stages of development of bnAbs. Nonetheless, we noted that RV144 placebo participants showed similar neutralization activity as individuals in the RV217 cohort [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who had been infected for about three years (n = 73) (Shelly Krebs and Samantha Townsley). Although breadth development dynamics could accelerate in vaccinees at later stages of infection, we found no difference in the rate of neutralization development, suggesting that RV144 vaccination primed B cells towards non-neutralizing epitopes that diverted responses away from neutralizing epitopes [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Priming the B cells towards certain epitopes may have prevented the characteristic Env recognition that has been associated with the elicitation of bNAbs.</p>
              <p>An alternative hypothesis is that RV144 vaccine recipients in our study were those who did not mount a strong enough response to prevent infection. The efficacy seen in this trial means that the vaccine selected out intrinsically good V1V2 responders, i.e. vaccine breakthroughs were poor responders to vaccination (they had lower V1V2 binding responses) and may also be individuals with a limited ability to mount bnAbs upon infection. While our comparison of heterologous breadth neutralization (with a multi-subtype panel) indicated that vaccinees were at a deficit compared to placebo participants, we found no evidence of lower responses among vaccinees when we analyzed each participant’s autologous responses, their responses against all viruses from other participants in the cohort and the responses mounted against a set of 14 heterologous but subtype-matched viruses (all individuals in the cohort were infected with CRF01_AE viruses; both the vaccine prime and boost contained CRF01_AE inserts). The vaccinees’s ability to neutralize heterologous but related CRF01_AE viruses contrasts with the restriction in the ability to produce bnAb to more distant viruses comprising distinct subtypes. These findings contradict the hypothesis that vaccinees defined a group with intrinsically less effective HIV-1 immune responses, rather they indicate that the differential humoral responses between the two groups were qualitative and not the consequence of a quantitative impairment among vaccinees. This was confirmed by the stronger V1V2-specific binding and Fc effector antibody functions in the vaccine group than in the placebo group.</p>
              <p>Fc effector functions were enhanced in vaccine recipients following HIV-1 infection, including increased NK cell activation targeting V1V2 at year 1, increased ADCP targeting V1V2 at years 1 and 3, and increased trogocytosis to Env at years 1 and 3. Although ADCC was shown to be associated with protection previously, we did not observe a difference in ADCC between vaccine and placebo recipients following infection. In this cohort, the vaccine recipients were characterized by high V1V2-specific Ab binding and ADCP responses. Interestingly, the vaccine priming impact was limited to V1V2-specific ADCP responses whereas gp120-specific ADCP responses were not significantly associated with the vaccine status. In addition, there was no correlation between V1V2- or gp120-specific ADCP responses. This highlights that epitope-based differences can be identified with ADCP assays and warrants the inclusion of different antigens when ADCP is tested. However, although a coordinated V1V2-specific Fc binding and effector profile distinguished the vaccine group from the placebo group, neither this enhanced effector functional profile nor the restriction of neutralization breadth had an effect on HIV-1 set point viral load.</p>
              <p>Vaccine mechanisms are typically understood through case-control analyses whereby superior immune responses are identified in vaccine recipients who did not become infected by comparison with the responses elicited in vaccinees who became infected during the trial. Here we highlight a complementary approach which interrogates vaccine-induced immune responses elicited following HIV-1 breakthrough infections. A benefit of such analyses is that we can directly compare vaccine and placebo recipients and evaluate if differences between the groups were due to RV144 vaccination (the fact that the trial was a randomized and double-blinded phase 3 vaccine efficacy trial with no interference allows such evaluation provided that one controls for all baseline participant characteristics that predict HIV-1 infection and the post-infection endpoint) [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One limitation of our study was that not all RV144 breakthrough participants were included in our study as some had started anti-retroviral therapy. We were also not able to relate data obtained at peak immunity (prior to infection) to our data obtained post-infection.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found that vaccination impacted the downstream development of functional antibody responses in individuals who subsequently became infected. While RV144 non-neutralizing antibodies were effective at inducing Fc effector responses, this pathway seemed off-target regarding the development of broadly neutralizing responses, suggesting that vaccine priming dictated the type of immune responses elicited. Immunogenicity studies with Env trimers hint at a parallel phenomenon. Env trimers, which have been regarded as candidate vaccines that could perform better than recombinant proteins (as used in the RV144 trial), have, so far only rarely induced cross-reactive neutralizing responses and these were usually weak [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These trimers display epitopes such as the V3 loop or the base of the trimer (which do not exist in membrane-bound Env) that are immunodominant but are generally associated with non-neutralizing responses. Owing to their immunodominance, these non-neutralizing antibodies may prevent the elicitation of bnAbs [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In RV144 participants, the vaccine-induced predominance of B cells with high-affinity for non-neutralizing V2 antibodies suggests that they may out-compete other B cell clones (that could have matured to elicit bnAbs) in the germinal centers and thereby have a negative impact on the development of neutralization breadth in RV144 vaccinees. Hence, our findings illustrate the challenges in the path to a highly efficacious HIV-1 vaccine, as the success of a vaccine may not only derive from the induction of antibodies towards specific epitopes but also depend on the deterrence from other dead-end responses. These results indicate that antigenically imprinting desired responses in the memory B cell repertoire (while preventing other responses) may be critical to develop effective HIV-1 vaccines.</p>

                <p>Statistical analysis and visualization were performed using R statistical computing environment (with R packages ggplot2, gplot, rpart and mixOmics) [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Statistical significances were computed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated with two-tailed p values. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was applied to correct for multiple testing to control type-I error (p &lt; 0.05 for significance unless otherwise stated). The ComplexHeatmap library in the R environment was used for hierarchical clustering which grouped the immune measurements (detections and antigen features) by their similarities. Data were standardized before clustering by centering around zero and scaling to the standard deviation of one for each feature. For all neutralization assays, data were fitted to a 5-parameter asymmetric nonlinear regression model to obtain the IC50, or concentration of mAb/dilution of plasma needed to obtain 50% neutralization against a given pseudovirus. For neutralization assays in which a fold-change in IC50 imparted by a particular virus mutant, virus treatment, or binding stoichiometry (e.g., IgG vs. Fab) was reported, the IC50 obtained for one virus/assay condition was divided by the IC50 obtained for the other virus/assay condition, as indicated in the figure legends and <italic>y</italic>-axes of data graphs. All neutralization assays were repeated at least 2 times, and data shown are from representative experiments. Analysis was performed within R 3.6.0 through R Studio (1.1.453, R Consortium, Boston, MA). Figures were created using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and R 3.6.0.</p>

                <p>Collinear variables were removed using polyserial correlation to produce stable Random Forest and PLSDA discriminators. Polyserial correlation was applied to rank features according to their correlation with a treatment group while Spearman correlation was used to identify correlated features. A subset of high-quality non-redundant features was identified by removing correlated features. Features were considered in decreasing order of polyserial correlation coefficient, removing subsequent features that were highly correlated (p &gt; 0.8) to those already selected.</p>

                <title>Random Forest and Classification and Regression Trees (CART)</title>
                <p>A combined modeling approach integrating Random Forest and CART was adopted from [<xref rid="ppat.1009101.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The modeling method was performed with variables selected after the correlation filter. Random Forest processes were adapted as an additional variable selection procedure to improve the stability of the model. Random Forest selection was carried out independently for each HIV-1 antigen (gp120, gp140, V1V2 and V3). A Random Forest importance score metric was used to rank features according to their importance in classifying groups. A Random Forest algorithm (‘RandomForest’ function in R) was evaluated by drawing a bootstrap sample from the data (75% of the data) and variable importance scores were generated for each feature. The process was repeated to generate 200 random bootstrap samples to improve stability. Features were used into CART models if they achieved an average importance score of 70% or above for each antigen. An exploratory tree was then grown with the relevant features selected through random forest using the ‘rpart’ function in R package. The rpart algorithm splits the data recursively until a predefined termination criterion is met. The splitting at each iteration is based on a variable that results in the maximum reduction in the heterogeneity of a selected variable. The Gini Index, which measures how often a randomly selected variable incorrectly labels the designed groups, is used as a measure of heterogeneity. To evaluate model performance, AUC curves were created (i) using cross-validation on training data at each time point and (ii) using testing data from a different time points to the data used to train the model.</p>

                <p>PLSDA models were generated with Random Forest-selected non-redundant features to assess their ability to classify the treatment groups. The function ‘plsda’ in the mixOmics R package was used to generate each model at each of the time points by setting the number of components to 10 with all other parameters kept at default. The performance of each of the PLSDA models was assessed using permutation tests. We permuted the treatment groups to create a null model and recalculate the model using the permutated data as described above. The data was permuted 200 times and 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. A distribution of balanced of accuracy metrics obtained with the non-permutated/true groups was compared with that obtained with the permutated groups (null hypothesis) classification. The assumption was that the classification model created with the permutated data should fail to predict group classes.</p>

                <p>PLS models were generated to link Ab biophysical binding features to Fc effector functional features. Both PLS models with all the features and the sparse variation (sPLS) were used. sPLS combines both integration and variable selection in a one-step strategy to maximize the covariance between two data sets and identify latent variables. Univariate Spearman correlations were first generated for each pair of biophysical and Fc effector functional features, selecting features with a significant correlation coefficient (FDR &lt; 0.05) to be included in the PLS model. The sPLS process was performed using the `sPLS’ function from the mixOmics package in the R environment. We tuned the number of components (ncomp) using an ‘elbow’ method, selecting the ncomp where we observed a diminishing change in the variance captured as we increased ncomp. The number of variables to keep in each component was tuned using nfold cross validation repeated 100 times, selecting the number of variables resulting in the lowest MSE value for each component. Associations/links were visualized using heatmaps generated with the ‘cim’ function in the mixOmics package. sPLS models were generated separately for each treatment group in order to discern distinct humoral relationships in the vaccine group.</p>

Logistic classifiers were trained with the features selected through correlation filtering as mentioned above. The classifier models were trained within the R package using the `glmnet’ function with lambda selected through a 10-fold cross-validation. A final model used for visualization was trained using the model with the lowest cross-validation classification error. To assess the predictability of the classifier, 200 repetitions were performed evaluating the balanced accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validations with training and testing sets randomly selected internally by the ‘glmnet’ function. Note that low numbers in some groups may not guarantee that each fold had at least a sample available and that the uneven distribution between groups may not guarantee equal numbers of samples in each fold. Robustness was tested for the classifier using permutation testing. Group labels were permutated by randomly shuffling the treatment arm. A logistic classifier was then evaluated for the data with permutated groups through the same process as with the original data. This process was repeated 200 times, each time retrieving the balanced accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validations. A comparison of the distribution of balanced accuracy between the actual and permutated groups was analyzed in terms of effect size and the tail probability of the mean balanced accuracy of each distribution.</p>

                  <p>Panels A and B show the proportion of significant correlations (Spearman Rho &gt; 0.5, p &lt; 0.5) between IgG responses and either FcγR responses (A) or Fc effector function (B). The color represents the proportion of significant associations whereby higher proportions are marked in dark purple. The median Rho value of these significant correlations across all FcγR features is reported in each cell. (C) Significant Spearman correlations between Fc effector functions within each treatment groups. Blue: positive correlation; Cyan: negative correlation. Stronger colors represent significant correlations after correction for multiple testing.</p>
