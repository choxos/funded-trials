              <abstract>
                <p>Since 2015, India has coordinated the largest school-based deworming program globally, targeting soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in ~250 million children aged 1 to 19 years twice yearly. Despite substantial progress in reduction of morbidity associated with STH, reinfection rates in endemic communities remain high. We conducted a community based parasitological survey in Tamil Nadu as part of the DeWorm3 Project—a cluster-randomised trial evaluating the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission at three geographically distinct sites in Africa and Asia—allowing the estimation of STH prevalence and analysis of associated factors. In India, following a comprehensive census, enumerating 140,932 individuals in 36,536 households along with geospatial mapping of households, an age-stratified sample of individuals was recruited into a longitudinal monitoring cohort (December 2017-February 2018) to be followed for five years. At enrolment, a total of 6089 consenting individuals across 40 study clusters provided a single adequate stool sample for analysis using the Kato-Katz method, as well as answering a questionnaire covering individual and household level factors. The unweighted STH prevalence was 17.0% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 16.0–17.9%), increasing to 21.4% when weighted by age and cluster size. Hookworm was the predominant species, with a weighted infection prevalence of 21.0%, the majority of which (92.9%) were light intensity infections. Factors associated with hookworm infection were modelled using mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression for presence of infection and mixed-effects negative binomial regression for intensity. The prevalence of both <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris trichiura</italic> infections were rare (<italic toggle="yes">&lt;</italic>1%) and risk factors were therefore not assessed. Increasing age (multivariable odds ratio [mOR] 21.4, 95%CI: 12.3–37.2, p&lt;0.001 for adult age-groups versus pre-school children) and higher vegetation were associated with an increased odds of hookworm infection, whereas recent deworming (mOR 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2–0.5, p&lt;0.001) and belonging to households with higher socioeconomic status (mOR 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2–0.5, p&lt;0.001) and higher education level of the household head (mOR 0.4, 95%CI: 0.3–0.6, p&lt;0.001) were associated with lower odds of hookworm infection in the multilevel model. The same factors were associated with intensity of infection, with the use of improved sanitation facilities also correlated to lower infection intensities (multivariable infection intensity ratio [mIIR] 0.6, 95%CI: 0.4–0.9, p&lt;0.016). Our findings suggest that a community-based approach is required to address the high hookworm burden in adults in this setting. Socioeconomic, education and sanitation improvements alongside mass drug administration would likely accelerate the drive to elimination in these communities.</p>

                <p>Approximately 1 in 5 people in India are infected with soil transmitted helminths (STH), leading to anaemia and malnutrition. To tackle this large burden of infection, the government of India launched one of the world’s largest school-based deworming programs in 2015 aiming to deworm all pre-school and school-aged children between 1 to 19 years of age twice yearly on the National Deworming Days. Deworming programs, including those in India, are focused on pre-school aged children, school aged children and women of reproductive age group. However, prevailing environmental and socioeconomic conditions, including poor sanitation, can contribute to high rates of reinfection from untreated adults and children. The DeWorm3 Project is a cluster-randomised trial evaluating the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission with community wide deworming of all individuals aged one to 99 years of age or older. As part of the study, we conducted a parasitological survey in the Deworm3 trial site in rural Tamil Nadu. Here we present the factors associated with STH infection and burden in these communities.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Soil-transmitted helminths (STH)—<italic toggle="yes">Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, hookworms (<italic toggle="yes">Ancylostoma duodenale</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Necator americanus</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris trichiura</italic>—are among the most common infections globally, with India estimated to have the highest number of cases (375 million) according to the Global Burden of Disease estimates, 2013 [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Significant worldwide reductions in prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic> (-25.5% since 1990) have been estimated, but these reductions have been modest for <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris</italic> (-11.6%) and even smaller for hookworm (-5.1%) [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In more recent estimates (2015), 258 million (or 1 in 5) individuals in India are estimated to be infected with STH, with 148 million <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic>, 109 million hookworm and 41 million <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris</italic> infections, indicating a lower prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris</italic>, but a higher prevalence of hookworm than previous reports [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moderate- and heavy-intensity (MHI) hookworm infections are associated with lower haemoglobin levels and anaemia particularly affecting pregnant women and young children who often have low baseline iron stores [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While a recent Cochrane review indicated that regular deworming of children in public health programmes does not seem to improve outcomes [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a study using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 45 STH endemic countries found that there was a consistent association between deworming and reduced stunting in pre-school-age children (PSAC) [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is especially relevant in India, where more than half the children under 5 years are stunted [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Deworming has also been shown to improve nutritional status, cognition and school performance in school-age children (SAC) [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>The WHO-recommended strategy is focused on controlling morbidity through mass drug administration (MDA) of anthelmintic drugs, albendazole or mebendazole, targeted to PSAC, SAC, women of reproductive age (WRA) and other at-risk populations, aiming for 75% coverage in these populations by 2020 [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the lymphatic filariasis (LF) control programme has delivered albendazole alongside diethylcarbamazine (DEC) through community-wide treatment in over 250 endemic districts in India since 2004 [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], STH burden has remained high [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) in India has since introduced the world’s largest school-based deworming program, targeting ~240 million children aged 1 to 19 years twice yearly (biannual) during the ‘National Deworming Days’ (NDD) conducted in February and August since 2015 [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Eleven states/union territories participated at the launch (including Tamil Nadu) and this program expanded to 33 states/union territories in 2019. With primary school enrolment exceeding 99% in India [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the involvement of anganwadi centres (a government run centre in each village providing care for pregnant women and children under 6 years of age under the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme), this is a highly effective way of reaching out to PSAC and SAC to carry out a targeted deworming program.</p>
              <p>Reinfection rates in endemic communities with ongoing targeted deworming programs are often high due to poor sanitation, high rates of open defecation, migration and persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated adults [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While India has initiated large-scale programs to provide toilet access and reduce open defecation, [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in the absence of significant structural improvements in sanitation, targeted deworming programs would likely need to be continued indefinitely [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, meta-analyses, mathematical models and empirical field studies suggest that a community-wide deworming strategy including individuals of all ages may be effective in interrupting transmission of STH infections [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The recent launch of the WHO 2030 targets for STH control programmes has also emphasised the goal of achieving and maintaining elimination of STH morbidity in pre-SAC and SAC as well as the need to establish an efficient STH control programme for WRA. This has highlighted the need for robust epidemiological data to inform the strengthening of future efforts to control or interrupt transmission of STH [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>The vast majority of empirical data monitoring the progress of the NDD and demonstrating STH burden reductions in children in India have been collected through school surveys [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

We present the results of an age-stratified community STH survey conducted at baseline with participants enrolled into a longitudinal monitoring cohort as part of the DeWorm3 trials, evaluating the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission by comparing community-wide MDA to school-age-targeted deworming [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03014167). Prior to the initiation of the study in India, a technical review meeting was convened with government authorities at the national level and subsequently sensitization meetings were held with officials at the state, district and block levels. Meetings were held with local community leaders to explain the purpose of the study and procedures. Information sheets in Tamil, the local language, were provided to participants before each study activity. Written informed consent was sought from the household head for households’ participation in the census. All LMC participants ≥18 years provided written informed consent while parental consent for participants &lt;18 years was obtained along with verbal assent for children aged 7–11 years and written assent for children aged 12–17 years.</p>

The Timiri block is located in the plains of Vellore district and comprises four primary health centres (PHCs), each in turn divided into 25 health subcentres (HSCs). Each PHC serves a population of ~30,000 and each HSC ~5,000 respectively. This area has an average annual rainfall of 971 mm and has the following soil types; sandy and sandy loam 19%, red loam soil 20.8%, clay and clay loam 57.9% and black cotton soil 4.27% [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the most common occupation in this rural block is agriculture (20%), individuals also work in nearby industries as skilled and semi-skilled labourers. The Jawadhu Hills block comprises of three PHCs and is further subdivided into 13 HSCs with each PHC serving a mostly tribal population of ~20,000 and each HSC ~3,000 respectively. This block is located 762 metres above mean sea level in a reserve forest area. The tribal or indigenous people that populate this area are the Malayali and are classified as a scheduled tribe (disadvantaged communities or group of people listed in a schedule of the Indian constitution under article 342) by the government. The mean annual rainfall in Jawadhu Hills is 1100 mm, the mean maximum temperature is 36.6°C and about 50% of the soil is red loamy clay and sandy soil. The main occupation is subsistence farming with more than 90% of the population involved in agricultural activities.

In the India site, 115 trained field workers conducted a baseline household census between October and December 2017 across 219 villages in Timiri and 154 villages in Jawadhu Hills. At each household, following informed written consent provided by the household head or equivalent adult, household- and individual-level data were collected with a questionnaire programmed using SurveyCTO software (Dobility, Inc; Cambridge, MA and Ahmedabad, India) on an Android smartphone [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Demographic details such as age and sex were collected for all household members and were verified using state or central Government of India (GOI) issued identification cards (Aadhar card, Electoral Identity Card, Driving Licence or Birth Certificate). Household-level information including number of persons in the family, assets, sources of income and access to water and sanitation facilities were collected. Housing characteristics such as flooring, roof and walls were observed by field workers. All households were provided a study ID card that contained the household ID linked QR code sticker, name of the head of household and the address. Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates were collected for all households censused, as well as for all structures at which no household members were found on three separate visits—these were classified as vacant or non-residential structures.</p>

Contiguous cluster boundaries were confirmed on the basis of administrative and geographical boundaries. Clusters were, on the whole, demarcated in line with HSCs, being divided along village boundaries where necessary, based on the requirement for clusters to comprise populations between 1,650 and 4,000. All villages within the study site boundaries were included. A total of 692 consented households from different health blocks that were located on the periphery of the cluster boundaries had been censused but were excluded during the demarcation process. A total of 32 clusters were defined in Timiri and 8 in Jawadhu Hills. In Jawadhu Hills, each HSC equated to a single cluster. While a majority of HSCs could be equated to single cluster in a Timiri, six HSCs were split into multiple clusters due to high population density.</p>

                <p>Following the census and cluster demarcation, 6,000 individuals from the 40 clusters were recruited into a longitudinal monitoring cohort (LMC) to be followed up for five years. Age-stratified random sampling of 150 enumerated individuals with PSAC aged 1–4 years, SAC aged 5–14 years and adults aged 15 years and above in a ration of 1:1:3 was used to recruit 150 individuals in each cluster. All censused individuals above one year of age who were permanent residents, i.e. residing in the study area for more than six months and not planning to move out of the study area for the study duration, willing to provide informed consent (and assent where applicable) and provide samples, were eligible for recruitment. The survey was conducted between December 2017 to February 2018 in the local language spoken by all participants (Tamil) during which individual-level data including school enrolment, highest education level achieved, deworming history and shoe-wearing at the time of the survey were collected. Additionally, household water and sanitation facilities were observed, where possible, with indicators on construction materials and usage recorded.

The containers had QR code stickers displaying the 9-digit participant ID, which was scanned upon receipt. The stool samples were transported on ice to the laboratory daily. All samples were read in duplicate by the Kato-Katz method by trained technicians who screened each slide (also labelled with the QR code sticker) for a minimum of six to eight minutes and within 30 minutes of preparation. The number of eggs in each slide was recorded on smartphones also using SurveyCTO software-based forms. The presence of other helminth ova and larvae was recorded but not quantified. With each batch, 10% of the slides were randomly checked by a supervisor for quality control. Presence of infection was determined if either one of the slides had at least one egg. Intensity of infection was calculated as the arithmetic mean of eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) by multiplying the eggs counted with a factor of 24 since the template used delivered 41.7 mg of stool.

Age- and cluster-population-weighted estimates were calculated using the proportion of the censused population living in the cluster. Population density per km<sup>2</sup> was estimated through totalling the number of censused individuals falling within a one km<sup>2</sup> buffer placed around each household in ArcGIS. For households near study area boundaries, the number of censused individuals was divided by the buffer area falling within the boundary. Principal component analysis (PCA) in line with Filmer and Pritchett’s widely used method [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was used to arrive at a composite wealth index using various assets that were available to the households that included ownership of cooking fuel, electricity, radio, stove, DVD, television, computer, refrigerator, sofa set, mattress, solar lamp, ceiling fan, watch, mobile phone bicycle, motorcycle, autorickshaw, cart, car, livestock, house ownership, and housing materials. Cronbach’s alpha assessed the dimensionality of the items included in the composite wealth index, and an item-rest correlation of 0.1 was set as a minimum threshold for including the item in the PCA. Variables with item-rest correlation less than 1 were removed and Cronbach’s alpha value was computed again to see if all the variables were pointing to a similar direction with overall alpha set at 0.7.

To fit the models, all significant (p&lt;0.05) variables in the mixed-effects multilevel univariable analyses, were included in the multivariable model and a backwards stepwise approach was used to arrive at the most parsimonious models. Data with more than 500 missing values were excluded from multivariable analysis.

Six other helminth species were also identified in 132 (2.2%) LMC participants during the survey and the more common species were <italic toggle="yes">Enterobius vermicularis</italic> (96, 1.6%) and <italic toggle="yes">Hymenolepis nana</italic> (27, 0.4%) (<xref rid="pntd.0009338.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

                <p>As infections with <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris</italic> were very low, further analysis was carried out only for hookworm infections. The results of the univariable and multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression analysis for hookworm infection are presented in <bold><xref rid="pntd.0009338.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>. In the univariable analysis, individual and household factors were associated with hookworm infection and nearly half of these variables remained significant in the multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression analysis. PSAC, SAC and adults had a hookworm prevalence of 2.6% (95% CI: 1.8–3.7), 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.2), and 24.8% (95% CI: 23.4–26.2) respectively. In the multivariable regression, SAC (multivariable odds ratio [mOR] 3.8, 95% CI: 2.3–6.3) and adults (mOR 21.4, 95% CI: 12.3–37.2) were more likely to be infected (p&lt;0.001) compared to PSAC (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0009338.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0009338.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>). Sex was not found to be associated with hookworm infection at the univariable or multivariable level. Among the other individual characteristics analysed, those who had a history of deworming in the past 12 months were less likely to be infected than those who did not (mOR 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2–0.5, p&lt;0.001) but wearing shoes (based on observations during the survey) was not associated with reduced hookworm infection risk. After accounting for other variables, migratory status was no longer associated with hookworm infection and neither was livestock ownership or family size.</p>

                <p>At the household level, a decreasing prevalence of hookworm was seen as education of the head of household increased, with a prevalence of 27.3% among those belonging to a household where the head had no education and 7.7% among those with household heads having higher secondary or college education. In the multivariable model the odds of infection were significantly lower among those with household heads having higher secondary or college education than in individuals from a household where the head had no education (p&lt;0.001). Female literacy in the family also showed a similar correlation but was not included in the multivariable analysis. A decrease in odds of hookworm infection with increase in socioeconomic status of the household was also seen (mOR 0.3 per quintile, 95% CI: 0.2–0.5, p&lt;0.001) (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0009338.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref></bold>). Although belonging to a household with flooring made of man-made materials was found to be associated with decreased odds initially (OR 0.7, 95%CI: 0.5–0.9, p = 0.004), after accounting for other variables, this did not remain significant in the multivariable analysis. When household WASH factors were analysed in the univariable analysis, those belonging to households with improved sanitation and having handwashing facilities had a reduced odds of infection, (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5–0.8, p&lt;0.001) and (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5–0.7 p&lt;0.001) respectively. Sanitation did not remain significant in the multivariable analysis and handwashing was not analysed further due to missing data.</p>

                <p>The mean (SD) EPG in PSAC, SAC and adults was 538.8 (847.7), 389.7 (746.3), 661.1 (1562.3) respectively with a trend of increased EPG in adults seen in both sexes (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0009338.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>). In the multivariable analysis (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0009338.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></bold>), an increased infection intensity ratio (IIR) was seen for both SAC (multivariable IIR [mIIR] 9.2, 95% CI: 4.3–19.7) and adults (mIIR 332.5, 95% CI: 166.4–664.5, p&lt;0.001) compared to PSAC. Although female sex appeared associated with higher intensity infections, after accounting for other associated factors, this relationship was no longer significant. Those who had a history of deworming in the past 12 months had a lower EPG (mIIR 0.1, 95% CI: 0.1–0.2, p&lt;0.001). No other factors at the individual level were associated with intensity of infection.</p>

                <p>At the household level, decreasing intensity of hookworm as education of the head of household increased was seen (mIIR 0.2, 95%CI: 0.1–0.5, p&lt;0.001). Female education also showed a similar correlation with intensity of infection. The association with SES was also similar to that seen with presence of infection (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0009338.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref></bold>) with a decreasing intensity of hookworm infection with increase in socioeconomic status of the household (mIIR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1–0.4, p&lt;0.001). When household WASH factors were analysed, those belonging to households with improved sanitation had a lower infection intensity than those residing in households with unimproved facilities (mIIR 0.6, 95%CI: 0.4–0.9). Belonging to households with a handwashing facility was also associated with lower intensity compared to households that did not have facilities in the univariable analysis (IIR 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2–0.5).</p>

              <p>The results of this parasitological survey conducted in an age-stratified cohort of 6089 individuals nested within the censused Deworm3 trial population of 140,932 individuals in southern India showed that hookworm was the most common STH infection in this region. The prevalence of hookworm was high and consequently remains a significant public health problem. Our study site is unique as it incorporates two subsites—a rural plain area of 32 clusters in Timiri and a difficult-to-reach, hilly area of 8 clusters in Jawadhu Hills with a mostly tribal population. The censused population comprehensively described the communities and age demographic profile that is typical of the region and the LMC surveyed was representative of the population enumerated. Our study indicated that a range of individual, household and environmental factors in these communities including age, SES, education, sanitation and vegetation influence both the odds of infection and the intensity of infection.</p>
              <p>As reported in the pooled analysis [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the age-weighted prevalence of STH in the India site was substantially higher (21.4%) than both the Malawi and Benin study sites, with the vast majority of infections attributable to hookworm. Only a small proportion of infections were of MHI (1.5%). Due to the low number of <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Trichuris</italic> infections detected, further analysis was limited to factors associated with hookworm prevalence and intensity in this population. While no previous data are available from the Timiri area, previous studies at Jawadhu Hills have shown a high prevalence of hookworm—38% in 2011–12 and 18.5% in 2013–14—despite multiple rounds of treatment with albendazole in the district as part of the LF control program [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Data collected from the neighbouring district, Villupuram, in Tamil Nadu in 2000, prior to the commencement of the LF programme involving combined administration of Albendazole, found an STH prevalence of 60% among children aged 9–10 years, with particularly high <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic> prevalence. A 70% decrease in STH prevalence after three rounds of MDA with DEC and Albendazole was recorded among SAC [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These reductions in prevalence over time and the very low proportion of MHI infections observed in this study would suggest that, despite the ongoing transmission of hookworm, the LF programme and the school-based deworming programmes have been effective in reducing heavy intensity hookworm infections and possibly the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Ascaris</italic> in SAC.</p>
              <p>The analyses highlighted several important correlates of hookworm infection in this setting. One of the most prominent of these was age, which was associated both with increased odds of infection as well as higher intensity of infection. This age intensity profile associated with hookworm has been described previously in several studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In our analyses, sex was not associated with hookworm infection. While adult males are sometimes found to be at higher risk for hookworm infection [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], previous studies conducted in this region have similarly found no association between sex and hookworm infection [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although not significant, the prevalence of infection by sex was similar until the 4<sup>th</sup> decade after which women had a higher prevalence than men. An increase in intensity of infection but not prevalence in older women has been noted in previous studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As expected, a history of deworming was associated with substantially (70%) reduced infection prevalence and intensity. This result is in line with the majority of community surveys conducted within the context of an ongoing school deworming programme [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and highlights the successes of the strategy in the target group, which in the India NDD extends further than in many endemic countries (1 to 19 year olds included).</p>
              <p>A higher level of education of the head of household and high SES were both independently strongly associated with decreased odds of infection as well as decreased intensity of infection. These findings are similar to many other community STH studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. SES is closely related to several other household-level factors measured in the survey, one such example is flooring. Although a manmade floor was found to be associated with lower odds of infection in univariate analysis, floor type was not significantly associated after accounting for SES. This is likely because flooring was highly correlated with other housing construction variables included in the SES composite variable.</p>
              <p>With India currently implementing the world’s largest sanitation programme, the Swachh Bharat Mission, there has been an unprecedented scale of toilet building but functionality and uptake remain challenges [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a study in rural Odisha, India increased community sanitation coverage did not reduce diarrheal disease or acute respiratory infections but a reduction in prevalence of helminth infections was seen along with a reduction in stunting in children under 5 [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In our study, although unimproved sanitation (including open defecation) was not associated with an increased odds of hookworm infection, residing in a household with access to improved sanitation was associated with decreased intensity of infection. Soil samples from a smaller proportion of households in the study site have been collected to quantify environmental STH contamination. These results will be presented in a future paper and may be useful in elucidating the relationships between sanitation access, peri-domestic risk and intensity of infection. Access to a facility to wash hands with soap and water in the household was also associated with decreased risk of infection as well as lower intensity of infection but was not included in the final multivariable model as data were not available for 590 households. In a meta-analysis of studies that applied JMP definitions to categorize WASH facilities, both access to sanitation as well as access to water and hygiene facilities were associated with reduced odds of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. While the effect of WASH interventions are not easily evaluated especially in the context of other interventions [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the importance of integrating comprehensive behavioural and structural WASH interventions and access to potentially sustain the gains made from deworming in the longer term has been highlighted in a recent modelling study [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p>Environmental factors that affect temperature, soil moisture and atmospheric humidity influence the rate of survival and development of hookworm larvae thereby affecting transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this study, both increased vegetation (NDVI) and elevation were associated with increased odds of infection as well as an increase in intensity of infection. In another study using remotely sensed data at a fine resolution in Jawadhu Hills, topographical parameters of elevation and slope were negatively and positively associated with hookworm infections at the village level [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Riess <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. have shown that ecological variables are associated with hookworm infection but have differing effects within a geographical region, are scale-dependent and urge caution against prediction at smaller scales using large-scale data [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, the effect of elevation in the current study is likely to be associated with the topographical differences between the Timiri and Jawadhu subsites and needs to be explored further using a finer resolution approach.</p>
              <p>A robust study design was used to assess the burden of STH among community members in the study site. However, these results presented here are based on a parasitological survey conducted using the Kato Katz technique on a single stool sample, which has been shown to be sub-optimal in estimating prevalence, especially in low intensity settings [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This limitation will be addressed by future analyses on these samples using field-validated high throughput species specific qPCR [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Tribal communities have previously been shown to have higher STH transmission than plains populations, especially urban populations [<xref rid="pntd.0009338.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Further analyses by sub-site and using spatial analyses would be useful to tease out these additional correlates of risk in these different settings and highlight heterogeneity in infection risk. These analyses are not possible at this stage of the trial due to blinding restrictions.</p>
              <p>The findings presented here highlight that despite several years of community-based deworming through the LF programme and multiple rounds of school-based deworming, community transmission of hookworm is still persisting in both rural and tribal areas of Tamil Nadu, especially in adults. This study provides important, robust data that will be useful to the research community as well as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in planning future potential expansion of the deworming program with synergy across other initiatives including the anemia free India targeting WRA, MDA for lymphatic filariasis in endemic districts and the recently launched Poshan Abhiyaan program that also provide albendazole with a view towards interrupting transmission.</p>

              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The objectives and study design are clear. The setup seems appropriate and thorough, and the aims are reasonable given the study design. The statistical methods appear appropriate and ethical requirements appear to have been followed.</p>
              <p>• Please provide more info about how you went from 10144 to 8517. It’s not clear to me from Figure 2 either—what made the additional people “not required”?</p>
              <p>• Were surveys undertaken entirely in Tamil, or were any tribal or other languages used?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes. This study is nested within a much larger, very well-resourced and very well designed, longitudinal cohort study. It would improve with further clarity on the stool specimens collected:</p>
              <p>Since the predominant parasite identified is hookworm, which has the least in vitro survival (once the stool is voided, from amongst the other STH parasites), and the key study outcome is intensity or number of hookworm eggs per gram of stools, it is very important to share the time from stool voiding to reading the slides. A delay can falsely underestimate the intensity. It is mentioned that stools were collected daily and transferred for lab reading every day: not clear how that translates to individual sample read time (median/mean and range, etc.).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The results are clear, reasonable, and match the analysis plan. The figure and tables are appropriate and interesting. The image resolution appears a bit low, but perhaps will be fine if they are not shown in this large size in the final version.</p>
              <p>• Your main findings in terms of correlates of hookworm infection seem to be environmental (though you acknowledge that this may be affected by environmental differences between the study sites), SES/education, and history of deworming. You use a mixture of univariable and multivariable models, but I would like to know whether history of deworming and SES/education are correlated. Two potential ways I could see this occurring are if a) people with more education had better access to healthcare or b) people with more education were more aware of past deworming as they had been provided with information about past treatment in a way that was accessible to them. If they are correlated with each other, it might be worth noting, just as you mention how you controlled for other variables when looking at social determinants. If not, then no issues.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Excellent and clearly presented results linked to the study objective. Minor question below can be clarified:</p>
              <p>1. Authors report a higher refusal rate in persons from higher SES and education status (page 13 - Results). Could this translate to possible overestimation of the hookworm prevalence?</p>
              <p>2. What was the reported PCT coverage for previous LF MDAs in the study areas? Would be good to know to relate to possible impact on Ascaris and Trichuris (though latter is less impacted by Albendazole treatment alone).</p>

              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The conclusions are well-supported, limitations are described (perhaps a bit more on potential bias especially in terms of the cascade of how participants were selected or opted out all the way down from the census to the number in the end with parasitological data). Good implications and relevance. Perhaps address any concerns if there's any chance (mentioned above in results comments) that people with lower educational attainment are less likely to report recent deworming (or that these two variables are potentially related in any other way).</p>

              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: • Since biannual can mean either twice a year or once every two years, please clarify by changing to “twice a year”</p>
              <p>• I think Lo 2018 might be better summarized as something like “a study using data from 45 countries found that there was a consistent association between deworming and reduced stunting in pre-school-age children (PSAC)” rather than “multiple studies have shown the benefits of deworming in endemic countries including a reduction in stunting in pre-school-age children (PSAC)”</p>
              <p>• Perhaps you could define an anganwadi center</p>
              <p>• I quibble with calling school-based deworming a “highly effective approach”, as it might be interpreted as meaning highly effective at reducing infection, which is the subject of your study rather than the basis for it. You might rephrase to “this is a highly effective way of reaching PSAC and SAC”.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: As above</p>

If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Overall, this is a thoughtfully done study looking at correlates of hookworm infection at two study sites, which is nested within a much larger deworming study. The correlates of reinfection are not too surprising, but this work is important. The finding that hookworm prevalence remains high is more interesting than it would otherwise be, as the authors have extensive knowledge of past community-based deworming for LF and school-based deworming in these study areas. Thus, the high prevalence is not just a snapshot of a random location, but proof that the programs which have targeted these areas have not yet achieved the elimination of STH as a public health problem in these areas.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a very well designed, well-conducted study which will add important knowledge for STH control (underscoring the confirmation of the need to treat adults as well as children to holistically address STH morbidity, especially in areas with a high burden of hookworm).</p>

              <p>Dear Ajjampur,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Epidemiology of soil transmitted helminths and risk analysis of hookworm infections in the community: results from the DeWorm3 Trial in southern India," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
