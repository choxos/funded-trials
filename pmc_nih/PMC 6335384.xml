                  <p>Placing food further away from people decreases likelihood of consumption (“Proximity Effect”). However, it is unclear how proximity affects consumption when both healthier and less healthy foods are available and cognitive resource for self-control is limited.</p>

                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>To test the hypothesis that when both healthier (raisins) and less healthy (chocolate M&amp;Ms) foods are available, placing less healthy food far, rather than near, increases the likelihood that healthier food is consumed.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>General population participants (<italic>N</italic> = 248) were all put under cognitive load and randomised to one of four groups: 1. Raisins near (20 cm), M&amp;Ms far (70 cm); 2. Both foods near; 3. M&amp;Ms near, raisins far; 4. Both far. Primary outcome: proportions of participants consuming raisins and M&amp;Ms, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The results did not support the primary hypothesis: when healthier and less healthy foods were both available, placing M&amp;Ms far, rather than near, did not increase likelihood of consuming raisins (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.54, <italic>p</italic> = .432). Regardless of the M&amp;Ms proximity, likelihood of consuming raisins was unaffected by the raisins’ proximity (62.9%(near) vs. 56.5%(far) <italic>OR</italic> = 0.61, <italic>p</italic> = .211). Likelihood of consuming M&amp;Ms non-significantly decreased when they were far and raisins were near, and when both foods were far (<italic>OR</italic> = 2.83, p = .057). Likelihood of consuming M&amp;Ms was affected by M&amp;Ms proximity, being higher when near (68.3%) than far (55.6%), <italic>OR</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = .015. Indices of cognitive load impact (higher vs lower) were unrelated to consumption of either food.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Likelihood of consuming a healthier food was unaffected by its proximity and that of a less healthy food. By contrast, likelihood of consuming a less healthy food was influenced by its proximity and possibly by that of a healthier food. These effects need replication in studies designed to detect smaller effect sizes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0010">Many people in high-income countries consume diets that undermine their health, including excessive consumption of foods that are high in calories and fat (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Monsivais &amp; Drewnowski, 2009</xref>), and few fruits and vegetables (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Stringhini et al., 2011</xref>). Such suboptimal diets significantly contribute to poor health at population level (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Newton et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0015">Two key factors that contribute to the high prevalence of unhealthy diets are the presence of food environments characterised by widely available cheap, appealing foods, and the cognitive resources to resist these. Cognitive resources are sets of mental processes comprising intelligence and executive functions (EF). EF includes response inhibition, allowing for self-control of impulsive actions, and support for self-regulation through on-going monitoring of behaviour (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Diamond, 2013</xref>). Response inhibition varies across individuals both at trait (innate) and state (temporary fluctuations) level. At trait level, the ability to resist reaching for a toy in childhood predicts EF in adolescence, an association considered to be primarily genetic in origin (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Friedman, Miyake, Robinson, &amp; Hewitt, 2011</xref>). At state level, lower cognitive resource arising from stress (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, &amp; Zhao, 2013</xref>), or when maintaining items in working memory, which has limited capacity (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Engle &amp; Kane, 2004</xref>), can negatively impact performance on tasks assessing EF (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mani et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0020">Lower trait cognitive resource is associated with consuming lower quality diets (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, Yates, Duong, &amp; Convit, 2011</xref>), overeating (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Groppe &amp; Elsner, 2015</xref>) and in children is predictive of higher BMI later in childhood (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Reinert, Po'e, &amp; Barkin, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, when cognitive resource is experimentally lowered, for example through a cognitive load task, food choices shift from healthier to less healthy foods (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Shiv &amp; Fedorikhin, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shiv &amp; Nowlis, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman &amp; Shimoga, 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0025">There is preliminary evidence that certain types of dietary interventions, i.e. those that provide information to participants and thus require them to actively reflect on and change behaviour, are more likely to contribute to health disparities between socioeconomic positions (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Beauchamp, Backholer, Magliano, &amp; Peeters, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lorenc, Petticrew, Welch, &amp; Tugwell, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">McGill et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, those that have their effects regardless of cognitive resource have the potential to change behaviour across social groups, thereby avoiding their potential to increase disparities by requiring cognitive resource, which is more limited in those living in poverty (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Raver, Blair, &amp; Willoughby, 2013</xref>). Interventions that alter structural cues in the environment are more likely to operate outside of awareness and therefore not rely, or at least rely less, on cognitive resource (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hollands, Marteau, &amp; Fletcher, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Marteau, Hollands, &amp; Fletcher, 2012</xref>) and thus may have the potential to be effective regardless of cognitive resource.</p>
              <p id="p0030">One such intervention involves altering the distance at which food is positioned. Placing a single less healthy food further away reduces the likelihood that it is consumed (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, Hollands, Couturier, &amp; Marteau, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas, de Ridder, de Vet, &amp; De Wit, 2012</xref>) and how much is consumed (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Musher-Eizenman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Painter, Wansink, &amp; Hieggelke, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wansink, Painter, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). This “proximity effect” does not seem to be moderated by cognitive resource (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, placing a single healthier food closer increases the likelihood that it is consumed (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Musher-Eizenman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Creary, 2013</xref>). In real-world environments, such as cafeterias, people are more likely to select healthier and less healthy foods when they are placed on the front row in a servery compared to middle or back rows (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkard, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rozin et al., 2011</xref>) and to purchase less chocolate when it is placed at a more distant till compared to closer, more convenient tills (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman, Hedderley, Staddon, Pierson, &amp; Symonds, 1994</xref>). Such evidence of the apparent consistency of the proximity effect across a range of foods suggests that a possible intervention capitalising on these effects could increase intake of healthier food by positioning it closer to people and/or reduce intake of less healthy food by positioning it further away.</p>
              <p id="p0035">There is increasing interest in developing and applying such interventions within real-world settings, involving altering aspects of the small-scale physical environment to influence behaviour, including likelihood to consume and amount of food consumed (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bucher et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hollands et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, the current evidence base is limited in a number of important ways making it uncertain whether and how such interventions might be implemented to improve diets at population level. First, most experimental studies of food proximity involve manipulating the distance of a single food (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Musher-Eizenman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Painter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Creary, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wansink et al., 2006</xref>), although any intervention capitalising on these effects would likely be implemented in a food environment in which multiple foods varying in healthiness are available. Only a small number of studies have examined the impact on consumption of experimentally varying the proximity of both healthier and less healthy foods (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kroese, Marchiori, &amp; de Ridder, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkard, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Zuraikat, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rozin et al., 2011</xref>), and these studies have generated inconsistent and incomplete findings. In two studies, moving healthier foods, such as muesli bars and fruits, did not change intake of less healthy foods, such as crisps, chocolate and cakes (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kroese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkhard, 1980</xref>). In a third study, moving candy to a less convenient location, non-significantly increased consumption of fruit (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman et al., 1994</xref>); however, only the distance of the candy was manipulated and thus the study could not determine the effect of moving fruit on candy consumption. In a laboratory study, placing either popcorn or apple slices near to participants increased their consumption regardless of the position of the other food (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Zuraikat, 2014</xref>); however, despite manipulating the distance of both foods, the effect of moving popcorn on consumption of apple slices, and vice versa, was not assessed. In a fifth study, it is unclear whether moving less healthy food affected consumption of healthier foods, and vice versa, since consumption of all foods were assessed together (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rozin et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0040">Based on the proximity effect, we hypothesise that placing a less healthy food further away increases the likelihood that a nearer healthier food is consumed. This primary outcome was chosen because many existing laboratory studies already provide evidence that positioning less healthy food further away reduces its intake, but fewer laboratory studies assess the impact of altering proximity of healthier food.</p>
              <p id="p0045">We designed the current study to provide a robust test of this hypothesis by reducing the risk of bias evident in the existing literature. First, we recruited participants that are representative of general populations and simulated lower cognitive resource by giving participants a cognitive load. Few studies investigate the proximity effect with general population samples including participants with lower cognitive resource. Existing studies assessing the proximity effect often recruit university students or staff (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Painter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Creary, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Zuraikat, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wansink et al., 2006</xref>), being unrepresentative of the general population in having higher cognitive, material and social resources. Only two studies to date purposefully recruited those likely to have lower cognitive resource and directly investigated the role of cognitive resource on the proximity effect (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>). However, these studies only assessed the proximity of a single unhealthy food.</p>
              <p id="p0050">The second way in which we strengthened the design of the current study was by recruiting enough participants to detect predicted effects thereby providing a more reliable and generaliseable estimate of the magnitude of the proximity effect (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bucher et al., 2016b</xref>).

                <title>The intervention</title>
                <p id="p0130"><italic>Foods provided.</italic> The less healthy food was chocolate M&amp;Ms (1000g) and the healthier food was mixed jumbo raisins (a quantity which matched the apparent portion-size of the M&amp;Ms), provided in separate clear glass 1-L bowls. An online study was conducted in which participants rated a selection of healthier and less healthy snacks on their perceived tastiness, appeal and healthiness. Chocolate M&amp;Ms and raisins were chosen as a result of being rated similarly by participants on perceived tastiness and appeal, while differing in perceived healthiness (see supplementary file for a brief report of this online study). A mix of colourful large raisins was used, providing some colour variety in the bowl, as well as a unit size comparable to that of the M&amp;Ms. In a previous study, some participants moved the bowl, thus undermining the intervention (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, the bowls were placed on non-slip mats to increase the effort required to move them and thus decrease the chance of participants moving them.</p>

In groups 1 and 2, the hand wipes were placed to fill the “unused” space to reduce the novelty of the bowl positions because these groups may have greater overall novelty compared to groups 3 and 4. Fixing the bowls in place was not considered appropriate, as this may have aroused suspicion as to the true nature of the study. Therefore, both bowls were placed on non-slip mats to increase the effort to move the bowl and thus reduce the chance that participants alter the bowls positions.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

                  <p id="p0210">Recruitment and testing took place from 30<sup>th</sup> January until 11th April 2017. Participants were recruited and screened by a research agency and those who were eligible to participate (excluding those with food allergies or intolerance) were invited to the experimental session and allocated an appointment by the agency. All participants gave informed consent before completing the screening questionnaire, and again on entry to the experimental session. Participants were tested individually in sessions lasting up to 1 h, running between 12:00 and 19:30. Participants were recruited into a study of “relaxation and memory”, a cover story in which the two foods could be placed on the table unobtrusively. Participants provided baseline measures of cognitive resource and provided demographic data in a questionnaire. Following this, all participants were instructed to view a 7-digit number on the computer screen for 10 s, and asked to keep this number in mind until they were asked to recall the number later in the session. They were then given a ten-minute “relaxation break” during which the foods were positioned on the table at the pre-specified distances accompanied with a selection of magazines and anti-bacterial hand wipes. The participant was verbally informed that they were free to read the magazines and help themselves to the foods before the researcher left the room for ten minutes. After the break, the participant repeated the measures of cognitive resource to give the impression that the break served as a relaxation intervention. Finally, participants completed ratings of hunger and general liking for each food that they had been provided. Participants were fully debriefed and reimbursed at the end of the session. After the participants left the room, the weight of the bowls was assessed and the food was topped-up, if necessary, after each participant.</p>

              <p id="p0365">To our knowledge, the current study provides the most direct and robust evidence to date of how the proximity effect operates and interacts with proximity effects of other foods when both healthier (raisins) and less healthy (M&amp;Ms) foods are available. When both foods were available, placing the M&amp;Ms far, rather than near, did not significantly increase the likelihood that the raisins were consumed. In contrast, the likelihood that the M&amp;Ms were consumed was affected by the position of the raisins, such that the likelihood to consume M&amp;Ms was reduced when both M&amp;Ms and raisins were far, or when M&amp;Ms were far and raisins were near, although not to a statistically significant degree, an effect which requires replication. Regardless of where the other food was placed, likelihood to consume raisins was not significantly related to its position, while likelihood to consume the M&amp;Ms was significantly related to its proximity.</p>
              <p id="p0370">We found no evidence to support the primary hypothesis that positioning a less healthy food further away increases the likelihood to consume healthier food. This is inconsistent with the very limited existing evidence which suggests that placing less healthy food far increases the rate of healthier food selection (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman et al., 1994</xref>). Though the proximity effect observed for the likelihood of healthier food consumption was in the direction consistent with the existing evidence, i.e. participants were more likely to take the healthier food when it was near compared to far (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkard, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Zuraikat, 2014</xref>), this effect was small and statistically non-significant, with the current study not powered to detect an effect of this size. The likelihood of consuming a less healthy food appeared to be affected by the position of the healthier food. Although this effect was statistically non-significant and requires replication, it is inconsistent with the existing evidence from studies using multiple foods where no such effect was observed (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kroese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkard, 1980</xref>). The observed effects were, however, consistent with the broader evidence that people are less likely to consume, and consume less, of a less healthy food when it is further away compared to near (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkard, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Musher-Eizenman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Painter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Creary, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wansink et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0375">There are two possible explanations for why the effect of placing raisins near was small and not statistically significant for increasing the likelihood of consuming the raisins. First, the proximity effect may operate differently in a general population sample compared to the student samples used in previous studies where statistically significant proximity effects were found for healthier food (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Creary, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Zuraikat, 2014</xref>). Second, cognitive load may affect vulnerability to the proximity effect differently for each food, e.g. people under cognitive load were more likely choose the less healthy of two (equidistant) food choices compared to when not under cognitive load (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Shiv &amp; Fedorikhin, 1999</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0380">In terms of the amount of the food consumed, the effect of proximity was inconsistent with existing evidence for both foods i.e. a reverse effect for raisins and no effect for M&amp;Ms. The latter is similar to the lack of effect for the amount of M&amp;Ms consumed in two previous studies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>; see Tables 4.1–4.2b in the supplementary file). There are three possible explanations for the reverse proximity effect for the amount of raisins consumed. First, imbalances in randomisation for unassessed variables could account for some differences in the amount consumed between the proximity conditions. Second, there may have been compensatory effects, i.e. participants may have consumed more raisins when it was far to detract from the urge to consume the M&amp;Ms and to satisfy their craving. Finally, participants may have taken larger handfuls of raisins when the bowl was far due to the greater effort of leaning to obtain it. This suggests that though the proximity effect reduces the likelihood that a food is consumed, it may not consistently affect the amount of the food that is consumed once it is consumed.</p>
              <p id="p0385">A key strength of this study is that it addresses important gaps in the existing literature using a robust study design, extending previous studies manipulating proximity of healthier and less healthy foods (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kroese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Meiselman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Meyers &amp; Stunkard, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Zuraikat, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rozin et al., 2011</xref>) often with designs that limited assessment of effects between the foods or which were at high risk of bias. First, by altering the proximity of both healthier and less healthy food, the study directly investigated whether altering proximity of one food affects likelihood to take the other food. Second, this study provides detailed data e.g. odds ratios, interaction-terms and effect sizes for each food at each distance, which should inform power calculations for future studies and aid in reproducibility. Finally, this study recruited a general population sample, including those of lower education level, who had lower manipulated state-level cognitive resource, a sample more representative of those in greatest need of dietary change at population level compared to existing studies. Giving further strength to this study, the statistically significant proximity effect observed in the M&amp;Ms is consistent with previous similar studies using the same or similar foods (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Privitera &amp; Creary, 2013</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0390">There were also limitations with this study. First, the study lacked statistical power to detect the smaller than expected proximity effect observed for the raisins and to assess moderation of cognitive load. A larger sample size is required in a future study to address this limitation. Therefore, due to the lack of statistical power, the results of the current cognitive resource analysis are considered as provisional. Second, participants were asked about their liking for chocolate rather than specifically chocolate M&amp;Ms and hunger was assessed at the end of the session to limit any awareness of the true nature of the study earlier in the session, and thus these measures may not have adequately captured the liking and hunger levels which may have initially affected food consumption. Additionally, the size of the proximity effect in situations where healthier and less healthy foods differ in likeability is uncertain. Future studies should assess liking for the specific foods provided. Third, the sample population may not be representative of the UK general population due to a higher proportion of post-graduate participants compared to other levels. Staying in education is associated with cognitive resource (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt et al., 2011</xref>); therefore, it is possible that the sample population in this study also had disproportionately higher cognitive resource. Future studies should recruit participants with lower levels of education. Nonetheless, the participants in this study are more representative of the general population in terms of other demographic characteristics, such as age, compared to existing studies assessing the proximity effect, which primarily include students. Finally, this study was conducted under laboratory conditions in which the food-choice task was restrictive, novel and in an artificial setting. Therefore, the observed effects may not be representative of effects in real-world environments in which multiple competing food options are available. Further research should be conducted in real-world settings, such as cafeterias or supermarkets, to assess the generalisability of these outcomes. It is also important that future research investigates whether changes in intake resulting from the proximity effect are sustained in the longer-term (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bucher et al., 2016b</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0395">There is increasing interest in developing and applying interventions which alter aspects of the small-scale physical environment to influence behaviour, including likelihood to consume and amount of food consumed (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bucher et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hollands et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The effects observed in the current study can inform the development of interventions that involve altering distance of both healthier and less healthy foods relative to each other. For example, such an intervention could place less healthy food further away from till-points in shops or further from consumers in buffet arrangements and would be expected to reduce the likelihood it is consumed. It also appears possible – albeit requiring replication – that the likelihood to consume less healthy food could be further minimised by simultaneously altering the proximity of healthier food options e.g. placing them in nearer and more convenient positions.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0400">The likelihood to consume healthier, compared with less healthy, food was not significantly affected by its proximity and that of competing less healthy foods. By contrast, the likelihood to consume less healthy food was influenced by its proximity and showed a non-statistically significant decrease when they were far and raisins were near, and when both M&amp;Ms and raisins were far. These differing effects require replication and further testing.</p>

                <p id="ntpara0010">In two previous studies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>), the issue of zero-inflated data restricted analysis of amount consumed to only those who consumed at least some of the snacks. However, assessing all participants as randomised, including non-consumers, is the most appropriate way of determining the intervention effect on amount consumed and shows an effect of proximity in existing studies (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis (i.e. including non-consumers) has now also been conducted on data from our two previous studies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>) and has been included in the supplementary file for the current study.</p>
