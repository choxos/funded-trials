                <p>Bovine group A rotavirus (RVA) is considered the major cause of diarrhea in intensively reared neonatal calves. Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) are efficient in protecting neonatal calves from RVA diarrhea; however, the value of this intervention in calves once diarrhea has appeared is unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the application of RVA-specific IgY as a passive treatment in those cases. The experimental groups were: G1 = RVA-specific IgY treatment; G2 = no Ab treatment; and G3 = colostrum deprived + no Ab treatment. IgY treatment significantly reduced virus shedding, diarrhea duration and severity compared to G2 and G3 calves. However, it caused a partial suppression of systemic Ab responses to RVA that could be associated with less severe diarrhea. The oral treatment with IgY for 7 days was associated with significantly higher antibody secreting cell responses in the calves compared with other groups of animals.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0005">Numerous epidemiologic studies have shown that group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the most frequent cause of severe gastroenteritis in young children and animals (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Estes and Kapikian, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Martella et al., 2010</xref>). In 1969, electron microcopy was used to detect virus associated with neonatal calf diarrhea (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Mebus et al., 1969</xref>). Multiple etiological agents are responsible for neonatal diarrhea in calves including RVA, coronavirus, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> species, <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and Coccidia (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bellinzoni et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Holland, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bendali et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Svennerholm and Steele, 2004</xref>). Among these agents, bovine RVA is considered the major cause of enteritis and diarrhea in artificially reared calves, causing important economic losses related to death, treatment costs and reduction in weight gain of affected animals (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Martella et al., 2010</xref>). Diarrheal disease severity is enhanced by several factors including herd management, environment and host nutritional and immunological status (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Saif and Smith, 1985</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bendali et al., 1999b</xref>). The disease usually occurs in 2- to 8-week-old calves and the severity decreases as the age increases. The incubation period is very short (12–24 h) and the diarrhea is self-limiting within 5 to 7 days, unless secondary bacterial infections occur (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Svennerholm and Steele, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2009</xref>). Bovine RVA strains are genetically and antigenically heterogeneous. Their genetic classification is based on the genes coding the two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, determining G and P types, respectively. The single most prevalent genotype combination among bovine RVA strains has been G6P[5], although spatiotemporal and herd farm type (cattle or dairy) differences in RVA strain distribution are observed worldwide (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Garaicoechea et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Badaracco et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Papp et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0010">Bovine RVA is ubiquitous and infects the enterocytes of the tip of the villi within the small intestine of neonatal calves. By multifactorial mechanisms, the infection disrupts the efficiency of the absorptive enterocytes and potentially activates the enteric nervous system, inducing a malabsorptive and secretory diarrhea (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bridger, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lundgren and Svensson, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Martella et al., 2010</xref>). The virus replicates quickly, generating high yields of virions and completing the transmission cycle before the host immune mechanisms can intervene (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Estes and Kapikian, 2007</xref>). The affected calves manifest severe diarrhea, dehydration, hyperthermia, anorexia and lethargy (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bellinzoni et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Holland, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bendali et al., 1999b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0015">Good management and hygienic practices can help to reduce the severity of RVA diarrhea in farm animals, while antibiotics can be used to control secondary bacterial infections and fluid and electrolyte therapy can help to restore the fluid reserves, minimizing calf mortality (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Holland, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Svennerholm and Steele, 2004</xref>). Being a gastrointestinal pathogen, the local gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) responses are critical for virus clearance and prevention of RVA reinfection. The RVA-specific passive maternal antibodies (Ab) acquired by colostrum intake (systemically absorbed and re-secreted to the gut) as well as Ab present in maternal milk (acting locally) are key factors in protecting the neonates (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Stott and Fellah, 1983</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Besser et al., 1988</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Saif and Fernandez, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barrandeguy et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2004</xref>). Dams are immunized with RVA-inactivated vaccines in the last third of pregnancy, between 60 to 30 days prior to parturition to enhance maternal Ab levels in serum to promote a higher concentration of IgG1 immunoglobulins in colostrum (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Holland, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Saif and Fernandez, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barrandeguy et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Svennerholm and Steele, 2004</xref>). Although Ab present in colostrum enter the circulation, the protection against this enteric disease is primarily dependent on the presence of RVA-specific Ab in the calves' intestinal lumen, indicating that protection could be achieved by the presence of passive Ab in the gut lumen combined with a rapid active antibody secreting cell (ASC) response in the intestinal lamina propria (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Saif and Fernandez, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 1998</xref>). Regarding passive immune protection, calves receiving pooled colostrum from vaccinated dams prior to gut closure (within 4 h after birth) were protected against severe diarrhea (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2004</xref>). However, RVA-specific Ab from colostrum decline after calving and seem to be insufficient against high challenge doses of virus (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, supplementation of milk diet with immune colostrum significantly reduced diarrhea and delayed viral shedding onset (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2010</xref>). However, the production of immune milks based on colostrum supplementation was not an industrially scalable alternative. This highlights the need of another source of large amounts of Ab for immunotherapeutic purposes in a cost-efficient way.</p>
              <p id="p0020">Recently, chickens have attracted considerable attention as an alternative source of antibodies, as IgY is deposited in the egg yolk in large quantities, making chickens an ideal source for specific polyclonal antibodies (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Touchette et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2004</xref>). There are several reports of chicken egg yolk Ab (IgY) being highly effective in protecting neonatal calves from bovine RVA diarrhea (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Ikemori et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ikemori et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Kuroki et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Kuroki et al., 1997</xref>). Our group has described that prophylactic provision of hyperimmune crude fluid egg yolk to newborn calves during the first 14 consecutive days of life significantly reduced the severity of diarrhea after oral inoculation with virulent bovine RVA. The treatment also prevented RVA diarrhea and virus shedding after a second virus challenge (seven days after the end of the passive Ab treatment). We observed that egg yolk treatment promoted a modulatory effect on ASC responses in the gut, inducing high numbers of bovine RVA-specific IgA ASCs (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>). This 14-day-long prophylactic treatment could be advantageous in dairy herds where bovine RVA is a major epidemiological concern. Still, other oral IgY-based treatments can be useful in dairy farms where RVA-associated diarrhea is a concern but less severe, decreasing the therapy's costs. Little is known about the usefulness of IgY Ab as a treatment to bovine RVA once virus infection has already induced diarrhea under controlled environmental conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential application of spray dried egg yolk powder enriched in bovine RVA-specific IgY Ab as a passive therapeutic treatment to be applied for 7 days after the appearance of diarrhea in neonatal calves experimentally challenged with virulent bovine RVA (G6P[5] strain). The potential of the powder as a commercial product was further evaluated.</p>

                  <p id="p0030">Fifteen newborn male Holstein calves acquired from the same dairy farm were removed from their dams at birth prior to suckling and moved into isolation facilities within the first 4 h of life. The animals were housed in individual isolation rooms under a strict management protocol as previously described (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2004</xref>). Calves were randomly assigned to one of the following feeding groups (G): G1 = colostrum (C) + milk supplemented with bovine RVA-specific egg yolk powder with a final ELISA IgY Ab titer to Indiana RVA strain of 4096 (n = 4); G2 = C + RVA Ab free milk (n = 5) and G3 = colostrum deprived (CD) + RVA Ab free milk (n = 6). These last two groups of calves were considered controls. Colostrum deprived calves are often found in herds where animals are not artificially assisted and many of the newborns fail to fed before the first hours of life. Calves in G1 and G2 received 1 L of colostrum pool from RVA non-vaccinated cows (but seropositive to RVA due to natural exposure to the virus in the field) within the first 6 h of life (prior to gut closure). This colostrum had a virus neutralization (VN) Ab titer to Indiana bovine RVA strain (genotype G6P[5]) of 65,536 and an IgG1 ELISA Ab titer of 16,384 and was produced as previously described (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>). All animals in G1 and G2 had a circulating ELISA mean IgG1 Ab titer to Indiana bovine RVA strain of ~ 1024/4096 in serum after colostrum intake. Calves in G3 did not receive colostrum but 1 L of RVA Ab free milk at this time point, remaining seronegative to bovine RVA, as expected. The milk used in the experiment was commercial sterilized bovine milk for human consumption (Mastellone Hnos., Argentina). All animals were orally inoculated with 10<sup>5.85</sup> Focus Forming Units (FFU) of virulent bovine RVA strain G6P[5] (Indiana strain) between the third and fourth feeding (0 post-inoculation day — PID) (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 1998</xref>). This viral dose was previously confirmed to cause diarrhea and virus shedding in 100% of inoculated CD calves (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2004</xref>). This viral strain is one of the most prevalent RVA strains circulating in newborn calves in Argentina (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Garaicoechea et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Badaracco et al., 2012</xref>) and worldwide (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Midgley et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Papp et al., 2013</xref>). Immediately after the onset of diarrhea, only calves assigned to IgY passive treatment group (G1) received 2 L of the supplemented milk twice a day for 7 days with a final ELISA IgY Ab titer to bovine RVA (Indiana strain) of 4096. After this time, all calves in this group were fed milk without supplemental Abs. Calves in G2 and G3 were fed commercial RVA Ab free milk during the experiment. All the calves were euthanized at PID 21 to study the primary Ab responses to bovine RVA infection.</p>

                <p id="p0105">For this experiment, newborn calves assigned to each experimental group were orally inoculated with virulent bovine RVA (Indiana strain, G6P[5] genotype) at 36 h of life. The onset of diarrhea after virus inoculation was statistically similar for all groups of calves, (G1: 2.0 days; G2: 1.2 days; G3: 2 days). In agreement, bovine RVA infectious viral particles were detected in feces from all animals by the same day that diarrhea appeared. Results for diarrhea and virus shedding are detailed in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
. Following the experimental design, calves assigned to G1 received RVA IgY Ab treatment within 2 h since the development of diarrhea and for seven consecutive days. Diarrhea in this group terminated an average of 3.2 days after the beginning of the passive treatment (range 2 to 5 days). This duration was significantly shorter than the ones registered for CD calves (10.4 days, G3) while animals fed colostrum followed by RVA Ab free milk (G2) developed RVA-associated diarrhea of an intermediate duration (average 7.6 days). Interestingly, virus shedding duration was significantly shorter in calves in G1 (average 4.5 days) than in animals in G2 (average 11.6 days), while calves in G3 showed an intermediate duration of 6 days in average. However, the areas under the curve of virus shedding (AUC) were not significantly different between the experimental groups of calves. Severity of RVA-associated diarrhea, considered as the average AUC of diarrhea score for each group of calves, was also significantly lower in RVA IgY Ab treated calves (G1) than in either of the other groups of animals (G2 and G3). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the number of days with RVA-associated hyperthermia for calves in G1 (2.5 days in average) compared with animals in control groups (G2: 12 days and G3: 11.4 days). It is important to mention that animals receiving passive RVA-specific IgY Ab treatment (G1) did not show other clinical signs of bovine RVA infection like anorexia, dehydration or depression (personal observation, data not shown), while they were evident in all calves in G2 and specially in G3.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Virus shedding, diarrhea duration and coproAbs titers in feces of the experimental groups of calves. Calves in G1 were fed two liters of commercial bovine milk supplemented with 100 g of egg yolk powder containing Indiana RVA strain-specific IgY Abs, twice a day for 7 days from diarrhea onset. Calves in G2 and G3 were fed RVA Ab free milk without any supplementation. Continuous lines represent the average ELISA Ab titer of isotype-specific bovine coproAbs to bovine Indiana RVA strain detected in feces. Dashed line in G1 represents the average ELISA IgY Ab titer to Indiana RVA strain. Columns represent average daily profile of virus shedding for experimental calves expressed as FFU/mL.

The ELISA IgY Ab titers to RVA varied daily and could be associated with the viral replication and shedding, especially because there was an increase in the titers observed once RVA-infection was cleared, around PIDs 9–10.

                <p id="p0115">Passive or active protection against RVA diarrhea is the most desirable outcome of any treatment or vaccination and can be achieved even when continued viral shedding is detected in feces. Moreover, the asymptomatic infection allows development of active immunity to prevent subsequent natural RVA infections. However, we have also previously demonstrated that oral passive treatments based on egg yolk cause a strong positive modulation of the local humoral immune response, and specially the antibody secreting cell responses in the intestinal mucosa (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>), so further characterization of calves immune responses to RVA were conducted.</p>
                <p id="p0120">We studied the local Ab responses to bovine RVA in feces by isotype-specific ELISA. Results obtained are also depicted in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> together with virus shedding and diarrhea duration. For CD calves in G3, bovine RVA-specific IgM and IgA Abs peaked at PIDs 6 and 7, respectively (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in G2 calves (C + RVA Ab free milk), while IgA Ab peaked at PID 8 and IgM Ab showed low titers from PIDs 5 to 11 for G1 animals (C + bovine RVA IgY Ab 4096 milk). It is also evident from <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> that IgG1 Abs to bovine RVA were present around PID 0 in feces from calves receiving colostrum (G1 and G2) while they were absent in G3 calves. However, from PID 8 on, animals in G3 (CD + RVA Ab free milk) showed detectable ELISA titers of Indiana RVA strain specific IgG1 in feces (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), similarly to the pattern described in serum (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
). By the end of the experiment, all the calves presented IgG1 as well as IgA Ab to Indiana RVA strain in feces. Although no other significant differences were observed between coproAb titers to bovine RVA, calves in G1 showed a trend toward lower RVA Ab titers than animals in G2 and G3 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Geometric mean isotype-specific and neutralizing Ab titers (GMTs) to Indiana RVA (G6P[5] strain) in serum collected weekly (lines). a) G1: calves fed with colostrum (C) followed by bovine RVA egg yolk supplemented milk with a final Indiana RVA IgY Ab titer of 4096 for 7 consecutive days once diarrhea appearance; b) G2: calves receiving C followed by non-supplemented RVA Ab free milk; c) G3: colostrum deprived calves receiving RVA Ab free milk.

At PID 0 (previous to experimental virulent bovine RVA inoculation), IgG1 Abs to bovine RVA were present only in animals that received colostrum at birth (G1 and G2), indicating its transference from the gut to the bloodstream. This was associated with the presence of VN activity to bovine RVA at this experimental time point for calves in G1 and G2. The IgG1 Ab titers to Indiana RVA strain remained constant in serum samples from all the animals in G1 and G2 during the experiment. In these groups of calves, after virulent bovine RVA inoculation, it was not possible to discriminate if the detected IgG1 in serum was derived from colostrum intake or if it represented active production of IgG1 by the neonates (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). As expected, while no Abs were detected in serum samples from calves in G3 (CD animals) at PID 0, ELISA Ab titers of IgG1 to bovine RVA increased progressively from PID 7 to PID 21, and they were statistically similar between animals in all experimental groups at PID 14 and until the end of the experiment (PID 21). At PID 21, IgG1 was the main isotype detected in serum, while IgA and IgM were still present in lower titers in all the experimental groups (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="p0135">As expected for a primary immune response against RVA, IgM isotype was detected by ELISA in serum at PID 7 in all calves. At this experimental time point, IgM Ab titers to Indiana RVA strain were significantly higher in G3 than in G1, while G2 showed intermediate responses (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The IgM titers peaked around PID 7 and then decreased, reaching statistically similar titers at PID 14 and 21 between groups. On the other hand, IgA Abs to Indiana RVA strain were also detected from PID 7 on in all experimental groups of calves, with a peak around PID 14. Calves in G2 had statistically lower ELISA IgA Ab titers to bovine RVA at PID 14 than animals in G3, while the titers in G1 were intermediate.</p>
                <p id="p0140">The VN Abs remained constant in G1 throughout the experiment, while in G3 there was a clear increment from the beginning of the experiment to PID 21. At this experimental time point, VN titers were statistically similar between all groups. Interestingly, animals in G2 showed a decrease in IgG1 Ab titers to Indiana RVA strain from PIDs 7 to 14 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

. At PID 21, all the animals had ASC to Indiana RVA strain in the studied tissues. In general, the numbers of ASC in systemic tissues of calves in G1 (C + RVA IgY Ab) were lower than in G2 and G3 groups of calves. In particular, the numbers of bovine RVA-specific IgM and IgG1 ASC responses in the spleens of G1 calves (C + RVA IgY Ab) were significantly less than the ones in the G2 and G3 animals. In MLN from jejunal and ileo-cecal regions, most statistical differences were observed in IgG1 ASC to bovine Indiana RVA strain, where colostrum deprived calves in G3 had higher numbers than animals from G1 and G2. Interestingly, in G2 calves (C + RVA Ab free), the predominant ASC isotype detected at PID 21 was IgM followed by IgA in all the systemic tissues studied. In contrast, in G3 calves (CD + RVA Ab free), most of the bovine RVA-specific ASC responses were mainly of the IgG1 isotype in these same tissues (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Mean numbers of bovine RVA ASC per 5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/MNC obtained from systemic lymphoid tissues (PBL, spleen and MLN draining the small and large Intestine), at 21 PID.

This finding is in agreement with the site of bovine RVA infection and replication in the small intestine and represents the main GALT effector — duodenum and jejunum- and inductive-ileum sites, respectively.

This trend toward higher numbers of bovine RVA ASC was also observed in other tissues, including Jejunum lamina propria and PP.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0170">In the present study we evaluated the use of IgY Abs to bovine RVA as a passive oral therapeutic treatment to control RVA-associated diarrhea in newborn calves. Animals were experimentally inoculated with bovine Indiana RVA strain (genotype G6P[5]), the prevalent RVA strain circulating in the field (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Garaicoechea et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Badaracco et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Midgley et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Papp et al., 2013</xref>). As control groups, colostrum-deprived animals and calves receiving colostrum, but not treated with any RVA-specific passive treatment were included. Although normally newborn calves would receive at least one liter of colostrum from their mothers, many of them fail to stand in the first hours of life and nurse soon enough before gut closure. These calves are frequently found in dairy herds from Argentina and their survival is compromised by the lack of passively transferred maternal immune factors and antibodies (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Tripathi and Vashishtha, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Osaka et al., 2014</xref>). The results obtained demonstrate that daily oral administration of egg yolk powder enriched in IgY Ab to bovine RVA at a final ELISA Ab titer of 4096 (VN titer: 2048, to Indiana RVA strain, genotype G6P[5]) significantly reduced the number of days with diarrhea and hyperthermia as well as the severity of the illness when compared with colostrum deprived calves that did not receive any virus-specific treatment.</p>
              <p id="p0175">Regarding virus shedding, calves treated with IgY Abs to bovine RVA cleared virus infection before the end of the passive treatment and significantly earlier than control animals receiving colostrum but without IgY Ab treatment (G2). Also, heterologous IgY Abs were detected by ELISA in feces, suggesting that they were not completely degraded in the intestinal tract. The resistance of IgY Abs to the calf's gut environment was also previously observed by our group in the administration of fluid crude egg yolk as a passive prophylactic treatment to prevent RVA-associated diarrhea in newborn calves (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0180">Another important novel feature observed in this study is the induction of a stronger RVA-specific ASC response in calves receiving milk supplemented with chicken egg yolk powder than in control animals receiving colostrum (G2) or CD calves (G3) fed RVA Ab free milk. This feature was previously observed in calves fed milk supplemented with crude egg yolk administered as a preventive strategy for a longer period of time (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>). These results together demonstrate that this immunomodulatory activity is local, affecting only GALT ASC responses. In the current experiment, calves were fed egg yolk powder for only 7 days, half of the time compared to previous prophylactic experiments. Yet, the modulatory effect of egg yolk supplementation was clearly maintained. These high numbers of bovine RVA-specific ASC detected in the GALT of egg yolk treated animals represent a powerful active immune strategy to control bovine RVA diarrhea as well as potentially other enteric infections. These results are in agreement with the presence of immunomodulatory molecules in the egg yolk, that promote B cell clonal expansion and IgA switching related to anti-inflammatory responses to dietary antigens (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). It has been previously demonstrated that this immunomodulatory effect of egg yolk is not related to IgY Abs itself, as calves treated with semi-purified IgY Abs for 14 days as well as gnotobiotic pigs fed milk supplemented with semi-purified IgY Abs for 9 days did not develop statistically higher ASC responses in GALT than control groups (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2012</xref>). However, it seems like IgY Ab treatment caused a partial suppression of active systemic Ab responses to bovine RVA. This could be associated with less severe diarrhea in treated calves, as systemic Ab responses to bovine RVA seem to be higher in colostrum deprived calves, while G2 calves showed intermediate responses.</p>
              <p id="p0185">It has been reported that IgY Abs against bovine RVA can be used to prevent virus-associated diarrhea in newborn calves (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>). In this work we focus on the treatment of clinical signs of bovine RVA infection once they appear, as many farmers would use a specific treatment more than a preventive one. We also shortened the passive treatment from 14 to 7 days when compared to previous prophylactic experiments by our group (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Parreño et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vega et al., 2011</xref>). However, even with only 7 days of twice daily continuous treatment, IgY Abs were a strong and versatile immune strategy against bovine RVA-associated diarrhea. Another important feature is the fact that the passive treatment administered to calves in this experiment consisted mainly of egg yolk powder, which can be easily manipulated and kept at room temperature for long periods of time (even until 12–16 months). These properties emphasize the advantages of egg yolk as a source of specific antibodies. Avian Ab represents both a reduction and refinement in animal use (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 2004</xref>). When considering Ab production for passive immunotherapy applications, chickens present a much more economical source of large quantities of specific Ab being also less invasive as it only requires daily collection of eggs (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Schade et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012</xref>). It would be critical to develop an egg yolk powder enriched in IgY Abs directed to several enteropathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea. This will represent a polyvalent product to be used as a preventive as well as a therapeutic strategy to control calf scours in dairy farms. Being an Ab-based therapy consisting of polyclonal heterologous Abs to bovine RVA, this passive oral treatment will help to control neonatal calf diarrhea. Importantly, this approach will help overcome the problem of microbial resistance to antibiotics, which are used indiscriminately to treat calf diarrhea, offering an innovative, ecological and powerful solution to this serious calf health problem in the dairy industry.</p>
