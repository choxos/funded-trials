                <p id="P1">Marijuana (MJ) is widely used among college students, with peak use between ages 18–22. Research suggests memory dysfunction in adolescent and young adult MJ users, but the neural correlates are unclear. We examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response during a memory task among college students with varying degrees of MJ involvement.</p>
                <p id="P2">Participants were 64 college students, ages 18–20, who performed a visual encoding and recognition task during fMRI. MJ use was ascertained for 3 months prior to scanning; 27 individuals reported past 3-month MJ use, and 33 individuals did not. fMRI response was modeled during encoding based on whether targets were subsequently recognized (correct encoding), and during recognition based on target identification (hits). fMRI response in left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and hippocampal regions of interest was examined between MJ users and controls.</p>
                <p id="P3">There were no group differences between MJ users and controls on fMRI response during encoding, although single sample t-tests revealed that MJ users failed to activate the hippocampus. During recognition, MJ users showed less fMRI response than controls in right hippocampus (Cohen’s d=0.55), left hippocampus (Cohen’s d=0.67) and left IFG (Cohen’s d=0.61). Heavier MJ involvement was associated with lower fMRI response in left hippocampus and left IFG.</p>
                <p id="P4">This study provides evidence of MJ -related prefrontal and hippocampal dysfunction during recognition memory in college students. These findings may contribute to our previously identified decrements in academic performance in college MJ users and could have substantial implications for academic and occupational functioning.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Marijuana (MJ) is one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances among emerging adults ages 18–22, and this age group shows the highest rates of use and dependence (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">SAMHSA, 2016</xref>). National surveys indicate that MJ use in emerging adults has been increasing over the past 30 years, and most recently, 22% reported use in the past month (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Shulenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the average period of peak MJ use also encompasses the final stages of neuromaturation (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gogtay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lenroot and Giedd, 2006</xref>) and typically coincides with the completion of formal education and the transition into adult roles. MJ use in adolescence and young adulthood has been linked to decrements in subsequent academic, occupational, and social function (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Fergusson and Boden, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Macleod et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Meda et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P6">Specific neural systems are involved in declarative encoding and retrieval, including prefrontal, posterior parietal, and medial temporal/hippocampal regions (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2011b</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The hippocampus and frontal lobes contain high densities of cannabinoid receptors (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Herkenham et al., 1990</xref>), the primary targets for the psychoactive constituents of MJ, and may be especially vulnerable to effects of MJ use and related memory impairments (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Solowij and Battisti, 2008</xref>). These regions also continue maturing throughout adolescence and emerging adulthood (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gogtay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lenroot and Giedd, 2006</xref>), and may be at risk for perturbations from intoxicants such as MJ during development.</p>
              <p id="P7">Memory deficits are one of the most consistently observed neurocognitive abnormalities among adolescent and emerging adult MJ users (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Jacobus and Tapert, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Lisdahl et al., 2013</xref>), although some research suggests that these effects may be limited to those with recent use (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hooper et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have characterized neural activation among adolescent MJ users during long-term encoding, but the results have been somewhat inconsistent (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Silveri et al., 2016</xref>). One study examined verbal associative learning following 22 days of confirmed MJ abstinence among adolescent users of alcohol, MJ, or both substances, compared to non-using controls. Despite similar task performance between groups, adolescent MJ users showed bilateral prefrontal hyperactivation, while users of both alcohol and MJ showed fMRI response levels intermediate between MJ users and controls (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schweinsburg et al., 2011</xref>). Within the hippocampus, users of MJ alone failed to show significant task-related activation, although users of both alcohol and MJ activated similarly as controls. Among young adults, high frequency of MJ use was associated with greater parahippocampal response during face/profession associative learning (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Becker et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, others have found no response differences in adolescent male MJ users during a pictorial associative learning task (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Jager et al., 2010</xref>). Further work is needed in order to clarify the neural sequelae of memory dysfunction in marijuana using young people.</p>
              <p id="P8">In the current study, we examined the neural correlates of visual encoding and recognition associated with recent MJ use in college students using BOLD fMRI. Participants performed an established figural memory task that ascertains BOLD response during nonverbal visual encoding and subsequent recognition (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beason-Held et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Dager et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jamadar et al., 2013</xref>). We focused our analyses on bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and hippocampus, as these regions have been most consistently implicated in fMRI memory paradigms in work by our group and others (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Blumenfeld and Ranganath, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jamadar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2011a</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Based on previous work examining fMRI response during verbal encoding (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Schweinsburg et al., 2010</xref>), we predicted that MJ use would be associated with increased response in bilateral IFG, and decreased response in bilateral hippocampus.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="P9">Participants were 60 18–20-year-olds who were recruited as part of a larger study of alcohol and neurocognitive function of first-year college students, the NIAAA-funded Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students (BARCS) study, described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Dager et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Dager et al., 2014b</xref>). The parent BARCS study recruited a pool of approximately 2000 participants by emailing all incoming first-year students in two consecutive years and distributing flyers on campus at two local colleges, resulting in a recruitment rate &gt;95%. From the BARCS study, individuals without MRI contraindications were invited to participate in neuroimaging, using rolling recruitment from BARCS throughout the academic year. Scanning participants were randomly assigned to complete either the figural memory task or a spatial memory task during scanning. Upon enrollment in the BARCS study, participants began completing monthly online substance use surveys (see below); however, not all imaging participants initiated monthly surveys before undergoing imaging (e.g., if imaging was scheduled very soon after enrollment). Thus, the current sample includes a subset of individuals who received the figural memory task and who answered substance use surveys in the 3 months prior to scanning. Participants provided written informed consent, approved by the institutional review boards at Yale University, Hartford Hospital, Trinity College and Central Connecticut State University. Exclusion criteria were history of seizures, head injury with loss of consciousness &gt;10 minutes, figural memory task performance that was invalid (e.g., all false alarms and no correct rejections) or unavailable, excessive motion during scanning, and MRI contraindications.</p>

                <title>Measures</title>
                <p id="P10">Current use of alcohol, MJ, and other drugs was characterized through secure monthly online self-report surveys as part of the BARCS study (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Dager et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Meda et al., 2017</xref>). For each monthly survey, participants reported the number of days on which alcohol was consumed, number of drinks per occasion, and number of days of binge alcohol use (≥4 drinks/occasion for females, ≥5 drinks/occasion for males). Peak drinks per month was based on the month with the highest reported drinking, and calculated by multiplying the number of days of alcohol use by the number of drinks per occasion. Participants reported their monthly MJ use in a scaled manner, ranging from 1–6, as follows: 1 = never used in the past 30 days, 2 = used 1–2 times, 3 = used 3–5 times, 4 = used 6–9 times, 5 = used 10–19 times, and 6 = used ≥20 times in the past month. In order to capture sporadic recent use as well as more consistent heavy use, groups in the current study were characterized based on MJ use in the 3 months prior to scanning: 33 individuals did not report MJ use, and 27 individuals reported past 3-month MJ use (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants also reported monthly use of other substances, as well as cigarette use on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Heatherton et al., 1991</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P12">The Figural Memory Task (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beason-Held et al., 2005</xref>) is a visual encoding and recognition task designed to minimize verbal encoding of stimuli. The task stimuli (20 targets and 20 distractors) were abstract black line drawings that are designed to be difficult to encode verbally, presented against a white background. Participants performed an encoding phase and a recognition phase during fMRI scanning. The encoding phase presented 20 target stimuli (duration 3 sec, interstimulus (ISI) interval 4 sec), which participants were instructed to silently memorize. For each stimulus, participants pressed a button on a fiber optic response box to confirm that they saw each item. After the encoding phase, there was a 5-minute delay (with no other cognitive task presented during the delay), followed by the recognition phase. During the recognition phase, 20 target and 20 distractor stimuli were presented in a fixed pseudo-random order, each for 3 sec with an ISI of 4 sec. Participants pressed a button with their right index (“yes”) and middle (“no”) fingers to indicate whether they had previously seen each stimulus, and accuracy was emphasized over speed.</p>

                <p id="P14">Stimuli from the recognition phase were classified as hits, misses, correct rejections, and false alarms. We used a signal detection approach (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Macmillan and Creelman, 2005</xref>) to examine the discriminability index, d’, which represents the ability to discriminate targets from distractors. We calculated d’ = <italic>z</italic>(hit rate) – <italic>z</italic>(false alarm rate), with a standard correction for false alarm rates of zero. Responses during the recognition phase were compared between groups using repeated measures ANOVA with two within-subjects factors (target vs. distractor and response “yes” vs. “no”) and one between-groups factor (group). We used independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests to determine group differences in d’.</p>
                <p id="P15">Functional images from the task were preprocessed and modeled similarly as in our prior work (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Dager et al., 2014b</xref>) using SPM5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/</ext-link>). The first six volumes were discarded to allow for T1 saturation effects. Images were realigned, spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standardized space, resampled to 3×3×3 mm voxels, and smoothed with a 5mm full-width, half-maximum Gaussian filter. Datasets were inspected for motion, and those with &gt;3mm displacement or &gt;3 degrees rotation were not included in the current study.</p>
                <p id="P16">BOLD response was modeled based on behavioral performance (items that were subsequent hits and misses), while covarying for the degree of motion and linear baseline trends. Trials from the encoding phase were modeled as correctly encoded if they were subsequently identified as targets during the recognition phase. Targets that were subsequently designated as distractors in the recognition phase were categorized as incorrectly encoded. Events in the recognition phase were coded as hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections. BOLD response for each event was modeled using a canonical hemodynamic response function fitted to the onset of the event. The duration of each event was determined by reaction time. BOLD response contrast was determined for correctly encoded vs. incorrectly encoded, hits vs. implicit baseline, misses vs. implicit baseline, and correct rejections vs. implicit baseline. Although false alarm events were modeled at the individual level, we did not examine group differences in BOLD response to false alarms because there were too few to model at the group level (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jamadar et al. 2013</xref>).</p>

The IFG ROI was created by combining frontal opercular, orbital, and triangular gyri, and the hippocampal ROI was defined based solely on the hippocampus. Left and right hemisphere regions were defined separately, for a total of four ROIs. For each ROI, data for each subject were extracted for correct encoding and for recognition hits, and analyzed in SPSS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics">https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics</ext-link>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P24">In this study, we examined the relationship between marijuana use and fMRI response during a visual encoding and recognition task in emerging adult college students. Although no group differences were observed during encoding, MJ users demonstrated less response than non-using controls in bilateral hippocampi and left IFG during recognition, and more MJ involvement was associated with lower fMRI response.</p>
              <p id="P25">Among controls, we observed significant activation in right and left hippocampus during encoding, as well as activation in both left and right IFG during encoding and during recognition. Together, these findings parallel our previous work with this task (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jamadar et al., 2013</xref>) and corroborate the utility of this paradigm in activating these brain regions. Although there were no group differences during the encoding phase of the task, exploratory analyses determined that MJ users showed no significant hippocampal BOLD response during encoding, whereas controls did exhibit significant hippocampal activation. Thus, a group difference might be revealed with larger sample sizes. This is consistent with previous work demonstrating lack of significant hippocampal response during a verbal associative learning task in adolescent MJ users (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schweinsburg et al., 2011</xref>). Given that prefrontal-medial temporal relationships are considered a crucial to successful encoding (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2011b</xref>), it is possible that inadequate engagement of these regions by MJ users contributes to poorer encoding.</p>
              <p id="P26">Importantly, group differences were observed during recognition in bilateral hippocampi and left IFG, and more MJ use was associated with larger deviations in BOLD response. These disparate activation patterns could provide insight into the specific aspects of memory function that are impacted in MJ users. For instance, in previous work examining verbal learning, adolescent MJ users showed intact learning, but poorer delayed recall and more false alarms (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Winward et al., 2014</xref>). The current results point toward neural mechanisms underlying these cognitive findings. During long-term memory retrieval, the IFG is thought to play a role in selecting goal-relevant information, particularly for single item recognition tasks (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Scalici et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, less IFG response during recognition in MJ users could point to poorer engagement while selecting responses. In addition, MJ users showed altered hippocampal response during recognition. Similarly, in an fMRI study spatial learning, adult MJ users did not show differences in medial temporal fMRI response compared to non-users during learning, but showed reduced fMRI response during retrieval (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Sneider et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings also parallel those of other imaging modalities. For instance, MJ use in adolescents and emerging adults was related to resting state fronto-temporal connectivity (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Houck et al., 2013</xref>) and poorer hippocampal white matter integrity (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Yucel et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these studies point to abnormal frontal-hippocampal circuitry associated with MJ use in young people.</p>
              <p id="P27">There is evidence from rodent models indicating that exposure to cannabinoids interferes with prefrontal and hippocampal plasticity, as well as memory performance, to a greater degree in adolescents compared to adults. For instance, administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of MJ, led to greater abnormalities in hippocampal protein expression and memory performance in adolescents compared to adults (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Quinn et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, adolescent THC exposure was associated with poorer spatial memory and altered hippocampal glutamate receptor expression (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Zamberletti et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, poorer spatial memory performance was related to decreased hippocampal neurogenesis following synthetic cannabinoid exposure in adolescents, but not in adults (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abboussi et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, adolescent THC treatment led to impaired endocannabinoid signaling and altered maturation of glutamate receptors in prefrontal cortex, as well as poorer spatial memory (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rubino et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, developing adolescent prefrontal-hippocampal circuits appear to be particularly susceptible to MJ-related neuronal damage. It is possible that similar mechanisms underlie memory dysfunction in human adolescents and emerging adults, contributing to the observed results in the current study. Future studies with additional techniques should attempt to identify neurochemical abnormalities underlying these differences in fMRI response.</p>
              <p id="P28">Interestingly, our exploratory analyses indicated that group differences may be specific to males, though this finding should be interpreted with caution given the relatively small sample size. In contrast to our observations, there have been some studies suggesting that females show greater effects from adolescent MJ exposure. Preclinical evidence indicates that adolescent THC treatment has a larger impact on the cannabinoid system in emotional and memory circuitry in females compared to males (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Rubino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2015</xref>). The few extant human studies seem to corroborate the preclinical literature. For example, in young adults, MJ use was associated with greater decrements in episodic memory function in females than in males (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Crane et al., 2013</xref>). Female adolescent MJ users exhibited larger amygdala volumes compared to female nonusers, but no difference was observed in males (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Padula et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, female adolescent MJ users showed larger prefrontal volumes than female controls, whereas male users showed smaller prefrontal volumes than male controls (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Medina et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that the discrepant findings between our study and others are related, in part, to interactions between MJ and varying hormone levels in females. For instance, estrogen regulates hippocampal function and enhances memory, and females show changes in memory abilities as levels fluctuate (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Frick, 2015</xref>). In rats, THC-induced impairments in nonspatial learning and memory were mitigated by estradiol treatment (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Daniel et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, ovarian hormone levels influence behavioral effects of MJ as well as cannabinoid receptor distribution (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Brents, 2016</xref>). Together, interactive effects between hormones and MJ may contribute to sex differences in the impact of MJ use on memory. This clearly presents an important avenue for future research.</p>
              <p id="P29">The current study provides unique insight into the neural mechanisms of memory function in emerging adult MJ users using an established fMRI paradigm. However, there are limitations to this work that should be considered. We only ascertained MJ use in the 3 months prior to scanning, and did not collect information on lifetime use patterns. Our findings are consistent with previous literature indicating memory dysfunction associated with recent heavy MJ use in both adults (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2003</xref>) and adolescents (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Lisdahl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Schweinsburg et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is unclear how our results might be influenced by lifetime patterns of use, which were not assessed. Future studies should characterize the impact of varying patterns of lifetime use, as well as whether these effects would differ with more distal use. In addition, MJ use in the current study was relatively light overall, with most participants only using 5 times per month or less. Thus, our results expand upon existing work by demonstrating observable effects even in low level MJ users. In addition, it is unknown whether the observed fMRI differences might pre-date MJ use. For instance, there are likely pre-existing prefrontal abnormalities in adolescent drinkers that confer risk for developing substance use disorders (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Silveri et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, young adults in remission from adolescent cannabis use disorder show altered prefrontal response during a risk-taking task, which could reflect pre-existing vulnerability to MJ use (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">De Bellis et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, although MJ users in the current study consumed more alcohol than controls in the 3 months before scanning, number of drinks per month was unrelated to hippocampal response in this sample, suggesting that recent alcohol use did not account for the observed effect in MJ users. However, it is unclear whether other unmeasured characteristics, such as lifetime substance use history, age of first MJ use, or personality may have influenced group differences. These relationships should be clarified by carrying out additional work with larger samples, examining varying patterns of lifetime MJ use, and implementing additional imaging techniques.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="P30">In sum, we identified reduced inferior frontal and hippocampal fMRI response during nonverbal recognition memory among emerging adult MJ users. MJ users failed to show significant hippocampal activation during encoding, but did not significantly differ from controls. Together, these findings suggest poorer engagement of prefrontal-hippocampal circuits during recognition, particularly in relation to response selection. Importantly, these results could contribute to our previously-observed declines in academic performance in college MJ users (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Meda et al., 2017</xref>), and may have implications for future academic and occupational success.</p>
