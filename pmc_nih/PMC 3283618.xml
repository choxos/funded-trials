                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Traditionally, vaccine development against the blood-stage of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection has focused on recombinant protein-adjuvant formulations in order to induce high-titer growth-inhibitory antibody responses. However, to date no such vaccine encoding a blood-stage antigen(s) alone has induced significant protective efficacy against erythrocytic-stage infection in a pre-specified primary endpoint of a Phase IIa/b clinical trial designed to assess vaccine efficacy. Cell-mediated responses, acting in conjunction with functional antibodies, may be necessary for immunity against blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The development of a vaccine that could induce both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses would enable important proof-of-concept efficacy studies to be undertaken to address this question.</p>

                  <title>Methodology</title>
                  <p>We conducted a Phase Ia, non-randomized clinical trial in 16 healthy, malaria-naïve adults of the chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) replication-deficient viral vectored vaccines encoding two alleles (3D7 and FVO) of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood-stage malaria antigen; apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). ChAd63-MVA AMA1 administered in a heterologous prime-boost regime was shown to be safe and immunogenic, inducing high-level T cell responses to both alleles 3D7 (median 2036 SFU/million PBMC) and FVO (median 1539 SFU/million PBMC), with a mixed CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> phenotype, as well as substantial AMA1-specific serum IgG responses (medians of 49 µg/mL and 41 µg/mL for 3D7 and FVO AMA1 respectively) that demonstrated growth inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>ChAd63-MVA is a safe and highly immunogenic delivery platform for both alleles of the AMA1 antigen in humans which warrants further efficacy testing. ChAd63-MVA is a promising heterologous prime-boost vaccine strategy that could be applied to numerous other diseases where strong cellular and humoral immune responses are required for protection.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>An effective vaccine against the blood-stage of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection could significantly contribute to any future strategy for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, limiting transmission and aiding disease eradication <xref rid="pone.0031208-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although anti-disease and anti-parasitic immunity is naturally acquired against blood-stage infection following repeated exposure <xref rid="pone.0031208-Langhorne1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, replicating such immunity by vaccination has proved extremely difficult <xref rid="pone.0031208-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There have been recent reports of efficacy observed in retrospective/post-hoc analyses from Phase Ib safety and immunogenicity trials of a blood-stage vaccine <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sirima1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> or one with a blood-stage component <xref rid="pone.0031208-Cech1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. More encouragingly, significant strain-specific efficacy was also recently reported in a pre-specified secondary analysis of a Phase IIb trial of a mono-valent 3D7 strain apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) protein vaccine <xref rid="pone.0031208-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Of note, this vaccine also showed an encouraging signal in a prior Phase IIa controlled human malaria infection study <xref rid="pone.0031208-Spring1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, despite these extensive efforts to date, no candidate blood-stage vaccine has been developed that has demonstrated statistically significant efficacy with regard to clinical outcome in a pre-specified primary endpoint analysis in a Phase IIa/b clinical trial designed to assess vaccine efficacy <xref rid="pone.0031208-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The majority of such blood-stage vaccine candidates have traditionally focused on recombinant protein-in-adjuvant formulations with the aim of inducing growth inhibitory antibody responses against merozoite antigens involved in the erythrocyte invasion process <xref rid="pone.0031208-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, increasing evidence suggests that T cells can also play an important contributory role in the mediation of immunity against blood-stage antigens <xref rid="pone.0031208-Good1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Good2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The mechanisms by which T cells could contribute to protective outcome <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans remain less well defined, particularly given the lack of MHC molecules necessary for antigen presentation on red blood cells (RBCs). One suggestion is that macrophages in the spleen, activated by cytokines from T helper 1 (Th1)-type CD4<sup>+</sup> cells specific for blood-stage antigens, may enhance phagocytic clearance of infected RBCs <xref rid="pone.0031208-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Yoneto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Another proposal is that CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells may bias the induction of cytophilic antibody subclasses from B cells that can in turn mediate anti-parasitic neutrophil respiratory burst activity (ADRB) <xref rid="pone.0031208-Joos1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> or antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) <xref rid="pone.0031208-BouharounTayoun1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> via monocytes. Alternatively, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against blood-stage antigens could target late liver-stage parasite forms which also express classical ‘blood-stage’ antigens <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Kawabata1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Belnoue1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. An effective blood-stage vaccine may therefore be required to induce strong cellular immunity that can act in concert with anti-parasite antibodies.</p>
              <p>Recently, viral vectored vaccines encoding blood-stage antigens have been developed which can induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models <xref rid="pone.0031208-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Heterologous prime-boost immunization with human or simian adenovirus followed by the orthopoxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the blood-stage antigen AMA1 is highly immunogenic for both antibodies and T cells in mice, rabbits <xref rid="pone.0031208-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and rhesus macaques <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although a long-standing subunit vaccine candidate antigen that is susceptible to strain-specific antibodies <xref rid="pone.0031208-Remarque1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, AMA1 exhibits extreme polymorphism <xref rid="pone.0031208-Takala1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> which has proved a significant obstacle in the development of a broadly neutralizing antibody-inducing vaccine for use in endemic populations <xref rid="pone.0031208-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the study reported here, the simian adenovirus and MVA vectors were designed to express an optimized transgene encoding two divergent alleles (3D7 and FVO) of AMA1 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These vectors, when used in heterologous prime-boost regimes in animal models, induced antibodies that mediate <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibition against both 3D7 and FVO strain <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites <xref rid="pone.0031208-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Moreover, similar vaccines, encoding the orthologous gene, can confer blood-stage efficacy in the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> rodent malaria model, which is dependent on vaccine-induced antibodies as well as AMA1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Biswas <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted). T cell epitopes within AMA1 that elicit proliferative T cell responses have also been described in naturally-exposed individuals from Kenya <xref rid="pone.0031208-Lal1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Udhayakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A recent Phase Ia study of a candidate human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) vaccine expressing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA1 (3D7 strain allele) <xref rid="pone.0031208-Bruder1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> was also shown to be immunogenic for AMA1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in malaria-naïve adults <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sedegah1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sedegah2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, concerns regarding pre-existing anti-vector immunity to human adenoviral serotypes <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Barouch1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and the inclusion of just one allele (3D7) in this vaccine formulation is likely to limit the widespread utility of this specific vaccine.</p>
              <p>The replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) has been shown to be a safe, versatile and exceptionally immunogenic vector when administered in a heterologous prime-boost regimen with the attenuated orthopoxvirus MVA in two Phase Ia clinical trials in healthy malaria-naïve adults in the UK; one using vectors encoding the liver-stage antigen thrombospondin related adhesion protein fused to a multi-epitope string (ME-TRAP) (O'Hara <italic>et al.</italic>, J Infect Dis 2011 in press), and the other using the same vectors encoding the blood-stage antigen merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Here we present the safety and immunogenicity results of the third ChAd63 vector to be trialled alone and in a prime-boost regimen with MVA. This Phase Ia trial utilized the ChAd63 and MVA vectors expressing an optimized bi-valent AMA1 insert designed to address antigen polymorphism, administered in a heterologous prime boost regimen to healthy malaria-naïve adults.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>The study was conducted at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and the University College London Clinical Research Facility, London, UK. Healthy, malaria-naïve males and non-pregnant females aged 18–50 were invited to participate in the study. There was no selection of volunteers on the basis of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to the ChAd63 vector prior to enrolment, however NAb titers were subsequently assayed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s012">Supplementary Information S1</xref> for the full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria).</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>This was a Phase Ia open-label, non-randomized blood-stage malaria vaccine trial. The clinical trial protocol and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as Supplementary Information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s011">Protocol S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s012">Supplementary Information S1</xref>. Allocation to study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g001">Figure 1</xref>) occurred at screening based on volunteer preference, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Eight volunteers were vaccinated with 5×10<sup>9</sup> viral particles (vp) ChAd63 AMA1 (diluted in 0.9% NaCl and administered in 300 µL) (groups 1A &amp; 1B). Four of these volunteers were subsequently vaccinated in the opposite arm 56 days later with 5×10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (pfu) MVA AMA1 undiluted and administered in 200 µL (group 1B). Another eight volunteers were vaccinated with 5×10<sup>10</sup> vp ChAd63 AMA1 undiluted and administered in 300 µL (group 2A &amp; 2B) and four of these were subsequently vaccinated 56 days later in the opposite arm with either 2.5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA AMA1 undiluted and administered in 100 µL (Group 2B(i), <italic>n</italic> = 1) or 1.25×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA AMA1 undiluted and administered in 50 µL (Group 2B(ii), <italic>n</italic> = 3). Note the dose of MVA AMA1 was reduced following greater than expected reactogenicity when using 5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu in Group 1B. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid.</p>

                <p>Volunteers attended clinical follow-up at days 2, 14, 28, 56 and 90 following ChAd63 AMA1 immunization in groups 1A and 2A and at days 2, 14, 28, 56, 58, 63, 84 and 140 following ChAd63-MVA AMA1 immunization in groups 1B and 2B. Safety assessments, including blood sampling for safety and immunology analysis at these visits were conducted as previously described <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A time window ranging between 1 and 14 days was allowed for vaccination and follow-up visits. Throughout the paper, study day refers to the nominal time point for a group and not the actual day of sampling.</p>
                <p>The first volunteer to receive each dose of ChAd63 AMA1 was vaccinated in isolation. Following a review of reactogenicity in these individuals 48 hours post vaccination, the remaining volunteers in each group were enrolled. There was a 2 week interval prior to dose escalation of ChAd63 AMA1, during which time a scheduled review of safety data was conducted by the independent Local Safety Committee.</p>

They were manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions by the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility, University of Oxford (ChAd63 AMA1) and IDT Biologika, Rosslau, Germany (MVA AMA1). Briefly, ChAd63 AMA1 was generated in suspension HEK293 cells and purified by caesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation. MVA AMA1 was generated in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) and purified by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. Each vaccine lot underwent comprehensive quality control analysis to ensure that the purity, identity and integrity of the virus met pre-defined specifications. Vaccine lots were stored at the clinical site at −80°C and the temperature was monitored. ChAd63 AMA1 vaccine stability was monitored by using an infectivity assay in HEK293 cells. The immuno-potency of the MVA AMA1 vaccine was confirmed by regular immunogenicity evaluation in mice.</p>
                <p>To address the issue of AMA1 polymorphism, the transgene insert was designed as a bi-valent composite sequence from the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood-stage antigen AMA1 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Briefly, the sequence of the AMA1 insert contains from N- to C- terminus: the leader sequence from human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) followed in-frame by the sequences encoding the ectodomain (amino acids 25–546) of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (strain 3D7) AMA1 followed by the ectodomain plus C-terminal transmembrane region (amino acids 25–574) of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (strain FVO) AMA1.

ChAd63 AMA1 demonstrated a good safety profile with the majority of AEs mild in severity (89%), all resolving completely, most (63%) within 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, 12 out of 16 volunteers (75%) experienced one or more local AEs related to ChAd63 AMA1; these were mild with the exception of three cases of arm pain (two moderate and one severe), one case of moderate swelling and one case of moderate erythema, all occurring in the higher dose group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). 10 out of 16 volunteers (63%) also experienced at least one or more systemic AEs related to vaccination. These were all mild with the exception of two cases of severe malaise and one case of severe headache experienced by two volunteers in the higher dose group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). MVA AMA1 administered intramuscularly at the relatively high poxviral dose of 5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu to the first four boosted volunteers (group 1B), was markedly more reactogenic than ChAd63 AMA1, with 3 out of 4 vaccinees (75%) experiencing a constellation of severe ‘flu-like’ systemic AEs (including malaise, myalgia, rigor, fatigue and feverishness) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). One of these volunteers described disorientation and ‘visual hallucinations’ whilst experiencing feverishness and a recorded fever of 37.8°C (AE defined as ‘delirium’). 92% of severe symptoms resolved completely within 48 hours of onset (one case of severe arthralgia took 72 hours to resolve). MVA expressing other malaria or HIV antigens has been used previously at doses equal to and higher than 5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu without safety concern <xref rid="pone.0031208-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Keefer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and such a dose was used because antibody induction in pre-clinical models has been shown to be dose dependent <xref rid="pone.0031208-Douglas1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Goodman2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Administration of MVA AMA1 at day 56 significantly boosted these responses in all volunteers as measured one week later on day 63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Due to the differences in dosage of MVA at this time point it is difficult to directly compare groups, however the volunteers in group 1B who all received 5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA AMA1 demonstrated a higher median response than those receiving the lower doses of MVA AMA1 (7186 [range 4372–10832] vs 2631 [range 2102–4500] SFU/million PBMCs). This was primarily due to two very strong responders in group 1B with peak post-boost responses in the region of 10,000 SFU/million PBMC. Analysis of the breakdown of the day 63 ELISPOT data showed that T cells were induced to both alleles equally; 3D7 (median 4959 [group 1B], 2036 [group 2B] SFU/million PBMC) and FVO (median 4359 [group 1B], 1539 [group 2B] SFU/million PBMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

                <p>T cell responses in all volunteers were detected in multiple peptide pools spanning the entire AMA1 vaccine insert in the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Individual responses are shown according to magnitude of the response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s003">Figure S2</xref>) or as a percentage of the total summed ELISPOT response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s004">Figure S3</xref>). Irrespective of whether the responses are analyzed after the priming immunization with ChAd63 AMA1 or following the MVA AMA1 boosting immunization, the individual and median responses broadly mirror the composition of the vaccine antigen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s003">Figure S2A</xref>). These data indicate that no single immuno-dominant region exists within the AMA1 transgene insert and importantly that responses were induced to epitopes contained within peptides whose sequence is common to both alleles. T cell responses were also measured to the tPA leader sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s005">Figure S4A</xref>), and this showed the absence of any response induction against this mammalian sequence. A total of 19 amino acid substitutions were also included in the AMA1 transgene to remove sites of potential N-linked glycosylation. A pool of 21 previously described peptides (15mers overlapping by 10aa, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s017">Table S5</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> was used that corresponds only to those peptides that vary between the native and vaccine AMA1 coding sequence. These peptides represent 21 out of 170 peptides (15mers) that are required to cover the whole AMA1 transgene insert, i.e. 12%. These two single pools were used here to measure responses following human vaccination. Responses to peptide pools for the vaccine versus native sequences of AMA1 showed a significantly stronger response to the vaccine pool for both day 14 (<italic>n</italic> = 16, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007) and day 63 (<italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) as assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s005">Figure S4B</xref>).</p>

                <p>Antigen-specific CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell functionality was also assayed by ICS at the day 84 time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Following peptide re-stimulation, detectable AMA1-specific CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells consisted of a mixed CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> phenotype. It should be noted that the ELISPOT and ICS assays vary in methodology (including the use of multiple versus a single peptide pool respectively, as well as differences in peptide concentration, use of co-stimulatory antibodies and use of fresh versus frozen PBMC). Nevertheless, in agreement with the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IFN-γ ELIspot data for this time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>), reasonably comparable responses were seen in groups 1B and 2B for both T cell subsets. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upregulated CD107a expression (marker of degranulation), and produced IFN-γ and TNFα but only negligible levels of IL-2. In comparison the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produced high levels of TNFα, lower levels of IFN-γ and IL-2, but did not upregulate CD107a expression. However, following re-stimulation with cryopreserved red blood cells infected with schizont/late trophozoite stage 3D7 strain <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites (iRBCs), negligible (&lt;0.05%) CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were evident above background uRBC re-stimulation. This is in contrast to results seen following ChAd63-MVA MSP1 immunization <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, whereby iRBC re-stimulation of PBMC resulted in comparable detection of CD4<sup>+</sup> (but not CD8<sup>+</sup>) MSP1-specific T cell responses to those seen following peptide re-stimulation. This result may reflect the lower levels of AMA1 antigen present in iRBC preparations that is available for presentation to T cells (in comparison to the more abundant merozoite surface protein), or may in part be due to the aforementioned amino acid substitutions affecting T cell recognition of native parasite AMA1 antigen. Distinct populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing 1+, 2+, 3+ or 4+ functional markers/cytokines were evident following a Boolean gate analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s006">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

                <p>The kinetics and magnitude of the serum IgG antibody response against the 3D7 allele of AMA1 were assessed over time by ELISA. AMA1-specific IgG was induced in all volunteers, with individual responses shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031208.s008">Figure S7</xref> and geometric mean (geomean) responses for each group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031208-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>. Following the ChAd63 AMA1 prime, there were significantly stronger responses in the higher dose group 2 in comparison to group 1 at the peak of the response on day 28 (geomean titer 109 [range 48–196] vs 37 [range 18–192] AMA1 antibody units (AU) in groups 2 versus 1 respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 8 vs 8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test). Responses declined slowly but were maintained above the detection limit at day 90 in groups 1A and 2A. Administration of MVA AMA1 at day 56 significantly boosted these responses in all volunteers bar one (in group 2B(ii)), with serum IgG responses peaking four weeks later as measured on day 84. At this time-point, there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.68 by Mann-Whitney test) in the average AMA1-specific IgG responses in group 2B (5×10<sup>10</sup> vp ChAd63 AMA1 prime and 2.5 or 1.25×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA AMA1) in comparison to group 1B (5×10<sup>9</sup> vp ChAd63 AMA1 prime and 5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA AMA1) (geomean titer 1709 [range 840–3370] vs 949 [range 84–2552] AMA1 AU respectively). Responses again declined over time but were maintained at high levels at the end of the study period (day 140) with again no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 1.00 by Mann-Whitney test) in the responses between groups 1B and 2B (geomean titer 971 [range 553–2683] vs 547 [range 90–1162] AMA1 AU respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 4 vs 4).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this Phase Ia study we have shown in healthy, malaria-naïve adult volunteers that a recombinant ChAd63-MVA heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen encoding AMA1 can induce functional antigen-specific antibody responses in addition to strong T cell responses. ChAd63 AMA1 demonstrated a good reactogenicity profile, similar to that seen consistently with the same doses of ChAd63 vectored vaccines encoding the pre-erythrocytic malaria antigen ME-TRAP (O'Hara <italic>et al.</italic>, J Infect Dis 2011 in press) and the blood-stage antigen MSP1 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, supporting the growing body of evidence that this simian adenovirus vector is safe for clinical use. MVA expressing other malaria or HIV antigens has been used previously as a vaccine vector <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> at doses equal to and higher than the maximum dose used in this study without safety concern <xref rid="pone.0031208-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Keefer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The increased reactogenicity seen with the relatively high poxviral doses of MVA AMA1 used in this study (5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu and 2.5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu) may be a result of differences in viral titration methods or other factors. When MVA AMA1 was used at a dose of 1.25×10<sup>8</sup> pfu, an acceptable reactogenicity profile was observed, without a significant compromise to vaccine antibody immunogenicity, although T cell responses tended to be higher following the higher boosting dose of MVA. A subsequent study has now shown this acceptable tolerability profile to be maintained following immunization of a further nine volunteers with the dosing regimen used here in group 2B(ii) (Sheehy <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation).</p>
              <p>The summed AMA1-specific IFN-γ T cell responses peaked at a median level of &gt;6900 SFU/million PBMC in group 1B (ChAd63 5×10<sup>9</sup> vp and MVA 5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu), &gt;2500 SFU/million in group 2B (ChAd63 5×10<sup>10</sup> vp &amp; MVA 1.25–2.5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu). However, it remains possible that some T cell epitopes are duplicated within the 3D7- and FVO-specific 20mer peptides (because a number of these only differ by 1–2 amino acids) and thus the total sum may potentially count some responses twice. Examining the median summed individual responses to the two alleles in the vaccine, we found T cells were induced to both alleles equally; 3D7 (4959 SFU/million PBMC in group 1B and 2036 SFU/million PBMC in group 2B) and FVO (4359 SFU/million PBMC in group 1B and 1539 SFU/million PBMC in group 2B). The same result was observed at the late day 140 time-point. These allele-specific totals are not subject to any double counting error due to peptide homology between the 3D7 and FVO strains, and these median ELISPOT responses compare favourably with those induced by the same vectors and regimen for the ME-TRAP and MSP1 malaria antigens and are substantially greater than those reported for AMA1 protein-in-adjuvant vaccines <xref rid="pone.0031208-Lyke1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Duncan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Responses induced after the ChAd63 AMA1 immunization also compared favourably with those recently reported following a single immunization of healthy adult US volunteers with 1×10<sup>10</sup> vp of an AdHu5 vaccine encoding the 3D7 AMA1 antigen <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sedegah2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, although interestingly in this study the use of a higher dose (5×10<sup>10</sup> vp) led to a significant reduction in T cell immunogenicity – an observation not seen here with the same dose of ChAd63.</p>
              <p>A total of 19 amino acid substitutions, as described and used elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, were also included in the vaccine transgene to remove sites of potential N-linked glycosylation that could occur during <italic>in vivo</italic> mammalian expression of the AMA1 transgene. Such amino acid substitutions could affect T cell recognition of the native parasite AMA1 sequence if they occurred within recognized epitopes. Following immunization of rhesus macaques with the same ChAd63-MVA AMA1 vaccines these substitutions were shown to have a minimal effect following comparative re-stimulation with peptides representing these substitutions and which reflected about 12% of the total number of 15mer peptides required for complete coverage of the AMA1 transgene <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However following human vaccination here, responses to peptide pools for the vaccine versus native sequences of AMA1 showed a significantly stronger response to the vaccine pool, indicating amino acid substitutions included in the insert are likely to impact on the T cell recognition of native AMA1 parasite antigen in humans – an effect potentially observed in the peptide versus pRBC re-stimulation of PBMC. Similarly, it cannot be automatically assumed that cellular immune responses to the native AMA1 sequence would have been as strong as those observed to the modified vaccine sequence, although given responses were broadly strong to the remaining native sequence of the antigen (roughly 88% of the total), this seems unlikely. Future studies should thus extremely carefully address the potential advantages and disadvantages of such modifications in the context of vectored vaccine design. The discrepancy described here between the T cell data in rhesus macaques versus humans, indicates that the assessment of the positive versus negative impact(s) of such modifications at the preclinical stage may be extremely difficult.</p>
              <p>The CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell populations also consisted of a mixed CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> phenotype, and the cells expressed a range of functional cytokines/markers following AMA1 peptide re-stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. It remains a significant challenge to the field to establish the relevance of such <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of T cell phenotypes to protective outcome against malaria <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans. Similar challenges are faced for <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of antibody function, and ultimately the development of an effective vaccine is required before such questions can be readily addressed. Nevertheless, the ChAd63-MVA vaccine platform, now tested here for the third time, represents a versatile delivery system for the reliable induction of high-level antigen-specific multi-functional T cell responses. The adverse reactogenicity profile of higher doses of MVA AMA1 means that future trials will use a maximum dose of 1.25×10<sup>8</sup> pfu of this vaccine, which will limit median T cell responses to approximately 2000 SFU/million PBMC. However, these data indicate that exceptionally strong T cell responses (approximately 10,000 SFU/million PBMC) have the potential to be induced in humans by subunit vaccination, if the MVA vector could be further engineered or formulated to reduce reactogenicity whilst maintaining transgene potency.</p>
              <p>In agreement with pre-clinical data in mice, rabbits and rhesus macaques <xref rid="pone.0031208-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, this ChAd63-MVA prime-boost regimen also induced substantial AMA1-specific serum IgG antibody responses. When quantified by a standardized ELISA, the concentrations of AMA1-specific IgG induced at the peak of the response (median 49 µg/mL against 3D7 AMA1 in group 2B) were comparable to AMA1 protein vaccines formulated in Alum <xref rid="pone.0031208-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> or Montanide ISA720 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, but three- to four-fold lower than Alum+CpG <xref rid="pone.0031208-Duncan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Mullen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. As for T cell induction, the magnitude of these antigen-specific IgG antibody responses is also highly comparable to those seen with the ChAd63-MVA MSP1 regime <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Importantly, however, unlike for MSP1, ChAd63-MVA AMA1 induced moderate growth inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> that correlated with total IgG ELISA titers. These levels were higher than those seen with a bi-valent (3D7 and FVO) AMA1 protein vaccine (AMA1-C1) formulated in Alum <xref rid="pone.0031208-Mullen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and an AdHu5 vaccine encoding the 3D7 allele of AMA1 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sedegah2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> (and assessed using the same assay of GIA), comparable to those when the vaccine was formulated in Montanide ISA720 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, but lower than those seen with the same vaccine was formulated in Alum+CpG <xref rid="pone.0031208-Duncan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Mullen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This ability of the AMA1 antigen to induce functional GIA at lower levels of antigen-specific human IgG (in comparison to MSP1) is in agreement with previous data generated with protein-in-adjuvant vaccines <xref rid="pone.0031208-Miura2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Similarly, in this study <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition levels of the FVO strain parasite were lower than those observed for 3D7, which is in agreement with previous clinical studies of the AMA1-C1 protein-in-adjuvant vaccine <xref rid="pone.0031208-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Mullen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Interestingly, dose escalation of ChAd63 AMA1 from 5×10<sup>9</sup> vp to 5×10<sup>10</sup> vp led to a statistically significant increase in AMA1-specific serum IgG antibody responses but no significant increase in AMA1-specific IFN-γ T cell responses. The same finding was also seen with ChAd63 MSP1 <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A recent report of an AdHu5 vectored malaria vaccine showed the same trend for antibody responses but significantly reduced T cell responses at the highest dose used <xref rid="pone.0031208-Sedegah2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, whereas dose finding studies with the MRKAd5-gag HIV vaccine showed a similar plateauing of T cell responses (as assessed by <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IFN-γ ELISPOT) at the highest doses used <xref rid="pone.0031208-Bett1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The reason(s) for these quantitative T cell differences at high vaccine dose remain unclear and such responses may be vector as well as antigen-dependent. Similarly, functional or qualitative differences in T cell effector function following adenoviral vaccine dosing warrants further investigation.</p>
              <p>In agreement with data relating to the use of the ChAd63 ME-TRAP vaccine in healthy UK volunteers (O'Hara <italic>et al.</italic>, J Infect Dis 2011 in press), there was also no apparent effect of low-level pre-existing anti-ChAd63 NAb responses on AMA1-specific cellular or humoral immune responses. This is also perhaps unsurprising given the relatively high doses of adenoviral vaccine used. Similar findings have recently been reported in healthy US adults following a single immunization with an AdHu5 vaccine encoding the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite antigen <xref rid="pone.0031208-Tamminga1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The T cell and GIA data are reassuringly comparable to those seen in pre-clinical studies in mice <xref rid="pone.0031208-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Goodman2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and macaques <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, supporting the importance of these models in pre-clinical vaccine optimization and development. The data also confirm that in comparison with leading AMA1 protein-in-adjuvant vaccines, the ChAd63-MVA vectored vaccine regimen in humans can induce comparable antibody titers, similar degrees of <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibition and markedly stronger CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses including those against conserved sequences of AMA1. Since AMA1 is also expressed on sporozoites and during the liver-stage of infection <xref rid="pone.0031208-Remarque1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Silvie1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, the strong T cell responses, in particular CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, induced by ChAd63-MVA AMA1 may reduce the parasite inoculum released from the liver <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and thus increase the potential for clinical efficacy at the blood-stage. It has been shown in animal models that immunization with multiple AMA1 alleles can focus B cell responses on more conserved eptiopes <xref rid="pone.0031208-Kusi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, and similarly the inclusion of conserved T cell epitopes in the vaccine insert described here (if capable of contributing to protective immunity in humans) may help to address the induction of effective immunity in the face of extensive parasite genetic variability. However, it remains for now unclear how effective these vaccines would be in the context of the marked AMA1 polymorphisms that are commonly seen in infecting parasites in the field <xref rid="pone.0031208-Takala1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that are highly likely to affect the neutralizing ability of vaccine-induced antibodies. Future work should also examine whether the enhanced cell-mediated and humoral immunogenicity reported in pre-clinical studies (when protein-in-adjuvant formulations are combined with viral vectored vaccines <xref rid="pone.0031208-Draper2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-Douglas1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031208-deCassan1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>) can also be achieved in humans in clinical trials. Further studies are now essential to ascertain whether the addition of strong cellular immunity to such levels of antibody response can translate into significant vaccine efficacy against blood-stage infection in Phase IIa controlled human malaria challenge trials.</p>

                  <p><bold>AMA1 overlapping peptides.</bold> 20mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids (aa) were generated for the whole of the AMA1 vaccine insert present in the ChAd63 and MVA vaccines. Peptides were divided into pools containing up to 10 peptides and were divided up according to whether they were 3D7 strain specific (3 pools, <italic>n</italic> = 24), FVO specific (3 pools, <italic>n</italic> = 24), common peptides (CP; 3 pools, <italic>n</italic> = 28), FVO terminus peptides (FVOT; 1 pool, <italic>n</italic> = 7). A single pool of tPA peptides (<italic>n</italic> = 5) was used and these were 15mers overlapping by 10aa. Amino acids that were substituted to prevent potential N-linked glycosylation are indicated in bold.</p>
