                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Intubation-related complications are less frequent when intubation is successful on the first attempt. The rate of first attempt success in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) is typically less than 90%. The bougie, a semirigid introducer that can be placed into the trachea to facilitate a Seldinger-like technique of tracheal intubation and is typically reserved for difficult or failed intubations, might improve first attempt success. Evidence supporting its use, however, is from a single academic ED with frequent bougie use. Validation of these findings is needed before widespread implementation.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The BOugie or stylet in patients Undergoin<underline>g</underline> Intubation Emergently trial is a prospective, multicentre, non-blinded randomised trial being conducted in six EDs and six ICUs in the USA. The trial plans to enrol 1106 critically ill adults undergoing orotracheal intubation. Eligible patients are randomised 1:1 for the use of a bougie or use of an endotracheal tube with stylet for the first intubation attempt. The primary outcome is successful intubation on the first attempt. The secondary outcome is severe hypoxaemia, defined as an oxygen saturation less than 80% between induction until 2 min after completion of intubation. Enrolment began on 29 April 2019 and is expected to be completed in 2021.</p>

                  <p>The trial protocol was approved with waiver of informed consent by the Central Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or the local institutional review board at an enrolling site. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at scientific conferences.</p>

              <p>Tracheal intubation of critically ill adults is frequently performed in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU). Successful intubation on the first attempt has been associated with a lower incidence of peri-intubation complications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> However, less than 90% of patients are intubated on the first attempt in most settings outside of the operating room, highlighting an opportunity for improvement.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Emergency tracheal intubation is commonly performed in three discrete steps. First, medications are administered to facilitate optimal intubating conditions (induction). Second, a laryngoscope is inserted into the patient’s mouth and a direct or indirect video view of glottic structures is obtained (laryngoscopy). Third, an endotracheal tube is placed in the mouth and advanced past the vocal cords into the trachea (intubation). Two commonly used devices that aid in placing the endotracheal tube include: a stylet (a malleable, metal rod preloaded inside the endotracheal tube to facilitate navigation of the upper airway) or a bougie (a thin, plastic introducer passed into the trachea which serves as a guide for passage of the endotracheal tube). When using a stylet, the endotracheal tube and stylet are passed into the trachea together. When using a bougie, the bougie is first passed into the trachea and then the endotracheal tube is advanced over the bougie using a Seldinger-like technique. There is substantial variation between clinicians as to whether they select the stylet or the bougie for the first intubation attempt.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 8</xref> For some physicians, the bougie is used primarily as a rescue device in the event difficulty is encountered in laryngoscopy or passage of the endotracheal tube with stylet. Other physicians use a bougie routinely on the first attempt at tracheal intubation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>
</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, only one prior randomised trial has compared rates of successful intubation on the first attempt outside of the operating room with use of a bougie versus use of endotracheal tube with stylet: the single-centre Bougie Use in Emergency Airway Management (BEAM) trial. That study showed a higher rate of successful intubation on the first attempt with use of a bougie (98%) compared with use of an endotracheal tube with stylet (87%) in adult ED patients (absolute difference 11%, 95% CI 7% to 14%).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, it is possible that these findings reflect increased institution-specific comfort with bougie use compared with the endotracheal tube and stylet—operators reported using a bougie in approximately 80% of intubations before the trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is unknown if the results of the BEAM trial will generalise to other settings where operators have less experience using the bougie and have greater experience using an endotracheal tube with stylet during the first attempt at intubation.</p>

                <p>The original inclusion criteria specified that patients must be at least 18 years old to be eligible. With approval from the Central Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, trial inclusion and exclusion criteria were amended on 16 January 2020 to allow the enrolment of patients less than 18 years of age. Because the identity and age of critically ill patients presenting to the ED are sometimes unknown (eg, a patient with cardiac arrest presenting by ambulance without family), this criterion was revised to include patients located in a participating unit of an adult hospital. We anticipate that a small number of patients whose identity and age are unknown, who are judged by treating clinicians to be an adult and enrolled in the trial, will later be determined to be less than 18 years old.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and treatment allocation</title>
                <p>Patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to undergo intubation using a bougie or using an endotracheal tube with stylet for the first attempt in permuted blocks of two, four or six, stratified by study site. Study-group assignments are generated using a computerised randomisation sequence, placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes and distributed to enrolling sites. Before opening the envelope, the operator determines that the patient meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. The operator documents whether they plan to use a video laryngoscope or a direct laryngoscope by checking a box on the front of the envelope. The operator then opens the envelope. Patients are considered to be enrolled once the operator opens the envelope to reveal study group assignment. Thus, group assignment is concealed until after documentation of laryngoscope choice and patient enrolment. Patients who are screened and excluded will be reported with trial results using a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram. After enrolment and randomisation, patients, treating clinicians and study personnel are not blinded to study group assignment.</p>

                  <title>Training</title>
                  <p>Before beginning enrolment at a site, operators at each site received a 30 min in-person lecture and watched a 6 min training video which demonstrated best practices for intubation with both a bougie and endotracheal tube with stylet. These materials are available from the authors on request.</p>

                <title>Bougie group</title>
                <p>For patients assigned to the bougie group, operators are instructed to use a bougie on the first attempt at laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. If the bougie is successfully placed in the trachea, an assistant is instructed to load the endotracheal tube (without a stylet) over the bougie. The operator is instructed to, without removing the laryngoscope from the mouth, advance the tube through the vocal cords to the desired depth in the trachea. If resistance is encountered when passing the endotracheal tube over the bougie, the tube is be retracted 2 cm, rotated 90° counterclockwise to orient the bevel tip of the tube vertically and readvanced into the trachea. With the operator or an assistant manually stabilising the endotracheal tube, the bougie is withdrawn from the endotracheal tube before ventilation. Confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement is deferred to clinicians; detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide is the standard of care at participating institutions.</p>
                <p>This trial evaluates the use of a straight, semirigid bougie. Experts report that less-rigid bougies packaged in a curled position are more difficult to advance through the glottic opening.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Participating units use a straight bougie at least 60 cm in length; a coudé tip is favoured but not required. Operators may choose whether and how to bend the bougie prior to intubation.</p>

                <p>For patients assigned to the endotracheal tube with stylet group, operators are instructed to use an endotracheal tube with stylet on the first attempt at laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. The shape and curvature of the endotracheal tube with stylet is determined by the operator, however a ‘straight-to-cuff’ shape and a distal bend angle of 25°–35° is encouraged. If there is difficulty passing the endotracheal tube, the operator is instructed to manipulate the tube as needed, including slight retraction and rotation. The stylet remains within the endotracheal tube until the tube is within the trachea. Confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement is deferred to clinicians; detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide is the standard of care at participating institutions.</p>

                <title>Subsequent attempts at laryngoscopy and intubation and cointerventions</title>
                <p>Study group assignment determines only the device to be used on the first attempt at laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. All other aspects of the intubation procedure are at the discretion of treating clinicians, including choice of endotracheal tube diameter, patient position, approach to preoxygenation, approach to ventilation and oxygenation between induction and intubation and devices used after the first intubation attempt. For laryngoscopes capable of both video-assisted and direct laryngoscopy, the use of the video screen during intubation is at the discretion of the operator. After the first attempt at laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, the operator may use any other method of intubation, including use of an endotracheal tube with stylet in the bougie group or use of a bougie in the endotracheal tube with stylet group. In either group, treating clinicians may, at any point, use any device they feel is required to ensure optimal care of the patient regardless of study group assignment. The approach to the initial attempt at laryngoscopy and intubation and any cointerventions are prospectively collected and will be reported.</p>
                <p>Coenrolment in other randomised trials is permitted as the use of randomisation facilitates balance between study arms, reduces the likelihood of any systematic effects on intubation success rates and allows for evaluation of the main effects in this trial.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>An observer, not directly involved with the intubation procedure, collects data for key periprocedural outcomes, including successful intubation on the first attempt, time between induction and successful intubation, arterial oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure at induction and the lowest values for arterial oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure between induction and 2 min following intubation. The background of trained observers depends on local context and may include either clinical professionals (eg, physicians or nurses) or research study personnel. All observers received training on study procedures and data element definitions.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the procedure, operators complete a paper data collection form to document the approach to oxygen administration and use of ventilation for preoxygenation and between induction and laryngoscopy, laryngoscope used, Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic view<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, laryngoscope video screen use (if applicable), reason for the failure to intubate on the first attempt (if applicable), subsequent intubation methods, difficult airway characteristics (cervical collar, glottic view obscured by body fluids, facial trauma) and complications of intubation (cardiac arrest, heart rate &lt;40 beats per minute, oesophageal intubation, airway trauma, witnessed aspiration). Operators record their specialty and training level and self-report the number of prior intubations, overall and with a bougie, at the time of each study intubation.</p>

                <title>Sample size estimation</title>
                <p>There is no established minimum clinically important difference in successful intubation on the first attempt. A prior single-centre randomised trial reported an absolute difference of 11% in successful intubation on the first attempt between the bougie and endotracheal tube with stylet groups. Because this trial was performed in an ED where the majority of first intubation attempts used a bougie, we anticipated a potentially smaller difference between groups in this multicenter trial conducted in a broader range of clinical settings with a broader range of operators. Therefore, the current trial was designed to detect a 6% absolute difference between groups in the proportion of patients who experience successful intubation on the first attempt. For two inexpensive interventions already routinely available and used in practice, the minimally clinically significant difference that would be expected to change practice is unknown. However, an absolute difference of 6% in successful intubation on the first attempt is similar to or smaller than the difference considered to be clinically meaningful in the design of prior airway management trials.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10 14</xref> Assuming 84% of patients in the endotracheal tube with stylet group experience successful intubation on the first laryngoscopy attempt, detecting a 6% absolute increase in successful intubation on the first attempt with 80% power at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 would require enrolment of 1050 patients (525 per group). Anticipating missing data for 5% of patients or less, we will plan to enrol a total of 1106 patients (553 per group).</p>

                <p>A DSMB composed of four clinical trials experts with backgrounds in critical care medicine, anaesthesia and emergency medicine has overseen the design of the trial and is monitoring its conduct. The DSMB reviewed a single interim analysis, prepared by the study biostatistician, on 4 February 2020, at the anticipated halfway point of the trial after enrolment of 553 patients, and recommended continuing the trial to completion without alteration. The stopping boundary for efficacy was prespecified as a p value of 0.001 or less for the difference in the incidence of the primary outcome between groups tested, using a χ<sup>2</sup> test. This conservative Haybittle-Peto boundary was selected to allow the final analysis to be performed using an unchanged level of significance (p&lt;0.05). The recommended stopping boundary for safety was a p&lt;0.025 comparing the incidence of oesophageal intubation and separately the incidence of airway trauma between groups, using a χ<sup>2</sup> test. The DSMB retains the authority to stop the trial at any point, request additional data or interim analyses or request modifications of the study protocol to protect patient safety.

                <title>Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome</title>
                <p>To assess the robustness of the findings, we will repeat the main analysis of the primary outcome in several alternatives to the overall intention-to-treat population. First, we will repeat the main analysis of the primary outcome among only those patients for whom a non-hyperangulated laryngoscope blade was used on the first attempt at intubation. Second, operators may choose to deviate from the assigned device for the safety of the patient after obtaining a laryngeal view. To address this, we will repeat the main analysis of the primary outcome for all patients, but will assign failure to the first intubation attempt for patients in whom the operator crossed over from the assigned device to the non-assigned device. Third, we will repeat the main analysis of the primary outcome, including only cases in which primary outcome data from the independent observer is complete (ie, excluding cases in which the operator’s self-report of whether there was successful intubation on the first attempt defined the primary outcome for that patient). Fourth, because prior intubating experience may influence success with both devices, we will repeat the main analysis of the primary outcome, excluding cases where the operator had ≤10 total prior intubations. Fifth, because prior experience with using a bougie may influence successful intubation in the bougie group, we will repeat the main analysis of the primary outcome, excluding cases where the operator had ≤5 prior intubations while using a bougie. Sixth, we will perform a sensitivity analysis that defines successful intubation on the first attempt as successful tracheal intubation during the first insertion of the laryngoscope blade, regardless of the number of insertions of a bougie or endotracheal tube.</p>

                <p>The BOUGIE trial is a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre, non-blinded randomised clinical trial comparing use of a bougie to use of an endotracheal tube with stylet for tracheal intubation of critically ill adults in the ED and ICU. Patient enrolment began on 29 April 2019.</p>

                <title>Pause in enrolment</title>
                <p>Over the first 10 months of enrolment, four patients were enrolled and subsequently found to be prisoners. On 28 February 2020, we paused enrolment to evaluate and improve enrolment procedures with a goal of preventing the enrolment of ineligible patients. The decision was made to extend the pause in enrolment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when enrolment was felt to be infeasible. Enrolment was resumed on 24 August 2020 with introduction of a new preprocedural ‘time out’ which requires the verbal recitation of eligibility criteria prior to enrolment to prevent subsequent enrolments of ineligible patients.</p>

                  <title>Waiver of informed consent</title>
                  <p>Critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality from their underlying illness. Most patients undergoing tracheal intubation in routine clinical care receive intubation using either a bougie or an endotracheal tube with stylet on the first attempt. Any benefits or risks of these two approaches are experienced by patients undergoing tracheal intubation in clinical care, outside the context of research. As a requirement for enrolment in the BOUGIE trial, the patient’s treating clinician must believe that either a bougie or an endotracheal tube with stylet would be a safe and reasonable approach for the patient (otherwise the patient is excluded). Therefore, making the decision between the two approaches randomly (by study group assignment) rather than by a provider who thinks either approach is safe and reasonable for the patient was expected to pose no more than minimal additional risk.</p>
                  <p>The investigators also determined that obtaining informed consent for participation in the study would be impracticable. Tracheal intubation of acutely ill patients is a time-sensitive procedure. Despite the availability of an informed consent document for the intubation procedure in clinical care, the risks and benefits of the procedure are infrequently discussed and the informed consent document for the procedure in clinical care is infrequently completed before the procedure due to its time-sensitive nature, the impairments induced by the patients’ critical illness and the frequent absence of surrogate decision-makers.</p>
                  <p>Because the study was expected to pose minimal risk and prospective informed consent was considered to be impracticable, a waiver of informed consent was requested and granted from the Single Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (reference number 182123). This is consistent with previous randomised trials comparing alternative approaches to tracheal intubation commonly used in clinical care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10 16–21</xref>
