              <abstract>
                <p>Glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational polypeptide chain modification in nature. Although carbohydrate modification of protein antigens from many microbial pathogens constitutes important components of B cell epitopes, the role in T cell immunity is not completely understood. Here, using ELISPOT and polychromatic flow cytometry, we show that <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation of the adhesin, Apa, of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> is crucial for its T cell antigenicity in humans and mice after infection. However, subunit vaccination with both mannosylated and non-mannosylated Apa induced a comparable magnitude and quality of T cell response and imparted similar levels of protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge in mice. Both forms equally improved waning BCG vaccine-induced protection in elderly mice after subunit boosting. Thus, <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation of Apa is required for antigenicity but appears to be dispensable for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. These results have implications for the development of subunit vaccines using post-translationally modified proteins such as glycoproteins against infectious diseases like tuberculosis.</p>

                <p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is the most devastating bacterial pathogen of all time that kills approximately 1.4 million people each year. <italic>Mtb</italic> modifies several of its proteins with sugar residues that influence many biological events. However, the significance of such sugar decorations and resulting carbohydrate and glycopeptide epitopes in shaping the T cell response during infection or after vaccination is insufficiently understood. Here, we show that the carbohydrate modifications of the <italic>Mtb</italic> Apa protein strikingly influence the magnitude of specific T cell responses in humans and mice after infection, but have only minor effect on the polyfunctionality and quality of T cell responses. The glycosylation of Apa was, however, expendable for T cell immunogenicity and protective efficacy when used either as a subunit vaccine or as a BCG-booster vaccine in dimethyl-dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA)-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvant against virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in mice. Our results suggest that the carbohydrate modification of microbial protein antigens may not always be critical for protection as our unmodified recombinant protein was sufficient for subunit vaccination. Together, our data underline the need to understand the role of heightened Apa glycoprotein-specific T cell responses in infection processes.</p>

              <p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis (TB), produces an array of protein antigens (Ags), many of which are post-translationally modified <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Brightbill1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003705-Drage1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which constitute important determinants of innate and adaptive immune response. As with other pathogens, the post-translational protein modifications influence host interactions. In particular, carbohydrate modification of proteins serves as an efficient ligand for innate C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) present on the antigen presenting cells (APCs). Members of this receptor family play an important role in immune response induction, immune evasion, immune regulation and tolerance <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Geijtenbeek1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition to their role in innate immunity, carbohydrate modifications of protein Ags contribute to B cell epitopes, and it has been recently shown that glycopeptides may constitute a T cell epitope and can induce a strong T cell response <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Avci1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Consequently, many glycoproteins or glyco-conjugates are considered Ags of interest in vaccine development. However, little is known about the role of protein glycosylation in T cell immunity in TB, and a better definition of immune responses to glycoproteins may aid in deciphering their role in protection or pathogenesis of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>
              <p>The 45-47-kDa secretory and cell surface alanine-proline-rich antigen (Apa; Rv1860) is one of the few glycoproteins of <italic>Mtb</italic> for which the complete glycosylation pattern has been described <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Dobos1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Dobos2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The modifications of native Apa (nApa) consist of complex <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation of specific threonine residues present at the N- and C-terminal domains <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Dobos2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-VanderVen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Apa is produced by all members of the <italic>Mtb</italic> complex including the vaccine strain, <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG). The nApa shares significant amino acid homology with a family of fibronectin attachment proteins found in other mycobacteria such as <italic>M. avium, M. marinum</italic> and <italic>M. leprae</italic> and is shown to possess fibronectin-binding activity <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In <italic>Mtb</italic>, mannosylated nApa is a potential adhesin and has a role in host cell attachment, entry, and immune evasion <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Ragas1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The nApa is an immunodominant Ag and has been found to be strongly recognized by serum antibodies (Abs) of active TB patients <xref rid="ppat.1003705-KunnathVelayudhan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and the Ab reactivity was mainly directed against mannose residues. The Ag-specific T cell recognition of nApa also requires mannosylation. These mannose residues are absent in the recombinant form of Apa (rApa) expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the rApa is poorly recognized by T cells of BCG inoculated guinea pigs <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Romain1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We and others have identified Apa as a possible vaccine candidate against TB <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Ferraz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but the role of glycosylation in inducing protective T cell immunity had not been studied.</p>
              <p>Here, we investigated the effect of Apa mannosylation on the T cell antigenicity after mycobacterial infections and the immunogenicity and protective efficacy following protein vaccination. Antigenicity is the ability of the molecule to react with a preformed Ab or T cell receptor (TCR) while immunogenicity is the ability to elicit a cell-mediated or humoral immune response <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which may or may not impart protection against a pathogen. Our results demonstrate that the mannosylation of Apa is critical for its T cell antigenicity in humans and mice after mycobacterial infections and provide evidence that a synthetic Apa glycopeptide constitutes a T cell Ag. We show that glycosylation of Apa is expendable for T cell immunogenicity and protective efficacy when used either as a subunit vaccine or as a BCG-booster vaccine against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in BALB/c mice. Our data suggest that comparable immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mannosylated and nonmannosylated Apa forms may not be due to the inability of nApa to induce glycopeptide-specific T cells, as generation of nApa-specific hybridomas following subunit vaccination of mice identified a T cell clone specifically reactive to the N-terminal glycopeptide of nApa. Importantly, our data suggest that Apa may be considered a possible component of future vaccines against TB to boost waning BCG immunity, regardless of glycosylation.</p>

                <title>Apa Glycosylation and Responses of Human PBMCs</title>
                <p>We first determined the role of Apa mannosylation in T cell recognition and recall of cytokine responses in healthy, BCG vaccinated (BCG<sup>+</sup>) and BCG unvaccinated (BCG<sup>−</sup>) adults. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 17/24 (70.8%) BCG<sup>+</sup> individuals produced more than 50 IFN-γ spot forming units (SFU)/10<sup>6</sup> cells (a positive response) after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with purified nApa, as compared to those from only 3/24 (12.5%) individuals after stimulation with rApa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Among BCG<sup>+</sup> individuals, an IFN-γ response was predominantly observed in individuals with positive skin test reactivity to <italic>Mtb</italic> purified protein derivatives (PPD<sup>+</sup>), with 15/16 (93.7%) individuals showing nApa-specific positive response. Only 2/8 (25%) BCG<sup>+</sup> individuals without PPD reactivity (PPD<sup>−</sup>) and 1/22 (4.5%) controls, i.e. BCG<sup>−</sup>PPD<sup>−</sup> individuals, responded positively to nApa. This dominant nApa-specific T cell response was dose dependent, as demonstrated by the increased frequency of IFN-γ SFU when PBMCs of 5 healthy PPD<sup>+</sup> (including 3 confirmed <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed) individuals were stimulated with varying amounts of nApa, in contrast to different doses of rApa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that nApa is recognized preferentially over rApa in these individuals.</p>

                    <p>(A–E) PBMCs from healthy donors were stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> with no Ag, nApa, rApa or WCL, and the T cell or DC responses were investigated.

The median IFN-γ SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs in no Ag stimulated wells (media only) were 7.5 (range 0–46.5) and 4.0 (range 0–37.5) for BCG<sup>+</sup> and BCG<sup>−</sup> donors, respectively.

                </fig>
                <p>Next, we characterized the Ag-specific IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 cytokine responses of 8 randomly selected BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> subjects by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and polychromatic flow cytometry and determined the percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing one (1+), any combination of two (2+), or all three (3+) cytokines. Significantly higher frequencies of IFN-γ, TNF-α or IL-2 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in nApa stimulated PBMCs than those stimulated with rApa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>) and the response was characterized by higher percentages (but comparable proportions) of nApa-specific polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the responding donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In contrast, the frequency of total cytokine producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not statistically different after stimulation with the two forms of Apa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), although 4 donors had more nApa-specific cytokine producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Collectively, these results suggest that mannosylation of Apa is important for the Ag-specific T cell recall responses in these individuals.</p>
                <p>The heightened T cell responses seen with mannosylated Ags are presumably due to efficient uptake through mannose binding CLRs on the APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) and higher efficiency of Ag presentation <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003705-Engering2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Apa mannosylation influences its uptake by DCs. We found increased binding/uptake of FITC-labeled nApa as compared to labeled rApa by the blood monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and by the CD11c<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) in the PBMCs of BCG<sup>+</sup> and BCG<sup>−</sup> individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s001">Figure S1C and D</xref>). A higher percentage of myeloid (mDCs) but not plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) from human PBMCs expressed CD80 following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with nApa than after rApa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>), suggesting increased activation of mDCs by nApa. It is known that mannose binding CLRs such as DC-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and mannose receptor (MR) are highly expressed on mDCs but are absent on pDCs, and play an important role in the uptake and presentation of mannosylated Ags <xref rid="ppat.1003705-McKenna1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Corroborating these observations, we found that nApa but not rApa binds to recombinant human MR, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR using an <italic>in vitro</italic> CLR adhesion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
                <p>To determine whether Ag presentation of nApa to specific T cells requires intracellular processing, APCs were fixed with glutaraldehyde before or after Ag pulsing. The MoDCs generated from the blood monocytes of three nApa-responding individuals (BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup>) were used as APCs, while T cells were purified from the PBMCs of respective individuals. The IFN-γ ELISPOT was used to investigate Ag presentation and activation of T cells after co-culture. Glutaraldehyde fixation of APCs before addition of nApa abrogated IFN-γ response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s001">Figure S1E</xref>), whereas fixation of APCs after pulsing with nApa did not prevent IFN-γ production, although the response (SFU) was lower than pulsing of Ag alone without fixation. These results indicate a requirement for intracellular processing of nApa for presentation to T cells. In contrast, fixation of APCs before addition of the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), did not prevent the IFN-γ response of T cells. Therefore, the lack of nApa-specific IFN-γ secretion by specific T cells, if fixation of APCs preceded Ag pulsing, is consistent with the presentation of cognate Ag (versus superantigen) <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Rojas1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sieling1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Next, to determine whether increased binding/uptake and activation of mDCs by nApa influences T cell reactivity and epitope recognition, we screened 32 sequential nonmodified synthetic overlapping peptides of Apa with PBMCs of BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> individuals who recognized both forms of Apa and those who recognized nApa over rApa. Several peptides induced positive IFN-γ responses in PBMCs from individuals who recognized both forms of Apa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s001">Figure S1F</xref>), whereas no peptide induced &gt;20 IFN-γ SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs from individuals who recognized only nApa. These results suggest that mannosylation of Apa does not induce alternate Ag processing in APCs to produce unique peptide epitopes, but rather carbohydrate contributes to T cell epitopes and recognition of such mannosylated epitopes (for example glycopeptides) is probably responsible for elevated T cell responses to nApa in these individuals.</p>

At different time points after infection, as indicated, mice were euthanized (n = 4/time point) and their spleen or lung cells (pools) were stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> with no Ag, nApa, rApa, nAg85B or WCL.

                </fig>
                <p>The time kinetics of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response confirmed the presence of significantly higher frequency of nApa-specific total cytokine secreting cells in the lung (p = 0.0002) and spleen (p = 0.0021) as compared to those specific for rApa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and revealed that the Apa responses peaked at 32–52 weeks (wks) after BCG administration, with a similar expansion and contraction trend for the nApa- and rApa-specific T cells. During the expansion phase, 3.9- and 8.6-fold more nApa-specific total cytokine secreting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed at 12 wks in the lung and spleen, while at the peak (52 wks) the increase was 7.7- and 2.7-fold more in the lung and spleen, respectively. At individual cytokine levels, however, the difference between nApa- and rApa-specific cytokine producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency was more pronounced for IFN-γ and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). These results suggest that mannosylation of Apa strongly influences the magnitude of Apa-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in BCG administered mice and indicates that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of these mice predominantly recognize major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II) restricted epitopes present in nApa only. On the contrary, the frequency of nApa- and rApa-specific total cytokine secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not significantly different at the time points evaluated, except at the 32 wk time point in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This difference in the lung was mainly due to the presence of a higher frequency of nApa-specific IFN-γ producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). These results indicate that both forms of Apa possess MHC-I restricted epitopes recognized by the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of BCG administered mice.</p>
                <p>Next, we compared the cytokine expression profiles of nApa- and rApa-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The lung CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response was dominated almost exclusively by 1+ cytokine (IFN-γ) producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, histograms). In contrast, about 38% and 50% of the nApa-specific cytokine secreting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produced more than 1 cytokine at the peak (52 wk) time point in the lung and spleen, respectively, and a significantly higher frequency of 2+ and 1+ cytokine producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed after stimulation with nApa than rApa in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, histograms). When the Ag-specific cytokine producing lung CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were categorized into 7 distinct subpopulations based on cytokine expression profiles, IFN-γ and TNF-α co-producing cells dominated nApa-specific 2+ cytokine producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), while IFN-γ or TNF alone producing cells were predominantly present among nApa-specific 1+ cytokine producers. Despite differences in the magnitudes, the proportions of nApa- and rApa-specific cytokine producing 3+, 2+ and 1+ cytokine producing CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not significantly different in both organs at the peak time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, pie charts).</p>
                <p>The proportions of nApa- and rApa-specific IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17 SFU in cultured ELISPOT assay were also not significantly different when compared at 3 time points; however, statistically higher frequency of IFN-γ or IL-17 SFU was present in the lung and spleen cell cultures after nApa stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). These results collectively suggest that Apa mannosylation may have only minor effect on the polyfunctionality and ratios of specific subpopulations of Apa-specific T cells in BCG inoculated mice. Similar dynamics were observed in <italic>Mtb</italic> Erdman infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s002">Figure S2D</xref>–F).</p>

The T cell epitope prediction analyses also indicated probable binding of a 15-mer encompassing Thr316 to MHC-II molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
                <p>To determine whether T cells recognize carbohydrate (di-mannose) in the absence of the proper peptide context, we synthesized rApa C-terminal 45-mer peptide with di-mannosyl-threonine residue at its N-terminus (at an unnatural position) linked by the additional glycine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). We termed this Apa 45-mer with additional four N-terminal residues as a 49-mer glycopeptide (i.e., Apa non-glycopeptide residues 281–325 with Gly-Thr(di-man)-Gly-Gly extension). Significant cytokine response was observed in ELISPOT when the lung, spleen or ILN cells from the BCG mice were stimulated with the synthetic 45-mer glycopeptide with a di-mannosyl residue at its natural position (Thr316). On the contrary, no positive cytokine response was found after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with the 49-mer glycopeptide, 49-mer nonglycopeptide (control) or the free di-mannose alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). These results suggest that the carbohydrate (di-mannose) attached to the proper peptide backbone is likely required for the recognition of nApa C-terminal glycopeptide by specific T cells from BCG mice. Further characterization of MHC bound glycopeptide interactions with the TCR and the orientation of carbohydrate residues can be accomplished through crystallography studies.</p>

                <p>To determine whether mannosylation of Apa also influences its ability to induce a protective immune response, mice were vaccinated s.c. with 3 doses of nApa or rApa (1 µg/dose) in the presence of dimethyl-dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants at 4 wk intervals, and the T cell responses were investigated 1 wk after the last dose.

                <p>When the cytokine expression profiles of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the spleen and lung were evaluated in the vaccinated groups, IL-2 and TNF-α co-producing cells dominated 2+ cytokine producing cells, while TNF-α or IL-2 single-producers were predominantly present among 1+ cytokine producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the cytokine expression profiles of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen and lung were dominated by TNF-α or IFN-γ secreting 1+ cytokine producers, respectively. Higher proportions of total cytokine producing splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of rApa vaccinated mice consisted of polyfunctional T cells than those of nApa vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Otherwise, we found no significant difference in the quality of nApa- and rApa-specific response, when the proportions of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cytokine producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were determined in the two vaccinated groups. Significantly more immunogen-specific IL-17 and IFN-γ SFU were observed in the spleens of rApa vaccinated as compared to nApa vaccinated mice in cultured ELISPOT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, histograms).

                <title>Generation of nApa-Specific Hybridomas Identify N-terminal Glycopeptide-Reactive T Cell Clone</title>
                <p>Since nApa is also glycosylated with complex mannose modifications at its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), the presence of N-terminal glycopeptide(s)-specific T cells in our nApa vaccinated mice samples remained a possibility. Our preliminary attempt to synthesize and evaluate N-terminal glycopeptide (39-mer) was unsuccessful, and whether nApa glycopeptide-specific T cells are generated following subunit vaccination was not clear. Therefore, to identify nApa-specific T cell clones we employed a specialized protocol of T-cell hybridoma generation, using a single dose nApa vaccination of BALB/c mice in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA). Individual T cell clones responding to nApa were purified by serial dilutions and tested for reactivity to nApa or rApa using an IL-2 capture ELISA after co-culture with APCs (i.e., syngeneic bone marrow derived dendritic cells) pulsed with Ag. Of the total 17 Apa-reactive hybridoma clones developed, 7 clones recognized both nApa and rApa while 10 clones recognized only nApa and not rApa (data not shown). Three of the 7 clones that recognized both nApa and rApa responded to a specific synthetic, nonmodified 15-mer peptide (two reactive to peptides spanning p271-288, and one to peptide p70-84, data not shown), while none of the 10 nApa reactive clones recognized any of the synthetic, overlapping, nonmodified peptides. Of the 10 clones only reacting to nApa, one clone, 4C3, reacted with a glycopeptide fraction of trypsin digested nApa fractionated by a reversed phase-HPLC column chromatography. Clone 4C3 produced significant amount of IL-2 when cultured with APCs pulsed with the whole digest of nApa but not with the digest of rApa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that the Ag presentation of nApa to 4C3 T cell clone was not inhibited by trypsin digestion. The RP-HPLC fractions consisting of the N-terminal 106 amino acid glycopeptide (residues p40-145) of nApa only demonstrated reactivity in IL-2 assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003705.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). Glycosylation of the N-terminus of nApa from <italic>Mtb</italic> likely explains specific recognition of the 4C3 clone to the nApa peptide. The lack of biological activity of T cell clone 4C3 when presented with rApa or synthetic nonglycosylated peptides collectively suggest that N-terminal glycopeptide-specific T cells are generated after nApa subunit vaccination. Further confirmation of these results will require identification of the precise epitope and synthesis of the N-terminal glycopeptide.</p>

The whole digest of nApa and fractions 19, 21, and 22 containing single N-terminal glycopeptide (residues p40-145) produced a positive IL-2 response when used for Ag pulsing of APCs.

Both forms of Apa imparted significant protection compared to naïve and adjuvant control groups at 2 different doses used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), and the bacterial burden among the Apa vaccinated groups was not significantly different. Vaccination with nAg85B also induced protection, but only nAg85B-10 µg was statistically different from the negative control groups at the level of lung and spleen. However, the degree of protection afforded by BCG vaccination was greater than any of the subunit vaccinated groups. Vaccination with either nApa or rApa induces comparable levels of protection in our model and suggests that glycosylation of Apa is not critical for protection.</p>

                <p>Considering the fact that most individuals in the world have been vaccinated with BCG and new TB vaccines have to be considered in the context of prior BCG vaccination, development of strategies aimed at boosting and improving the protective immunity induced by BCG is considered to be one of the rational approaches to develop an effective vaccination regimen against TB. Since BCG induced protection wanes significantly by 18 months in mice (unpublished data), we investigated the booster effect of 2 doses of nApa or rApa administered 3 wks apart in DDA-MPL at 16 months after BCG vaccination. Both forms of Apa significantly boosted T cell responses compared to boosting with saline, and a significantly higher frequency of T cells from the Apa-boosted groups recognized nApa over rApa after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g008">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Nonetheless, comparable nApa-specific responses were found in both Apa-boosted groups, except for splenic IFN-γ SFU. Of importance, boosting with either form of Apa, but not with saline, significantly reduced <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU in the lung and spleen of BCG mice compared to age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). BCG mice boosted with nApa or rApa showed about 2.0-log reduction in bacterial counts in the lungs as compared to age-matched naïve mice, while 1.7-log to 2.0-log reduction was found in the spleens of nApa- and rApa-boosted mice, respectively. This protection is characterized by a significantly lower frequency of ESAT-6+CFP-10-specific total as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell IFN-γ responses in the spleens of Apa-boosted groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003705-g008">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Glycosylation generates an enormous variety of modified protein-derived epitopes. However, the significance of such modified antigenic epitopes in intracellular bacterial pathogens in shaping the T cell repertoire and determining the outcome of an immune response is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that mannosylation of <italic>Mtb</italic> Apa (also known as MPT-32 or ModD) is crucial for its T cell antigenicity during mycobacterial infections of humans and mice and provides direct evidence that bacterial mannopeptides are T cell Ags using a synthetic Apa glycopeptide. Previously, glycopeptides containing tumor associated carbohydrates <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Gad1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-GalliStampino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, glycopeptides of self-Ags in autoimmune diseases <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Backlund1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and artificially glycosylated peptides of model Ags <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Avci1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> have been shown to be recognized by T cells. In antigenic glycopeptides, the peptide backbone usually provides the binding motif that interacts with the MHC molecule, while the glycan provides an important part of the structure (epitope) that is recognized by the T cell receptor <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Werdelin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Conversely, pure carbohydrates are usually incapable of MHC binding and T cell stimulation, and due to their haptenic nature requires a carrier. The exception to this immunologic paradigm is zwitterionic polysaccharides which are presented in an MHC class-II restricted manner <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Cobb1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Because complex carbohydrates are not removed during processing by DCs, it remains possible that mannosylated peptide epitopes within nApa are recognized <italic>in vitro</italic> by T cells primed in infected mice and humans <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Vlad1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our synthetic peptide screenings suggest that the recognition of carbohydrate containing epitopes (i.e., glycopeptides) rather than increased Ag uptake, mDCs activation or alternate Ag processing leading to enhanced recognition of other peptide epitopes is the major determining factor for heightened T cell responses to nApa during infection. Mapping of the precise mannosylated epitopes will further help to identify whether mannose binds to the MHC groove along with peptide backbone or interacts strictly with TCR and will provide direct insight into the role of mannosylation in Ag presentation of Apa to T cells.</p>
              <p>Unexpectedly, vaccination of mice with nApa or rApa induced comparable CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency, regardless of the form of Apa used for <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation. Nonetheless, these data together with post-challenge recall responses revealed that the paucity of anti-rApa T cell responses after primary infection, especially CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, is not due to an intrinsic inability of rApa to induce these responses. However, why nApa is recognized highly discriminately by T cells during infection but not after subunit vaccination remains to be answered. Speculatively, mannosylated epitope(s) of nApa might be effectively generated in phagosomes during intracellular growth of BCG or <italic>Mtb in vivo</italic>, but the relative dominance of mannose bearing epitopes versus peptide epitopes may change during processing of nApa in the presence of DDA-MPL in the endo-lysosomes of APCs <italic>in vivo</italic> following subunit vaccination. It is known that transport to different types of compartments in APC can lead to differential processing and generation of different epitopes within the same protein <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Billeskov1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and that different T cell epitopes in the same protein have been found to be recognized during infection and after subunit vaccination <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Billeskov1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our protocol, the majority of specific T cells generated after nApa-DDA-MPL vaccination might have been directed against the dominant peptide epitopes (such as p271-288 and p231-250) and the frequency of glycopeptide-specific T cells, if at all generated, might have been diminished in nApa stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. The carbohydrate or glycopeptide epitope-specific T cells induced by glycoprotein vaccination have been reported to be scarce and highly sensitive to <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Avci1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Avci2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The requirement of specialized protocols for their expansion <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Avci2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> including generation of T cell hybridomas has been suggested. Generation of nApa-specific T cell hybridomas following subunit vaccination of mice using FIA identified a T cell clone (4C3) specifically responding to the glycosylated N-terminal peptide of nApa. The dominant nature of peptide epitope p271-288 was also confirmed, because two hybridomas (3F7 and 2D10) that recognized both nApa and rApa strongly recognized synthetic peptides spanning p271-288 in IL-2 assay (data not shown). Therefore, the comparable immunogenicity of nApa and rApa following subunit vaccination may not be due to the inability of nApa to induce glycopeptide-specific T cells.</p>
              <p>Of paramount importance, both nApa and rApa offered comparable protection against virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge in mice, regardless of whether the 1 or 10 µg/dose was used for vaccination. Despite higher <italic>in vitro</italic> immunogen-specific cytokine SFU induced in the lungs by 1 µg than 10 µg/dose vaccination and the subtle differences in the quality of serum Ab response induced by the two forms of Apa vaccination prechallenge, comparable protection was found in all Apa vaccinated groups. Therefore, mannosylation appears to be dispensable for protective efficacy of Apa in DDA-MPL adjuvant in our model of progressive TB. It remains to be seen whether heightened T cell responses can be induced against nApa than its recombinant counterpart by using a different delivery vehicle or adjuvant system and whether the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of nApa differs from rApa in FIA, the adjuvant used for T cell hybridoma generation. However, immunization with a mannosylated model peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) has been previously shown to induce poor Th1 effector functions despite enhanced Ag presentation <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Kel1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Nonetheless, the ability of rApa to impart protection in this study is consistent with previous observation that i.n. subunit vaccination using rApa protein imparts notable protection in mice <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Of note, a comparable protection was offered by nAg85B and nApa vaccination despite the presence of 10 to 30-fold higher magnitude of immunogen-specific lung CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in nAg85B vaccinated mice (data not shown). In addition, WCL-specific T cell responses induced by BCG in the lung prechallenge were 2 to 5-fold lower than the immunogen-specific responses induced by nAg85B vaccination, but, the protection imparted by nAg85B was not better than BCG. These results suggest that no direct correlation exists between the magnitude of immunogen-specific T cell responses induced by subunit vaccination and the degree of protection afforded against <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge. Previously we have shown that the <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins selected on the basis of dominant T cell and IFN-γ response during human infection do not necessarily impart stronger protection in vaccination experiments <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable4" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, the decreased T cell responsiveness with higher dose (10 µg) Apa vaccination did not adversely affect the protection using either form in challenge experiments. Understanding the mechanism of such immune regulation and Apa vaccination induced protection will require further investigation.</p>
              <p>One of the important findings in this study is the particularly significant protective efficacy of Apa when used as a BCG-booster vaccine against <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge in the elderly mice with waning BCG induced protective immunity. Stronger and comparable protection observed in the nApa or rApa-boosted BCG mice, whose T cell responses are mainly primed against mannose modifications of nApa, further suggests that mannosylation of Apa is dispensable for BCG-boosting potential. It is conceivable that a similar effect might be seen in humans previously vaccinated with BCG in childhood and whose immunity has waned, although of course, this would require clinical verification.</p>
              <p>The progress of glycoproteins as vaccine candidates often suffers a serious roadblock during the developmental pipeline. It is usually due to perceived loss of immunogenicity when produced as a recombinant protein, synthetic peptides or DNA vaccine due to complete absence or lack of appropriate glycosylation. Despite effectiveness of several glyco-conjugate vaccines against extracellular pathogens, it has been suggested that artificial glycosylation of peptides and targeting of CLRs may not always lead to generation of protective immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, as CLRs are also targeted by pathogens to evade host immune responses <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Geijtenbeek1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, some ligand-MR interactions can result in promotion of Th2, anti-inflammatory or regulatory responses and may even lead to T cell anergy and tolerance <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Kel1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Chieppa1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Glycosylation can mask protective epitopes in Ag, prevent effective Ag processing, inhibit proteolysis by masking cleavage sites and shift the pattern of peptides processed by DCs <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Hanisch1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Contrarily, tolerance induction or CLR engagement can be a disease defense strategy <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Medzhitov1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Schaefer1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and it is argued that a mere ‘Th1 vaccine’ employing conserved immunodominant Ags can induce hyper-immune activation and may be advantageous to <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003705-Comas1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and a complex balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory host factors is required to prevent and control <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our results, therefore, underscore the importance of conducting comparative protection studies in animal models with a glycosylated Ag and its non-glycosylated counterpart. This may prevent elimination of poorly antigenic but otherwise protective non-glycosylated candidate during preclinical evaluation and may help save lengthy, costly and complex developmental efforts to artificially glycosylate it, carried out with the aim to improve its immunogenicity.</p>
              <p>In summary, we provide the evidence that the natural glycosylation of a protein may differentially affect its antigenicity and immunogenicity- the two attributes known to influence the protective efficacy of TB subunit vaccines <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003705-Sable5" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Although Apa mannosylation influences T cell antigenicity during infection, it is expendable for induction of protective immunity following vaccination. Recently, a protein-<italic>O</italic>-mannosylating enzyme has been found to be required for virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003705-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and our results highlight the need for further investigation of the role of increased mannosylated epitope-specific T cells in infection. In view of the finding that <italic>Mtb</italic> Apa improves waning BCG immunity and imparts significant protection in elderly mice, it makes a strong case for its inclusion as a possible component of future vaccines against TB.</p>

Each symbol represents an individual donor, while the horizontal bar indicates a median response. (B) Cytokine expression profiles of nApa and rApa- specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. PBMCs from PPD<sup>+</sup> (n = 8) or PPD<sup>−</sup> (n = 3) BCG vaccinated donors were stimulated with nApa, rApa or WCL (10 µg/ml) and IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α cytokine co-expression profiles were determined using the Boolean gating. The proportions of subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells positive for one (1+), any combination of two (2+), or all three (3+) cytokines constituting total cytokine positive (+) Ag-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were determined for each donor and expressed as percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and plotted as histograms. The pie charts present the mean frequencies of single (1+), double (2+) and triple (3+) cytokine producers of BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> donors specific for each Ag. (C–D) Uptake of nApa and rApa by DCs. The PBMCs from the healthy BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> or BCG<sup>−</sup>PPD<sup>−</sup> individuals or MoDCs from the BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> individuals (n = 3) were pulsed with indicated FITC-labeled Ags for 2 h and Ag uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry.

(D) Summary of FITC-labeled nApa and rApa uptake by CD11c<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> blood DCs and MoDCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. The MFI is represented by the geometric mean of the gated CD11c<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> peak. The data are means ± s.e.m. of three independent experiments. *Significant using 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test. (E) Processing and presentation of nApa to T cells. APCs (MoDCs) from nApa responding BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> individuals (n = 3) were fixed with glutaraldehyde before or after pulsing with no Ag, nApa or SEB for 4 h at 37°C. A set of APCs were also pulsed without fixing for 4 h. After incubation APCs were washed and cultured with T cells purified from the PBMCs of the respective individuals for 40 h in IFN-γ ELISPOT plates. The data are mean ± s.e.m SFU/10<sup>6</sup> purified T cell from 3 individuals evaluated in duplicate cultures. TNTC- too numeric to count. (F) Synthetic peptide screenings. The frequency of nApa, rApa or 32 individual non-modified synthetic Apa peptides-specific IFN-γ secreting cells in the PBMCs of BCG<sup>+</sup>PPD<sup>+</sup> donors recognizing both nApa and rApa or those recognizing nApa much better than rApa was determined by ELISPOT assay and expressed as mean SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs.</p>
