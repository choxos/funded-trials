              <abstract>
                <p>The search for effective treatments for obesity and its comorbidities is of prime importance. We previously identified IKK-ε and TBK1 as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and associated insulin resistance. Here we show that acute inhibition of IKK-ε and TBK1 with amlexanox treatment increases cAMP levels in subcutaneous adipose depots of obese mice, promoting the synthesis and secretion of the cytokine IL-6 from adipocytes and preadipocytes, but not from macrophages. IL-6, in turn, stimulates the phosphorylation of hepatic Stat3 to suppress expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, in the process improving glucose handling in obese mice. Preliminary data in a small cohort of obese patients show a similar association. These data support an important role for a subcutaneous adipose tissue–liver axis in mediating the acute metabolic benefits of amlexanox on glucose metabolism, and point to a new therapeutic pathway for type 2 diabetes.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Accumulating evidence indicates that the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity plays an important role in the development of metabolic disease. Obesity induces an increase in the NF-κB pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, which leads to induction of the non-canonical IKKs, IKK-ε and TBK1 in adipose tissue and liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Once induced, these kinases can initiate a counter-inflammatory programme by phosphorylating and activating phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE-3B) in adipocytes, thus producing reduced levels of cAMP and resistance to stimulation by catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. This resulting catecholamine resistance reduces energy expenditure and thermogenesis, and contributes to the development of obesity in humans and mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Our previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of IKK-ε/TBK1 with the dual-specificity inhibitor amlexanox improved catecholamine and insulin resistance, and resulted in significant weight loss and reversal of metabolic disease in obese mice, but had no effect on normal-chow fed mice in which the kinases are not elevated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
            <p>While improved catecholamine sensitivity may account for the dramatic weight loss observed after IKK-ε and TBK1 inhibition in obese mice, the mechanism of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose handling remains uncertain. A euglycemic–hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that the insulin-sensitizing effects of amlexanox were mainly attributed to suppression of hepatic glucose production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Moreover, insulin sensitization was observed prior to significant weight loss in obese mice. However, it was not clear whether the effects of amlexanox in the liver were mediated through direct inhibition of hepatic IKK-ε/TBK1 or another indirect mechanism. Here we describe one indirect pathway by which inhibition of IKK-ε and TBK1 in the subcutaneous adipose tissue affects reduced hepatic glucose production. Specifically, inhibition of IKK-ε and TBK1 by amlexanox stimulates the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from adipocytes as well as preadipocytes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue via a cAMP/p38-dependent pathway. The resulting increase in serum IL-6 is responsible for the activation of hepatic Stat3, which suppresses expression of <italic>G6pc</italic> to reduce hepatic glucose output.</p>

                <title>Direct versus indirect effects of amlexanox in the liver</title>
                <p>To determine the mechanism by which amlexanox improves hepatic insulin sensitivity, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of hepatic gene expression a few hours after <italic>in vivo</italic> amlexanox treatment, and identified over 1,700 differentially expressed genes (GEO accession code GSE57054). Pathway analysis of these differentially regulated genes revealed that the top two most enriched pathways were the adipocytokine signalling pathway and the Jak/Stat signalling pathway, presumably activated by a tissue-derived ligand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Amlexanox treatment induces IL-6 signalling</title>
                <p>The preponderance of Jak/Stat responsive genes in the RNA sequencing analysis led us to hypothesize that early effects of amlexanox in the liver might, at least partially, be due to the increased appearance of cytokines in the circulation. We thus screened serum from amlexanox-treated obese mice for a series of cytokines known to be upstream of the Jak/Stat pathway, and identified one, IL-6. Time course studies revealed that serum IL-6 levels were significantly elevated soon after amlexanox treatment, peaking 4 h after gavage with the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Increased serum levels of leukemia-inducible factor were also observed with amlexanox treatment; this IL-6 family ligand may also contribute to the effects of amlexanox on Jak/Stat signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). No changes in other IL-6 family ligands, including leptin, were observed. To identify the source of IL-6, we performed gene expression analysis in various tissues from mice treated for 4 h with amlexanox. No difference was observed in muscle, liver or epididymal fat <italic>Il6</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, there was a significant increase in <italic>Il6</italic> expression in the inguinal adipose tissue. Consistent with preferential induction of <italic>Il6</italic> expression in subcutaneous fat, we also observed increased expression in the dorsal subcutaneous depot, but not in the perirenal visceral fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The precise mechanism regulating the depot specificity of <italic>Il6</italic> expression is unclear, as similar differences are not observed when the tissues are treated <italic>ex vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>

Increased <italic>Il6</italic> expression was observed both in mature adipocytes and the stromal vascular cells (SVC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). <italic>Emr1</italic> expression was restricted to the SVC, indicating that there was negligible macrophage contamination of the mature adipocyte fraction from the inguinal white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). As expected, <italic>Adipoq</italic> expression was exclusive to the mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We further sorted the SVC to evaluate the amlexanox-induced <italic>Il6</italic> expression in preadipocytes versus immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). <italic>Emr1</italic> expression was exclusive to the CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, confirming the sorting of macrophages into this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). In addition, enriched expression of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> confirmed the identity of the preadipocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Amlexanox induced <italic>Il6</italic> expression specifically in the preadipocyte population but not in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Importantly other cytokines such as <italic>Tnfa</italic> were specifically expressed in the CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>). These data indicate that amlexanox specifically directs <italic>Il6</italic> expression in adipocytes as well as preadipocytes, but interestingly not in immune cells such as macrophages.</p>

                <title>Induction of <italic>Il6</italic> expression in adipocytes via cAMP signalling</title>
                <p>In adipocytes, IKK-ε and TBK1 phosphorylate and activate PDE-3B, thereby reducing intracellular cAMP levels and contributing to catecholamine resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, which has been well-described in obese rodents and patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Inhibition of IKK-ε/TBK1 by amlexanox <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> relieves this inhibition and restores catecholamine sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Downstream of cAMP, p38 activation leads to increased expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), which likely contributes to increased energy expenditure in amlexanox-treated mice. Interestingly, the <italic>Il6</italic> gene is also reported to be a downstream target of cAMP signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Consistently, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the β-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and CL316,243, as well as the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, significantly increased <italic>Il6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
                <p>To recapitulate the obese state, we overexpressed wild-type IKK-ε in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was sufficient to cause catecholamine resistance and block the upregulation of <italic>Il6</italic> in response to CL316,243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Importantly, the kinase dead mutant of IKK-ε was without effect. Furthermore, consistent with an inhibitory effect of IKK-ε and TBK1 on cAMP signalling, pretreatment of cells with amlexanox significantly potentiated the effect of CL316,243 on <italic>Il6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Amlexanox also increased <italic>Il6</italic> expression in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), but failed to induce <italic>Il6</italic> expression in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>), consistent with the expression pattern described above for SVC <italic>in vivo</italic>. As a positive control, we further investigated <italic>Il6</italic> expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. As expected RAW264.7 cells robustly produce IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide, via the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). However, unlike adipocytes, RAW264.7 macrophages do not produce IL-6 in response to forskolin, indicating that IL-6 production in macrophages occurs through a pathway different from that used in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i,j</xref>).</p>

                <title>Amlexanox-induced IL-6 expression is cAMP/p38 dependent</title>
                <p>Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with amlexanox alone for 2 h significantly increased <italic>Il6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The amlexanox-induced increase in <italic>Il6</italic> expression correlated with secretion of IL-6 from 3T3-L1 adipocytes into the cell culture media 4 h after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). As predicted by the proposed mechanism involving reduced PDE-3B activity, amlexanox induced a significant increase in cellular cAMP levels in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), confirming that the drug increases IL-6 secretion from adipocytes via increased cAMP signalling.</p>
                <p>Induction of <italic>Il6</italic> by cAMP has been previously shown to be dependent on p38 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Consistent with this notion, p38 phosphorylation increased after amlexanox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, the stimulation of p38 phosphorylation by amlexanox was rapid, occurring over a time course similar to its ability to relieve the feedback inhibition of TBK1 phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The induction of Stat3 phosphorylation in these adipocytes was not observed until after 4 h of treatment, a lag consistent with the time course of secretion of IL-6 into the media. Further supporting that <italic>Il6</italic> induction by amlexanox is mediated by a p38-dependent pathway downstream of cAMP, pretreatment of adipocytes with the p38 inhibitor SB203,580 completely blocked the effect of amlexanox to increase both <italic>Il6</italic> expression and IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). The dependency of amlexanox-induced IL-6 secretion in adipocytes on p38 was confirmed by short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of p38 (Mapk14) prior to amlexanox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). To verify that these effects of amlexanox were mediated by its inhibition of IKK-ε/TBK1, we utilized another structurally unrelated inhibitor of these kinases CAY-10576. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with CAY-10576 also increased the expression and secretion of IL-6 in a p38-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), confirming that this effect is due to inhibition of IKK-ε/TBK1, and not a non-specific effect of amlexanox.</p>

                <p>We also explored the role of the cAMP/p38 pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similar to the induction of <italic>Il6</italic> expression, amlexanox treatment specifically increased cAMP levels in inguinal adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of amlexanox on IL-6 secretion was downstream of this pathway, we pretreated mice by oral gavage with SB203,580. The stimulatory effect of amlexanox on serum IL-6 levels was inhibited by p38 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Consistent with p38-dependent induction of IL-6 in inguinal adipose tissue by amlexanox, we observed a significant increase in <italic>Il6</italic> mRNA levels as well as IL-6 precursor protein levels, both of which were completely blocked by administration of SB203,580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

                <p>Next, we investigated whether the increase in serum IL-6 after amlexanox treatment was associated with increased Stat3 activity in the liver. Following administration of amlexanox to obese mice, we assayed phosphorylation of Stat3 at tyrosine 705, which mediates dimerization and subsequent nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation. Hepatic Stat3 phosphorylation was increased 4 h after amlexanox treatment, coincident with the increase in serum IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figs 7a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1a</xref>, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

Furthermore, amlexanox treatment significantly enriched Stat3 occupancy at the promoter of <italic>Socs3</italic>, a well-known Stat3 target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>

                <p>Pre-treatment with SB203,580 dose dependently decreased amlexanox-stimulated hepatic Stat3 phosphorylation, coordinating well with decreases in serum IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figs 7f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6b</xref>, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).

While the IgG control antibody had no effect on the amlexanox or vehicle control-treated mice, the IL-6 neutralizing antibody blocked the stimulation of Stat3 phosphorylation in the amlexanox-treated mice, but had no effect in the vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).

                <p>In the liver, Stat3 activity is associated with suppression of gluconeogenic gene expression, specifically <italic>G6pc</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Increased binding of Stat3 to the <italic>G6pc</italic> promoter at all four previously characterized binding regions was observed in liver derived from amlexanox-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a–d</xref>). Amlexanox treatment specifically increased DNA binding by Stat3, but not FoxO1 or CREB, indicating that the latter transcription factors are likely not involved in the regulation of <italic>G6pc</italic> expression by the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>). Consistent with the indirect effects of amlexanox in the liver and lack of effect on CREB, amlexanox did not increase cAMP levels in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). We verified that treatment with amlexanox results in reduced gluconeogenesis in obese mice after only 3 days of treatment, by performing a pyruvate tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g</xref>).

                <title>Potential relevance to human disease</title>
                <p>To explore whether a similar crosstalk occurs in humans, we investigated the relationship between circulating IL-6 levels and measures of insulin sensitivity in a small cohort of obese-diabetic patients treated with amlexanox in a 12-week open-label clinical trial. In the mice, we observed the most robust effects on IL-6 signalling over the first 24 h of drug treatment. However, the earliest serum withdrawal in this clinical trial was 1 week after initiation of treatment. In addition, differences in the dosage of amlexanox in this clinical trial further obfuscate direct comparison with the IL-6 response in the animal studies. Nevertheless, a relatively small but statistically significant increase in serum IL-6 levels was observed after the sixth week of treatment, in these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a</xref>). Increased serum IL-6 levels were also observed during the first 2 weeks of treatment in four of the six patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10b</xref>). The relative increase in serum IL-6 in response to amlexanox treatment varied from patient to patient, with some patients showing a more pronounced response than others, even after baseline normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10c</xref>).</p>
                <p>Although fasting blood glucose levels and the homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score tended to be lower after amlexanox treatment, these results did not reach statistical significance in this small cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Hypothesizing that the insulin-sensitizing effect of amlexanox treatment in humans is associated with the relative IL-6 response, we performed a linear regression analysis to determine whether the IL-6 response correlated with improvements in the HOMA-IR score, as a measure of insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To quantify the IL-6 responsiveness for each patient, we calculated the area under the curve for serum IL-6 levels after normalization to baseline for each patient. We calculated the HOMA-IR score at the end of the 12-week study as a per cent of baseline HOMA-IR for each individual patient. There was a significant correlation (<italic>P</italic> value=0.02, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value=0.8) between the IL-6 response and improvements in the HOMA-IR score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10d</xref>). Although we have limited power in a cohort of this size, these data are consistent with the subcutaneous adipose tissue–liver communication axis that we observed in mice treated with amlexanox. The complete results of this clinical study will be reported elsewhere.</p>

              <p>The role of IL-6 in regulation of glucose homoeostasis has been controversial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.

Differences in the chronic versus acute metabolic effects of IL-6 may explain why contradictory results have been observed in genetic mouse models of disrupted IL-6 signalling. It is acutely secreted from skeletal muscle in response to exercise, and studies have indicated that it is produced from brown or white fat depots in response to sympathetic activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Adding further complexity to the metabolic effects of IL-6, our results indicate that IL-6 may also represent a crucial player in a subcutaneous adipose tissue–liver axis.</p>
              <p>Taken together, these data indicate a new, previously unappreciated crosstalk between subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver in the control of glucose homoeostasis. These findings suggest that activation of the inflammatory programme in obesity induces expression of IKK-ε/TBK1 in both adipocytes and preadipocytes of subcutaneous fat, initiating a process of catecholamine resistance that reduces energy expenditure, but also suppresses the catecholamine-induced increase in adipose IL-6 expression, thereby contributing to elevated hepatic glucose production in obesity. Acute inhibition of IKK-ε/TBK1 by amlexanox reverses this catecholamine resistance, raising cAMP levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and in the process dramatically increasing IL-6 expression and subsequent activation of Stat3 in the liver to suppress gluconeogenesis. These studies reinforce the notion of IKK-ε/TBK1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance in obese patients.</p>

Mice were assigned to treatment groups, such that prior to treatment the mean body weight, as well as the s.d. of the body weight, was equal across treatment groups, using a method similar to block randomization. Additional consideration was given to housing, such that each cage contained multiple treatment groups, to avoid confounding by cage effects. Sample size was determined based on the available cohorts and the number of treatment groups required. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle and given free access to food and water, except when food was restricted during fasting.

Single-cell complementary DNA size distribution and concentration were assessed on a capillary electrophoresis-based fragment analyser (Advanced Analytical). Illumina libraries were constructed in 96-well plates using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit as described previously using the protocol supplied by Fluidigm. For each C1 experiment, a bulk RNA control (about 200 cells) and a no-cell negative control were processed in parallel in PCR tubes, using the same reagent mixes as used on chip. Libraries were quantified by Bioanalyzer, using High Sensitivity DNA analysis kit, and also fluorometrically using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kits and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Life Technologies).</p>

                <p>Flash-frozen vehicle or 8 h amlexanox-treated liver samples (~400 mg per chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)) were thawed on ice and homogenized in 10 volumes 2 mM DSG (ProteoChem), incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then passed through a 70 μM mesh to remove extracellular debris. The homogenized cells were centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Formaldehyde crosslinking was quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM, and then incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The crosslinked cells were centrifuged and cell pellets were resuspended in ice cold Cell Lysis Buffer to isolate nuclei. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation, and then sonicated and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of Stat3 antibody (C-20) or normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, 2729) overnight. Immunoprecipitated complexes were captured with protein A dynabeads (novex) for 90 min at 4 °C, washed and eluted from beads.
