                <sec>
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Phosphorylated peptides presented by MHC molecules represent a new class of neoantigens expressed on cancer cells and recognized by CD8 T-cells. These peptides are promising targets for cancer immunotherapy. Previous work identified an HLA-A*0201-restricted phosphopeptide from insulin receptor substrate 2 (pIRS2) as one such target. The purpose of this study was to characterize a second phosphopeptide, from breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 3 (BCAR3), and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a novel immunotherapic vaccine comprising either or both of these phosphorylated peptides.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Phosphorylated BCAR3 protein was evaluated in melanoma and breast cancer cell lines by Western blot, and recognition by T-cells specific for HLA-A*0201-restricted phosphorylated BCAR3 peptide (pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>) was determined by <sup>51</sup>Cr release assay and intracellular cytokine staining. Human tumor explants were also evaluated by mass spectrometry for presentation of pIRS2 and pBCAR3 peptides. For the clinical trial, participants with resected stage IIA–IV melanoma were vaccinated 6 times over 12 weeks with one or both peptides in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant and Hiltonol (poly-ICLC). Adverse events (AEs) were coded based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.03, with provision for early study termination if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rates exceeded 33%. The enrollment target was 12 participants evaluable for immune response to each peptide. T-cell responses were assessed by interferon-γ ELISpot assay.</p>

                  <p>pBCAR3 peptides were immunogenic in vivo in mice, and in vitro in normal human donors, and T-cells specific for pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> controlled outgrowth of a tumor xenograft. The pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> peptide was identified by mass spectrometry from human hepatocellular carcinoma tumors. In the clinical trial, 15 participants were enrolled. All had grade 1 or 2 treatment-related AEs, but there were no grade 3–4 AEs, DLTs or deaths on study. T-cell responses were induced to the pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> peptide in 5/12 patients (42%, 90% CI 18% to 68%) and to the pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> peptide in 2/12 patients (17%, 90% CI 3% to 44%).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The development of therapeutic cancer vaccines based on peptides presented by MHC-I molecules to CD8 T-cells has been pursued for many years. Studies of these types of vaccines have recently been revitalized by the successes of checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell immunotherapies and by interest in patient-specific mutated antigens as vaccine targets. Peptide antigens tested in cancer vaccines have commonly been derived from source proteins in one of three categories: tissue-specific differentiation proteins, cancer-germ cell proteins or mutated proteins. The immunogenicity of antigens derived from non-mutated proteins may be compromised by mechanisms of self-tolerance.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While antigens carrying tumor-specific mutations may avoid some tolerance concerns, identification of relevant antigens in each patient and preparation of an appropriate vaccine are technically challenging and resource-intensive undertakings,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> and their therapeutic value is likely to vary widely. Importantly, only a small number of previously-identified antigens in any of these categories are derived from proteins that are objectively linked to mechanisms of cellular growth control, survival or metastasis. Such antigens are particularly appealing as immunotherapeutic targets for cancer control because their alteration as a means of immune escape may compromise one or more aspects of the malignant phenotype. We have identified peptide antigens of this type that are modified by intracellular phosphorylation, naturally processed and presented by MHC-I molecules on cancer cells and specifically recognized by CD8 T-cells.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> Phosphorylation is associated with a variety of cellular control processes, some of which are dysregulated in cancer cells. The source proteins for MHC-I-associated phosphopeptides identified to date are in large part known phosphoproteins,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> supporting the idea that the peptides are processed from folded proteins participating in signaling pathways.</p>
              <p>One such protein is insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2). IRS proteins are adapters that link signaling from upstream activators to multiple downstream effectors to modulate growth, metabolism, survival and differentiation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> IRS2 overexpression at the gene or protein level is evident in many cancer types and has been demonstrated to cause tumorigenesis and enhanced metastasis in vivo.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> IRS2 phosphorylated at Ser<sub>1100</sub> is detectable in multiple cancers, and the resulting phosphopeptide (pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub>) is endogenously processed and presented by the MHC-I molecule HLA-A*0201 at levels that allow strong immune recognition (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and unpublished). pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub>-specific CD8 T-cells can be generated from HLA-A2 transgenic mice by immunization with the phosphopeptide.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> These T-cells are capable of recognizing and killing human melanoma and breast tumors in vitro and controlling tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model system.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>A second cancer-relevant HLA-A*0201 restricted phosphopeptide is derived from breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 3 (BCAR3). BCAR3 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and mediates both cellular migration and acquisition of resistance to therapeutic antiestrogens in breast cancer cells, processes that are associated with malignancy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> A BCAR3-derived phosphopeptide (pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>) was initially shown by us to be presented by HLA-A*0201 on melanoma cells.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Here, we show that it also is immunogenic in HLA-A2 transgenic mice and that the resulting CD8 T-cells can directly recognize melanoma and breast cancer tumor cell lines.</p>
              <p>Several reports, including our own, have established the safety and immunogenicity of multipeptide vaccines derived from non-mutated tissue-specific proteins.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–18</xref> In the clinical trial reported here, we now evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine consisting of these two oncologically and immunologically relevant phosphorylated peptides, pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> and pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub>.</p>

Pixel densities were determined using the AlphaEaseFC software and the densities of BCAR3 and of BCAR3 phosphorylated at T130 (phosphoT130-BCAR3) were normalized to those from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Antihuman BCAR3 was from Bethyl labs (Montgomery, Texas, USA). Anti-GAPDH was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, California, USA). A polyclonal antibody recognizing T130 phosphorylated BCAR3 protein was generated by AbboMax (San Jose, California, USA) by immunization of a rabbit with a 13mer phosphopeptide (CRHIMDR[pT]PEKLK), and sequential affinity purification on columns derivatized with the 13mer and its non-phosphorylated counterpart.

Data analysis was performed using Xcalibur software (Thermo Electron Corporation) and raw data files were searched using Byonic (Protein Metrics) against the Swissprot human protein database. Phosphopeptide sequences were confirmed by accurate mass measurement and manual interpretation of MS2 spectra.

                  <p>This was an open-label, pilot, proof-of-concept study to assess phosphopeptide vaccine safety and immunogenicity. It was designed with three arms to assess each phosphopeptide individually before assessing the combination: Arm A, pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> only; Arm B, pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> only; and Arm C, pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> + pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub>. Arms A and B were restricted to patients with stage IIIB–IV melanoma (at original presentation or at recurrence, with or without measurable disease). Once safety was evident for each peptide in these higher-risk patients, Arm C was open for stage IIIB–IV patients and also for patients with lower risk (stage IIA–IIIA) melanoma rendered clinically free of disease by surgery, other therapy or spontaneous remission. Accrual to arm C occurred only after continuation was deemed appropriate in the initial safety phase of arms A and B. Maximum target accrual was set at 21 eligible participants who received a vaccination. Provided safety rules were met, immunogenicity would be assessed for each phosphopeptide in up to 12 evaluable participants total.</p>

                  <p>The study was monitored continuously for treatment-related adverse events. Adverse events were described and coded based on NCI CTCAE v4.03. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any unexpected adverse event that is possibly, probably or definitely related and: (1) ocular ≥grade 1, (2) non-hematologic/non-metabolic ≥Grade 3, or (3) hematologic/metabolic ≥Grade 3. Toxicities with known or likely autoimmune features and affecting vital organs, including colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, uveitis and adrenal insufficiency, were recorded and assessed with special interest. These were considered DLTs if ≥grade 2 and probably or definitely related. Grade 2 autoimmune toxicities involving these organs/tissues were not considered DLTs if only possibly related. Vitiligo was not considered a DLT, but was recorded. Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism was considered a DLT if ≥grade 3. All vaccinated participants were followed for a minimum of 4 weeks for assessment of DLTs.</p>

If that subject did not experience a DLT within 4 weeks, 2 additional participants were accrued. If 0/3 DLTs were observed, then the initial safety criteria for the arm were satisfied; if ≥2/3 participants experienced a DLT, then accrual to that arm would be halted permanently; otherwise three additional participants would be accrued to the arm to assess safety. Accrual to arm C occurred only after the initial safety criteria for arms A and B were satisfied. A maximum of nine participants were accrued in sequential cohorts of 3.

PBMCs were isolated from 80 mL (except 120 mL week 0) using Ficoll gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide/90% serum. Thawed PBMCs were incubated 2 hours at 37°C with 40 µg/mL each of pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>, pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> and pS33-βcat<sub>30-39</sub> (control), washed to remove unbound peptide, and resuspended in medium containing 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-7 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, New Jersey, USA) for 3 days. New medium containing recombinant human IL-7 plus 10 ng/mL IL-15 (Peprotech) was added on days 3, 7 and 10. Cells were assayed on day 14 for IFNγ production by ELISpot assay using methods and criteria described previously.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Briefly, T2-B7 cells were pulsed with each of the three phosphopeptides for each assay date. Negative controls included no peptide, irrelevant peptide (HIV gag peptide restricted by HLA-A2; Atlantic Peptides, LLC, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA), and positive controls included PMA-ionomycin, PHA. Responses were corrected for the fraction of CD8 T-cells in PBMC as determined by flow cytometry of individual samples at culture initiation. T-cell responses were calculated using the following definitions: Nvax=number T-cells responding to vaccine peptide; Nneg=number T-cells responding to maximum negative control; Rvax=Nvax/Nneg. A patient was considered to have a T-cell response to vaccination (binary yes/no), only if all of the following criteria were met: (1) Nvax exceeded Nneg by at least 100 spots/100 000 CD8 cells, (2) (Nvax – 1 SD) ≥ (Nneg +1 SD) and (3) Rvax after vaccination ≥2 x Rvax prevaccine. Prevaccine Rvax values less than one (eg, control counts exceed number of responding T-cells) were set equal to one to indicate no response and to prevent overinflating adjusted fold-increases due to prevaccine ratios less than one or division by zero. Interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated for the response of 2 normal donors to a mixture of viral peptides (CEF peptide pool, Proimmune, Sarasota, Florida, USA): for the high responder, mean number of spots per 1 00 000 cells was 309, and CV was 29%.</p>

                  <p>Since this was a first-in-humans clinical trial with phosphopeptide antigens for cancer, a first goal was to assess safety with a small study. The biological primary endpoint was evidence of immunogenicity. The prespecified level of interest was two or more patients with T-cell responses. Beyond that, CI for the observed proportions would determine how much the data supported immunogenicity. Assuming that the response to one phosphopeptide is not affected by the presence of the other for those in arm C, the immunogenicity of each phosphopeptide was based on the total number of participants vaccinated with the specific phosphopeptide, alone or in combination with the other (ie, Arm A+Arm C for pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>; Arm B+Arm C for pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub>). Based on the upper limit of a one-sided 90% CI, if the upper limit of the observed bound was &gt;35% to any single phosphopeptide, we would conclude that the phosphopeptides was immunogenic and worthy of further study. To define the CD8 T-cell response rate with higher precision would require a much larger sample size, which was not indicated in this first-in-humans trial.</p>

                <p>We previously found that pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> is naturally presented by HLA-A*0201 on cancer cells with high levels of protein, and that it serves as a target for immune mediated tumor control.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Using mass spectrometry, we identified another HLA-A*0201-associated peptide on melanoma cells comprising residues 126–134 of the BCAR3 protein, which was phosphorylated at T130 (pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We evaluated additional melanoma and breast cancer cell lines for expression of the phosphorylated source protein using a commercially available polyclonal BCAR3 antibody and a validated phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 antibody (described in Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 1</xref>). BCAR3 protein expression was quite heterogenous in both melanoma and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A, B</xref>). Nonetheless, phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 was detected in most of the melanoma and breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A–C</xref>). Because of a strong cross-reactive band evident in Western blots, the phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 antibody could not be used for immunohistochemical analysis of human tumor specimens. A survey by mass spectrometry of presented peptides extracted from several HLA-A*0201<sup>+</sup> primary tumor samples failed to identify pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> (Dennis Underwood, Agenus, personal communication). However, the pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> peptide was directly identified by mass spectrometry in naturally presented peptides extracted from 4/5 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples at 1–5 (two tumors) and 6–20 (two tumors) copies per cell (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). It was found at less than one copy per cell on 1/4 normal adjacent tissue samples. In addition, a phosphoproteome analysis identified phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 in 3/105 primary breast cancer samples, while 22/105 of these same samples expressed phosphoS<sub>1100</sub>-IRS2.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> PhosphoS<sub>1100</sub>-IRS2 has also been identified by phosphoproteome analysis in an unspecified fraction of high-grade serous ovarian<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and non-small-cell lung carcinomas,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> 2/4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia isolates and 1/1 primary mantle cell lymphoma.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> These results suggest that the expression of pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> on HLA-A*0201<sup>+</sup> tumors may be limited, although a more comprehensive survey of additional tumor types is warranted, while demonstrating that pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> is expressed broadly and frequently on multiple tumor types.</p>

(A–C) Expression of phosphoT130-BCAR3 and BCAR3 in melanoma (A) and breast cancer (B) cells was evaluated by Western blot using the validated phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 antibody and a commercially available BCAR3 antibody. GAPDH expression served as a loading control, and DM331 melanoma cells were included in both panels for comparison. Data are representative of two (melanoma) and three (breast) independent experiments. (C) Relative expression of phosphoT130-BCAR3 in melanoma and breast cancer cells normalized to the respective GAPDH levels. (D) pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>, pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub>, the non-phosphorylated forms and a control peptide (IP30) were tested for their ability to compete with a radiolabeled peptide derived from hepatitis B core protein for binding to purified HLA-A*0201. The dose required to reduce binding of the radiolabeled peptide by 50% (dotted line) corresponds to the IC<sub>50</sub> value. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (E) Human T-cells from one donor were cultured in 10 microwells containing irradiated stimulators pulsed with pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> or pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub> and evaluated for pBCAR3- or pBCAR3(V)-specific responses in a <sup>51</sup>Cr-release assay after 2 weeks using targets pulsed with either the phosphorylated or unphosphorylated forms of the peptide. Data points represent individual microcultures from one donor. (F) AAD transgenic mice were immunized with BMDC pulsed with pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> or pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub>. Six days later, mice received a boost of phosphopeptide, CpG, and anti-CD40. T-cells were harvested from the spleens and lymph nodes and evaluated for cytokine production after 5 hour incubation with pulsed stimulators. Dot plots are gated on CD8 cells. (G) Mice were immunized with pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub>, and the percentages of CD8 T-cells isolated from them that recognized the immunogen or the parental pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> were determined by intracellular staining for IFNγ.

(H) Melanoma and breast cancer cells expressing endogenous phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 were incubated separately with two independently derived murine pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> specific T-cell lines and the fraction that produced IFNγ quantified by flow cytometry. Data are normalized to % of maximal response that was quantified using stimulators pulsed with 10 µg/mL of pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> (range of maximal response was 70%–85%).

A pBCAR3 peptide modified by substitution of V for L at residue 134, the P9 anchor position, (pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub>) was predicted to have higher affinity for HLA-A*0201 by ANN analysis, but showed no difference in direct binding assays. Both peptides induced antigen specific human T-cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>), while only pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub> was immunogenic in vivo in HLA-A2 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2F</xref>). Nonetheless, all T-cells generated by immunization with pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub> showed complete cross-reactivity with pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> as assessed by quantifying the fraction of IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T-cells after a 5-hour incubation with stimulators pulsed with either the modified or the natural phosphopeptides, and this was maintained over graded doses of the phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2G</xref>).</p>
                <p>We used two T-cell lines generated from pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub>–immunized mice to assess the expression of pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> on human cancer cell lines. Melanoma and breast cancer cell lines that express the phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 protein by Western blot were recognized well by both T-cell lines, and the extent of T-cell recognition varied among the cells, suggesting that the epitope is displayed at varied levels on the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2H</xref>). However, the level of T-cell recognition did not correlate with phosphoT<sub>130</sub>-BCAR3 protein levels by Western blot, suggesting variability in the efficiency of Ag processing and presentation, MHC levels or expression of molecules supporting T-cell recognition might vary among these cells. We also evaluated the ability of pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>-specific T-cell line 1, and murine T-cells specific for another phosphopeptide derived from β-catenin, pS33-βcat<sub>30-39</sub>, to control growth of SLM2 tumors in a xenograft model. Both T-cell populations reduced tumor growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).

                <p>Treatment-related adverse events are detailed for all 15 patients in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>. There were no treatment-related grade 3–4 toxicities, no deaths on study and no DLTs. All patients had grade 1 and 2 adverse events, usually limited to 24–48 hours after each vaccine. All patients developed grade 2 vaccine injection site reactions, which were more persistent and included induration in 13 patients and skin ulceration in 2 patients. Other common treatment-related grade 1 and 2 toxicities were fatigue, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, autoimmune disorders, fever, nausea and diarrhea. Meaningful differences in adverse events among study arms were not evident. Autoimmune toxicities were observed in three patients: two in arm A and one in arm B, and all were grade 1. These were all treatment-associated asymptomatic elevations of serum antinuclear antibody (ANA), and were identified in patients 1A (day 183), 3B (day 85) and 4A (day 85). Three patients had pretreatment elevations of rheumatoid factor (10C) or ANA (7C, 15C). No patients developed treatment-related vitiligo.</p>

                <title>Immune responses to phosphopeptides in vaccinated patients</title>
                <p>All 15 eligible patients were evaluable for immune responses in PBMC. Initial ex vivo ELISpot assays to detect IFNγ production in response to peptide antigen, performed on four patients representing arms A (2A), B (3B) and C (7C, 8C), were negative. Thus, subsequent ELISpot assays were performed after one in vitro sensitization for all patients.</p>
                <p>Two patients had evidence of pre-existing immune responses to phosphopeptides based on a greater than twofold increase, and increase of at least 100 spots/100 000 CD8 cells, compared with the maximum negative control at baseline. Specifically, the ratios and spot counts per 100 000 CD8 cells at baseline were as follows: patient 7, for pIRS2 (2.8x and 373 spots difference); patient 8, for pBCAR3 (2.8x and 137 spots difference) and for pbeta-catenin (which was not in the vaccine, 2.9x and 139 spots difference). Responses to vaccine required increases compared with any pre-existing responses (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary figure 2</xref>). T-cell responses to vaccine peptides were identified against pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> in 2/12 patients (17%, Arms A+C) and against pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> in 5/12 patients (42%, Arms B+C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Overall 6 of 15 patients (40%) had a T-cell response to either or both of these peptides. The majority of immune responses were detected at a single time point, typically at weeks 3, 5 or 8. One patient (#11) also showed an additional immune response at week 26. No responses against the negative control phosphopeptide, pS33-βcat<sub>30-39</sub>, were observed at any time. In addition, responses in arm A and B patients were specific for the vaccinating peptide only. Also, there were indications of subthreshold responses in several patients at other time points that were specific for the same peptide (4A, 8C, 15C). Associations of immune response with autoimmune toxicities were not evident (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). These results give confidence that the significant responses observed are a consequence of vaccination, despite their transience. The study design set a goal for immunogenicity based on an upper limit of a 90% CI for the observed immune response rate of 35%. The values calculated for pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> and pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> were 44% and 68%, respectively, for each peptide (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). These both exceeded the protocol specified upper limit immunogenicity criteria target of &gt;35% supporting further study and development. The prespecified target for immune response rate coincided with 2 or more responses in 12 evaluable patients for each peptide, with greater interest in further development with higher immune response rates.</p>

                    <p>Vaccine-associated increases in immune reactivity to phosphopeptides. Immune responses to phosphopeptides were determined by ELISpot assay of 14 days in vitro stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as outlined in the Methods section. Values are shown for the six patients with immune responses to either or both peptides. Time points with data that meet criteria for an immune response to pBCAR3 or pIRS2 are denoted by asterisks.</p>

              <p>Phosphopeptides function as therapeutic targets for T-cell antitumor immunity, and those that arise from cancer-associated protein phosphorylation represent an entirely new category of cancer neoantigens. We have identified hundreds of phosphopeptides from a wide range of human cancers that are collectively presented by numerous common HLA alleles. An important feature of phosphopeptides is that the phosphate can enhance binding of peptides that would otherwise bind poorly to an MHC-I molecule.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In addition, the phosphate creates an antigenic form that is quite distinct from that of the unphosphorylated peptide,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> based on the presence of the phosphate in the T-cell receptor contact zone and the induction of a distinct MHC-bound peptide conformation.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 33</xref> As a consequence, there is negligible cross-reactivity by phosphopeptide-specific T-cells on the unphosphorylated homolog.</p>
              <p>A first challenge in selecting phosphopeptides for cancer vaccines is to define those that are uniquely presented on the surface of cancer cells, but not on normal cells. We have previously identified pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> as a promising target based on its breadth of expression,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the identification of IRS2 as an oncogene that is overexpressed in multiple human cancers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> The data presented here establish its prevalence in hepatocellular carcinoma. We have also provided new data on another promising phosphopeptide target, pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>. BCAR3 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and mediates both cellular migration and acquisition of resistance to therapeutic antiestrogens in breast cancer cells, processes that are associated with malignancy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Here, we showed that BCAR3 phosphorylated at T130 is expressed in a number of malignanT-cell lines from melanoma as well as breast, that the pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> peptide is immunogenic in humans and mice, and that pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> specific T-cells were able to reduce the outgrowth of of human tumor xenografts. While pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>/BCAR3 phosphorylated at T130 was expressed in a high percentage of tumor cell lines, it was found infrequently among tumors surveyed to date, suggesting limited therapeutic potential. However, it but may be more prevalent on other kinds of tumors that remain to be evaluated. Based on the fact that both peptides are also presented by the widely expressed HLA-A2 molecule, we prioritized them for evaluation as cancer immunotherapeutic candidates.</p>
              <p>Peptide vaccines have generally been found to be very safe,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> but the novelty of phosphopeptides, and the lack of reagents to test for their expression across all normal human tissues, makes it important to assess their safety in humans. Thus, we have performed a first-in-humans evaluation of a vaccine preparation comprised of these two phosphopeptides. Our findings demonstrate safety of vaccination with pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> and pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> phosphopeptides administered with IFA plus polyICLC. Adverse events were mild and comparable to those observed with other vaccines containing IFA. T-cell responses to both peptides met criteria for immunogenicity worthy of further investigation. Limitations of this pBCAR3/pIRS2 vaccine were that the immune responses were not detected ex vivo and they were usually transient, most being detected only at a single time point. Cancer vaccines with other antigens have also induced transient immune responses,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> but a goal of vaccines is to induce more durable responses. We designed the trial such that immune response rates with the upper bound of the 90% CI exceeded 35%. The fraction of patients responding to pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> was 42% (90% CI 18% to 68%), but the fraction responding to pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> was lower at 17% (90% CI 3% to 44%). In two earlier melanoma vaccine trials testing the immunogenicity of 12 peptides that had been previously identified as valid T-cell targets, the range of immune response rates based on ex vivo ELISpot assays for each peptide ranged from 0% to 78% and 7% to 50%, respectively, with the median immune response rates across the 12 peptides of 21% and 13%, respectively.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17</xref> In two trials with data based on ELIspot assays after one in vitro stimulation, those rates ranged from 0% to 75% (median 62%) and 0% to 90% (median 68%), respectively.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> In other work, we have established that both pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> and pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> can be targets of pre-existing immune memory in normal individuals, but the frequency of responders to pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> is higher (Lulu, Cummings and Engelhard, unpublished). That prior finding is supported by evidence of pre-existing immunity to those same peptides in one patient each, as well as pre-existing immunity to a third peptide (not included in the vaccine), from phospho-beta-catenin. While the natural exposure leading to pre-existing immune memory to phosphopeptides is not known, these results could indicate that pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> is inherently more immunogenic. On the other hand, the magnitude of vaccine-induced responses to pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> was comparable to those induced to pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub>. This raises the possibility that patient-specific factors as well as differences in inherent immunogenicity may be factors in limited responses to pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub>.</p>
              <p>An important goal for future investigation is to identify vaccination strategies that enhance the magnitude and persistence of the immune responses. We have found that vaccination with cocktails of peptides can enhance overall immune response rate to 100% even though individual peptides may have lower immune response rates.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Thus, one strategy to enhance the immunologic activity of phosphopeptide vaccines is to create cocktails with additional phosphopeptide antigens, and to vaccinate with peptides modified to enhance MHC binding (eg, pBCAR3(V)<sub>126-134</sub>). Another approach is to optimize the vaccine adjuvants. The TLR3 agonist poly-ICLC has enhanced immune responses to other peptide vaccines, especially when combined with IFA.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In the present trial, the poly-ICLC was not incorporated in the peptide/IFA emulsion, but was administered by separate injection into the same site as the emulsion. In other experience where poly-ICLC enhanced immunogenicity of peptide vaccines containing IFA, poly-ICLC was incorporated in the emulsion.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> Thus, other approaches to enhance the immune responses to phosphopeptides include incorporation of TLR agonists directly in the vaccine emulsion or vaccination in combination with other immune adjuvants, such as agonistic CD40 antibody. The pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> peptide may also be rendered more immunogenic if the C-terminal residue is modified to valine, as per the preliminary data. It is also important to establish whether the transience of responses can be mitigated by the inclusion of checkpoint blockade inhibitors, or other modalities that target immunosuppressive mechanisms.</p>
              <p>While phosphopeptides represent a new class of tumor neoantigens, the vaccine strategies that employ them are also worthy of further investigation. It would be difficult to rely on endogenous kinase activity to phosphorylate proteins expressed via a genetically based vaccine, and at present we expect that phosphopeptide vaccines will remain based on synthetic peptides. It would be useful to explore whether such vaccines might benefit from the use of longer peptides, which have shown promise in other studies,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref> or by coupling them to various lipids or adjuvants.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref> While we presently have no evidence that the phosphate moiety is removed by plasma phosphatases, we have found that MHC binding stabilizes the phosphate against removal by phosphatases in vitro (Obeng <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished). Thus, some consideration to the use of non-hydrolyzable phosphophate analogs is reasonable, although these have frequently been shown to be antigenically distinct.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The availability of preclinical models employing HLA transgenic mice is of particular value in testing these approaches on peptides of human origin prior to incorporating them into clinical trials.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The findings from this clinical trial highlight the safety of vaccination with phosphopeptides arising from oncogenic phosphoproteins. The pIRS2<sub>1097-1105</sub> and pBCAR3<sub>126-134</sub> phosphopeptides are expressed not only by melanomas, but also by several additional kinds of cancer cells. Thus, our results open the door to vaccines using these phosphopeptides for an array of other cancers. Enhancing phosphopeptide immunogenicity with other adjuvant strategies is expected to elevate the promise for this approach, and to increase the prospect for clinical benefit. Phosphopeptides are presented by most MHC-I alleles so far examined, enabling the approach to be exploited to a broad range of patients. In addition, individuals without a clinical diagnosis of cancer often have T-cells that recognize some of these phosphopeptides<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> (Lulu, Cummings and Engelhard, unpublished). An intriguing possibility is that these T-cell responses may arise as a result of successful immune surveillance of early cancers, and it is notable that patients who develop clinical cancers typically have diminished T-cell responses to phosphopeptides.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The presence of T-cell responses to phosphopeptides in otherwise healthy individuals also provides strong evidence that T-cells reactive to those peptides are safe and that induction of such responses in cancer patients will not induce significant autoimmunity to normal tissues. The present findings provide rationale for next generation phosphopeptide vaccines targeting a larger number of antigens presented by a range of MHC-I alleles, and also provide a rationale for adoptive cell therapies targeting these peptides.</p>
