                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This qualitative study was conducted at the Children’s Ward of Jinja Hospital, where children with severe malaria were hospitalized. A total of 22in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of children hospitalized with severe malaria. Issues explored were formulated based on the Partners for Applied Social Sciences (PASS) model, focusing on facilitators and barriersto caregivers’promptseeking and accessing ofappropriate care. The data were coded deductively using ATLAS.ti (version 7.5). Codes were then grouped into families based on emerging themes.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Caregivers’ rating of initial symptoms as mild illness lead to delays in response. Use of home initiated interventions with presumably ineffective herbs or medicines was common, leading to further delay. When care was sought outside the home, drug shops were preferred over public health facilities for reasons of convenience. Drug shops often provided sub-optimal care, and thus contributed to delays in access to appropriate care. Public facilities were often a last resort when illness was perceived to be progressing to severe disease. Further delays occurred at health facilities due to inadequate referral systems.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Communities living in endemic areas need to be sensitized about the significance of fever, even if mild, as an indicator of malaria. Additionally, amidst ongoing efforts at bringing antimalarial treatment services closer to communities, the value of drug shops as providers ofrationalantimalarialtreatment needs to be reviewed.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>For African children with uncomplicated malaria, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends prompt treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) within 24 hours of illness onset as a key strategy for preventing progression to severe malaria [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unlike in the past, when ACTs were scarce and expensive [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], efforts by governments, international organizations, and partner institutions have resulted in increased availability of high quality and affordable ACTs in both the private and public health sectors [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This achievement has likely contributed greatly to reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality in Africa [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, despite increases in ACT coverage rates, the proportion of eligible children receiving ACTs within 24 hours of illness onset remains low [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], partly explaining why hundreds of thousands of children continue to die of malaria each year [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>If malaria control and elimination programs are to succeed, there is a need to ensure maximum treatment effectiveness, characterized by high quality case management and appropriate health seeking behavior by patients or caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown that the delivery of antimalarials may fail at different stages, including at the initiation of treatment at home, or due to health care providers offering ineffective medicines [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For children, caregivers’ response to illness is the first and probably the most important step in determining if treatment is received promptly [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Circumstances surrounding caregivers’ delays in seeking appropriate care are complex [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Knowledge, perception, and beliefs of illness are known to influence the time taken to appraise symptoms, thus influencing response time and potentially leading to delays in seeking care.</p>
              <p>Categorization of fever as a minor ailment by caregivers has been shown to delay response to illness among children with malaria in Tanzania [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Treatment of illness episodes with local remedies and herbs contributes to further delays in seeking appropriate care [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, if care is sought at drug shops, where the quality of care is often sub-optimal [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], delay in receiving appropriate treatment is a likely outcome [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Social networks, including caregiver partners, parents, in-laws, and neighbors involved in negotiating response to illness can also be associated with delays in care [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Understanding caregivers’ health seeking behavior while taking into consideration contextual factors that govern behavior is a prerequisite for formulating policies targeted at optimizing response to illness [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, policy efforts continue to focus on provider factors such as increasing availability of ACTs to communities at risk, while neglecting demand side factors such as how caregivers interpret and respond to symptoms of illness. Sensitizing communities to availability of services and providing classical biomedical descriptions of symptoms of malaria have had little impact on caregivers seeking care promptly [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This situation is likely explained by consideration of care seeking as a linear pathway, neglecting social and environmental contexts that govern individual behavior and response types which shape pathways to care[<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Utilizing interviews with caregivers of children who presented with severe malaria in Jinja, Uganda, we explored the social and environmental constraints that shape when and how caregivers respond to illness, and sought to explain delays in accessing appropriate treatment for malaria.</p>
              <sec id="sec006">
                <title>Research team</title>
                <p>A social scientist with undergraduate and postgraduate training in social science, and epidemiology, respectively led all interviews. The lead interviewer is female and has experience spanning a period of 10 years, working as a coordinator on several qualitative studies [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A member of the local hospital staff, who was well accustomed with local language, culture, and social norms of the locals recruited patients, explaining to respondents reasons for conducting the study, introducing the interviewer and when applicable translating and responses. At the time of conducting interviews, the interview team was aware of the main findings of the primary study. Prior to conducting the interview, the interview team introduced themselves to the study participants highlighting, who they were, and where they came from. Additionally, they explained the purpose of the interview to study participants.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This was a qualitative study, linked to a study of determinants of severe malaria in children, in which delay in seeking appropriate care was found to be a strong risk factor for severe malaria [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Caregivers of children hospitalized with severe malaria were interviewed to explore how their social and environmental contexts influenced when and how they responded to illness. We explored motivations for caregivers’ actions in response to illness, explaining delays in seeking and accessing appropriate treatment for their children. Our approach was mainly deductive in nature, driven by the hypothesis that delay in seeking appropriate care was a risk factor for severe malaria.</p>

                <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                <p>To explore contextual factors, this study drew on the Partners for Applied Social Sciences (PASS) model [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The model is built on the backbone ofa pathway model, focusing on factors involved ineach step of the pathway to care that hinder or facilitate prompt seeking or access to appropriate care. Factors in the model are grouped into four main categories: 1) illnessperception and explanatory models; 2) social values; 3) access tocare and resource seeking; and 4) medicalpluralism [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Considering social and environmental contexts, we explored how these factors contributed to caregiver delays in seeking appropriate care for children with malaria.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>The study was conducted in the catchment area of the Children’s Ward of Jinja Regional Referral Hospital, which includes 10 districts located in the Busoga sub-region, with a few patients also coming from two districts located in the Buganda region [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Malaria transmission in the sub-region is considered hypo to hyper endemic [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In 2016, the malaria parasite prevalence rate among children in the Busoga sub-region was 53.1% based on an HRP2-basedrapid diagnostic test [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The economic base for 53% of the local people is subsistence-oriented farming [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with some villagers engaging in small-scale business such as operating small roadside shops. The Busoga region has 42.0% of the population living in poverty and is known to suffer from famine [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], malnutrition, very high infant mortality rates, and rampant jigger epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Literacy levels are low, with 56.1% and 43.8% of male and female heads of households being literate. The Early Childhood Development Index, a composite measure of the developmental status of children, was reported to be 55.5% in the region, the lowest value reported in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
                <p>The local health arena in Busoga is pluralistic, with access to traditional medicine and biomedicines at both public and private facilities [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The region has public health facilities ranging from level II to level IV health centers, district hospitals and a regional referral hospital. The average distance between level III (and above) health facilities and households is &lt; 5 km [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Services rendered at public facilities are plagued by staff absenteeism and frequent stock outs of essential medicines [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Drug shops, though popular, often offer substandard services [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Initiatives at improving quality of services at drug shops have been implemented in the region, with reported success [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

                <title>Sampling</title>
                <p>Sampling was purposive and research participants were selected based on gender, relation to the child, age, time taken to seek care, and form of severe malaria. Maximum variation in the selection of respondents ensured that different social groups were represented, including consideration of employment and socio-economic status. The study team approached eligible respondents during hospitalization at Jinja Children’s Hospital. Respondents were purposively included in the sampling frame.</p>

                <p>Interviews with caregivers were conducted privately during the recovery period of the child’s hospitalization either in the hospital gardens or in one of the study offices, depending on the respondent’s choice. Both venues offered privacy, with minimum interruption. For all 22-interview sessions, no one other than the child’s primary caregiver and interviewers were present.</p>

                <p>An interview guide was developed (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217262.s001">S1 Appendix</xref></bold>) based on key themes agreed upon by the study team based on observations noted during the primary study. The interview guide was pilot tested and modified by the lead interviewer, improving on sequencing of questions. Interviews lasted less than 2 hours and were conducted in the local language. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed in the language in which they were conducted before translation into English by an experienced interviewer. The interviewer did not repeat any of the interviews, nor were transcribed interviews returned to study participants for comment and correction. Additionally, upon completion of each interview, the interviewer noted a summary of key observations during the interview. Patient responses were categorized into three phases: 1) illness recognition, 2) response to illness and 3) actions.</p>

                <title>Definition of terms</title>
                <p>Delay was defined as a prolonged interval (typically &gt;24 hours) between illness onset and commencement of appropriate treatment. Illness recognition was defined as the caregivers’ appraisal of symptoms as a sign of illness. Response was defined as the caregiver acknowledging the need to intervene upon the child’s illness. Caregivers’ actions were defined as the measures taken in response to illness. Individuals who provided advice to the caregiver in terms of how to respond to the child’s illness were referred to as the therapeutic management group[<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The primary caregiver was the person who was with the child right from onset to presentation to hospital.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Analysis of data was deductive in nature, informed by preliminary findings of the primary study that identified delayed seeking of care and seeking care at drug shops as potent risk factors for severe malaria [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon completion of the primary study, findings were presented to a panel of experts, including pediatricians, social scientists, and medical anthropologists, during which themes worthy exploration were formulated. Individual transcripts were entered into ATLAS.ti. Version 7.5.18 (Atlas.ti. GmbH, Berlin Parts), and coded (a code was a word or short phrase that symbolically assigned meaning to a portion of language in the data) by the lead investigator of the study under the supervision of a medical anthropologist using a mixed approach of both open and closed coding based on pre–defined criteria. Related codes were categorized into families’ representative of different themes informed by the findings of the quantitative study [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These themes formed the basis of the write-up and discussion. Participants were not involved nor consulted for opinion on themes.</p>

                <p>We interviewed 22 caregivers, each with a child hospitalized with severe malaria at the Children’s Ward of Jinja Regional Referral Hospital during the months of February and March 2016.The majority of the caregivers were mothers (15, 68.2%), with grandmothers (3, 13.6%), fathers (2, 9.1%), aunts (2, 4.5%), and stepmothers (1, 4.5%) accounting for the others. The average age of caregivers’ was 31 years (range 18 to 48years). Most (68%) caregivers were primarily engaged in subsistence farming, with occasional selling of excess food (<xref rid="pone.0217262.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Caregivers explained that the interpretation of the child’s illness sometimes involved other members of the family. Caregivers living with parents or mothers-in-law for example explained that they felt obliged to seek advice from them. Others consulted included fathers, grandparents, neighbors, and friends. The process of consultation itself caused delays. In some cases the symptoms were perceived to be because of witchcraft or other ailments and so herbal medicines were prescribed in place of conventional medicines, thus contributing to delays (Quote A309).</p>

                <p>At home, caregivers often initiated treatment with a combination of herbs and conventional medicines. This was often followed by a waiting period in anticipation of recovery following use of these medicines. This contributed to delays in seeking appropriate care. Conventional medicines provided included panadol, oral antibiotics, and antimalarials, often purchased from drug shops, or left over from treatment of a previous illness episode (Quotes A307).</p>

                <p>While public health facilities were reported to promptly refer patients, caregivers had to arrange for transport to the next level. This contributed to delays in accessing appropriate care (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217262.s003">S3 Appendix</xref></bold>). Overall, multiple processes contributed to delays in access to appropriate care for children that were eventually diagnosed with severe malaria.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We studied contexts that contributed to delays in appropriate care for children who eventually developed severe malaria. Consistent with previous reports[<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], mild fevers led to delays in response. Caregivers responded to what they perceived as mild illness with ineffective home interventions. When care was sought outside the home, drug shops were preferred over public facilities, but because the care was often sub-optimal, there was delay in accessing appropriate treatment.</p>
              <p>Caregivers ably explained the cause of malaria and were aware of the common manifestations of severe malaria; appreciating the fact, that malaria could cause death. However, their understanding did not appear to have a bearing on how they responded to illness and on the time to seek appropriate care, suggesting that response were influenced by other factors, such as the contexts within which they lived [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Caregivers’ perceptions of illness as mild based on low fever has been reported in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], possibly explained by the subtle, non-specific and irregular nature of initial symptoms of most malaria episodes [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In such circumstances, caregivers may feel that a child’s illness is benign, thus opting to observe or provide simple, ineffective home remedies [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], contributing to delay in seeking appropriate care for malaria. Home remedies may suffice for common childhood viral infections, which are often self-limiting [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but slow response to malaria is dangerous, as established infection can rapidly progress to severe disease [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
              <p>Consultations with family members and neighbors were also a common cause of delay. Advice given was often using of herbs, contributing to delays in seeking appropriate care [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Culturally, grandmothers and mothers-in-law, particularly if paternal, hold a dominant position, to the extent that caregivers are obliged to follow advice, even if they disagree [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Fathers were consulted, often times for financial support. However, in contrast to previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], involvement of fathers did not notably contribute to delays in care. Some caregivers reported having autonomy to make decisions in the absence of fathers or when dealing with an uncooperative father, demonstrating empowerment of some mothers [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>Outside homes, drug shops were the preferred choice of care, a finding consistent with results of other studies in the region [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Drug shops have proliferated in both rural and urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As reported previously, short distance from home, lower cost of obtaining care compared to health centers, short waiting times, and ease of accessing medicines were reasons for preference of drug shops [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, caregivers sought care at drug shops for symptoms deemed mild and not serious, suggesting that they were aware of the shortcomings of these shops. The popularity of drug shops offers an opportunity for promoting timely access to appropriate antimalarial treatment [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, limitations of drug shops, including lack of provider knowledge on management of malaria [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], poor referral practices [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], lack of diagnostic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and profit driven behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], remain major hurdles. Programs directed at improving services at drug shops have yielded mixed results [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Publications from the ACT Watch group, a multi-country research project designed to fill evidence gaps in malaria treatment [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggest that despite efforts to improve care, appropriateness of antimalarial treatment at drug shops remains sub-optimal [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In Tanzania, the Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlet program for regulating and training drug shops to provide affordable and quality medicines was successful in promoting appropriate antimalarial treatment [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, sustaining gains has proven to be a problem [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], with reports indicating providers returning to poor dispensing practices [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Rapid Diagnostic Tests have been introduced at drugs shops to rationalize use of antimalarials, but amidst resistance from providers given the desire to profit through the sale of anti-malarial treatments, and from caregivers due to high costs [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p>
              <p>What is the best approach for improving delivery of health services amidst constraints of the public health system and the popular private sector? One approach is to strengthen the public health system which, despite its challenges [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], has the infrastructure and human resources for effective delivery of health services [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Beyond focusing on patient care, efforts should to be directed at improving hospitality services at public facilities. Studies in Uganda and Malawi have shown that abusive and disrespectful health workers were barriers to accessing care at public facilities [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This may partly explain why caregivers initially seek care at drug shops, whose hospitability services are likely far better due to the need to maintain customers [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Strengthening the quality of services at drug shops is an alternative option. However, achieving quality services at drug shops is limited by multiple challenges including sub-optimal drug dosing, use of medicines not in national treatment guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], limited diagnostic capacity and inconsistent referral practices [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and the desire for profits [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Additionally, despite laws that provide for standards of operations, many drug shops operate illegally [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], with poor quality of health services [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], including inappropriate provision of parenteral artesunate [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. This situation calls for policymakers to embark on programs of action to empower and strengthen regulatory frameworks and instruments in relation to drug shops [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p>
              <p>Regardless of limitations, policy makers must acknowledge that drug shops are a popular point of care and can be mobilized to treat acute febrile illnesses among rural populations. In Tanzania [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] interventions including provision of subsidized packs of pediatric ACT to retail outlets, training of retail outlet staff, and community awareness activities resulted in significant increases in ACT coverage for reported fevers. In-appropriate use of antimalarials by drug shops remains a concern. However, provision of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in the private sector could minimize this problem as was demonstrated in a study in Ghana [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], where introduction of RDTs resulted in reduced dispensing of antimalarial to patients without malaria, and did not reduce prescribing of antimalarials to true malaria cases. Additionally, by applying principles of commercial marketing to social health problems, drug shops have the potential to serve as an effective mechanism for promoting socially beneficial behavior change [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Also banning drug shops because of poor quality of care concerns may run them underground, causing more harm than good. Key is finding the right balance, supporting drug shops to provide much needed services, but maintaining acceptable standards of care.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we report on delays in seeking appropriate care by caregivers of children eventually diagnosed with severe malaria. Lack of action for perceived mild fever contributed to delays in care. Social networks including grandmothers and mothers-in-law, whose influence often resulted in inappropriate treatment options, led to further delays. Despite the opportunity, drug shops have been shown to contribute to delay in seeking appropriate care [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], possibly explained by providing inappropriate care. Unfortunately, caregivers often sought care at public health facilities only when interventions at home or at drug shops had failed and illness had progressed from mild to severe. To address these gaps, there is need for a multipronged approach, starting with prioritization of health education programs sensitizing communities living in endemic areas, not only on recognition of symptoms of malaria, but emphasizing the significance of fever, irrespective of grade as an indicator of malaria [<xref rid="pone.0217262.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For drug shops, there is need to define the role ofdrug shops in providing care to sick children in sub-Saharan Africa. Once defined, shop attendants should be trained and regulated to operate appropriately. For the public health sector, governments and partners need to direct efforts towards improving quality of hospitality services, a neglected area deserving attention.</p>
