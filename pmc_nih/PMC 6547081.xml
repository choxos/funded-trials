                  <p>In a cohort study of 1269 toddlers with and without autism spectrum disorder who received their first diagnostic evaluation between 12 and 36 months, overall stability of an autism spectrum diagnosis was 0.84, which was higher than in other groups.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Universal early screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in primary care is becoming increasingly common and is believed to be a pivotal step toward early treatment. However, the diagnostic stability of ASD in large cohorts from the general population, particularly in those younger than 18 months, is unknown. Changes in the phenotypic expression of ASD across early development compared with toddlers with other delays are also unknown.</p>

                  <p>Among the 1269 toddlers included in the study (918 [72.3%] male; median age at first evaluation, 17.6 months [interquartile range, 14.0-24.4 months]; median age at final evaluation, 36.2 months [interquartile range, 33.4-40.9 months]), the overall diagnostic stability for ASD was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87), which was higher than any other diagnostic group. Only 7 toddlers (1.8%) initially considered to have ASD transitioned into a final diagnosis of typical development. Diagnostic stability of ASD within the youngest age band (12-13 months) was lowest at 0.50 (95% CI, 0.32-0.69) but increased to 0.79 by 14 months and 0.83 by 16 months (age bands of 12 vs 14 and 16 years; odds ratio, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.59-11.74). A total of 105 toddlers (23.8%) were not designated as having ASD at their first visit but were identified at a later visit.</p>

                  <p>The findings suggest that an ASD diagnosis becomes stable starting at 14 months of age and overall is more stable than other diagnostic categories, including language or developmental delay. After a toddler is identified as having ASD, there may be a low chance that he or she will test within typical levels at 3 years of age. This finding opens the opportunity to test the impact of very early-age treatment of ASD.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common disorder of childhood, affecting 1 in 59 children.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It is also becoming clear that ASD has its beginnings during prenatal life.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Because many children with ASD have clinical signs within the first year, such as failure to respond to their name<sup><xref rid="poi190014r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and reduced positive affect,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> there is a considerable demand for early detection, intervention, and services.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although several studies have shown that early signs of ASD can sometimes be detected using parent report screens as early as 12<sup><xref rid="poi190014r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> or 18 months of age,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> the mean patient age at ASD detection is several years later, generally between 3 and 4 years of age.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This late age of detection is a missed opportunity given the accelerated pace of brain development that occurs between birth and 3 to 4 years of age.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Despite the appeal of the concept of early detection and treatment in ASD, there are many unknowns. Foundational questions regarding early-age diagnostic stability, age of clinical symptom onset, and overlap of early-age clinical symptoms between ASD and other disorders, such as language delay or global developmental delay, remain unanswered. A previous report<sup><xref rid="poi190014r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> by the US Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse early universal screening for ASD given the lack of clarity regarding the balance of benefits and harms of early screening and detection.</p>
              <p>The months surrounding the first birthday are a remarkable time for a toddler’s development. At this age, toddlers learn to walk,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> speak their first word,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and engage in a range of joint social attention behaviors, such as pointing and showing objects to others to share social attentional focus.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The toddler stage is also the earliest age that ASD can be detected and treatment started,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> yet the stability of an ASD diagnosis at this pivotal age is unknown.</p>
              <p>A previous report<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> stated that most studies examining the diagnostic stability of ASD before 3 years of age have involved slightly older, clinic-referred cohorts, usually at approximately 2 years of age. Stability coefficients within these studies have been high (mean, 88%, range, 63%-100%).<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Two studies examined stability at an even younger age (18 months) but examined this question from within multiplex families using the infant sibling design. One of these studies reported that 93% of siblings first diagnosed as having ASD at 18 months retained that diagnosis at a final diagnostic age of 36 months,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> but only 69% of siblings first diagnosed as having ASD at 24 months did so (ie, 27 of 39 retained diagnosis).<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Although studies collectively suggest that an ASD diagnosis is moderately stable at young ages,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> there are several key questions remaining. First, it is unclear whether stability estimates from infant sibling designs would be found within a general population cohort. Second, none of the previous clinic-referred cohort studies included large groups of toddlers without ASD ascertained in the same manner as the toddlers with ASD. Such contrast groups are essential to understand how the ASD phenotype emerges from and overlaps with clinical expressions from other diagnostic groups, such as language and developmental delay, commonly found in clinical settings. Third, clinic-referred studies are small, usually containing 50 to 100 participants, and may generate less stable results. Moreover, children referred to a clinic because of already suspected ASD may generate artificially high stability rates relative to a community-ascertained sample.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Fourth, despite the potential of the infant sibling design to study ASD from birth, stability estimates have only been reported starting at 18 months of age, leaving questions surrounding younger ages unanswered.</p>
              <p>Interleaved with these gaps in knowledge is the recent finding from infant sibling studies<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> that 50% to 80% of toddlers eventually diagnosed as having ASD at 3 years of age were not identified as having ASD by expert clinicians at 18 months of age. In short, despite extensive clinical testing that included the gold standard tool the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS),<sup><xref rid="poi190014r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> these diagnoses were missed. A newer study,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> however, suggests that such so-called late-onset cases may be attributable to weaknesses inherent in standardized diagnostic tools at early ages, rather than a lack of observable ASD symptoms per se. Determining the degree to which such late-onset cases may be present in a general population cohort is essential, because if rates are as high as in infant sibling cohorts, it would strongly underscore the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for repeat screening at multiple ages. It would also add further urgency to the search for early behavioral or biological tests for ASD to more readily detect ASD during the earliest ages when detection is the most challenging. In this study, we sought to examine the diagnostic stability of ASD in a large cohort of toddlers starting at 12 months of age and to compare this stability with that of toddlers with other disorders, such as developmental delay.</p>

                  <title>Diagnostic Stability</title>
                  <p>Stability coefficients were first calculated within 2-month age bands by determining the proportion of toddlers with a particular diagnosis at their first diagnostic visit who retained that same diagnosis at their last visit. Diagnostic transition tables were created for overall and 2-month–interval age-binned data. Diagnostic stability was modeled using logistic regression, with sex, age at first diagnosis, interval between first and last diagnosis, and diagnostic group at first visit as variables and results reported as odds ratios (ORs) (eTable 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI190014-1-s">Supplement</xref>). To examine the association of age at first diagnosis with stability coefficients while optimizing statistical power, we binned age to 4 roughly equally populated groups: younger than 14 months, 14 to 17.99 months, 18 to 23.99 months, 24 months or older. No significant association between sex or interval with stability coefficients was found. Follow-up models with the 4 age bins as the only covariates were used to examine the association of age at first diagnosis with stability coefficients within each diagnostic group. A B-spline method with 3 <italic>df</italic> was also used to test the nonlinear, continuous association of age at first diagnosis with stability coefficients within each diagnosis group and to visualize the data. All analyses were performed in the R programming environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) (eMethods in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI190014-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Given caution from the ADOS developers regarding use of the ADOS with toddlers with nonverbal mental ages younger than 12 months and those who are not ambulatory,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> stability coefficients were also recalculated after removing such cases.</p>

                  <p>To visualize how phenotypic expression of ASD and other disorders changed across visits, diagnostic heat maps were generated using the ggplot library in R software. With the use of this approach, diagnostic judgments were illustrated inward out from first diagnosis to the final diagnosis, and each diagnostic judgment was assigned a unique color. In this way, transition patterns across diagnosis visits could be visually deciphered.</p>

                  <p>For comparison with infant sibling diagnostic stability studies, the ASD cohort was categorized as having an early-age persistent ASD diagnosis, which was defined as an ASD diagnosis at or before 18 months of age that was retained at final diagnosis; middle-age persistent ASD diagnosis, which was defined as an ASD diagnosis after 18 months of age that was retained at final diagnosis; and late-identified ASD, which was defined as ASD not diagnosed at first diagnostic visit regardless of intake age. The 270 toddlers who were initially identified as having TD and retained this diagnosis at final diagnostic age were used as a contrast cohort. One-way analyses of variance with follow-up planned contrasts and Cohen <italic>d</italic> were used to examine clinical differences. Expanded comparisons that included all diagnostic groups were also conducted (eFigure 3 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI190014-1-s">Supplement</xref>).</p>

Stability coefficients are denoted within each cell (coefficients are not adjusted for the age at first diagnosis; a high concordance with age-adjusted coefficients was observed) (eTable 4 in the Supplement gives coefficients adjusted for age at first diagnosis). To read the table, compare values across each row or vertically within each column. For example, of the 400 toddlers initially designated as having autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 336 retained this diagnosis at their last (final) diagnostic visit, yielding a diagnostic stability coefficient of 0.84, whereas 35 toddlers had ASD features but no longer met ASD criteria, 6 tested as developmentally delayed, 6 as language delayed, 10 had other developmental issues, and 7 were designated as typically developing with no residual symptoms. For transition tables with stability coefficients within 2-month age bands, see eFigure 4 in the Supplement. B, Changes in diagnosis across visits. Colors represent each diagnostic group and rings represent each diagnostic visit, with the smallest center ring representing the first visit. The left-most panel summarizes diagnostic changes for toddlers who received 2 diagnostic evaluations a mean of 15 months apart; the center represents toddlers who received 3 diagnostic evaluations a mean of 11 months apart; and the right-most panel represents toddlers who received 4 or more diagnostic evaluations a mean of 8 months apart. The heat map indicates that ASD was the most stable diagnostic category, and that toddlers initially suspected as having developmental delay (DD) or language delay (LD) frequently received a final diagnosis of ASD. TD indicates typical development.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Children with ASD are detected and treated nationally at approximately 4 years of age.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, we found that within the context of an early detection program,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> children can be reliably diagnosed with ASD several years earlier, as young as 14 months. The implications of this finding extend beyond information that relates to diagnostic stability and may open new opportunities to consider if and how treatments started at this early age are associated with long-term outcomes of affected children.</p>
              <p>An initial ASD diagnosis was more stable than any other diagnosis, including TD. In our cohort, 84% of toddlers initially diagnosed with ASD at their first visit retained this diagnosis at 3 to 4 years of age. Most toddlers within the remaining 16% did not lose their delays entirely but instead presented with milder delays at their final diagnostic visit. The most common transition was ASD to ASD features, a diagnostic category used for toddlers with signs of ASD but not enough to meet <italic>DSM</italic> criteria. The least common transition was ASD to TD (ie, only 1.8% of toddlers initially designated as having ASD transitioned to TD). Because all toddlers were immediately referred for treatment once any delay was detected, improvements in symptom severity could have been associated with a positive impact of very early treatment, which research suggests may be more beneficial than treatment started at older ages.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> From a public policy perspective, this finding suggests that it is important to initiate treatment immediately after an initial designation of ASD, even at the youngest ages. The human brain has an enormous capacity to resculpt and remodel, particularly during the first postnatal years. The few studies that have examined treatment during this transformative time window have found that toddlers with ASD,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> cerebral palsy,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> premature birth,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and severe hearing loss<sup><xref rid="poi190014r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> experience significant positive changes, such as an increase in 15 IQ points<sup><xref rid="poi190014r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> or improvements in speech perception and language ability.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The caveat, however, is that early-age diagnostic evaluations should be conducted by practitioners with considerable experience in early ASD development. In many places in the United States, such experience is severely lacking.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although the overall stability of an ASD diagnosis was high, examination of the data within 2-month age bands revealed that stability was selectively low at 12 months, with a stability coefficient of 0.50. The lower stability coefficient for ASD specifically at 12 months is likely reflective of some limitations in the diagnostic tools used at that age, which included the ADOS-2 and <italic>DSM</italic>. In the first diagnosis ASD sample, which contained 400 toddlers, only 7 transitioned to a final diagnosis of TD, and 5 of these were within the 12-month age band. Research from the ADOS-2 developers cautions that it is not valid for use with toddlers who have a nonverbal mental age younger than 12 months,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> yet even when such toddlers were removed from analyses, the stability coefficient did not improve. Twelve months is an age when toddlers learn to talk, walk, merge, and shift attention with objects and others, and it is not surprising that this age would be the most diagnostically challenging. When toddlers with ASD features were included in the calculation at 12, 14, and 16 months of age, stability coefficients increased to 0.70 at 12 months, 0.85 at 14 months, and 0.94 at 16 months. This finding is likely related to the possibility that ASD is a dimensional rather than categorical disorder<sup><xref rid="poi190014r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and the strict cutoff boundaries defined by the <italic>DSM</italic> may artificially affect results.</p>
              <p>Our study also found that toddlers diagnosed as having an LD at their first visit overwhelmingly transitioned into testing within the typical range by 3 to 4 years of age. Such transient LD cases have been commonly noted in the literature.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Toddlers who exhibited an LD were referred for immediate treatment and generally received 1 to 2 hours per week of speech therapy. Our study was not designed to determine whether such early treatments affected the speed with which toddlers caught up by the time they reached final diagnosis age. Another possibility is that the psychometric test that we used (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) may be less reliable at very young ages.</p>
              <p>The importance of understanding ASD diagnostic stability in a general population, community-ascertained cohort should not be underestimated, particularly when early screening starting at 18 months is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> yet most screening studies<sup><xref rid="poi190014r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> validate diagnoses only once, usually at approximately the age of screening, leaving unclear the degree to which an initial diagnosis persists at later ages. Although this was not a screening study and the cohort contained approximately 25% community-referred cases, most of the ASD cases were detected using a broadband screening tool, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Infant-Toddler Checklist,<sup><xref rid="poi190014r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> administered at well-child visits.</p>
              <p>In this study, with a sample size of 1269 toddlers from the general population, each with multiple evaluation visits, generating a total of more than 3000 evaluation visits, we found that 105 (23.8%) who ultimately received a diagnosis of ASD at 3 to 4 years initially had ASD missed at their first evaluation visit. This percentage is substantially lower than the 50% to 80% late-identified ASD cases reported in infant sibling studies.<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="poi190014r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Among the patients with late-identified ASD, 45 (42.8%) were initially suspected of having only an LD. That is, practitioners focused on a child’s delays in language rather than subclinical social delays. This finding is consistent with an infant sibling study<sup><xref rid="poi190014r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> that reported lower-than-expected language scores on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning test within their late-identified group.</p>
              <sec id="H2-8-POI190014">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>One limitation to our study was that the practitioners who made the final diagnoses were not masked to previous diagnoses. This lack of masking was because <italic>DSM-5</italic> procedures and criteria require consideration of historical information regarding ASD symptoms. Although unlikely, it is possible that review of this information could have biased psychologists in favor of increased diagnostic stability. Evidence counter to this point is the relatively weak diagnostic stability found in other delay groups.</p>
