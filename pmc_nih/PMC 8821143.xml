                <p id="P2">The desire to engage in waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) may occur when smokers and nonsmokers conjure positive mental simulations of WTS. However, effects of these simulations on desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco and potential mediators are unexplored. This research addressed these effects among young adult waterpipe tobacco smokers and nonsmokers. Two online studies were conducted with adults ages 18–30. In Study 1, 200 smokers, 190 susceptible nonsmokers, and 182 nonsusceptible nonsmokers were randomized to mentally simulate or not WTS in the future. In Study 2, 234 smokers and 241 susceptible nonsmokers were randomized to four arms: no simulation or simulations that varied valence of experience (positive, negative or no valence provided). Main outcomes were immediate desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco, cognitive and affective attitudes, and perceived harms. In Study 1, mental simulations increased the desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco among smokers. In Study 2, asking participants to simulate WTS positively or with no valence instruction increased desire to smoke relative to negative valence instruction or no simulation. Negative simulations reduced perceived probability of smoking within a month compared to positive simulations. Effects on desire to engage in WTS were mediated by cognitive and affective attitudes among susceptible nonsmokers and by cognitive attitudes among smokers. These findings suggest that exploring when and how often mental simulations about WTS are evoked and their potency for promoting prevention and cessation of WTS merit further attention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P3">In the US, waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) is a public health concern due to WTS-related health risks such as poorer pulmonary function, heart disease, and cancer (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Akl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Mamtani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Montazeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Raad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Rezk-Hanna &amp; Benowitz, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Waziry et al., 2017</xref>). Many psychological (e.g., positive attitudes, low perceived harms), social (e.g., norms, friends/family influence), cultural, and marketing (e.g., enticing advertisements, limited health warnings) influences have contributed to WTS appeal and spread, especially among young adults (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Akl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2017</xref>). Nationally in 2017, about 7% of 18–24 year olds engaged in WTS during the last 30 days (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">United States Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Tobacco Products, 2018</xref>); in some states, close to 19% of college educated 20–28 year olds smoked during the last 30 days (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Loukas et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, many young adults who do not engage in WTS are open to trying it; that is, they are susceptible.Among college students, 27% to 51% are susceptible (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Lipkus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Nuzzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Roberts &amp; Ferketich, 2020</xref>). In a nationally representative sample, 22% of young adults ages 18–30 were susceptible to WTS (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Sidani et al., 2017</xref>). Of concern, susceptible individuals are more likely to initiate WTS (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Lipkus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Sidani et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, there is limited evidence for interventions to prevent WTS or enhance cessation in young adults (for reviews, see <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Jawad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Maziak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Sadeghi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P4">A factor that has not been explored in relation to WTS is smokers’ and nonsmokers’ mental simulations of engaging in future WTS. Humans spend considerable time contemplating the future and make plans accordingly to achieve desired and avoid undesired outcomes (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>). These efforts often involve mentally simulating scenarios depicting possible future actions and corresponding outcomes. Episodic future thinking—that is, mental simulations of possible future events (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2015</xref>)—has been shown to influence pro-social attitudes (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Gaesser &amp; Schacter, 2014</xref>), emotion regulation (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Miloyan et al., 2016</xref>), and prospective memory (i.e., our ability to remember carrying out an intended action (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Neroni et al., 2014</xref>), among other processes. Relatedly, and critical for the purpose of the current studies, episodic future thinking can influence decision-making, such as attenuating temporal discounting in decisions involving money (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Peters &amp; Büchel, 2010</xref>), and reducing calorie intake (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Dassen et al., 2016</xref>), alcohol consumption (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Snider et al., 2016</xref>), and cigarette smoking (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P5">While it remains unclear how decisions to engage in WTS occur, mental simulations likely affect these decisions via deliberate and impulsive (i.e., experiential) processes. For example, deliberative processes that increase probability of use can include simulations of planned future waterpipe tobacco in enjoyable social situations, using appealing flavored tobacco, and when and where to smoke (e.g., a favored waterpipe tobacco establishment, home). Further, mental simulations of WTS are hypothesized to occur spontaneously by reflecting on past WTS experiences, environmental exposures about WTS, such as product advertisements and/or passing waterpipe tobacco establishments, as well as conversations the ensue on the topic in person or social media. In sum, mental simulations of WTS, triggered various ways, can increase the decision to engage in and use the product.</p>
              <p id="P6">The extent to which imagery during episodic future thinking can influence intention to engage in WTS and potential mediators for this effect are unknown. For example,many young adults believe WTS is not harmful or addictive (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Akl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cornacchione et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hair et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2013</xref>). These risk perceptions are associated with waterpipe use (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Akl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Eissenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hair et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Primack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Sutfin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Villanti et al., 2015</xref>) and may be a potent reason why susceptible young adults experiment with WTS. Mental images about a health risk have been linked with risk perceptions as well as risk-related intentions and actions (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Cameron, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Slovic et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Traczyk et al., 2015</xref>). In experimental studies, manipulations that induce mental images of harms of risky behaviors increase perceived risk (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Sobkow et al., 2016</xref>) and reduce risk-related intentions and behaviors (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P7">Mental simulations that lower perceived harms or create mental images involving positive experiences of future WTS may increase favorable cognitive and affective attitudes toward WTS (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Mays et al., 2020</xref>). For example, according to the affect heuristic, lower perceived risks are associated with more positive attitudes toward the target of focus (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Slovic et al., 2005</xref>). To the degree that mental simulations of future WTS entail positive thoughts, feelings, and sensory experiences (e.g., taste, smells), smokers and nonsmokers are expected to report lower perceived harms and more favorable cognitive (e.g., safe, useful) and affective (e.g., pleasant, satisfying) attitudes toward WTS (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Trafimow &amp; Sheeran, 1998</xref>). In turn, lower perceived risk and positive attitudes should correlate with a stronger desire to engage in WTS.</p>
              <p id="P8">Mental simulations’ influence on attitudes, risk perceptions, and intentions is expected to be stronger among waterpipe tobacco smokers than among susceptible or nonsusceptible nonsmokers for the following reasons. According to the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Schacter &amp; Addis, 2007</xref>), individuals use information stored in episodic memory to construct mental simulations of possible future events. When experienced events closely resemble those imagined, the clarity and vividness of the imagined event is stronger (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">De Brigard &amp; Giovanello, 2012</xref>), and there is more overlap with neural regions engaged in episodic memory encoding and retrieval (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Papies et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2015</xref>). Given these processes, smokers’ mental simulations of WTS are expected to align with their assumed positive experiences of using the product and thus should promote stronger intentions and greater actual product use compared to WTS imagery in nonsmokers.</p>
              <sec id="S2">
                <title>Present research</title>
                <p id="P9">In two online experimental studies, we examined how simulations influence perceived harms, attitudes toward, and desire to engage in WTS among waterpipe smokers and nonsmokers. The purpose of Study 1 was twofold. First, based on the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis, we examined as proof of concept whether smokers’ simulated experiences of WTS are more positive (e.g., more favorable thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations) and align more closely with their anticipated future experiences of WTS than susceptible and nonsusceptible nonsmokers. Second, we tested the following interaction hypotheses:
<list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P10">Smokers and susceptible nonsmokers in the mental simulation arm will report more positive cognitive and affective attitudes as well as lower perceived harm of WTS compared to their counterparts in the control arm; nonsusceptible nonsmokers in the mental simulation arm will report more negative cognitive and affective attitudes as well as more harm about WTS compared to the control arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P11">Smokers and susceptible nonsmokers in the mental simulation arm will express a stronger desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco compared to their counterparts in the control arm; nonsusceptible nonsmokers in the mental simulation arm will report a lower desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco compared to participants in the control arm.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="P12">We examined further whether the positivity/negativity (i.e., valence) of simulated thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations correlated with the desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco and whether the association is mediated by perceived harms and attitudinal beliefs toward WTS. We expected that simulated future WTS that entailed more positive thoughts, feelings, and pleasant sensory experiences would be associated with a higher desire to smoke and these associations would be mediated by lower perceived harms and more favorable attitudes toward WTS. We expected these patterns to be moderated by smoking status such that they would hold more powerfully for smokers, followed by susceptible then nonsusceptible nonsmokers. In a second study we examined how the explicit manipulation of the valence of the simulation (e.g., positive or negative simulations) influenced attitudes toward, perceived risks and desire/intention to engage in WTS.</p>

                  <p id="P13">Participants were recruited using the Internet crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Waterpipe tobacco smokers and (non)susceptible nonsmokers were recruited separately. Individuals first gave consent and then completed a screener to determine eligibility. To be eligible as a smoker, participants had to be 18 to 30 years of age, report WTS use within the last 30 days, and express not having quit. To be eligible as a (non)susceptible nonsmoker, participants had to be 18 to 30 years of age, report never having smoked waterpipe tobacco, not even a puff or two. Susceptibility status was based on a four-item scale: 1) “Do you think that you will smoke tobacco from a waterpipe soon?” 2) “Do you think that you will smoke tobacco from a waterpipe in the next year?” 3) “Do you think that in the future you might experiment with waterpipe tobacco smoking?” and 4) “If one of your best friends asked you to smoke tobacco from a waterpipe, would you?” (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Lipkus et al., 2015</xref>). Response options included: “Definitely yes”; “Probably yes”; “Probably no”; and “Definitely no”. Participants were deemed susceptible to WTS if they responded other than “Definitely no” to one or more questions. Data quality assurance measures included prohibiting duplicate responses and using verification to prevent automated completion (i.e., by bots).</p>

                  <p id="P26">Among participants in the simulation arm, pathways from valence of thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations to desire to smoke, with perceived harm and attitudes as correlated mediators, were examined with smoking status as a moderator using multi-group structural equation models (SEM; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Byrne, 2004</xref>). We first tested an unconstrained model that allowed mediational pathways to vary across smoking status. We then tested a constrained model that imposed invariance on the mediational pathways across smoking status. We used the nested chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test statistic to compare the fit between the two models. An unconstrained model with better fit suggests that the mediation pathways vary by smoking status (i.e., strength of the pathways among the variables differ by smoking status). The model fit was assessed by commonly-used goodness-of-fit indices: chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>), goodness of fit index (GFI), normed fit index (NFI), incremental fit index (IFI), relative fit index (RFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Following recommended criteria for evaluating model fit indices (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Kline, 2015</xref>), a nonsignificant χ<sup>2</sup> value (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&gt; .05) indicates a good overall model fit to the data. For GFI, NFI, IFI, RFI, and CFI, values greater than .90 were used as an indication of a good model fit. A RMSEA of less than .06 also indicates a good model fit. Standardized path coefficients were used as effect sizes of associations between two variables controlling for other variables in the model. Bootstrapping (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1994</xref>) was used to address the potential issues of unstable standard error estimation resulted from small samples within groups and non-normal distributions of the variables.

              <p id="P32">Study 1 provided initial evidence that mental simulations of WTS, especially the valence of simulated experiences, evoked a greater desire to smoke, especially among smokers -- and smokers reported that their simulations closely resembled their smoking experiences. However, experimental evidence is needed that manipulation of valence of simulations motivate desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco. The purpose of Study 2 was to corroborate findings from Study 1 by experimentally <italic toggle="yes">manipulating</italic> valence of simulations (no instruction, positive, negative) and testing whether positive simulations increase the desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco and negative simulations decrease that desire relative to a no simulation control arm. Further, given Study 1 findings that simulating WTS had the most profound effects on smokers followed by susceptible nonsmokers, only these two groups were approached. We predicted that, compared to the no-simulation control arm, participants instructed to simulate positive experiences would report a higher desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco while those instructed to simulate negative experiences would report a lower desire to smoke. No a-priori prediction was made as to how the latter two arms would differ in desire to smoke compared to the no-valence (i.e., unspecified) instruction simulation control arm.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P49">In two studies, we showed that engaging in mental simulations of future WTS influenced the immediate desire to smoke compared to no episodic future mental simulations. Study 1 provided initial insights about smokers’ and nonsmokers’ experiences of mentally simulating future WTS. According to the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Schacter &amp; Addis, 2007</xref>), smokers’ encoded memories of past experiences of WTS should more strongly influence the valence of simulated future thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations and result in more easily generated and realistic scenarios when simulating future episodes, compared to nonsmokers. Findings were consistent with these predictions whereby smokers had the most favorable experiences and found the simulated scenarios realistic, more likely to resemble a future experience, and easier to produce. Moreover, smokers who simulated WTS (versus those who did not) expressed a stronger desire to smoke; there was a similar (but non-significant) pattern for susceptible nonsmokers. Among nonsusceptible nonsmokers, the mental simulation had no significant effect on desire to smoke. Modeling demonstrated different pathways through which the mental simulation affected desire to smoke by smoking status. For both smokers and susceptible nonsmokers, there were more direct (e.g., physical sensation for smokers) or fully mediated indirect paths linking reactions with attitudes or perceived harms, relative to nonsusceptible nonsmokers. That is, for smokers and susceptible nonsmokers, mental simulations appear to have more routes through which they can influence desire to smoke WTS than for nonsusceptible nonsmokers. Nonsusceptible nonsmokers lacked full mediational pathways linking valence of simulated reactions with desire to smoke.</p>
              <p id="P50">The purpose of Study 2 was to corroborate and extend Study 1 findings by experimentally manipulating valence of simulations and testing whether positive simulations increase the desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco and negative simulations decrease that desire relative to a no simulation control. Consistent with Study 1, across manipulations smokers had more positively-valenced thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations, found it easier and less effortful to generate simulations, and simulations were judged as more realistic and likely to be experienced than susceptible nonsmokers. Valence of thoughts, feelings, and physical reactions were similar when smokers, but not susceptible nonsmokers, were induced to simulate positive experiences or when provided with no specific valenced instructions.</p>
              <p id="P51">Varying the valence of mental simulations helped clarify why smokers asked to simulate WTS in Study 1 reported a greater desire to smoke than those in the control arm. Findings suggest that when asked to simulate future WTS, smokers in Study 1 likely defaulted to positive thoughts, feelings, and/or physical sensations akin to giving them instructions to simulate positive scenarios, resulting in similar effects on desire to smoke. Providing no instructions about valence or instructions to produce positive simulations resulted in similar increases in desire to smoke, especially compared to participants who were not asked to produce simulations.</p>
              <p id="P52">Study 2 SEM analyses provided further evidence of mediation effects of simulation conditions on desire to smoke relative to a no simulation control. Engaging in positive simulations heightened desire to smoke for smokers via favorable cognitions and for susceptible nonsmokers via both favorable cognitive and affective attitudes. Conversely, negative simulations lowered desire to smoke for smokers via the reduction of favorable cognitive attitudes and for susceptible nonsmokers via more negative affective attitudes. Among susceptible nonsmokers, allowing them to freely simulate WTS with unspecified valence instructions reduced the immediate desire to smoke by decreasing favorable cognitive attitudes.</p>
              <p id="P53">Study 2 also examined the likelihood of engaging in WTS one-month into the future. Here we found that negative simulations reduced the likelihood of future smoking compared to the positive simulation arm. Thus, whereas the immediate desire to smoke waterpipe was influenced by positive simulations, negative simulations played a significant role both in reducing the perceived likelihood of smoking in the next month and in diminishing the desire to smoke right now. These findings suggest that negatively-valenced simulations could be harnessed as a preventive intervention and used to counter marketing that exploits the impact of positive simulations on WTS (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Palmedo et al., 2017</xref>). It will be important to test potential strategies (e.g., public health messaging, simulations embedded into behavioral interventions) that can be leveraged to induce negative simulations to prevent WTS and encourage cessation in future studies.</p>
              <p id="P54">Our findings have potential theoretical and practical implications concerning WTS. First, mental simulations have not been researched as a mechanism that influences WTS and should be integrated into the WTS literature. Simulations affected how smokers and susceptible nonsmokers evaluated WTS immediately thereafter; they mattered. Second, simulations can act as important <italic toggle="yes">precursors</italic> to cognitions and affective attitudes that influence desire and intentions to engage in WTS. Indeed, simulations influenced cognitive and affective attitudes as mediators, with weak or no effects on perceived harms. Suggested by our findings, marketers may promote positive simulations of the experience of smoking waterpipe tobacco, influencing susceptible nonsmokers’ experimentation with WTS through both cognitive and affective mechanisms while affecting smokers through cognitive appeals, directing their thinking about the WTS experience (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Papies et al., 2017</xref>). Third, our findings show that we can explicitly influence valence of simulations. Negative simulations need to be reinforced and positive simulations interrupted; for example, use of health warnings or making explicit the motives and misleading claims of marketers (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Sutfin et al., 2021</xref>) may achieve both these ends. Fourth, the study of mental simulation can inform policy to curb WTS. Ads promoting WTS likely trigger positive simulations that increase product use. Research is needed as to how various ad attributes (e.g., size, color, placement, descriptors of WTS) affect content and valence of simulations and ensuing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Policy-makers can consider banning ad attributes that produce positive simulations that result in WTS – akin to disallowing the term “light” cigarettes.</p>
              <p id="P55">This research contributes to the larger literature linking episodic future mental simulations with behavior modification. For example, a recent review of 123 studies by Cole et al. (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2020</xref>) observed a significant, albeit modest, effect of mental simulations on behavior change (g=.49). Although the review included a wide variety of behaviors, many studies were health-related such as reduction in alcohol consumption (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hagger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and calorie intake (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Johannessen et al., 2012</xref>). To our knowledge, the results reported here constitute the first evidence that episodic future simulation may be an effective strategy to curb future WTS behavior, and thus extends the scope of simulation research to an important health-risk behavior.</p>
              <p id="P56">There are several limitations to our findings. First, it is unclear how well the findings generalize to populations beyond the current sample. Convenience samples like the one used here represent an important first step to test key hypotheses but we acknowledge that the hypotheses tested here should be examined in more representative samples. Second, we did not assess the durability of effects or, crucially, the uptake or cessation of WTS. It is possible that mental simulation may affect instrumental behaviors such as telling oneself to stop while smoking waterpipe (i.e., self-talk) yet require repeated and consistent practice to modify smoking behavior. Third, while mental simulations in general (Study 1) and the valence of the mental simulations (Study 2) were manipulated, instructions pertaining to what exactly to simulate (e.g., type of outcome, context, etc.) were not provided. It is likely that different simulations (e.g., smoking alone or with friends, a specific type of negative or positive outcome) could produce different effects. Testing guided simulations will be important in future research.</p>
              <p id="P57">Notwithstanding these limitations, these findings reveal that mental simulations can influence key beliefs and the desire to smoke in smokers and susceptible nonsmokers in a new health domain, WTS. Mental simulations are highly malleable, often used in planning for the future, and can change health behaviors (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Conroy &amp; Hagger, 2018</xref>). Given the paucity of novel strategies to prevent and promote cessation of WTS in young adults, interventions that use and build on mental simulations merit further scrutiny.</p>
