                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1/2a study enrolled healthy HIV-uninfected adults at low risk for HIV infection. They were randomized (1:4:1) to receive 4 doses of an adenovirus 26-based HIV-1 vaccine encoding 2 mosaic Gag and Pol, and 2 mosaic Env proteins plus adjuvanted clade C gp140 (referred to here as clade C regimen), bivalent protein regimen (clade C regimen plus mosaic gp140), or placebo. Primary end points were safety and antibody responses.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In total 152/155 participants (clade C, n = 26; bivalent protein, n = 103; placebo, n = 26) received ≥1 injection. The highest adverse event (AE) severity was grade 3 (local pain/tenderness, 12%, 2%, and 0% of the respective groups; solicited systemic AEs, 19%, 15%, 0%). HIV-1 mosaic gp140-binding antibody titers were 79 595 ELISA units (EU)/mL and 137 520 EU/mL in the clade C and bivalent protein groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001) after dose 4 and 16 862 EU/mL and 25 162 EU/mL 6 months later. Antibody response breadth against clade C gp140 and clade C/non-clade C gp120 was highest in the bivalent protein group.</p>

          <body>
            <p>With 38 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide, a safe, globally effective vaccine remains essential to curb further HIV transmission [<xref rid="jiac445-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date, 4 preventive HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in efficacy studies, only 1 of which demonstrated vaccine efficacy (31% in the RV144 trial) [<xref rid="jiac445-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The vaccines’ immunogens’ inability to elicit a sufficiently broad and durable immune response to counter the extensive diversity of HIV-1 is likely one of the main reasons for their poor efficacy [<xref rid="jiac445-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
            <p>A multivalent HIV vaccine based on the replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector was developed using a mosaic immunogen approach to elicit broader responses against diverse variants of HIV-1 [<xref rid="jiac445-B5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>]. The in silico<italic toggle="yes">-</italic>designed mosaic antigens include a maximum number of potential epitopes from group M variants of HIV-1 envelope (Env), group-specific antigen (Gag), and polymerase (Pol) proteins [<xref rid="jiac445-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These Ad26-delivered HIV-1 mosaic antigens elicited broad cellular immune responses and partially protected against neutralization-resistant simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIVSF162P3 in rhesus monkeys [<xref rid="jiac445-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the addition of adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein (gp)140 to the Ad26-based mosaic vaccine substantially improved protection in rhesus monkeys [<xref rid="jiac445-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Env-specific binding antibodies were repeatedly identified as a correlate of protection for these mosaic vaccines [<xref rid="jiac445-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Specifically, Env-directed antibodies targeting diverse sequences within the first and second hypervariable regions (V1V2) of gp120 correlated inversely with the HIV-1 infection risk in the RV144 efficacy study, with V1V2 antibodies potentially contributing to protection [<xref rid="jiac445-B12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>]. Moreover, in the HVTN 702 phase 2b/3 efficacy trial, high levels of V1V2-binding antibody responses along with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses correlated with decreased HIV-1 acquisition [<xref rid="jiac445-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These findings highlight the potential of Ad26-delivered HIV-1 mosaic antigens combined with recombinant gp140 as vaccine immunogens.</p>
            <p>A vaccine regimen consisting of Ad26-delivered HIV-1 mosaic antigens (2 mosaic <italic toggle="yes">gag-pol</italic> genes and 1 mosaic <italic toggle="yes">env</italic> gene) and high-dose clade C gp140 induced a robust and comparable immune response in both humans and rhesus monkeys, and protected the monkeys against repetitive, intrarectal, heterologous challenges with SHIVSF162P3 [<xref rid="jiac445-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Adding a fourth Ad26 vector encoding a second, complementary, mosaic <italic toggle="yes">env</italic> gene induced a significantly greater and broader immune response against diverse HIV-1 strains [<xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; this regimen was evaluated in the phase 2b Imbokodo efficacy study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03060629), wherein the primary analysis demonstrated that vaccine efficacy, assessed in women at risk for HIV acquisition, was not significantly different from 0% [<xref rid="jiac445-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The goal of this first-in-human study was to determine whether adding a second gp140, based on mosaic (Mos) <italic toggle="yes">env</italic> encoded by Ad26, to the previously evaluated clade C gp140, given with the Ad26-based tetravalent HIV vaccine [<xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<xref rid="jiac445-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>
), would increase the breadth of humoral immune responses against diverse HIV clades without compromising safety or clade C responses.</p>

                <p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2a study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02935686) was conducted at 13 sites in the United States, Kenya, and Rwanda. Healthy HIV-uninfected adults aged 18 to 50 years who were at low risk for HIV-1 infection and gave informed consent were enrolled (additional eligibility criteria are listed in the <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The study regimen consisted of Ad26.Mos4.HIV or placebo administered intramuscularly at day 0 and week 12; at weeks 24 and 48, Ad26.Mos4.HIV was coadministered (1 injection in each arm) with either clade C gp140 (further referred to as the clade C regimen in this article), clade C gp140 and Mos1 gp140 (referred to here as the bivalent protein regimen), or placebo. Participants were randomized (1:4:1) to receive either the clade C, bivalent protein, or placebo regimen, respectively (<xref rid="jiac445-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>
). For reference, the clade C regimen uses the same vaccine components as were evaluated in the phase 2b Imbokodo efficacy study [<xref rid="jiac445-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
                <p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practices, and applicable regulatory guidelines. The study protocol was approved by institutional review boards at each study site. Participants or their legally acceptable representatives provided written informed consent to participate at the time of screening.</p>

                <p>Sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to be analyzed for humoral and cellular immune responses, respectively, were obtained from blood samples collected on day 0 (baseline) and at weeks 28 (4 weeks after third vaccination), 52 (4 weeks after fourth vaccination), and 72 (6 months after fourth vaccination; <xref rid="jiac445-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>

                <p>Vaccine-induced binding antibody responses were analyzed using 5 HIV-1 Env clade-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against gp140 antigens. Vaccine-induced binding immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG3 subclass responses were investigated using clade C (C97ZA.012)-specific ELISAs. The functionality of vaccine-induced antibodies was evaluated in a virus neutralization assay (VNA) using TZM-bl cells and Env-pseudotyped viruses. The HIV-1 binding antibody multiplex assay was used to determine the magnitude and breadth of antibody isotype (IgG and IgA) and subclass (IgG3) responses to a broad panel of HIV-1 Env using a global antigen panel against gp120, gp140, gp41, and V1V2-gp70 scaffolds (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="jiac445-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays were used to analyze T-cell responses to stimulation with pools of HIV-1 immunogens. Intracellular cytokine staining was used to detect interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and/or interleukin 2 (IL-2)-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to HIV-1 mosaic immunogens. Immune responses against Ad26 were evaluated using an adeno-VNA. These assays are further described in the <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>.</p>

                <p>The primary end points were (1) the safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens (ie, solicited local and systemic adverse events [AEs] over 7 days after each vaccination; AEs over 28 days after each vaccination; discontinuations due to AEs; and serious AEs and AEs of special interest, ie, HIV infection, during the course of the study); and (2) the titers and breadth of HIV-1 Env binding antibody responses to the 2 vaccine regimens. Secondary end points included titers and breadth of Env-specific neutralizing antibodies for tier 1 HIV viruses; Env-specific antibody functionality; titers and breadth of Env-specific binding antibody isotypes; and T-cell responses. T-cell responses were characterized in terms of IFN-γ response, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell functionality, and T-cell memory differentiation. Exploratory end points included B-cell responses, lymph node immune responses, and immune responses to the Ad26 viral vector.

The full analysis set (FAS; safety analyses) included all participants who received ≥ 1 study injection. The per protocol immunogenicity set (immunogenicity analyses) included participants who received at least the first 3 injections within the protocol-specified time window (± 2 weeks), did not contract HIV during the study, and had ≥ 1 blood sample analyzed. For pooled analysis, the clade C group immunogenicity data were enriched with data from participants in our previous study [<xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to allow statistical analysis. No statistical hypothesis was tested in the immunogenicity analysis, but differences in the magnitudes of immune responses between the vaccinated groups were explored either by a 2-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test on the log<sub>10</sub> data, if those were normally distributed, or by a Wilcoxon rank sum test, using SAS 9.4 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>

                <p>The binding antibody multiplex assay was used to measure the breadth and durability of the binding antibody response against cross-clade panels of gp120, gp140, and V1V2 antigens. The bivalent protein regimen consistently resulted in greater breadth, magnitude, and durability of binding antibody responses than the clade C regimen against gp120 and gp140 clade C, gp120 and gp140 non-clade C, and an extended gp120 panel of clade C antigens after the third and fourth vaccinations, and 6 months after fourth vaccination (<xref rid="jiac445-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

                <p>Overall, these data indicate that, in general, the vaccines induce cellular immune responses consistently across the vaccinated populations at rates similar to the peak observed after the third or fourth vaccination, through 6 months after the fourth vaccination.</p>

Other responses were generally comparable between vaccinated groups.</p>
                <p>To understand the role of preexisting and vaccine-induced vector immunity in the response to vaccination, Ad26 neutralization titers were evaluated over the course of the vaccination series. Preexisting, naturally induced neutralizing antibodies to Ad26 were detected in most participants from East Africa (89%) compared to 5% of those from the United States (<xref rid="jiac445-F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>
). Ad26-neutralizing antibody titers increased after the first vaccination but were not substantially boosted upon subsequent vaccinations (<xref rid="jiac445-F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>
). Among the predominantly Ad26-seronegative participants from the United States, a low negative correlation (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = –0.345, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05) between Ad26 VNA and ELISA responses at the second vaccination, and a low positive correlation (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.344, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05) after the third vaccination were observed (<xref rid="jiac445-F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>
). However, no significant correlations between prevaccination Ad26 titers and postvaccination responses were detected among participants from East Africa (<xref rid="jiac445-F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>
). No difference in the magnitude of ELISA responses was seen between the United States and East Africa after completion of the vaccination schedule (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Hence, Ad26 vector-specific immunity prior to vaccination had little, if any, influence on the magnitude of induced immune response.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This first-in-human study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of adding the Mos1 gp140 component to the previously tested Ad26.Mos4.HIV and clade C gp140 vaccine regimen [<xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Adding the in silico designed Mos1 gp140 improved both the magnitude and breadth of humoral immune responses without increasing reactogenicity. Both regimens were generally safe and well tolerated, consistent with the results of earlier studies on Ad26-based mosaic HIV vaccines [<xref rid="jiac445-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Solicited and unsolicited AEs were mostly mild and comparable between the 2 groups, with the rates of solicited systemic AEs decreasing after the first injection. No HIV infections, serious AEs, or deaths occurred.</p>
              <p>Both regimens elicited humoral and cellular anti–HIV-1 immune responses in 100% and up to 94% of recipients, respectively. The immunogenicity profiles observed in both groups are generally consistent with earlier studies [<xref rid="jiac445-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Binding antibody titers to Mos1 gp140 increased after each vaccination, peaking after the fourth vaccination in both groups. Neutralizing antibody responses were only raised against tier 1 HIV strains, in line with previous findings [<xref rid="jiac445-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This vaccination schedule demonstrated that the immune response specificities elicited by the first 2 Ad26.Mos4.HIV injections can develop into broad humoral and cellular immunity, and their specificities can be differentially boosted depending on the composition of the subsequent gp140 vaccines. The bivalent gp140 regimen induced a humoral response of greater magnitude and breadth than the clade C gp140 regimen, and was not associated with any diminution in clade C-specific responses, thus ruling out antigenic competition, an important concern in multivalent HIV vaccine development [<xref rid="jiac445-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The improved performance of the bivalent regimen in eliciting a greater magnitude and breadth of V1V2 responses is a potentially important difference, as these responses have been consistently associated with reduced risk of HIV-1 infection and increased vaccine efficacy across trials [<xref rid="jiac445-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="jiac445-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These humoral immune response data, taken together, show that adding the Mos1 gp140 component improved vaccine-induced humoral immune responses.</p>
              <p>Induction of long-lived immunological memory was indicated by persistence of vaccine-elicited CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses 6 months after the final injection at similar magnitude as the peak, combined with balanced effector and central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell phenotype and persistent, and broad antibody responses. The durability of immune responses elicited by both vaccine regimens was consistent with the favorable durability profiles reported for Janssen's Ad26-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<xref rid="jiac445-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Zika vaccines [<xref rid="jiac445-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>All participants generated Ad26-neutralizing antibodies irrespective of their baseline serostatus. The magnitude of vaccine-induced HIV-specific humoral responses was comparable between populations that were predominantly Ad26-seropositive (Kenya and Rwanda) and -seronegative (United States) and was not impacted by preexisting Ad26-specific immunity. These results may be of relevance for situations where Ad26-based vaccines will be more widely used [<xref rid="jiac445-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Very rare cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been reported among recipients of Ad26-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [<xref rid="jiac445-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but no cases of VITT were reported in either this study or this HIV vaccine development program, nor with any other Ad26-vectored vaccines developed by Janssen, aside from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Given the few participants with evaluable fine-needle aspirate results, no inferences regarding differences in B-cell responses between the vaccine regimens can be drawn.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, adding a mosaic gp140 Env component to the regimen containing Ad26.Mos4.HIV and clade C gp140 [<xref rid="jiac445-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] increases the humoral and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell immune responses while maintaining the vaccine's safety and tolerability profile. The bivalent protein vaccine consistently induced the greatest breadth of antibody responses against multiclade Env panels, including (although to a lesser extent) against V1V2 clade C antigens. In the HVTN 702 study, high levels of V1V2-directed binding antibody responses were associated with decreased HIV-1 acquisition [<xref rid="jiac445-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], even though overall, vaccine efficacy was not demonstrated [<xref rid="jiac445-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The phase 2b Imbokodo study (HVTN 705) evaluating efficacy of the Ad26.Mos4.HIV and the clade C gp140 regimen in women in Southern Africa started during execution of the ASCENT trial, but the primary analysis subsequently demonstrated that vaccine efficacy did not differ significantly from 0% [<xref rid="jiac445-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, based on these results from ASCENT, the efficacy of the Ad26.Mos4.HIV and bivalent gp140 vaccine regimen is being evaluated in men who have sex with men and transgender individuals in the Mosaico study (NCT03964415) in Western Europe and the Americas, where clade B is most prevalent. These complementary studies will demonstrate how the different immunologic responses induced by these vaccine regimens will impact vaccine efficacy in populations that are geographically distinct, and in which route of HIV transmission differs.</p>
