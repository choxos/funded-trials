                  <p>Although self-efficacy is a potential determinant of feeding and care behaviors, there
is limited empirical analysis of the role of maternal self-efficacy in low- and
middle-income countries. In the context of behavior change interventions (BCIs)
addressing complementary feeding (CF), it is possible that maternal self-efficacy can
mediate or enhance intervention impacts.</p>

                  <p>In the context of a BCI in Bangladesh, we studied the role of maternal self-efficacy
for CF (MSE-CF) for 2 CF behaviors with the use of a theoretically grounded empirical
model of determinants to illustrate the potential roles of MSE-CF.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We developed and tested a locally relevant scale for MSE-CF and included it in a survey
(<italic>n</italic> = 457 mothers of children aged 6–24 mo) conducted as part of a
cluster-randomized evaluation. Qualitative research was used to inform the selection of
2 intervention-targeted behaviors: feeding green leafy vegetables in the last 24 h (GLV)
and on-time introduction of egg (EGG) between 6 and 8 mo of age. We then examined
direct, mediated, and potentiated paths of MSE-CF in relation to the impacts of the BCI
on these behaviors with the use of regression and structural equation modeling.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>GLV and EGG were higher in the intensive group than in the nonintensive control group
(16.0 percentage points for GLV; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 11.2 percentage points
for EGG; <italic>P</italic> = 0.037). For GLV, MSE-CF mediated (β = 0.345,
<italic>P</italic> = 0.010) and potentiated (β = 0.390, <italic>P</italic> = 0.038)
the effect of the intensive group. In contrast, MSE-CF did not mediate or potentiate the
effect of the intervention on EGG.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>MSE-CF was a significant mediator and potentiator for GLV but not for EGG. The
divergent findings highlight the complex determinants of individual specific infant and
young child feeding behaviors. The study shows the value of measuring behavioral
determinants, such as MSE-CF, that affect a caregiver's capability to adopt
intervention-targeted behaviors.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adequate and appropriate complementary feeding (CF) with nutrient-dense foods such as green
leafy vegetables and eggs beginning at 6 mo of age is important for child survival, growth,
and development (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, inadequate CF
during the period from 6 to 24 mo is associated with stunting and other manifestations of
undernutrition (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Consequently, numerous interventions
to improve CF have been designed and implemented, including behavior change communication
(BCC), sometimes coupled with food provision or cash transfers to caregivers (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>Designing effective BCC for CF requires understanding the key factors and processes that
influence caregiver behavior. Several well-developed theoretical models of behavior change
[e.g., the Health Belief Model (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the Theory of
Planned Behavior (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and Social Cognitive Theory (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)] have been developed to inform
the design and evaluation of nutrition interventions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A central construct of these theories is self-efficacy, which Bandura (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)
defines as “beliefs in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action
required to produce given levels of attainments” (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; p. 624). Bandura asserts that self-efficacy is domain-specific and that
measures of generalized self-efficacy are less analytically useful when examining its role
in behavior and behavior change, because an individual's self-efficacy varies across
activities and functions (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>Maternal self-efficacy has long been considered a key determinant of breastfeeding success.
Work in this area has included the development of validated self-efficacy scales and
applications in low- and high-income countries (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Such work has been lacking for CF, although a small body of empirical research
has documented the importance of self-efficacy as a driver of behavior change in nutrition
interventions in low- and middle-income countries (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Previously, self-efficacy has
been examined empirically as either a mediator (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)
or as a potentiator (i.e., positive effect modifier) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) of nutrition behavior change interventions (BCIs). However, to our knowledge,
no research has examined both roles for self-efficacy, even though theory suggests that
self-efficacy can play out in multiple, and highly specific, ways (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, little is known about how self-efficacy is related to
behavior change for CF practices, because behavioral theories are rarely considered when
designing or evaluating such programming (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).
Given these gaps, we sought to examine the role of maternal self-efficacy for CF (MSE-CF) in

the inferential strengths afforded by experimental design with contextualized understanding
generated by qualitative methods.</p>
              <p>Alive &amp; Thrive (A&amp;T) is a global initiative that aims to improve infant and young
child feeding (IYCF) practices in multiple contexts (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The A&amp;T behavior change
program theory explicitly recognized the importance of self-efficacy in the intervention
pathway and thus targeted improved maternal self-efficacy along with other behavioral
determinants, such as knowledge, skills, intent, motivation, and perceived social norms
(<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The impact evaluation of the initiative showed that a combination of
strategies—interpersonal counseling, mass media, and community mobilization (the “intensive
intervention” or intervention group)—led to greater improvements in all core WHO CF
indicators than did mass media alone (the “nonintensive intervention” or control group)
(<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, impacts varied by behavior,
suggesting that multiple factors likely influenced the effect of the intervention on
specific behaviors (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
              <p>In this substudy, a component of the overall evaluation, we used cross-sectional midline
survey data collected 2 y after the baseline survey in Bangladesh. With the explicit goal of
examining issues of MSE-CF, this survey included specific measures of MSE-CF that were
extensively tested to increase measurement precision. We aimed to assess the extent to which
the increased intake of particular intervention-targeted foods was mediated by increased
MSE-CF and whether MSE-CF multiplied the intervention's effect, thereby acting as a
“potentiator” or positive effect modifier. Put simply, we asked: Did the intervention act
through increasing MSE-CF? And did mothers with higher MSE-CF gain more from the
intervention than mothers with lower MSE-CF?</p>

addition, their communities were targeted with social mobilization to build awareness of
IYCF practices among men and other family members. In contrast, mothers in the
nonintensive group received standard interpersonal counseling on nutrition from frontline
health workers in the context of routine health visits, along with less-structured
community mobilization that did not cover IYCF practices (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A mass media campaign on IYCF was implemented nationwide for the

was selected as the index child. The survey included a total of 457 mothers, of which 213

                  <title>Creation of MSE-CF questions and scale</title>
                  <p>A set of questions related specifically to MSE-CF were developed on the basis of
self-efficacy theory (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and the specific CF
behaviors prioritized in the intervention (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).
Attention was given to designing questions that supported the principles of appropriate
scale development (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The questions were
subjected to cognitive testing (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) to
determine if the question constructs, terminology, and translation were appropriate for
respondents. In this development and testing phase, native Bengali-speaking interviewers
conducted individual qualitative interviews with 15 mothers who were not in the survey
sample. They asked respondents to “think aloud” as the question was asked,
systematically going through each part of the question (i.e., lead-in, terminology,
response scale) and determining how well the translation reflected the original English
questions. Mothers were most easily able to answer questions where the response was
scaled by first answering “yes,” “no,” or “don't know” to the lead-in question; “yes”
answers were then followed up by asking “always” or “sometimes.” This procedure
generated a 3-point response scale: “yes—always,” “yes—sometimes,” or “no.” The
cognitive testing revealed that, for these concepts, this approach worked better than a
standard 5-point Likert scale.</p>
                  <p>The MSE-CF scale was composed of 4 questions (informed by this cognitive testing) on
the following items: maternal self-efficacy for <italic>1</italic>) feeding
family-cooked foods, <italic>2</italic>) avoiding feeding store-bought snacks,
<italic>3</italic>) being able to decide the types of foods fed to the child, and
<italic>4</italic>) raising a healthy child. The responses to these 4 questions were
added to generate an MSE-CF scale with a range from 0 to 8. A “no” response was given a
value of 0, “yes—sometimes” a value of 1, and “yes—always” a value of 2. None of the
respondents replied “don't know.” The scale had an internal consistency Cronbach's α
(<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) coefficient of 0.60 in the total study
sample. MSE-CF was centered at the group mean for all analysis.</p>

                    <p>In the intensive areas, mothers were instructed by frontline health workers to give
infants and young children green leafy vegetables alone or mashed with thick lentils,
other vegetables, and either fish or egg into rice. Green leafy vegetables are
commonly consumed as part of the daily diet in rural Bangladesh (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and can be grown in or around the homestead; therefore, they
were easily available to mothers. In the midline survey, mothers were asked: “Did your
child eat green leafy vegetables yesterday (during the day or night)?” A binary
variable was constructed from the yes or no responses to this question.</p>

                    <p>Eggs were chosen because of their positioning as a special food for children.
Although eggs were less expensive than other animal-source foods, they often were not
served as a family food because fish is a preferred animal-source food among
Bangladeshi adults. This positions egg, in contrast to green leafy vegetables, as a
potential “special food” that is less accessible to mothers than are green leafy
vegetables.</p>
                    <p>The intervention encouraged an earlier age of introduction of egg (specifically
between 6 and 7 mo) than is common in Bangladesh, where animal-source foods are often
introduced late (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). To examine response to
this recommended practice we asked: “At what age did you start giving eggs to [index
child's name]?” Mothers had the option of responding, “not yet given.” Mothers who
reported giving their child egg between 6 and 8 mo of age were coded as “on time.” All
responses of giving their child egg at ≥9 mo old were considered “not on time.”</p>

potential influences in the Bangladeshi context on the 2 behavioral outcomes. These
variables were as follows: child sex, child age (only in the green leafy vegetable
models), maternal education and socioeconomic status, household food security, and
consumption of green leafy vegetables or egg by any household members apart from the
index child in the last 24 h. Maternal education was calculated on the basis of the
highest level of schooling, reported by the mother. Socioeconomic status was measured
with the use of an index of 32 assets, including both durable assets and livestock
assets (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Household food insecurity was
assessed with the use of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Household consumption of green leafy vegetables or egg in the last 24 h was included in
the regression models as a proxy for the household availability of either green leafy
vegetables or egg. Given previous research in this context on the association between
maternal consumption and child consumption, we presumed that household availability
would influence whether these foods were given to the child (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The intervention did not deliver messages that encouraged all
household members to consume these foods, and at the time of this midline survey the
intervention had no detectable effect on household consumption of these foods. Thus, the
intervention would have affected child consumption of these foods through 1 of 2
pathways: increased feeding of an available family food to the child or special
provisioning of a food not consumed by the family for the child. Because neither pathway
affects household consumption of these foods, adjusting for household consumption is
appropriate and does not “over control.”</p>

              <p>We sought to clarify the role of self-efficacy in an effective intervention to improve CF
behaviors in a low-income setting and chose to examine maternal self-efficacy in the context
of 2 distinct behaviors. We found that impacts of the A&amp;T intervention were mediated
through increased MSE-CF in the case of feeding green leafy vegetables in the last 24 h.
Furthermore, mothers with higher MSE-CF gained the most from the intervention on this
behavioral outcome. In contrast, although the A&amp;T intervention was also effective in
increasing on-time introduction of eggs to infants as an early animal-source food, the
intervention did not work through increased MSE-CF to affect this behavior, nor did MSE-CF
potentiate this effect. Our research thus shows that the role of MSE-CF differs between
these 2 IYCF behaviors.</p>
              <p>The finding that MSE-CF both mediated and potentiated the impact of the intervention on
feeding green leafy vegetables in the last 24 h (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) supports the theory of “moderated mediation” (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The mediation effects of MSE-CF were potentiated
by the level of MSE-CF, such that the mediation effects were stronger among those with
higher MSE-CF. In the intensive group, having a higher MSE-CF corresponded to a higher
predicted probability of feeding green leafy vegetables in the last 24 h. In the absence of
potentiation, the lines would have been parallel. To our knowledge, the combined mediation
and potentiation effects of self-efficacy have not been shown before this study.</p>
              <p>Our divergent findings with regard to the 2 recommended behaviors highlight the complex
determinants of IYCF behaviors and empirically strengthen qualitative insights from the
intervention's process evaluation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). To
interpret the difference between the findings for green leafy vegetables and eggs, we draw
on these findings and field observations conducted as part of the larger study. Eggs, which
must often enter the household from the market, are relatively expensive in Bangladesh,
∼0.12 US$/egg at the time of this study, whereas in 2010, 18.5% of the population lived on
&lt;1.90 US$/d and 56.8% of the population lived on &lt;3.10 US$/d using 2016 World Bank
poverty estimates (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Furthermore, our
qualitative research and field observations indicated that eggs are rarely a preferred food
for adults in Bangladesh. Eggs, therefore, may fall into the category of being a “special
food” for a child, and because of cultural considerations, a caregiver generally must
request that someone buy this “special food” in the market for the child. This requires that
the caregiver is able to influence the household shoppers. These differing determinants of
specific complementary feeding behaviors have important implications for frontline workers
who are usually charged with delivering BCC that is intended to address a diversity of CF
practices. Our findings suggest that intervention design efforts should likely delve deep
into the determinants of specific individual practices, and assess the feasibility of
shaping some behaviors via counseling alone.</p>
              <p>Although the present study focused primarily on MSE-CF, certain structural or cultural
factors known to affect CF practices should be acknowledged. In Bangladesh, elders and men
usually do the food shopping for the household. At baseline, women's reported control over
the purchase of food, clothes, and medicines was low, with only 3.6% of mothers stating that
they purchase most of the food consumed by the family (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Men reportedly managed the household finances and decided what to purchase
(<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This role structure that reduces women's
autonomy has significant implications for access to resources and what is fed to the child.
Green leafy vegetables, on the other hand, are part of a typical family meal and are also
relatively easy to grow. In the 2 A&amp;T intervention groups combined, 45.1% of households
reported consuming green leafy vegetables in the last 24 h, whereas only 23.3% reported
consuming egg. Green leafy vegetables may be gathered from surrounding fields or from
household gardens within a mother's access and control. As a result, she would not have to
rely on other members of the household to provide these items to her child. Therefore, in
addition to self-efficacy, structural and cultural factors such as women's agency, autonomy,
and access to resources, all known to underlie healthy behaviors (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), may have influenced the CF practices examined here.</p>
              <p>Another factor that could help to interpret these findings is the relation between maternal
dietary diversity and child dietary diversity. Nguyen et al. (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) found that, in Bangladesh, mothers consume vitamin A–rich fruit and
vegetables (including green leafy vegetables), and a mother's consumption of such foods is
associated with her children's consumption of the same. Thus, the recommendation to feed
green leafy vegetables has the advantage of being part of established consumption patterns.
In contrast, egg consumption was much lower for both mothers and children, perhaps
indicating limited access to eggs or a lack of preference for eggs in this setting (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
              <p>Self-efficacy can be conceptualized at the level of a specific behavior (e.g., feeding a
specific food in a particular way) or a domain of behaviors (CF). Our results suggest that
measuring domain-specific self-efficacy is refined enough to allow for behavior-specific
interpretation, given adequate contextual knowledge. Comparing the differences between
caregivers’ responses to green leafy vegetables and eggs, we see why it is important to
examine the associations of domain-specific self-efficacy at the level of a specific
behavior. The lack of association of MSE-CF with the on-time introduction of egg can be
explained by cultural and economic factors that limit a mother's agency to implement healthy
behaviors (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This outcome specifically points
out the influence of household role structure and economic decision making associated with
roles. This finding is consistent with Bandura's (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) supposition that “under forcible disincentives or imposed social and physical
constraints, individuals are disinclined to act on their self-efficacy beliefs” (p. 10).
Strong self-efficacy is no match for a reality of restricted agency or limited resources.
Where men are the decision makers, or where households are constrained by resources to act
on information or confidence, improving MSE-CF may be associated with limited improvement.
Indeed, given the trade-off between purchasing “special foods” and other crucial household
expenses in very poor households, purchasers may be unable to provide special foods even if
they are convinced of the importance of providing them. Poverty may thus limit the impact of
a well-designed and well-delivered IYCF BCC intervention (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
              <p>In sum, these results underline the need to approach IYCF intervention design and
evaluation with the consideration of key constructs and theories, such as self-efficacy,
that influence caregiver behavior. In addition, interventions that are able to complement
effective individual approaches with approaches that address social, environmental, and
contextual determinants may be able to amplify their impacts (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p>
              <p>Some limitations of our data and analyses are worth mentioning. First, this study did not
measure or model the mechanisms by which MSE-CF is increased, and we did not investigate
which component of the intervention was responsible for the increase in MSE-CF in the
intensive group. We simply note that the A&amp;T intensive intervention directly influenced
MSE-CF, which was part of the program theory of change (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Second, this study was conducted
in the middle of the overall evaluation cycle. The effects of MSE-CF may become stronger
with longer exposure to the intervention, or be attenuated as behaviors become more
normative and accepted and require less individual agency. Third, both outcome measures are
self-reported, and therefore may be subject to both social desirability bias and measurement
(recall) error. In the context of this study, we were not able to assess the role of social
desirability, but the final impact evaluation ascertained that, in the context of
Bangladesh, social desirability bias was negligible (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Finally, we note some challenges with measurement of domain-specific
self-efficacy. Although our questions were extensively cognitively tested, the Cronbach's α
coefficient of the MSE-CF scale was 0.60, on the lower end of acceptable scale properties,
as a generally accepted range is 0.70–0.95 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
This lower scale consistency may be attributed to the limited number of questions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) included in the scale. Further work on this measure
to refine and potentially expand the set of questions that comprise the scale or the scaling
of responses might further improve internal consistency and would advance research in this
area.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, although challenging, our study indicates the utility of measuring and
testing the role of domain-specific self-efficacy. Identifying critical variables, such as
MSE-CF, along the pathway between intervention and outcomes can inform both intervention
design and evaluation. Studying MSE-CF along the program impact pathway for this
intervention improved our understanding of the mechanisms for behavior change in this
setting and helped highlight that a specific behavioral determinant targeted by the
intervention did indeed play a significant mediating and potentiating role, but only for one
of the behaviors. Our findings indicate that MSE-CF may manifest differently for different
behaviors and that, for some behaviors, other constraints are likely more salient. A
multipronged approach to BCIs that fully considers both intrinsic and extrinsic challenges
to supporting specific behaviors and foods could help strengthen the impact of such
interventions.</p>
