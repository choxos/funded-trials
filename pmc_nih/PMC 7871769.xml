                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged ≥18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (≥18-&lt;55 and ≥55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 µg dose relative to the 50 µg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 µg mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.</p>

              <p id="p0030">Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family of viruses that can cause mild to severe illness, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in Dec 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to widespread morbidity and mortality <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0035">The urgent need for safe and effective interventions to mitigate the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted international efforts to develop antivirals and vaccines. Numerous vaccine candidates based on traditional and new platforms are currently being evaluated including nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), virus-like particles, peptide-based, recombinant protein, live attenuated and inactivated virus modalities. The focus of most of the candidates has been on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0040">COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of clinical development, with several candidates in pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, including mRNA-based vaccines <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The use of mRNA technology is a promising pandemic response-strategy which combines a readily adaptable means of designing immunogens with rapid manufacturing and scale-up, thereby enabling shorter vaccine development timelines compared with other approaches <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. mRNA-based vaccines encoding viral antigens have been shown to be immunogenic against infectious pathogens with an acceptable safety profile in several clinical studies, including early phase trials of COVID-19 vaccines <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Additionally, preliminary findings from the interim analyses of two phase 3 trials of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, demonstrated efficacy in prevention of COVID-19 and no significant safety concerns to date <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0045">mRNA-1273 is a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated mRNA vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P). In preclinical studies, mRNA-1273 induced potent neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were protective against infection in the lungs and noses of mice without evidence of immunopathology <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Vaccination of rhesus macaques with a 2-dose regimen of mRNA-1273 induced robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity and rapid protection in the upper and lower airways, in the absence of associated immunopathologic changes in the lung <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0050">In a phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04283461), mRNA-1273, administered as two injections 28 days apart, was investigated at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 250 µg in participants 18–55 years of age, and at 25, 50, and 100 μg in older cohorts (56–70 and &gt;71 years) <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding and neutralizing antibody levels induced by mRNA-1273 vaccine were similar to or higher than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Vaccine recipients also developed Th-1 directed T-cell responses with minimal Th-2 responses. There were no significant safety concerns, and adverse reactions were mainly mild or moderate in the younger and older age groups at the 25 and 100 µg doses. The 100 μg dose induced higher antibody titers than the 25 μg dose, whereas the 250 µg dose did not lead to significant increases, which supported evaluation of the 100 μg dose in phase 2 and phase 3 vaccine trials <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>

                <p id="p0070">Dose levels of 50 and 100 μg mRNA-1273 were evaluated in two age cohorts, comprised of healthy adult participants aged ≥18–&lt;55 (cohort 1) and ≥55 (cohort 2). Within each age cohort, approximately 300 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 50 and 100 µg of mRNA-1273 or placebo. The randomization was performed in a blinded manner using a centralized Interactive Response Technology. Vaccine dose preparation and administration were performed by unblinded pharmacy personnel who did not participate in any other aspects of the study. All study staff, participants, clinical research organization (CRO) and sponsor personnel will remain blinded to dosing assignment until study-end (day 394), except those involved with the day 57 primary analysis.

                <p id="p0080">The study was initiated by parallel enrollment of all 300 participants in the younger cohort and a sentinel group of 50 participants in the older cohort (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). Acceptable safety of the sentinel group and all available data from cohort 1 was confirmed by an independent safety monitoring committee before vaccination of the remaining participants in cohort 2 (N = 250).</p>
                <p id="p0085">The mRNA-1273 vaccine and placebo were administered as a deltoid intramuscular injection using a 2-dose regimen with the first dose given on day 1 and the second on day 29. Vaccine was provided at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL using normal saline to dilute the doses prior to administration. Each injection was administered in a volume of 0.5 mL containing 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or saline placebo. Both the first and second doses were administered in the same (preferably nondominant) arm. Participants were monitored for a minimum of 60 min post-injection. Assessments included vital sign measurements and monitoring for local or systemic reactions.</p>
                <p id="p0090">Participants were instructed on performing and recording self-assessments via an electronic diary (eDiary). Safety and reactogenicity assessments included monitoring and daily recording of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) using the eDiary during 7 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) observed or reported during the 28 days following each injection, AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation or withdrawal from the study, medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) from days 1 through 394, and results of safety laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, and assessments for SARS-CoV-2 infection from day 1 through study completion. After the day 57 visit, participants received monthly prompts via the eDiary to capture occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, SAEs and any COVID-19 symptoms. Solicited local ARs included pain, erythema, and swelling/induration at the injection site, and localized axillary swelling or tenderness ipsilateral to the injection arm. Solicited systemic ARs were headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, rash, fever, and chills. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (DHHS 2007) was used in this study with modification for rash, solicited ARs, and vital signs (Table S1).</p>

                <p id="p0095">For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were collected at days 1, 29, and 57 and RNA was measured using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Viracor Eurofins Clinical Diagnostics, supplementary methods) <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using a predetermined baseline cycle threshold value of 38. Participants experiencing pre-specified SARS-CoV-2 disease criteria during the study were asked to contact the study site for a prompt, thorough clinical assessment.</p>
                <p id="p0100">Immunogenicity was assessed in blood samples collected on days 1 and 29 (before administration of vaccine) and days 43, and 57. The assay methods are detailed in the supplementary methods. Briefly, serum binding antibody (bAb) levels against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific to the S-2P protein developed in collaboration with PPD laboratories (Richmond, Virginia, USA). The anti-spike antibody concentration (µg/ml) was determined by interpolation from an 11-point dilution of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody (clone CR3022, Rockland, Inc, Limerick, PA). Serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using a live virus microneutralization (MN) assay based on an <italic>in situ</italic> ELISA readout. The assay was qualified for evaluation of human serum and conducted in accordance with Battelle laboratory protocols and qualified critical reagents (Columbus, Ohio, USA). The final reportable value for each sample was the MN<sub>50</sub> titer. Human sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients collected at least 15 days post-infection confirmed by RT-PCR (BioIVT, Westbury, NY, USA and Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd, Dublin, Ireland) served as a reference for the ELISA and MN assays.</p>

                <p id="p0105">The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by the level of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-specific binding antibody (bAb) of 2 dose levels of mRNA-1273 vaccine, each administered as two vaccinations, 28 days apart. The secondary objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of 2 dose levels of mRNA-1273 vaccine, each administered as two vaccinations 28 days apart, assessed by nAb titer. The primary safety endpoints were solicited ARs through 7 days after each injection, unsolicited AEs through 28 days after each injection, MAAEs and SAEs throughout the entire study period, safety laboratory abnormalities at days 29 and 57 (cohort 2 only), and vital sign measurements and physical examination findings. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the level of bAb measured by ELISA on days 1, 29, 43, 57, 209, and 394. The secondary objective endpoints were titer of SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb on days 1, 29, 43, 57, 209, and 394, and seroconversion on days 29, 43, 57, 209, and 394 as measured by an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb titer from below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to ≥LLOQ, or a 4-times higher titer in participants with pre-existing nAb titers.</p>

Descriptive results of safety and immunogenicity analyses are presented. Analyses were performed by treatment group overall (2 cohorts combined) and for each cohort individually. Safety analyses were based on the safety set consisting of all randomly assigned participants who received any study vaccination, except solicited ARs which were based on the solicited safety set comprising all participants who were randomly assigned, received any study injection and contributed any solicited AR data. Safety analyses are presented as counts, percentages, and associated Clopper–Pearson 95% confidence intervals, as appropriate, for local reactions, systemic events and any unsolicited adverse events, MAAEs and SAEs according to preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 23.0) by group. Summary statistics were provided for abnormal laboratory values and grading shifts.</p>
                <p id="p0120">Immunogenicity analyses were performed in the per-protocol dataset comprised of all randomly assigned participants who had baseline data available and at least one post-injection assessment for the analysis endpoint, complied with two injection schedule and timings of immunogenicity blood sampling with post-injection results available for at least one assay component, and did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline nor major protocol deviations that could impact the immunogenicity analysis. For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean (GM) of specific bAb levels and GM titers (GMT) for nAb with the corresponding 95% CI at each timepoint are reported. Descriptive summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum are also provided. Antibody values reported as below the LLOQ were replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that were greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) were converted to the ULOQ.

              <p id="p0190">In this randomized, controlled phase 2 trial, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, administered as a two-dose vaccination regimen at 50 and 100 µg, exhibited robust immune responses and an acceptable safety profile in healthy adults aged 18 years and older. Local and systemic adverse reactions were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity, were ≤4 days of median duration and were less commonly reported in older compared with younger adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by both doses of mRNA-1273 within 28 days after the first vaccination, and rose substantially to peak titers by 14 days after the second vaccination, exceeding levels of convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. The antibodies remained elevated through the last timepoint assessed at 57 days. Neutralizing responses met criteria for seroconversion within 28 days after the first vaccination in the majority of participants, with rates of 100% observed at 14 and 28 days after the second vaccination. While no formal statistical testing was done, binding and neutralizing antibody responses were generally comparable in participants who received the 100 µg mRNA-1273 and the 50 µg dose at all time points and across both age groups. Overall, the results of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial extend previous immunogenicity and safety results for mRNA-1273 in the phase 1 study in an expanded cohort including participants older than 55 years of age <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0195">The safety and reactogenicity profile of the mRNA-1273 vaccine through 28 days after the last dose was consistent with data previously published for other mRNA vaccines, including those of recent COVID-19 studies <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Solicited local and systemic symptoms were reported more frequently after mRNA-1273 than placebo and were reported at higher frequencies after the second dose. The occurrence of some solicited AR, fever and chills for example, were higher in participants who received 100 µg compared with 50 µg of mRNA-1273; however, the reactogenicity was generally not dose-dependent. The reported rates in participants ≥55 years of age tended to be lower than in participants 18–55 years of age, although formal statistical comparisons were not performed. Unsolicited AEs, including severe AEs, regardless of relationship to study vaccination, occurred at similar frequencies across the mRNA groups and placebo groups in both age cohorts. Treatment-related AEs occurred at higher rates in the mRNA group compared with placebo in younger participants, attributed to a greater frequency of injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, induration) reported as unsolicited events per criteria described in the protocol. The safety profile of mRNA-1273 seen in the two age cohorts in this study was also consistent with the results observed in the phase 1 trial of mRNA-1273 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0200">Neutralizing antibody levels have been shown to correlate with protection against viral diseases; however, immune correlates to SARS-CoV-2 in humans are less well-understood <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Moreover, robust and comparable bAb concentrations and nAb titers were observed at both mRNA-1273 dose levels and were substantially enhanced following the second vaccination to levels higher than those in human convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients. Overall, these data indicate dose-dependent immune responses to the first and second vaccinations with both doses of mRNA-1273 and confirm that a robust immune response is generated at both 50 and 100 µg dose levels.</p>

              <p id="p0210">While this was the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the mRNA-1273 vaccine, there are some limitations. The study population was not designed at the time to be representative of those at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Importantly, the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine is being assessed in larger and more diverse populations in the 30,000 participant-phase 3 Coronavirus Efficacy and Safety Study (COVE) study. Additionally, the present study was not designed for statistical comparison of superiority or equivalence between doses of mRNA-1273; thus, conclusions are necessarily qualitative. Although antibody responses were generated by mRNA-1273 that, on average, exceeded those of convalescent sera, at the present time a serologic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Additional data informing the duration of immunogenicity and the longer-term safety of mRNA-1273, will be provided in the 13-month follow-up to the end-of-study in this trial, as well as from the expanded testing in the ongoing COVE trial.</p>

The 13-month end-of study assessment of this trial and the ongoing phase 3 COVE trial may provide additional longer-term data on the safety and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 vaccine.</p>
