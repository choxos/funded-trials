                <p>Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form a semi-permeable barrier between parenchymal hepatocytes and the blood. LSECs participate in liver metabolism, clearance of pathological agents, immunological responses, architectural maintenance of the liver and synthesis of growth factors and cytokines. LSECs also play an important role in coagulation through the synthesis of Factor VIII (FVIII). Herein, we phenotypically define human LSECs isolated from fetal liver using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Isolated LSECs were cultured and shown to express endothelial markers and markers specific for the LSEC lineage. LSECs were also shown to engraft the liver when human fetal liver cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice with liver specific expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) transgene (uPA-NOG mice). Engrafted cells expressed human Factor VIII at levels approaching those found in human plasma. We also demonstrate engraftment of adult LSECs, as well as hepatocytes, transplanted into uPA-NOG mice. We propose that overexpression of uPA provides beneficial conditions for LSEC engraftment due to elevated expression of the angiogenic cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor. This work provides a detailed characterization of human midgestation LSECs, thereby providing the means for their purification and culture based on their expression of CD14 and CD32 as well as a lack of CD45 expression. The uPA-NOG mouse is shown to be a permissive host for human LSECs and adult hepatocytes, but not fetal hepatoblasts. Thus, these mice provide a useful model system to study these cell types in vivo. Demonstration of human FVIII production by transplanted LSECs encourages further pursuit of LSEC transplantation as a cellular therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form a layer partially separating hepatocytes from the blood in liver sinusoids. LSECs play a number of important roles including blood filtration, cytokine secretion and immune regulation <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0077255-Banshodani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. LSECs differ from vascular endothelial cells in that they lack a basal membrane and have large pores called fenestrae. Fenestrae allow passage of plasma and particles between blood and the space of Disse, thus allowing hepatocytes to perform their metabolic functions <xref rid="pone.0077255-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. LSECs originate during embryogenesis from the capillary endothelium of the septum transversum <xref rid="pone.0077255-Couvelard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Between 5 and 20 weeks’ gestation LSECs lose their basal membranes, acquire fenestrations and start production of extracellular matrix components.</p>
              <p>Functional differences between LSECs and vascular endothelial cells are further reflected in the proteome. There are, however, inconsistencies in the published phenotypes of LSECs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For instance, some researchers describe LSECs as CD31<sup>−</sup> (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1<sup>−</sup>), CD34<sup>−</sup> and von Willebrand Factor (vWF)<sup>−</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0077255-Couvelard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0077255-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, whereas others have observed expression of these markers on LSECs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Benten1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Follenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of freshly isolated human LSECs for study has in some cases led to the reliance on culture expanded LSECs. As in vitro culture generally has strong affects on gene expression, the phenotypic profile of cultured cells is likely to differ from that of LSECs in their natural state. Differences between mouse and human LSECs in cell-surface expression of immune-modulatory factors have also been suggested <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Knolle1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. With these points in mind, we endeavored to profile the expression of cell-surface antigens on freshly-isolated LSECs obtained from fetal human livers.</p>
              <p>One of the many important functions of LSECs is production of Factor VIII (FVIII) <xref rid="pone.0077255-Do1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. FVIII is a blood coagulation factor, the deficit of which causes hemophilia A, a lethal disease without treatment. Therapeutic administration of recombinant FVIII prevents fatal bleeding. Transplantation of LSECs could provide a permanent source of FVIII and a cure for hemophilia A. Successful transplantation of rodent LSECs has been described in the CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV, DPPIV) knockout rat <xref rid="pone.0077255-Malhi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and in a hemophilia A mouse model <xref rid="pone.0077255-Follenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Kumaran1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Benten et al. demonstrated a dispersed distribution of LSECs shortly after transplant into mice with long-term survival in the liver <xref rid="pone.0077255-Benten1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Transplantation of human LSECs with production FVIII has not been described.</p>
              <p>We report transplantation of human liver cells into NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup> Il2 rg<sup>tm1Sug</sup> Tg(Alb-Plau)11-4</italic>/ShiJic (uPA-NOG) mice. These are immunodeficient mice, which have a mouse urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) transgene expressed under a murine albumin promoter <xref rid="pone.0077255-Suemizu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This mouse has been successfully transplanted with human adult hepatocytes. In this study, we sought to evaluate liver engraftment in uPA-NOG mice transplanted with human fetal liver cells and adult liver cells, for comparison. Our findings indicate that LSECs readily engraft the livers of uPA-NOG mice and produce FVIII that can be measured in the plasma.</p>

Standard curves were generated using VisuCal-F Frozen Calibrator plasma (Affinity Biologicals), representing a pool of human plasma collected from a minimum of 20 donors and FVIII activity was calibrated as 108% of the secondary coagulation standard lot #4 reference standard from the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. According to the lot #4 reference standard, the VisuCal-F Frozen Calibrator plasma is equivalent to 0.95 IU/ml FVIII. An additional human plasma sample, used in the assay as an independent positive control, was obtained from our institute and handled in a similar fashion as the murine plasma samples. Each plasma sample was diluted by four serial dilutions (4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-fold) with ELISA sample diluent and measured in triplicate. Data are shown as the undiluted mean percent-value of the lot #4 reference standard ± standard deviation from results obtained with samples diluted 8-fold.</p>

                <title>Identification and Phenotypic Characterization of Human Fetal LSECs</title>
                <p>Previously we described a method for the discrimination of fetal liver cells based on the combined expression of the surface markers CD326 (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) and the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14, and a lack of the blood cell marker CD45. Whereas cells expressing high levels of CD326 and low levels of CD14 represent hepatoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, region D) <xref rid="pone.0077255-Fomin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, another population of cells identified by this staining schema, which we refer to as CD14<sup>++</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, region C), was found to express significantly more CD31 mRNA than cells found in groups B or D (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). As CD31 is a possible marker for both sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>; we hypothesized that the CD14<sup>++</sup> cells may contain LSECs and, therefore, studied expression of other likely markers of sinusoidal endothelium on these cells. We initially subdivided the CD14<sup>++</sup> population into two populations: CD14<sup>++</sup>CD326<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>++</sup>CD326<sup>−</sup>. This was originally done because of an unrelated interest in CD326 as a marker of hepatocytic precursors. We isolated four populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, regions A, B, C and D) and performed expression analysis, by qPCR, for genes associated with endothelial cells. Among the four populations, only CD14<sup>++</sup> cells expressed endothelial cell markers CD144 (VE-cadherin), CD202b (angiopoietin-1 or TIE-2) and CD309 (VEGF receptor 2). These cells also expressed the coagulation factors vWF and FVIII, which are produced by LSECs. There was no significant difference in expression of these five genes between the CD326<sup>+</sup> and CD326<sup>−</sup> subpopulations of CD14<sup>++</sup> cells (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.18). Consequently, subsequent experiments did not distinguish among CD14<sup>++</sup> cells based on CD326 expression.</p>

                <p>CD32 is another antigen with a similar pattern of expression as CD14 on liver endothelial cells. A low magnification image reveals widespread staining of CD14 and CD32 in the parenchyma of a 24 weeks’ gestation liver, but neither antigen stained endothelial cells found in large vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). The same pattern of staining was observed using polyclonal antibody that recognizes only the CD32b isoform of CD32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2E–F</xref>). High magnification images of CD32 and CD14 show strong co-staining on cells lining liver sinusoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2</xref> G–I). Moreover, co-staining of CD32 and CD105 on cells lining liver sinusoids but not on vascular endothelial cells confirm CD32 as a specific marker of LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2</xref> J–L).</p>
                <p>The vascular endothelial cell markers CD31, CD34 and CD144 were confirmed to be expressed on LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2M–O</xref>). Additionally, FVIII expression was found expressed by LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2P–Q</xref>). vWF expression was found on LSECs as well as vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g002">Fig. 2R</xref> and data not shown). Thus based on the antigen expression patterns observed by epifluorescence microscopy, the expression of CD14 and CD32 can be used to identify and isolate FVIII expressing LSECs.</p>
                <p>A broader phenotypic characterization was performed on freshly isolated fetal liver cells seeking further evidence that CD14<sup>++</sup> cells are LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

Receptors expressed on CD14<sup>++</sup> cells included CD40, CD71 (transferrin receptor) and CD105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The angiopoietic growth factor receptors CD202b and CD309 were also expressed. Additionally, CD271 (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) and CD333 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) were expressed. A number of molecules associated with immune function were analyzed as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), with high levels of CD32 expression being notable. Lower levels of CD16 (Fcγ receptor III) were also observed. CD284 (toll-like receptor 4) and HLA-DR expression were also detected. Among the cell-surface enzymes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), expression of CD26 and CD73 (ecto-5′-nucleotidase) were the highest, but CD10 (membrane metallo-endopeptidase), CD13 (alanine aminopeptidase) and CD38 (cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase) were also expressed at moderate levels. Lastly, high levels of CD36 (thrombospondin receptor), CD59 (protectin) and CD90 (Thy-1) were measured, and low levels CD141 (thrombomodulin) expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
                <p>LSECs share many phenotypic similarities to other parenchymal and sinusoidal cells. In particular, macrophages (Kupffer-Browicz cells) found adjacent to LSECs within the liver sinusoids have in the past been difficult to distinguish from LSECs owing to their many similarities and close association within the liver tissue. Liver macrophages were excluded from our flow cytometric analysis of LSECs based on their expression of CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Macrophages express high levels of CD45 unlike LSECs. Both cell types express similar levels of CD14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) as well as the endothelial cell markers CD31 and CD105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). CD32 was also found to be expressed by macrophages, but at modestly lower levels than found on LSECs. Conversely, HLA-DR expression was notably higher on macrophages than on LSECs. Among the antigens studied, CD45 provides the clearest separation of LSECs and macrophages.</p>

The percentage of human cells in the liver varied in different experiments reaching up to 27% maximum of live cells and had a tendency to increase with time after transplantation. Non-hematopoietic cells repopulated mouse livers up to 8%. This frequency did not significantly increased beyond 130 days of engraftment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077255-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).

We did not notice any significant damage nor increased proliferation among murine LSECs (data not shown). uPA plays an important role in angiogenesis and liver regeneration <xref rid="pone.0077255-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Bueno1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Thus, we tested if the levels of VEGF were increased in uPA-NOG mice. We compared three groups of mice: uPA-NOG homozygous, uPA-NOG hemizygous, and NSG – immunodeficient mice with no uPA transgene. Each group contained 9 mice of different ages and sexes in the same proportions.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Successful transplantation of human liver cells into uPA-NOG mice was demonstrated resulting in engraftment of LSECs and production of human FVIII. We present an extensive phenotypic profile of fetal LSECs, which should prove valuable in future efforts in the identification, isolation and study of LSECs. Freshly isolated and transplanted LSECs can be reliably identified based on their expression of CD14 and CD32 as well as a lack of CD45 staining to exclude hematopoietic cells such as macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that whereas fetal and adult LSECs engrafted uPA-NOG mice, only adult hepatocytes could engraft uPA-NOG mice.</p>
              <p>Despite numerous studies describing LSECs, their molecular identity remains a controversial issue <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We sought to provide a thorough phenotypic description of freshly-isolated fetal LSECs to better understand the differences between these cells and other endothelial cells. We observed a sizable population of cells expressing mid to high levels of CD14 (CD14<sup>++</sup> cells) in human fetal livers, which were neither hematopoietic nor parenchymal cells. Previously, expression of CD14 was described on human fetal LSECs after 20 weeks of gestation <xref rid="pone.0077255-Couvelard2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, in adult human liver sections <xref rid="pone.0077255-Scoazec1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and on rat LSECs during endotoxemia <xref rid="pone.0077255-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We also observed CD14 expression on LSECs in tissue sections as young as 9.5 weeks’ gestation and by flow cytometry on 13 weeks’ gestation livers. CD14 is a receptor for lipopolysaccharide, which together bind CD284. Our results demonstrate constitutive expression of these molecules prior to any exposure of the LSECs to lipopolysaccharide from the gut, as was also suggested for murine LSECs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Uhrig1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Flow cytometric analysis revealed expression of endothelial cell markers such as CD31, CD34 and CD105 on LSECs. CD32 expression has been shown on LSECs, but not vascular endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0077255-Scoazec2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and we show high levels of CD32 expression, as well as the CD32b isoform, on fetal LSECs. We also did not observe expression of CD32 on vascular endothelial cells in the liver. LSECs are also known to express a number of molecules associated with antigen presentation <xref rid="pone.0077255-Elvevold1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Knolle1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We observed expression of CD4, CD11c, CD40, CD54 and HLA-DR, but we did not detect any expression of the T-cell co-activation ligands CD80 and CD86, in contrast to what has been reported for murine LSECs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Knolle1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In mice, LSECs have been shown to promote T-cell tolerance, thus these cells play an important role in allogeneic liver transplantation <xref rid="pone.0077255-Onoe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0077255-vonOppen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The tolerizing properties of LSECs may allow for greater mismatch in major histocompatibility antigens when considering allogeneic LSEC transplantation as a therapy for hemophilia A.</p>
              <p>Different animal models have been used to study LSEC transplantation. For instance, DPPIV deficient rats were shown to incorporate DPPIV<sup>+</sup> rat LSECs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Malhi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

In some experiments livers of recipient animals were preconditioned by irradiation <xref rid="pone.0077255-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> or chemically <xref rid="pone.0077255-Follenzi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Malhi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> in order to disrupt the endogenous sinusoidal layers. In the present study uPA-NOG mice were used without preconditioning. No defects in LSECs were apparent in these mice, yet they provided conditions beneficial for engraftment of human LSECs. We hypothesized that overexpression of uPA, an important component of extracellular matrix network in the liver of these mice, aids in creating a permissive microenviroment for LSEC engraftment. A role of uPA has been shown in liver repair and remodeling <xref rid="pone.0077255-Bezerra1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. uPA activates MMPs which in turn trigger VEGF signaling <xref rid="pone.0077255-Mohammed1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. VEGF cleavage by MMPs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, plasmin <xref rid="pone.0077255-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, or directly by uPA <xref rid="pone.0077255-Plout1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> is required for its mitogenic function. Furthermore, uPA/uPA receptor system is required for VEGF induced cell migration <xref rid="pone.0077255-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Additionally, uPA gene therapy of liver cirrhosis has been observed to result in upregulation of VEGF, promoting liver regeneration <xref rid="pone.0077255-Bueno1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. VEGF stimulates liver regeneration by specifically recruiting LSECs <xref rid="pone.0077255-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-LeCouter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Conversely, blocking of VEGF in injured livers prevents migration of LSEC precursors from the bone marrow <xref rid="pone.0077255-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. uPA-NOG mice have increased level of VEGF in the livers, suggesting that overexpression of uPA is resulting not only in an impaired liver parenchyma but also providing the angiogenic signaling required for successful LSEC engraftment.</p>
              <p>We confirmed the observation that the uPA-NOG mouse is a permissive host for adult human hepatocytes <xref rid="pone.0077255-Suemizu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, we observed no definitive evidence of fetal hepatocyte engraftment, in line with a prior study demonstrating superior engraftment with adult hepatocytes compared to fetal cells <xref rid="pone.0077255-Haridass1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Others have reported engraftment of fetal-liver derived hepatocytes in mice <xref rid="pone.0077255-Schmelzer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Nowak1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. There are notable differences between fetal and adult parenchymal cells, but which of these differences account for the poor engraftment of fetal cells in the adult liver environment are still unknown <xref rid="pone.0077255-Fomin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Schmelzer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Demonstration of successful human LSEC transplantation and production of FVIII offers hope for the development of a cellular therapy for hemophilia A. Hemophilia A treatment currently requires lifelong administration of plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII. This treatment, although lifesaving, is associated with immune reactions, unending medical care and considerable cost <xref rid="pone.0077255-Mannucci1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, about 30% of children receiving recombinant or plasma derived FVIII infusions developed inhibitory antibodies to it <xref rid="pone.0077255-Gouw1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Successful transplantation of a sufficient number of LSECs capable of prolonged, or even life-long, FVIII production would be a significant advancement for the treatment of hemophilia A.</p>
              <p>We demonstrate that LSECs are the only source of FVIII production in the fetal human liver and that these cells continue to secret FVIII after transplantation into mice. Therefore we suggest that fetal LSECs could be a potential cell source for human transplantation for treatment of hemophilia A. Fetal liver has been used as a source for human transplantation before <xref rid="pone.0077255-Muench1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077255-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Nonetheless, the number of LSECs that can be harvested from fetal tissue is limited by their size and gestation age. If fetal LSECs could be successfully expanded ex vivo while maintaining their functional properties after transplantation, then sufficient donor cells may be obtained. Successful cellular therapy for hemophilia A will depend on a number of factors including the number of cells in the graft, the frequency of transplants, the ability of the transplanted cells to engraft, the capacity of the engrafted cells to grow and their survival in a foreign host. Alternatively, the technology to produce patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells that can be genetically corrected and then expanded and differentiated into LSECs offers another possible treatment for Hemophilia A. Such a therapy would also depend on adequate cell culture systems to produce a graft of sufficient size as well as development of robust and safe technologies for the creation of pluripotent stem cells and performing the required genetic therapy on these cells. A deeper understanding of the embryonic and fetal development of LSECs and use of the uPA-NOG mouse model can aid in the development of such therapies.</p>
