              <abstract>
                <p>The role of systemic autoimmunity in human traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other forms of brain injuries is recognized but not well understood. In this study, a systematic investigation was performed to identify serum autoantibody responses to brain-specific proteins after TBI in humans. TBI autoantibodies showed predominant immunoreactivity against a cluster of bands from 38–50 kDa on human brain immunoblots, which were identified as GFAP and GFAP breakdown products. GFAP autoantibody levels increased by 7 days after injury, and were of the IgG subtype predominantly. Results from in vitro tests and rat TBI experiments also indicated that calpain was responsible for removing the amino and carboxyl termini of GFAP to yield a 38 kDa fragment. Additionally, TBI autoantibody staining co-localized with GFAP in injured rat brain and in primary rat astrocytes. These results suggest that GFAP breakdown products persist within degenerating astrocytes in the brain. Anti-GFAP autoantibody also can enter living astroglia cells in culture and its presence appears to compromise glial cell health. TBI patients showed an average 3.77 fold increase in anti-GFAP autoantibody levels from early (0–1 days) to late (7–10 days) times post injury. Changes in autoantibody levels were negatively correlated with outcome as measured by GOS-E score at 6 months, suggesting that TBI patients with greater anti-GFAP immune-responses had worse outcomes. Due to the long lasting nature of IgG, a test to detect anti-GFAP autoantibodies is likely to prolong the temporal window for assessment of brain damage in human patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with approximately 2 million reported TBI events in the US annually. The pathogenesis of TBI involves two components: the initial mechanical injury, and subsequent secondary cell death that expands the core lesion <xref rid="pone.0092698-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092698-Mondello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. During acute neuronal necrosis, calpains are hyper-activated, while caspases are activated in apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0092698-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Animal model studies and clinical data both indicate that blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown frequently follows head trauma <xref rid="pone.0092698-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Mondello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Shlosberg1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Blyth1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Cell death within the first day following TBI promotes release of brain proteins and their breakdown products (i.e., putative biomarkers) from injured cells into biofluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood <xref rid="pone.0092698-Mondello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Identified biomarkers observed in human biofluids post TBI include neuron specific enolase (NSE), glia calcium-binding protein S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), ubiquitin carboxyl hydrolase-like 1 (UCH-L1), neurofilament proteins, and αII-spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) <xref rid="pone.0092698-Brophy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Quantitative detection of these biomarkers in biofluids would support a relatively simple and straightforward means of detecting brain injury. Because TBI diagnosis currently relies primarily on MRI and/or CT scans and neurological assessments, blood-based biomarker tests would represent a valuable new clinical tool <xref rid="pone.0092698-Mondello3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
              <p>After TBI and rupture of the BBB, brain proteins (potential biomarkers) released from damaged brain cells enter the bloodstream where they may trigger an immune response. This study reports the results of a primary screen to determine which brain biomarkers become targets of the immune system after TBI. Autoimmunity involves the development of antibodies against self-antigens, or autoantibodies. Depending on subtype, antibodies can be maintained within the bloodstream for years. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an example of an autoimmune disease that involves a central nervous system (CNS) antigen. Patients with MS develop circulating autoantibodies against MBP <xref rid="pone.0092698-Ponomarenko1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Reports have documented brain-directed autoimmunity in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, epilepsy, and paraneoplastic syndromes <xref rid="pone.0092698-Dambinova1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Additional studies have reported autoimmune responses in spinal cord injury <xref rid="pone.0092698-Ankeny1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Hauben1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In human TBI, however, autoimmunity has only been examined in a limited way and focused on autoantibodies against preselected antigens such as MBP, S100B, and glutamate receptors <xref rid="pone.0092698-Ponomarenko1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Hedegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Goryunova1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Tanriverdi et al. also identified the presence of anti-pituitary antibodies in patient serum 3 years after head trauma <xref rid="pone.0092698-Tanriverdi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Tanriverdi2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Mostly recently, Marchi et al. showed that college American football players may experience repeated BBB-disruption and serum surges both S100b and subacute auto-S100B antibodies. They further identified a correlation of serum S100B, auto-antibodies and white matter disruption <xref rid="pone.0092698-Marchi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the present study, we employed a global, systematic neuroproteomics approach to discover the predominant brain autoantigens associated with human TBI. The study set included 53 patients with severe TBI, and age-matched healthy controls. Serum samples from each individual collected on days 0–10 post TBI were screened against human brain lysate by western blotting to visualize autoantigens. Then tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the autoantigens. Remarkably, TBI patients developed autoantibodies that were directed primarily against GFAP and its breakdown products (BDP). GFAP is an intermediate filament protein specifically localized to the cytoskeleton of mature astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0092698-Middeldorp1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This report represents a characterization of anti-GFAP and GFAP-BDP autoantibodies post TBI and an initial evaluation of their clinical relevance. We hypothesize that post-translational modified GFAP could breakdown the self-tolerance and preferably serve as the immunodominant autoantigen to trigger autoimmune response following TBI. In addition, anti-GFAP autoantibodies might also provide the basis for a novel, blood-based diagnostic test for human TBI in the subacute phase.</p>

The local ethics and hospital management committees also approved the protocols. Informed consent was written. Archived deidentified biosamples (serum) are used for this study. Samples from adult severe TBI patients were analyzed retrospectively. Patient serum samples were from Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX; n = 16), University of Florida (Gainesville, FL; n = 10) and University of Pécs (Pécs, Hungary; n = 27). To be considered a TBI patient, the following criteria had to be met: Patients &gt;18 years of age with severe TBI defined as having a sum Glasgow coma score (GCS) of ≤8 on the post-resuscitation admission neurological examination and requiring a ventriculostomy catheter for clinical management. Serial serum samples were collected from enrollment to up to day 10 from 53 severe TBI patients. The number of blood samples per patient ranged from 2–11. For controls, 96 volunteers at least 18 years of age with no history of significant trauma were recruited under informed consent, unless falling under exclusion criteria. Exclusion Criteria: 1) No ventriculostomy needed or could not be placed; 2) Life-threatening systemic injury (AIS = 5) in any organ system other than head or spine; 3) Severe pre-existing chronic disease; 4) History of severe psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia); 5) History of prenatal retardation. One blood sample was collected per control individual. All patient identifiers were kept confidential.</p>

In addition, all experiments were done in a manner consistent with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. For the penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) model, rats were generated at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and the WRAIR IACUC approved all experimental procedures. PBBI was induced on anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) by stereotactically inserting a perforated steel probe through the right frontal cortex of the anesthetized rat and rapidly inflating the probe’s elastic tubing into an elliptical shaped balloon to 12.5% of total rat brain volume <xref rid="pone.0092698-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The control groups consisted of sham surgery or naïve animals.</p>
                <p>All other experiments involving rats were performed at Banyan Biomarkers with University of Florida IACUC approval. Rats injured by the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model were generated as described <xref rid="pone.0092698-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. CCI was induced on anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan). Where indicated, calpain inhibitor SNJ-1945 (100 mg/kg bolus, i.v., in a formulation of PEG 12.5%/EtOH 60%/PBS) was administered immediately after CCI. After 24 h, animals were anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation. The cortex and hippocampus were removed from both hemispheres, rinsed in ice cold PBS, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.</p>

                <p>Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels and electrotransferred to PVDF membrane. PVDF membranes were then clamped into the Mini-Protean II Multiscreen apparatus (Bio-Rad), and individual lanes were blocked and probed with human sera diluted at 1∶100, unless otherwise noted. Secondary antibodies used were either alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG+IgM or AP-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG diluted 1∶10,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Quantification of autoantibody reactivity on immunoblots was performed via computer-assisted densitometric scanning (Epson 8836XL high-resolution scanner and NIH Image J densitometry software). Autoantibody levels were expressed in arbitrary densitometry units. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. The Mann-Whitney U test (two tailed) was used to evaluate the difference between two groups, with p&lt;0.05 taken as significant. Spearman correlations were used to explore the relationship between fold change in autoantibody levels and outcome measures.</p>

The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (99% water/1% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (75% acetonitrile/25% water with 0.1% formic acid). Separation was achieved using a run time of 111 min. The elution gradient was from 2% to 40% B over 90 min, the followed by 40% to 80% B over 5 min and held for 5 min before returning to the initial mobile phase composition (2% B). Tandem mass spectra were collected on a Thermo LTQ-XL (Thermo-Fisher) using a data dependent acquisition. MS/MS spectra were extracted by Xcalibur version 2.7.0. All MS/MS spectra were analyzed using Sequest (Thermo-Fisher; version SRF v. 5) and X! Tandem (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thegpm.org">www.thegpm.org</ext-link>; version 2007.01.01.1).

                <title>Circulating Brain-specific Autoantibodies Developed after TBI in Humans</title>
                <p>To screen for brain-directed autoantibodies, serum samples from severe human TBI patients (n = 53) or non-head injured normal controls were screened against human post-mortem brain lysate by western blotting. A manifold immunoblotting apparatus was used to screen up to 16 serum samples per blot in parallel. To determine whether brain-directed autoantibodies were pre-existing or triggered by injury, serum samples drawn during the first 24 hours after injury (Day 0) or on the 10th day after injury (Day 10) initially from five subjects were compared individually to normal controls (n = 5). Although signal intensity varied among patients, Day 10 TBI sera in 3 out of five subjects (P1, P2, P4) recognized a cluster of protein bands with molecular weights (MW) between 38 and 50 kDa, based on comparison to MW markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). Day 0 sera from the same TBI patients or from normal individuals showed relatively little immunoreactivity in the 38–50 kDa region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). The origin of the bands in this region for normal subject in lane C2 is unknown. We had no prior medical histories for the normal individuals or whether they had previously experienced TBI. To explore the timing of autoantibody development post TBI further, the time course from one strongly reacting patient is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>
<bold>)</bold>. Importantly, autoantibody reactivity bands were only observed intensely from Day 6 to Day 10. In all, 9 of the 12 patients examined in this way showed increasing immunoreactivity toward the 38–50 kDa autoantigen cluster with time post injury, with variable signal intensities. We then expanded our autoantibody examination to 12 TBI patients up to Day 10. In 9 out of 12 TBI patients, autoantibodies against the 38–50 kDa cluster were first detectable from 4–7 days after injury, with levels rising thereafter up to Day 10. All 9 of these patients showed immunoreactivity toward the 38–50 kDa autoantigen by Day 7 (data not shown). Of the remaining 3 patients, 2/12 showed no signals, and 1/12 was positive toward the 38–50 kDa autoantigen at all time points examined. We do not know whether this particular positive patient had previously experienced TBI. These results indicated that brain injury triggered the development of circulating autoantibodies against the 38–50 kDa brain autoantigen.</p>

                <p>To determine whether TBI autoantibodies represented an immediate and temporary (IgM-based) or a sustained (IgG-based) immunoresponse, autoantibody subclass was examined. Results revealed that TBI autoantibodies were predominantly IgG (n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). To test for brain-specificity of the 38–50 kDa autoantigen, Day 10 TBI sera pooled from 4 patients were also screened against protein lysates made from a panel of human organs. The TBI-associated 38–50 kDa autoantigen cluster was detected in the brain, but not in the 8 other organs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>To extend these findings, the latest serum sample available from each of 53 severe TBI subjects (Day 4–10 post injury) was screened individually against human brain lysate using the manifold blotting assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold><bold>E</bold></xref> shows a quantitative analysis of the distribution of TBI-associated immunoreactive bands from these TBI patients.

The total number of all immunoreactive bands within each increment was then counted and plotted according to MW. Collectively, TBI patients showed the highest number of immunoreactive bands against brain antigens in the 35–55 kDa range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1E</bold></xref>). Although the MW of the brain autoantigen cluster measured by the software (35–55 K) differed slightly from the MW ladder (38–50 K), this assessment reveals that TBI patients showed a dominant immune response against unknown brain protein cluster in the 38–50 K range.</p>

                <p>Clustering of the autoantigen bands suggested they might be derived from a single protein. To reveal the identity of the autoantigen cluster, a neuroproteomics approach involving liquid chromatography separation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) was used. Human brain lysate proteins were first fractionated on a strong anion exchange column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>), separated by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>), and then the autoantigen was visualized on blots using pooled Day 10 TBI sera from 4 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). Multiple bands (of molecular weight 50 to 38 kDa) from fractions 20–22 were excised from gels, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D, E</bold></xref>). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was readily identified in several bands by multiple unique peptides, with high sequence coverage (43.8–56.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D, E</bold></xref>). To confirm that GFAP was the autoantigen, a duplicate blot of fractionated human brain lysate was probed with an anti-GFAP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2F</bold></xref>). The GFAP blot showed an almost identical banding pattern to that generated with human TBI sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g002"><bold>Fig. 2F</bold></xref>). Since the calculated molecular weight of GFAP should be 50 kDa, based on the multiple banding presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Figure 1C, D</bold></xref>), and the post-mortem nature of the human brain lysate we used as human brain protein source, we speculate that the lower molecular weight bands (46, 44, 40 and 38 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Figure 1E, F</bold></xref>) are likely to be breakdown products (BDP) of GFAP.</p>

Prior to probing the blot of human brain lysate, GFAP primary antibody or Day 10 TBI serum from each of 3 TBI patients was preincubated in the absence or presence of 10 μg purified GFAP or Tau. Tau was selected due to its similar MW to GFAP, multiple isoforms, brain specificity, brain enrichment, and association with neuronal damage. For the GFAP primary antibody, preincubation with GFAP prevented the antibody from binding to GFAP bands on the blot (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092698.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Similarly, for three TBI patients tested individually, preincubating Day 10 TBI serum samples with GFAP protein effectively blocked recognition of the brain autoantigen cluster, while Tau did not (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092698.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>).

Calpain activation is an established feature of rat PBBI <xref rid="pone.0092698-Zoltewicz2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Cortex was collected from the injured region of PBBI rats at 1 day post-injury, or from naïve and sham rats as controls, and examined for GFAP by western blot. Rat cortex at 1 day post-PBBI showed significantly increased GFAP breakdown to a 44 kDa and a 38 kDa fragment. In particular, the 38 kDa band was not observed in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). Similarly, cortex was examined from rats subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury <xref rid="pone.0092698-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In this experiment, CCI-injured rats were treated with calpain inhibitor SNJ or its vehicle immediately after CCI. Then 1 day later, cortex was examined by immunoblotting for αII-spectrin and GFAP. In vehicle-treated cortex, αII-spectrin showed breakdown to the calpain-specific SBDP145 fragment, while in SNJ-treated cortex, SBDP145 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Likewise, GFAP breakdown to 38 kDa was present in vehicle-treated injured cortex, but was significantly reduced in SNJ-treated cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). These results are consistent with GFAP breakdown associated with calpain after TBI in animal models.</p>

                <title>TBI Autoantibodies Recognized GFAP in Injured Rat Brain and Cultured Rat Astrocytes</title>
                <p>To determine whether TBI autoantibodies could recognize native GFAP in the brain, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. First, cortical sections from rats that had undergone CCI a day previously were probed with human normal serum, human Day 10 post-TBI serum, or anti-GFAP antibody. Normal serum showed little immunoreactivity, while human TBI serum and GFAP antibody detected cortical cells with the characteristic star-like shape of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>). Next human TBI serum and GFAP antibody were co-incubated on 5 μm sections of rat hippocampus, and visualized by double immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g006"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>). In such thin sections, immunofluorescence provides a reasonable measure of colocalization without the need for confocal microscopy. Normal serum showed little immunoreactivity in either control or CCI rat hippocampus (not shown). Human TBI autoantibodies produced minor staining of naive rat hippocampus, which did not overlap with GFAP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g006"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>). By contrast, in the injured hippocampus, TBI autoantibody immunostaining was elevated and partially colocalized with GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g006"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>). The fact that the overlap between TBI sera and anti-GFAP antibody is not perfectly aligned suggests that there are other autoantigens being recognized by the TBI sera. In any case, these data indicated that TBI autoantibodies were able to recognize GFAP or GFAP-BDP <italic>in vivo</italic> after brain injury.</p>

                <p>Next, the ability of TBI autoantibodies to bind GFAP in primary rat astrocytes was examined. This was done for two purposes: to test rigorously whether TBI autoantibodies bind to GFAP in astrocytes, and to determine whether calpain cleavage of GFAP affected the intensity of TBI autoantibody staining. After fixation, primary astrocyte cultures were either undigested or digested with calpain-2, then double-stained with anti-GFAP antibody plus either human normal serum or pooled Day 9–10 TBI sera (n = 3). Immunostaining was then imaged by confocal microscopy. In undigested cultures, GFAP antibody stained GFAP in astrocytes with a filamentous pattern (red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>
<bold>, left</bold>). Normal human serum showed only minor staining (green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>

<bold>, left</bold>). Staining by human normal serum was also unchanged by calpain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7B</bold></xref>). In contrast, GFAP antibody (red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7C</bold></xref>
<bold>, left</bold>), and pooled TBI sera (green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7C</bold></xref>

The staining intensities of GFAP antibody and TBI sera did not change after calpain digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7D</bold></xref>). This experiment confirmed that TBI autoantibodies were able to recognize GFAP in primary rat astrocytes. It also showed that staining intensity was independent of calpain digestion at least for the 3 TBI patient serum samples tested.</p>

                <p>We also examined the effects of anti-GFAP autoantibodies from human TBI serum on glial cells in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>). Either human TBI serum with no detectable anti-GFAP autoantibody (control serum) or human TBI serum with strong anti-GFAP autoantibody was incubated with living primary rat astrocytes in culture.

We observed that even in normal astrocytes, anti-GFAP can label cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g008"><bold>Figure 8C</bold></xref>) – interestingly, staining is more localized to the cell body and short processes that are more proximal to the cell body of astrocytes – suggesting that anti-GFAP might be inhibiting the assembly and/or function of GFAP, including the support of process extension. When cells were co-treated with calcium ionophore A23187 (20 μM), which activates calpain, glial cell bodies were even more prominently and diffusedly labeled with anti-GFAP autoserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g008"><bold>Figure 8D</bold></xref>).

                <p>The clinical and demographic characteristics of our 53 patients with severe TBI and 96 healthy normal controls are summarized in <bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092698.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>. Sera from all subjects were probed against human brain lysates using the manifold immunoblotting apparatus as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The appearance and intensity of a 38 kDa GFAP-BDP was used as a measure of autoantibody presence in each patient’s serum samples. Consistent with our earlier data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>), circulating autoantibody against GFAP-BDP was observed in sera of TBI patients 4–10 days after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g009"><bold>Fig. 9A</bold></xref>). Using western blots to evaluate the autoantibodies, our patient data is qualitative, rather than quantitative as would be obtained by ELISA. Nevertheless, we were able to evaluate the potential application of GFAP-BDP autoantibodies in diagnosis of subacute TBI, using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis which was performed to discriminate between head injured subjects and controls. The area under the curve (AUC) measures how well a parameter (in this case the level of GFAP-BDP autoantibody) can distinguish between two groups. The AUC was significant at 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.87, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g009"><bold>Fig. 9B</bold></xref>), indicating that autoantibody level did distinguish head-injured from healthy individuals. From the ROC curve, an optimal cutoff value of 8.49 (arbitrary densitometry units) was defined. Based on this value, 64.2% of all TBI patients (34/53) had a positive autoantibody response to GFAP-BDP (day 4–10), compared to only 15.2% in normal controls (15/96) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g009"><bold>Fig. 9C</bold></xref>). Our previous data showed that GFAP and BDP levels return to baseline by 3–4 days after severe TBI <xref rid="pone.0092698-Mondello4" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, we hypothesize that the acute serum level (within first 24 h) should have some degree of correlation to the subsequent development of autoantibody (autoab) response (day 4–10). In fact, we found a significant correlation between the serum level of GFAP protein at 1 day post injury and serum level of GFAP autoantibodies at 4 to 10 days post injury (p = 0.048) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g009"><bold>Fig. 9D</bold></xref>). We also investigated the potential correlations among GFAP-BDP autoantibody levels, injury severity, and prognostic outcome. The best Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) within the first 24 hours after injury was used to classify the severity of TBI. Patients with higher GCS scores of 9–13 (less severe) had significantly lower autoantibody levels (p = 0.029) than patients with lower GCS scores of 3–8 (most severe) <bold>(</bold>

A determination of the number of TBI patients that developed anti-GFAP autoantibodies post TBI was obtained by computing the fold change in anti-GFAP immunoreactivity over time for each patient. Only those patients having a late serum sample of Day 7 or beyond were selected for this analysis (45 patients). Based on the time course experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>), Day 7 was determined to be late enough to show an increased autoantibody response, if present. For each patient, the latest available serum sample (Day 7–10) was paired with the earliest available serum sample (Day 0–1), and blots of human brain lysate were probed with each pair. In this way, each patient served as his or her own control, thus bypassing the issue of variability. As a measure of the level of anti-GFAP autoantibodies in each patient, bands at 38 kDa were quantified by densitometry. The ratio of values for the late time point over the early time point was then computed for each patient, to give fold change in autoantibody levels with time post injury. In this analysis, only 45 out of the total 53 TBI subjects fulfilled our relative quantitative method inclusion criteria. The median fold increase of 38 kDa BDP levels was 1.66 times for the 45 TBI patients, with a maximum of 34.7 times, and a minimum of 0 (no immunoreactivity, 1 patient) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092698-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The average increase was 3.77. Thirty of the 45 TBI patients (67%) showed an increase of 1.5 times or more post TBI. For 43/45 patients, clinical outcome data was available. For these 43 patients, GOS-E (Glasgow outcome score at hospital discharge) ranged from 1–4, with 1 indicating death, 2 vegetative state, and 3–4 indicating severe disability. A significant negative correlation between fold change in anti-GFAP-BDP autoantibody levels and GOS-E score at hospital discharge was found (p = 0.03; Spearman r = −0.33) (data not shown). This is consistent with the correlation obtained between absolute anti-GFAP-BDP levels at Day 4–10 and GOSE-E (at 6 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g009"><bold>Fig. 9F</bold></xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, human severe TBI serum samples were screened in order to identify TBI-associated autoantigens. TBI autoantibodies showed common immunoreactivity against a cluster of bands in the 38–50 kDa region on brain immunoblots, which were identified as GFAP and GFAP-BDPs. Our previous report showed that GFAP protein from 38–50 kDa was present in CSF samples from human severe TBI patients <xref rid="pone.0092698-Zoltewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The present study is consistent with the conclusion that calpain was responsible for cleaving GFAP to 38 kDa. In TBI patient sera, GFAP autoantibody levels increased by 7 days after injury and were of the IgG subtype, suggesting that they could persist much longer. Preliminary data has shown that human post-TBI serum can sustain anti-GFAP autoantibodies for up to 6 months, the latest time point yet examined (unpublished observations). Thus the level of GFAP autoantibodies in serum could potentially serve as the basis of a test for TBI. Each patient could serve as their own control, with an acute serum sample (0–3 days post injury) establishing baseline levels of anti-GFAP immunoreactivity, and a later sample (7–10 days post injury) serving as a test for elevation.</p>
              <p>With the methods employed here, out of all the brain proteins represented on immunoblots, TBI serum recognized GFAP most strongly. Using similar methods, rat post-TBI serum did not show apparent immunoreactivity against GFAP (unpublished observations). This could be a result of sensitivity issues, the greater complexity of human disease, temporal differences, or a fundamental species difference. Human TBI serum recognized other bands on brain immunoblots besides GFAP, but at lower intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Similarly, when sections of injured rat hippocampus were probed with TBI serum, in addition to labeling GFAP, TBI serum also labeled material that did not co-localize with GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g006"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>). While these findings indicate that human TBI serum contained immunoreactivity against additional brain autoantigens, the combined data clearly show that TBI patients commonly developed autoantibodies against GFAP, evidenced both by western blotting and rat brain/astrocyte staining.</p>
              <p>When primary rat astrocytes were co-stained with GFAP antibody and TBI serum, the intensely stained, rounded cells had morphologies typical of dead/dying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7E, F</bold></xref>). Early steps in cell death include retraction of cellular processes and nuclear condensation <xref rid="pone.0092698-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Based on morphological criteria, the rounded cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7E, F</bold></xref> were likely dead or dying prior to fixation. Rounded astrocytes stained more intensely with TBI autoantibody than healthy cells. Cellular condensation, and the resulting concentration of GFAP into a reduced volume, was likely responsible for the increased intensity of staining. As a limit fragment of calpain digestion, the 38 kDa GFAP band may be a particularly persistent form of GFAP in dead or dying astrocytes. The intense staining of dead/dying astrocytes suggests that 38 kDa GFAP is stable even in the context of cell death. The important implication for TBI patients is that GFAP-BDPs may persist within degenerating astrocytes in the brain, thus facilitating it becoming a predominant immune target. In addition, we found that anti-GFAP autoantibody can gain entry to live glia cells in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold><bold>A–D</bold></xref>). This is consistent with previous work showing that anti-nuclear autoantibodies can also enter cells <xref rid="pone.0092698-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We further found that incubation with anti-GFAP autoserum causes cytotoxicity in glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g008"><bold>Figure 8E</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the presence of autoantibody to GFAP can be potentially pathogenic during the recovery phase of TBI.</p>
              <p>When rat brain sections were co-stained with GFAP antibody and TBI serum, signals from both were stronger in injured rat hippocampus than in naïve hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g006"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>). In injured brain, astrocytes respond by proliferating and upregulating GFAP in a process termed reactive gliosis <xref rid="pone.0092698-Buffo1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Condensation of damaged astrocytes or the persistence of 38 kDa GFAP may have also contributed to the increased staining. Alternatively, given that TBI autoantibodies detected the 38 kDa GFAP band most commonly on western blots, it is also possible that TBI autoantibodies preferred to bind to 38 kDa GFAP-BDP over intact GFAP. Not all TBI sera showed such a preference, since the pooled TBI sera in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g007"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref> detected GFAP in healthy cells (likely intact) with similar intensity to that in calpain-cleaved cells, and calpain digestion did not affect the intensity of staining. The preference of anti-GFAP autoantibodies for various GFAP bands is likely to differ among patients, since each patient’s immunoresponse is unique. This is a subject worth further investigation.</p>
              <p>Unidentified brain-directed autoantibodies in human blood can be found in normal subjects <xref rid="pone.0092698-Levin1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Here, anti-GFAP autoantibodies were present in 15.6% of normal individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092698-g009"><bold>Fig. 9C</bold></xref>). It is possible that some control individuals may have had previous unreported/minor head injuries or other undiagnosed neurological issues. It is thus possible that the response seen in normal subjects represents either a low concentration of natural antibodies that cross react with GFAP or specific anti-GFAP autoantibodies due to prior brain injury. When TBI-induced release of additional GFAP and BDPs can produce a boosting effect in such individuals resulting in more production of IgG against GFAP. Anti-GFAP autoantibodies have been preliminarily reported in other human disorders, such as in patients with Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias <xref rid="pone.0092698-Colasanti1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-DAndrea1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Mecocci2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, stroke <xref rid="pone.0092698-Dambinova1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Kamchatov1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, diabetes <xref rid="pone.0092698-GmezTourio1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, neurological disorders, multiple sclerosis <xref rid="pone.0092698-Poletaev1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Grny1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, autism <xref rid="pone.0092698-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and lead-exposed workers <xref rid="pone.0092698-Moneim1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Anti-GFAP antibodies in brain tumors of astrocytic origin (such as glioma and glioblastoma) have also been reported <xref rid="pone.0092698-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. While these reports reveal that anti-GFAP autoantibodies are associated with a variety of neurological pathologies, the present article represents the first description of anti-GFAP autoantibodies after TBI. We are also the first to identify that post-translationally modified GFAP (GFAP-BDP) is a preferred autoantigen that could contribute to the breakdown of self-tolerance of the immune system following TBI. Indeed, our concept that GFAP-BDP is an immunodominant brain autoantigen following TBI meets two key requirements for the immune system breaking tolerance to self-proteins <xref rid="pone.0092698-Darrah1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> : (i) Accessibility of the antigen to the immune system: The brain is considered an immune-privileged organ due to the lack of a lymphatic system, and protection by the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, the release of a brain protein (GFAP-BDP) in elevated quantity and a compromised BBB after TBI would fulfill the first requirement. (ii) Non-homeostatic state of the protein/altered-self (i.e., through non-tolerized post-translational modifications (PTMs) of self-protein). In the case of GFAP, the formation of GFAP-BDP by proteases such as calpain upon glial cell injury or death (by necrosis or apoptosis) following TBI fulfills this second requirement.</p>
              <p>There are some limitations for our current study. Fro example, measurement of autoantibodies by western blot-based methods might have limited clinical applications <xref rid="pone.0092698-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0092698-Pelayo1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In the future, it would also be valuable to develop an assay to measure anti-GFAP autoantibody levels in human blood reliably and quantitatively (e.g., an ELISA). In addition to measuring the presence of an autoantibody at a single time point, it would also be useful to quantify changes of anti-GFAP autoantibody over time after injury, as was done in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092698-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). In addition, anti-GFAP or GFAP-BDP autoantibodies are not limited to TBI, Thus caution should be exercised that anti-GFAP might not be a perfect subacute diagnostic of TBI as other factors can contribute to autoimmunity. Instead it might be a useful tool is showing the possibility that autoimmunity might play a role in individual and vulnerable subjects.</p>
              <p>Okonkwo et al. <xref rid="pone.0092698-Okonkwo1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and Papa et al. <xref rid="pone.0092698-Papa1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> both recently described the GFAP/BDP antigens are detected in serum after mild-moderate TBI. These studies found GFAP-BDP antigen detectable in blood (serum, plasma), which is different from the present study where anti-GFAP autoAb is identified in subacute period post-TBI. In fact, these complementary studies show that significant GFAP-BDP levels are also released into circulation after moderate-mild TBI. For future studies, it will be important also to examine if autoantibody to GFAP is induced after mild to moderate TBI. While levels of released GFAP decline rapidly after TBI <xref rid="pone.0092698-Mondello4" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0092698-Lumpkins1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, IgG-based autoantibodies could potentially last for days to months. Because of the long lasting nature of IgG, a test to detect anti-GFAP autoantibodies is likely to prolong the temporal window for assessing brain damage. Measuring patient titer over days to months following injury could provide additional information about patient outcome, progress or response to therapy.</p>
              <p>The mechanistic effect of anti-GFAP autoantibodies is unclear at this point. Such autoantibodies could be beneficial, pathogenic, or of no consequence. The existence anti-GFAP autoantibodies in ∼16% of apparently normal patients suggests a benign role, at least as long as the BBB is intact. The negative correlation between fold change in TBI autoantibody levels and GOS-E at discharge suggests that increased anti-GFAP autoantibody levels may indicate more severe injury. This provocative finding should be verified by additional studies. Regardless of their biological role, this study has demonstrated that anti-GFAP autoantibodies could potentially serve as a novel subacute and chronic biomarker for TBI in humans.</p>
