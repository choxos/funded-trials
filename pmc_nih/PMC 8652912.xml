            <p><bold>Lay Summary:</bold> The feasibility and acceptability of a 13-week lifestyle
behavior change program designed to reduce type 2 diabetes mellitus risk factors among
low-income women and children was tested. Participants were patients at a Federally
Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with a history of gestational diabetes or prediabetes and
their 8- to 12-year-old children. Program acceptability and feasibility were assessed
using surveys and interviews completed by participants and FQHC staff, and effects on
weight, diabetes risk factors, and lifestyle behaviors were explored. Forty-two
mother-child pairs were randomized to participate in intervention or control conditions.
Thirty-five pairs (83%) completed measurements. Participants and program leaders
positively rated content and engagement. A majority strongly agreed that weekly
activities were enjoyable (97%), applicable (96%), useful (97%), and motivational (96%).
Attendance averaged 65% across 2 intervention groups; delivery costs were estimated at
$225 per pair. There were no significant differences in body weight, body mass index,
waist circumference, blood glucose, diet quality, physical activity, sleep, or home
environment changes between intervention and control mothers or children. Findings from
this pilot study will inform a larger clinical trial to establish the efficacy of the
intervention on diabetes risk factors in FQHC patients.</p>

a behavioral lifestyle intervention on T2DM risk factors in women with a history of
GDM and their 8- to 12-year-old children. The intervention was developed and
delivered in collaboration with an FQHC in Southern Arizona serving more than
110 000 uninsured and underinsured patients. This work was university
scholar-initiated and guided but involved active participation and support by FQHC
colleagues through a formal subcontract and a research team consisting of university
researchers and FQHC personnel. The research team met bimonthly for 2 years
(2018-2020), and adaptation of intervention content was conducted in collaboration
with these colleagues.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Two FQHC clinic sites were selected to participate in the study. Participants
were recruited as mother-child dyads to either the intervention or a wait-listed
control condition. Female FQHC patients with a history of GDM during any of their
pregnancies and/or a prior diagnosis of prediabetes and who had children 8- to
12-years-old at time of study were identified through an electronic medical records
search and contacted by phone and postal mail to participate. The participating
child was required to be a biological child but did not have to be the direct
product of a pregnancy with GDM. Respondents meeting eligibility criteria were
invited to attend 1 of 6 information sessions held prior to the start of the
intervention in September 2019, where those who wished to participate provided
informed consent (mother) and assent (child), were assigned a study identification
number, and completed baseline measurements. Participants completing baseline
measurements were block randomized (block size of 4) to either the intervention or
wait-listed control conditions by selecting a numbered envelope with a blinded
treatment condition inside. Randomized participants were assigned to a clinic site
based on their preferred language (English or Spanish). Participants began the
13-week face-to-face group-based intervention within 2 weeks of completing baseline
measurements while wait-listed control families continued to receive FQHC standard
of care for persons with pre-diabetes (referral to a Registered Dietitian,
follow-ups with primary care provider every 6 months, redraw hemoglobin A1c every
6 months) over the same 13-week period. Intervention blinding was not possible with

session along with activities such as cooking demonstrations and family physical
activity. The intervention was delivered in a group-based format once weekly for 13
consecutive weeks in English or Spanish by bilingual group leaders. Group leaders,
who were selected from FQHC staff based on their nutrition and health competencies
(certified group fitness instructors and registered dietitian nutritionists), each
completed 16 h of group-based experiential and didactic training led by the research
team using standardized training materials that included a lifestyle coach manual to
ensure program fidelity and consistent delivery across both languages. Dyads
attended 1.5-h long sessions which were similarly structured, consisting of: family
physical activity, a small group (2-3 families) discussion on goal setting, a food
demonstration incorporating vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, and an activity
designed to increase foundational knowledge and skills related to healthy food
selection, family physical activity, and creating a home environment wherein healthy
behaviors and choices become the default. Mothers and children were divided into 2
groups during the last half of each session. Mothers participated in parenting
discussions which focused on strategies to engage the entire family in lifestyle
modification, while children engaged in age-appropriate physical activities. Every
third session, a behavioral health specialist led stress management and sleep
exercises for all participants.</p>

              <p>Program feasibility was assessed using participant recruitment and enrollment rates
and by fidelity of intervention delivery by FQHC staff, assessed by trained
researchers who observed 3 of 13 sessions for each group following an established
rubric. Program acceptability was assessed by session attendance, weekly
participant, and coach surveys (each consisting of 7 Likert-response questions
evaluating weekly curriculum topics for relevance, ease of understanding/delivery,
motivation, application to daily life, enjoyment, engagement, confidence) rated on a
0 to 3 scale; and, 3 open-ended questions soliciting best liked/least liked
activities and suggestions), observations of engagement of participants during
program activities by coaches and researchers, and participant retention rates.
Program costs were documented throughout the intervention period using a bottom-up
micro-costing approach that included direct medical and non-medical costs (eg,
personnel gross hourly salaries, intervention material costs, and overhead costs
related to use of facilities for prevention services). Potential for adoption,
integration, and scale were explored through semi-structured interviews with FQHC
staff and administrators. The interviews were conducted by a trained researcher who
was not part of the original research team or involved in the intervention.
Interviews were conducted after intervention and data collection were completed. The
interviewer probed for successes, challenges, alignment with the FQHC’s needs and
mission, leadership support, and opportunities for growth and sustainability.</p>
              <p>All continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics and presented
by treatment group. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency counts and
percentages. Baseline sociodemographic and clinical data were compared between the
intervention and wait-listed control groups. Dichotomous and ordinal variables were
examined using either a chi-square test or Fishers exact test, and continuous
measures were analyzed using a 2-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test or 2 sample

              <p>Due to scheduling constraints of the participating FQHC clinics (which offered
multiple programs in a limited space), the number of groups was consolidated from
the originally planned 3 groups (up to 10 dyads per group) per intervention or
wait-listed control condition to 2 groups (up to 15 dyads per group) per condition.
The COVID19 pandemic disrupted the recruitment and conduct of a second cohort of
participants planned for Spring 2020, reducing our sample size from N = 60
(anticipated) to N = 41 (actual). Program attendance averaged 65% across both
language formats, with the Spanish language session attendance exceeding 75%.
Session observations confirmed strong intervention adherence, and program delivery
within the 1.5 h per week allotted time frame. Coaches used evidence-based
information, encouraged participant comments and questions, and kept families
engaged in intervention activities “all or almost all the time (&gt;90%).”
Participants and lifestyle coaches positively rated the program content and
engagement strategies. Nearly all strongly agreed that weekly activities were
enjoyable (97%), applicable (96%), useful (97%), and motivated them to make
lifestyle changes (96%). Participants particularly enjoyed mindfulness/breathing
activities, learning to read nutrition labels, understanding the role of sleep, and
menu planning activities. Coaches positively rated ease of program implementation
(average 4.8/5.0). A majority (88%) of coaches indicated the program topics
motivated them to lead the sessions and that participants were actively engaged in
session activities. Mothers and lifestyle coaches preferred that activities were
delivered to the dyad unit versus separately to children and parents. Estimated
intervention delivery costs were approximately $225 per mother-child pair.</p>
              <p>Seven FQHC staff members participated in a one-on-one in-depth interview following
the intervention. Program successes identified by interviewees included the
development and successful delivery of a culturally sensitive, engaging, and
empowering family-based T2DM prevention program. The integration of a behavioral
health component was also considered a strength. Challenges included the limited
number of participants served by the research study compared to the needs of the
FQHC population, difficulties recruiting participants who met the study eligibility
criteria, and the logistics of coordinating the intervention across multiple clinic
locations. Despite these challenges, interviewees agreed that the intervention was
responsive to the FQHC priorities by increasing evidence-based pediatric- and
family-centric health promotion programming that addressed obesity and T2DM
disparities among FQHC patients. Interviewees suggested that broader eligibility
criteria, greater visibility of the program across the FQHC, and a reimbursement
model that offset program costs would allow them to reach and serve more families,
thereby enhancing the potential for adoption, integration, and sustainability of the
program over the long-term.</p>
              <p>While our primary goal was feasibility and acceptability, we assessed changes to
anthropometric, physiological and behavioral outcomes among participants. There were
no statistically significant differences in body weight, BMI (or BMI
<italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-score), waist circumference, or HbA1c changes between
intervention and control mothers or children. <xref rid="table4-21501327211057643" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Similarly, there were no
statistically significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes, including
diet quality, time spent in physical activity, child sleep, or the healthy home
environment score (Data not shown).</p>

              <p>Our intervention was developed in response to a call for pilot and feasibility studies<sup><xref rid="bibr37-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> that sought to develop practical and sustainable strategies to improve
processes of care and health outcomes for persons at risk of developing T2DM in
primary care settings. Emphasis was placed on potential for improving routine
diabetes and obesity practice and informing policy. Given that women with history of
GDM and their offspring have elevated risk for developing T2DM, our approach engaged
both mothers and their children. Populations who experience disparities in T2DM
prevalence and care are disproportionately low-income and identify as persons of
color, thus, we partnered with colleagues at FQHC in Southern Arizona, wherein a
majority of patients are uninsured or underinsured, and identify as Hispanic or
Latino.</p>
              <p>Our intervention was among the first to address T2DM risk of both mother and child
simultaneously using the concept of “primordial prevention,” which explicitly
leverages the motivation of mothers to address potential social and environmental
conditions that promote or amplify chronic disease risk factors such as T2DM,
thereby slowing or halting risk of transmission to their children.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Indeed, there
is precedent for the application of primordial prevention to T2DM risk reduction.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Family-based pediatric obesity interventions in which parents or caregivers
are actively involved and coached to use proactive food and physical activity
parenting strategies have demonstrated higher rates of success compared with those
that focus only on the child.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Leveraging the FQHC
infrastructure to deliver primordial prevention within low-income and otherwise
vulnerable communities is an opportunity to definitively address T2DM familial risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We succeeded in demonstrating feasibility of implementing a diabetes prevention
program that enrolled majority low income and Hispanic women, a population
disproportionately burdened by diabetes. This program extended previous efforts by
our team to introduce primordial prevention to the area of diabetes prevention,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and was highly accepted by participants and FQHC program staff. To our
knowledge, ours was one of the first studies to integrate a family-based T2DM
prevention program as part of a FQHC delivery system, and evaluate the feasibility
and acceptability of such a program in this setting.</p>
              <p>Due to the pilot nature of our study, we did not expect to observe statistically
significant changes in weight and BMI—2 key risk factors for reducing diabetes
risk—although there was evidence of changes in desired directions. Prior to
proceeding with a larger, fully powered clinical trial, we will further refine the
intervention to address additional drivers of T2DM risk identified in our study and
by our FQHC partners (eg, social determinants of health such as food insecurity, and
transportation challenges) and work closely with our FQHC colleagues to respond to
these challenges.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-21501327211057643" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our study had several strengths. A behavioral health specialist was added to our
intervention team to specifically address the links between stress and health. The
inclusion of behavioral health components was novel to family-based diabetes
prevention and was very highly rated by participants. The FQHC was able to bill for
behavioral health services, thereby partially recovering program delivery costs. Our
academic-community partnership was another strength of this study, allowing the team
to understand and balance the needs of the FQHC and its patients with scientific
rigor necessary to build an evidence base for family-based T2DM prevention in
primary care. This collaboration could form the foundation of a scalable model in
the FQHC network once program effectiveness is established.</p>
              <p>Our study also had several limitations. Our focus on women with a history of GDM was
narrow by design; however, this created challenges for FQHC staff using the
electronic health record to identify patients with GDM, some of whom were diagnosed
up to a decade prior. Our focus on GDM prevented us from testing the program on
patients with prediabetes who comprise a much larger proportion of the FQHC patient
population. We offered optional face-to-face visits with Registered Dietitian
Nutritionists during the study, but current restrictions around Dietitian services
in our State meant that patients were responsible for a co-pay or the entire consult
depending on insurance status. Consequently, only 4 mother-child dyads took
advantage of this opportunity. Finally, we were challenged by the COVID19 pandemic,
which hindered recruitment of our second cohort of participants (limiting us to 42
participants instead of the 60 we had planned), slowed recruitment of additional
families to the study in January and February of 2020, and halted all intervention
plans in late February 2020. Although this lowered our statistical power to detect
meaningful changes in weight and behavioral outcomes, we were able to gather enough
data to estimate power for a future definitive clinical trial.</p>
              <p>As we emerge from a pandemic, there are many opportunities for this program to expand
and thrive. In the next iteration of this program, we will consider additional
opportunities for cost recovery. Digital and hybrid (digital plus face-to-face)
treatment options are more relevant now than ever and we anticipate that
restrictions on Dietitian services and billing will continue to shift in this
direction, providing an additional reimbursement avenues. Other critical next steps
include the integration of the intervention with the existing referral system and
electronic health record, greater visibility of provider “champions” who promote the
program to patients and staff, dedicated recruitment staff, and a cost recovery
model that can be replicated and scaled in other FQHC networks across the United
States.</p>
