              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">The pathogenesis and risk factors for chronic diseases are becoming better understood and disease risk tools tailored to these factors have become more popular. These tools seek to educate at-risk individuals about early signs and symptoms, encourage behavior changes to lower risk, and encouraging screening for individuals with early disease manifestations. Personalized risk tools aimed at the lay public have been developed for many cancers, cardiovascular disease, heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, among others [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These tools are available in multiple formats including written or web-based materials, in-person or telephone counseling, and motivational interviewing sessions [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some strategies present genetic information alone to communicate disease risk [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] while others focus on behavioral factors to help educate patients on modifiable risk [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, presenting risk of a chronic disease without clear options to lower that risk may have unintended negative effects by inducing psychological distress, thus could result in more harm than benefit, particularly for those disclosed to have high risk [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Individuals at risk for a chronic disease with high levels of concern may be more likely to seek these tools. Therefore, the effect of novel personalized risk disclosure methods on psychological distress measures, such as concern for developing disease, is important to understand.</p>
              <p id="P7">RA affects about 1% of the population, and is characterized by a chronic inflammatory arthritis that may result in disability as well as increased morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. RA risk factors include demographics (female sex, increasing age), family history, genetics (HLA-DRB1), biomarkers (RA-related autoantibodies, cyclic citrullinated peptide [CCP] and rheumatoid factor [RF]), and lifestyle (smoking, low fish intake, obesity, and poor dental health).</p>
              <p id="P8">Some prior research on risk education tools and anxiety suggests that distress may not be induced. Many chronic disease risk communication programs have demonstrated a more realistic estimate of chronic disease risk after initial overestimation [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as well as lowered disease-related concern [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many of these studies were performed using risk tools using only genetic factors so it is unclear whether more comprehensive chronic disease risk tools might have different effects on concern. We previously developed [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] a comprehensive chronic disease risk tool incorporating demographics, genetics, biomarkers, and lifestyle factors to estimate risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assessed effects on RA-related concern.</p>
              <p id="P9">The Personalized Risk Estimator for RA (PRE-RA) Family Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02046005) was a randomized controlled trial conducted among first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with RA, since they are familiar with RA and motivated to participate in prevention efforts. We randomized FDRs to receive RA risk to one of three strategies: 1) a web-based risk calculator called the PRE-RA tool, 2) the PRE-RA tool plus a session with a health educator using motivational interviewing concepts (with intent to improve RA risk-related health behaviors), or 3) a Comparison arm receiving standard information about RA risk factors and epidemiology. The PRE-RA tool was personalized to demographics, genetic, biomarker, and lifestyle risk factors. The main analysis of the PRE-RA Family Study found that those randomized to the PRE-RA tool were more likely to report increased motivation to improve at least one RA risk-related behavior (diet, exercise, dental hygiene and smoking) immediately and up to 6 months post intervention. Subjects randomized to PRE-RA arms also reported significantly more behavioral changes than the Comparison arm including increased fish intake, more frequent brushing and flossing, and higher levels of smoking cessation [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P10">This secondary analysis aimed to investigate whether the PRERA tool affected levels of and decrease in concern for developing RA. We hypothesized that those who were randomized to the personalized PRE-RA tool would have decreased levels of disease-related concern compared to the Comparison arm.</p>

                  <p id="P15">Those randomized to the PRE-RA arm received the web-based, personalized RA risk educational tool. The PRE-RA web-based risk education tool was modified from YourDiseaseRisk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yourdiseaserisk.wustl.edu/">http://www.yourdiseaserisk.wustl.edu</ext-link>), a freely available website providing personalized risk estimation of 17 chronic diseases including 12 cancers, emphysema, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The details of the PRE-RA tool are described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The PRE-RA tool calculated individualized estimates of RA risk by compiling demographic data, family history, lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, smoking, and dental hygiene), genetic information (presence or absence of risk polymorphisms in <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>, the strongest genetic risk factor for RA) as well as RA-related autoantibody status (CCP and RF). Research assistants input genetic/biomarker results into the web-based tool prior to the study visit, but otherwise all data were reported by the participant and summarized by the tool in real time. Based on this information, individuals received a personalized RA risk result summary including both a relative and an absolute lifetime risk of developing RA. These risks were displayed in both a numeric and pictorial format for those with differing levels of numeric literacy. Since only lifestyle risk factors are modifiable, the risk results were interactive to emphasize RA risk-related behaviors; subjects could visualize how their RA risk might change if they adopted specific combinations of lifestyle changes. The risk education tool also contained links to websites with useful information on RA and tips on lifestyle changes for those interested in obtaining additional education. Subjects interacted with the PRE-RA tool without guidance from study staff, typically for about 15 min. Subjects also received printouts of the RA risk summary results and the same handout that those in the Comparison arm received.</p>

Concern was measured on a 5-point Likert scale: 0 (not at all concerned), 1 (a little concerned), 2 (somewhat concerned), 3 (quite concerned) and 4 (extremely concerned). Concern was also analyzed as both a continuous variable (based on the numerical values from the ordinal scale, ranging from 0 to 4) and a dichotomous variable (somewhat, quite, or extremely concerned vs. not at all or a little concerned).</p>

                <p id="P19">Covariates were assessed at baseline and included age, sex, race, education, relationship to affected relative with RA, and self-perceived lifetime RA risk. Self-perceived lifetime risk was assessed as a percentage by asking subjects “On a scale of 0–100%, what do you believe your chances are of developing RA sometime in your life?”. Risk tendency scores were calculated using the Risk Propensity Scale [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a measure designed to assess tolerance or aversion to risk. A higher risk tendency score is interpreted as being more likely to take risks. Attitudes about contributors to RA risk were determined among subjects by asking them to rate the extent to which they believe lifestyle factors, autoantibodies, and genetics impact RA risk. Contemplation of RA risk was a composite measure defined as answering “yes” to at least three of five statements assessing aspects of RA risk contemplation: “I am worried about getting RA”, “I am curious about my risk for RA”, “I want to learn more about RA”, “I want to find out ways to lower my risk for RA”, and “I want to get blood tests for RA”.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p id="P20">We reported descriptive characteristics at baseline for randomized subjects stratified by study arm.</p>
                <p id="P21">We first analyzed self-perceived lifetime RA risk at baseline as a continuous variable. Only among those in the PRE-RA and PRE-RA Plus arms, we used a paired-samples t-test to compare baseline self-perceived lifetime risk of RA to the lifetime RA risk calculated by the PRE-RA tool. We did not include subjects in the Comparison arm in this analysis because they did not complete the PRE-RA tool so did not have a calculated lifetime RA risk. We then derived the “overestimation” of RA risk by subtracting the calculated risk from the self-perceived risk. Among this same subset, we performed unadjusted and multivariable linear regression analyses to investigate whether baseline characteristics were associated with the outcome of overestimation of lifetime RA risk. We included all considered covariates in the multivariable model.</p>
                <p id="P22">Our primary analysis compared RA risk-related concern in the PRE-RA and PRE-RA Plus arms to the Comparison arm at each post-intervention time-point (immediate, 6-week, 6-month, and 12-month) using the concern variable as a continuous value. We obtained p values using a linear regression model with continuous RA-risk related concern as the dependent variable and study arm as the independent variable (reference = Comparison arm), adjusting for concern at baseline. We analyzed each time point independently among those with data. There was relatively low (&lt;10%) loss to follow-up and this was not differential by study arm, study flow diagram previously published [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To evaluate for the incremental effect of the health educator, we also compared the PRE-RA Plus arm to the PRE-RA arm.</p>
                <p id="P23">In secondary analyses, we analyzed RA-related concern stratified by high risk vs. low risk scores calculated by the online risk education tool for the PRE-RA or PRE-RA Plus arms. As in our previous publications and based on prior literature risk stratifying for RA, the “high risk” group was defined as having ≥5% lifetime risk of RA and the “low risk” group &lt;5% lifetime risk of RA, only among those randomized to the PRE-RA or PRE-RA Plus arms since they had calculated lifetime RA risk available [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We used linear regression to adjust for baseline concern and other covariates (age, sex, education, type of relative with RA, and perceived RA severity) to investigate how risk group was associated with changes in concern over each post-intervention time-point. As in the primary analysis, continuous RA risk-related concern was the outcome of the regression model and risk group (high risk, low risk, Comparison arm [reference]) was the independent variable adjusting for baseline RA-related concern. We also compared the high risk group to the low risk group.</p>
                <p id="P24">We investigated whether a subset of subjects who were concerned at baseline were more or less likely to have a decrease in concern after the intervention. We defined “decreased concern” as any decrease in concern at the 6-month visit compared to the baseline visit among subjects who indicated “somewhat” or greater RA risk-related concern at baseline. We used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio for decrease in concern about RA risk (i.e., reassurance) among individuals in the PRE-RA or PRERA Plus arm vs. Comparison arm at the 6-month post-randomization time point.</p>
                <p id="P25">We considered a two-sided p value&lt;0.05 as statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS v.9.4.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P31">This randomized controlled trial conducted among healthy FDRs of RA patients suggests that a personalized, web-based RA risk calculator lowered RA-related concern on a long-term basis post-intervention. Even subjects who were disclosed to be at high lifetime RA risk tended to have lower levels of concern than the Comparison arm, and demonstrated decrease in their RA risk-related concern. The addition of a health educator to the PRE-RA tool provided only a subtle incremental benefit in decreasing concern, suggesting that subjects were mostly reassured by using the web-based tool without much additional benefit of one-on-one interpretation. We found that subjects tended to overestimate their lifetime risk of RA by over five-fold compared to a calculated estimate personalized to their demographics, genetics, biomarkers, and lifestyle. RA risk-related concern was strongly associated with overestimation of lifetime RA risk, suggesting that having a relative with RA may influence risk perception and suggests that education may help individuals to better calibrate accurate disease risk. To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate changes in concern for developing a chronic disease after risk disclosure using a comprehensive tool that includes genetic/biomarkers results and also personalized to demographics and behaviors.</p>
              <p id="P32">Previous literature also suggests that many populations including FDRs, at-risk individuals, and healthy individuals may overestimate their self-perceived of chronic diseases [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. FDRs in our study estimated their absolute lifetime risk of RA to be40.5%. Among those randomized to receive the PRE-RA tool, the mean calculated lifetime RA risk was 7.5%, consistent with literature estimates of RA risk in FDRs based on family history [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This result supports previous findings of perceived vulnerability and overestimation among relatives of affected individuals and could be a result of familiarity with the disease through experience with the affected family member and over-inflation of the genetic contribution to chronic disease risk [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that after presenting subjects with accurate risk of disease self-perceived risk drops to a more realistic level [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P33">We found that individuals randomized to the PRE-RA arm had significantly decreased RA risk-related concern at all time points after intervention. Risk summary tools and risk counseling has been shown previously to decrease chronic risk-related concern [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Chronic disease risk-related concern has also been shown to decrease after risk-disclosure methods that involve a genetic counselor [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prior studies have also stratified based on high or low risk groups for a chronic disease. For example, a prospective study investigating breast cancer risk found that regardless of risk group (high or low), women who attended genetic counseling were found to have less worry immediately afterward and this persisted for up to a year later [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another study testing the effect of individual genetic counseling among a population of women at increased risk by having <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations found a decrease in breast cancer worry [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our study, even those disclosed to be at high risk for RA had lowered levels of concern during the follow-up period compared to subjects who did not receive personalized risk disclosure. These results suggest that a personalized medicine approach integrating a variety of risk factors for chronic disease can be successfully integrated with positive psychological effects without requiring interpretation from a health educator or counselor.</p>
              <p id="P34">A major strength of this study was its design as a randomized controlled trial, and thus it was unlikely to be confounded by baseline factors. Another advantage of the study was the use of the PRE-RA tool, a comprehensive RA risk tool. The tool was modeled on YourDiseaseRisk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yourdiseaserisk.wustl.edu/">http://www.yourdiseaserisk.wustl.edu</ext-link>), which has been used successfully to estimate risk of many chronic diseases and cancers. We modified the tool to estimate RA risk by integrating information across many risk categories and to present risk estimates in a numeric, pictorial, and interactive way for ease of comprehension [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Next, our study had twelve months of follow-up data and little loss to follow-up, with 87% of subjects remaining in the study for the entire 12-month follow-up period [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Subjects disclosed to have low RA risk on the PRE-RA tool were still more likely to increase motivation than those in the Comparison arm [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This demonstrates that even though concern decreased, the intervention still had positive health benefits for this group. Finally, our study recruited FDRs of patients known to have RA, so there was no uncertainty as to whether subjects truly had a relative affected with RA.</p>
              <p id="P35">Our study does have some limitations. First, the self-reported measure that we used to determine RA-related concern may not have accurately captured disease-related concern. However, a previous study showed that disclosure of genetics to those at risk for Alzheimer’s disease had minimal impact on a variety of validated psychological measures even among those who were disclosed to be at high risk, similar to our findings [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We did not measure self-perceived lifetime risk of RA after intervention, so were unable to study whether this changed during follow-up period and whether it may have mediated the disease risk-related concern. This study was a secondary analysis and therefore, findings should be considered hypothesis-generating as opposed to conclusive. Due to the nature of the intervention, we could not blind subjects and research staff to study arm, which may have resulted in performance or detection bias. While we modeled the content of our comparison arm after standard of care, we used a one-on-one presentation format to present these results to ensure the participant’s attention. Since the PRE-RA arm had no interaction with the health educator and still lowered RA risk-related concern, we find it unlikely that this explains our findings. However, alternate methods to communicate disease risk in the Comparison arm might have affected the results. Since RA is relatively uncommon even among FDRs, a majority of participants overestimated their risk. It is unclear if similar findings would occur for individuals at risk for more prevalent chronic diseases where overestimation of risk may not be as common as in our study. Finally, our study population was mostly female, white, and educated, so our findings may not be generalizable to other populations. This was an educated and motivated population, so less educated and unmotivated populations may be less likely to make lifestyle changes after the intervention. However, even more pronounced effects could occur in a population with more lifestyle risk factors and a larger knowledge deficit.</p>
              <p id="P36">In conclusion, we demonstrated that a comprehensive chronic disease risk tool lowered RA risk-related concern in FDRs of RA patients. Subjects who received personalized RA risk were more likely to be reassured than those not receiving personalized RA risk, regardless of whether they were deemed to be high or low risk and interpretation from a health educator provided only subtle improvements beyond the web-based personalized risk disclosure tool. Future studies should further investigate the overall psychological and health behavior impact of personalized medicine strategies for chronic disease risk disclosure.</p>
