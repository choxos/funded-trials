                <p id="Par1">BCMA targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown deep and durable responses in multiple myeloma. However, relapse following therapy is frequently observed, and mechanisms of resistance remain ill-defined. Here, we perform single cell genomic characterization of longitudinal samples from a patient who relapsed after initial CAR T cell treatment with lack of response to retreatment. We report selection, following initial CAR T cell infusion, of a clone with biallelic loss of BCMA acquired by deletion of one allele and a mutation that creates an early stop codon on the second allele. This loss leads to lack of CAR T cell proliferation following the second infusion and is reflected by lack of soluble BCMA in patient serum. Our analysis suggests the need for careful detection of BCMA gene alterations in multiple myeloma cells from relapse following CAR T cell therapy.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has provided frequent, deep, and durable responses in relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (MM), with initial Phase I/II studies reporting 73‚Äì100% overall response and 31‚Äì69% complete response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, progression-free survival in some studies have been &lt;12 months, indicating myeloma recurrence despite the persistence of CAR T cells in a number of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par4">In this work, by performing single-cell transcriptome profiling on serially collected bone marrow (BM) samples, we show biallelic loss of BCMA as one of the resistance mechanisms to anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy with Idecabtagene Vicleucel in a patient with initial response but relapse with resistance to retreatment with the same CAR T-cell product.

The patient was treated with four lines of therapy including proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 antibody before CAR T-cell therapy, with limited response.

                <title>Changes in BM microenvironment post-CAR T-cell therapy</title>
                <p id="Par6">To delineate changes in BM cellular components as a potential mechanism underlying lack of response to CAR T-cell reinfusion, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling on serially collected BM samples (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Clustering analysis from 37,658 cells from 8 time points, before the first CAR T cell¬†infusion to 1 month after the second infusion, identified 13 clusters consisting of hematopoietic cells and MM cells (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The BM sample before the first infusion was depleted of CD138+ cells¬†by cell selection. A small number of MM cells were observed at 2 weeks after the first infusion of the CAR T-cell therapy. Thereafter, MM cells became undetectable and remained undetectable until eight months after the first infusion, when biochemical as well as cytological relapse occurred (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>). We observed a predicted suppression of B-cell count at study entry as an effect of the MM cell growth, with B-cell recovery at 1 month coinciding with anti-MM response (3% of all cells) and reaching 18% at 8 months after first infusion (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>), and again suppressed to 3% at relapse. We detected CAR+ T cells in the BM only at 2 weeks after first infusion, when maximal CAR+ T-cell expansion was observed in blood using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-based detection (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B, E</xref>). We did not detect infused CAR T cells in the BM with single-cell transcriptome profiling after the second CAR T infusion, but a limited expansion was confirmed in the blood using RT-PCR (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). The 6-log expansion of CAR+ T cells in the blood after the first infusion is consistent with observed expansion in the KarMMA study, where 5.5‚Äâlog expansion was observed in the responding patients with a median peak CAR+ T-cell expansion at day 11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A lower expansion (2-log) with the second infusion may represent environmental influences or MM-intrinsic factors.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Tumor-intrinsic changes.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Cell embedings for plasma/multiple myeloma (MM) cells (green colors) and B cells (cream colors) are shown from screening to 2 weeks after second infusion (<italic>x</italic> axis).

                <p id="Par7">Re-clustering of the T-cell cluster showed an increased proportion of CD4+ helper and T-regulatory cells (Treg) 2 weeks after first infusion (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F, G</xref> and Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and these two clusters had high expression of proliferation-related genes (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref> and Supplementary Data¬†<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref> and¬†<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). However, Treg proportion remained similar at the second infusion, ruling out its impact on lack of expansion of CAR+ T cells. To detect any unusual endogenous T-cell activity that may potentially affect CAR T-cell function, we investigated inhibitory markers <italic>CD274</italic> (<italic>PD-L1</italic>), <italic>PDCD1</italic> (<italic>PD-1</italic>), <italic>LAG3</italic>, <italic>TIGIT</italic> at early and late time points including after second infusion. As can be seen (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref> and Supplementary Table¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), at no time point the proportion of the cells expressing these checkpoint inhibitors is higher then the base line. Moreover, the absence of change in these markers on endogenous T cells does not mean that the CAR+ T cells do not express these markers. However, in absence of detectable CAR T cells there is no direct way to look at expressed inhibitory markers on CAR T cells. Therefore, future studies will require investigation of resistance associated with presence of checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

                <title>Role of tumor intrinsic factors in resistance</title>
                <p id="Par8">As we did not delineate a role of the BM milieu mediating suppression of CAR T-cell expansion and function following second infusion, we next explored tumor intrinsic factors. We evaluated soluble BCMA (sBCMA) level (produced predominantly by MM cells) in serum at different time points, and observed high levels before the first CAR T cell infusion, which dropped significantly to a very low level coincident with the clinical response; however, sBCMA remained low even at the time of relapse with increased burden of MM, indicating a lack of BCMA production by MM cells (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). We therefore investigated genomic changes in MM cells at the time of relapse. This patient had clonal t(11;14) translocation (96% of all cells) and clonal deletion 13 (94% of all cells) at the time of diagnosis. A similar clonal composition was observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis at study enrollment, when 4% of the cells also showed deletion 17p. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of BM samples identified three samples (at the time of relapse and post second CAR T-cell infusion) with significant numbers of MM cells, evidenced by expression of CD138 and <italic>XBP1</italic> (markers of plasma cells), <italic>CCND1</italic> (upregulated in this patient with t(11;14)), and lack of <italic>RB1</italic> (downregulated in this patient with del13) (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Imputation of copy number alterations from single-cell transcriptomic data showed that the majority of MM cells had a deletion of 16p, including the <italic>BCMA</italic> locus located on 16p13.13. (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). We further validated these findings using deep whole exome sequencing (WES) of purified CD138+ cells collected 2 weeks after the second CAR T infusion. Of note, copy number alterations detected by WES almost completely overlapped with CNAs predicted by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), including deletion 16p (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Before the first CAR T-cell infusion, 4% of BM MM cells showed deletion 17p, whereas after the second infusion both WES and scRNAseq prediction showed that del17p and del16p were clonal, and longitudinal scRNAseq analysis indicated that del17p and del16p co-occurred in the same clone (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D, F</xref>). Interestingly, WES also identified a high subclonal (~70%) nonsense mutation (p.Q38*) in <italic>BCMA</italic> that creates an early stop codon in the <italic>BCMA</italic> gene (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref> and Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This biallelic <italic>BCMA</italic> loss, acquired with one copy deletion and a second copy loss-of-function mutation, provides the molecular basis for lack of <italic>BCMA</italic> expression in MM cells at the time of relapse.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par9">This case represents initial response followed by development of an acquired resistant phenotype as represented by both relapse and then lack of response to second CAR T infusion (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). BCMA represents an important component of plasma cell function, and thus its loss is not frequently observed. However, this case highlights a possibility that myeloma cells may be able to acuire alternative growth mechanisms to survive without BCMA expression and related signaling intermediates. Studies have shown that MM usually shows substantial inter and intra-tumor heterogeneity, which is closely related to progression, resistance to therapy, and recurrences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Loss of several other targets for different treatments, such as CRBN with immunomodulatory agents or BCL-2 with venetoclax, has been associated with resistance to these treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A single antigen targeting CAR T-cell treatment may also be affected by the loss of target as a result of tumor evolution and selection. Targeted antigen-negative relapse is one of the main reasons for resistance to CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy and accounts for ~9‚Äì25% of cases of relapse in other hematological cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition to antigen loss, immune-mediated rejection of the murine construct may play a role in resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We did observe low level anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at 6 months post first infusion, which persisted during the retreatment. ADA could have potential impact on CAR T cell expansion following second infusion. However, lack of BCMA expression was likely the predominant factor responsible for lack of response to second infusion. The extent of the role of ADA in this setting will need to be ascertained in a larger cohort of patients in the future. Previously, a large study evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy in B-cell malignincies showed that addition of fludarabine to cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion before the first infusion and an increased dose in the second infusion compared to the first infusion would increase the response rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, both of which were followed in the currect study.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Here we describe emergence of a clone with loss of BCMA target leading to acquired resistance to retreatment. However, as it is equally important and previously shown in other hematological cancers, there are other possible factors such as microenvironmental changes and immune-mediated rejection of the murine construct that may contribute to resistance to CAR T-cell therapies. Here we only report one mechanism with limited power; however, future studies with larger sample size will be able to determine the dominant resistance factors and expected frequency of each mechanism in MM. We also observed a clonal <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutation (p.P278T) (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>) using WES, suggesting that both <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>BCMA</italic> had deletion in one allele and mutation in the second allele. We analyzed our data from 300 newly diagnosed MM patients and using a conservative estimate observed del16p in 6% patients (44% were subclonal deletions) and, interestingly, it co-occured with del17p in 77% of the del16p patients (sixfold encrichmnet, hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic>-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.38e‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ11, Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Importantly, we also observed that 36% of patients with del17p also carried del16p. These results support our previous observation regarding similar relative timing for both deletion events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and may highlight the need to carefully examine for <italic>BCMA</italic> gene alterations in patients being retreated with subsequent BCMA targeting therapy at relapse from initial BCMA CAR T-cell treatment. The co-occurrence of 16p deletion in patients with del 17p also underscores the need to further evaluate the role of BCMA targted therapies in high-risk del17p MM. It would also be important to further investigate, with more sensitive methods, the presence and frequency of very low subclonality del16p. In general, WES data from 1300 newly diagnosed MM patients failed to detect any missense or nonsense mutations in BCMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This suggests that pressure of specific BCMA-targeted treatment can select for a very low level of biallelic deletion (<italic>BCMA and TP53</italic>) in these patients (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). As BCMA has a functional role in MM, such BCMA-independent growth on one hand may indicate a more aggressive phenotype, but it may also suggest a new vulnerability that can be targeted by alternative therapies. Anecdotal instances of post-CAR T-cell sensitivity to various therapies have been reported and the index patient in this report has remained alive 3 years from CAR T-cell therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par11">This case represents molecular characteristics of MM. It identifies significant genomic evolution that may represent clonal selection and/or induction of new changes under the pressure of therapy. Our results suggest that BCMA-negative cell populations may get selected under strong treatments like CAR T-cell therapies. Although the platform we have used was not sensitive enough to detect the presence of low-level resistant cells at an early stage, our results still support a possible role for sensitive and deep sequencing of BCMA locus before CAR T-cell reinfusion or consideration of sequential BCMA-targeted therapies, to identify the outgrowth of a rare MM cell with BCMA loss. Recently, CAR T-cell therapy approach simultaneously targeting dual antigens BCMA and GPRC5D was shown as one approach to prevent BCMA escape-driven relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The presence of subclonal changes may also provide clinically important information supporting dual antigen-targeted CAR T cell or other combination or maintenance therapies.</p>
