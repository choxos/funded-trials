                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>To evaluate prediction of response and event-free survival (EFS) following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy by SET2,3 index of nonproliferation gene expression related to estrogen and progesterone receptors adjusted for baseline prognosis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Â Experimental Design:</title>
                  <p>A correlative study was conducted of SET2,3 measured from gene expression profiles of diagnostic tumor (Agilent microarrays) in 379 women with cStage IIâIII breast cancer from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1031 neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor trial SET2,3 was dichotomized using the previously published cutoff. Fisher exact test was used to assess the association between SET2,3 and low proliferation at week 2â4 [Ki67 â¤ 10% or complete cell-cycle arrest (CCCA; Ki67 â¤ 2.7%)] and PEPI-0 rate in cohort B, and the association between SET2,3 and ypStage 0/I in all patients. Cox models were used to assess EFS with respect to SET2,3 excluding cohort B patients who switched to chemotherapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Patients with high SET2,3 had higher rate of pharmacodynamic response than patients with low SET2,3 (Ki67 â¤ 10% in 88.2% vs. 56.9%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; CCCA in 50.0% vs. 26.2%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0054), but rate of ypStage 0/I (24.0% vs. 20.4%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.4580) or PEPI = 0 (28.4% vs. 20.6%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.3419) was not different. Patients with high SET2,3 had longer EFS than patients with low SET2,3 (HR, 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 0.34â0.80; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0026).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>This exploratory analysis of Z1031 data demonstrated a higher rate of pharmacodynamic suppression of proliferation and longer EFS in high SET2,3 disease relative to low SET2,3 disease. The ypStage 0/I rate and PEPI = 0 rate were similar with respect to SET2,3.</p>

              <p>Trials of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NeoET) in cStage IIâIII breast cancer have established that early pharmacodynamic and subsequent pathologic response to NeoET are prognostic, so some patients may avoid chemotherapy. But there is still a need for pretreatment biomarkers to identify the most appropriate patients to begin NeoET. In this blinded analysis of the sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SET2,3) index in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1031 trial of NeoET, we demonstrate that higher SET2,3 from diagnostic tumor biopsy was associated with greater odds of early pharmacodynamic response in the tumor (Ki67 â¤ 10% after 2â4 weeks NeoET) and longer event-free survival (EFS). Individual components of SET2,3, measuring endocrine receptorârelated transcription (SET<sub>ER/PR</sub>) and baseline prognosis were found to be independently prognostic for EFS.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NeoET) trials for patients with clinical stage IIâIII breast cancer that is hormone receptorâpositive and HER2-negative (HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>â</sup>) provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a relatively short preoperative exposure to endocrine therapy on the cellular and/or pathologic response in the primary tumor, yet retain the ability to offer chemotherapy later if deemed appropriate (1â<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, a means is needed to identify which patients presenting with clinical stage IIâIII HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>â</sup> disease are most appropriate to begin NeoET. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1031 trial is one of few prospective clinical trials that is sufficiently powered for evaluation of response and long-term patient outcomes after NeoET for clinical stage IIâIII HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>â</sup> breast cancer (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>).</p>
              <p>The SET2,3 assay of sensitivity to endocrine therapy genomic index for stage IIâIII breast cancer was designed to measure nonproliferative hormone receptorârelated transcription and then adjust for the patient's baseline prognosis from disease burden (tumor size and regional lymph node involvement) combined with molecular subtype (6â<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These two components of SET2,3 are the SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index (18 nonproliferative hormone receptorârelated transcripts relative to 10 reference transcripts) and the baseline prognostic index (BPI) that combines clinical tumor stage, clinical nodal (cN) stage, and RNA4 (molecular subtype derived from four transcripts: <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PGR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">AURKA</italic>) measured from the pretreatment tumor biopsy (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7, 8</xref>). Higher SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index values indicate more active endocrine-related transcription and higher BPI values indicate more indolent prognostic features (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> and BPI have been reported to add independent prognostic information in the setting of adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>â</sup> breast cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). SET2,3 represents their weighted sum (SET2,3 = 0.75 Ã SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> + 0.51 Ã BPI; refs. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7, 9</xref>).</p>
              <p>The objective of this study was to examine whether SET2,3 could identify patients who are more likely to experience tumoral response to NeoET, including early on-treatment pharmacodynamic response, posttreatment pathologic response, or improved long-term clinical outcomes.</p>

                <title>Study cohort</title>
                <p>The patients included in this study were drawn from the ACOSOG neoadjuvant trial Z1031, a phase III trial that enrolled postmenopausal women with clinical stage IIâIII estrogen receptor (ER)âpositive Allred score 6â8 (or ER-positive staining in &gt;66.7% cells) breast cancer (4). ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology. Z1031 was conducted in two sequential cohorts. Patients in cohort A were randomized to 16 to 18 weeks of either 1 mg anastrozole daily, 2.5 mg letrozole daily, or 25 mg exemestane daily (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Patients in cohort B chose to receive either anastrozole or letrozole and underwent a tumor biopsy after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. If the tumor had Ki67 &gt; 10% at week 2â4, it was recommended that they switch to chemotherapy (cohort B-chemo) or go immediately surgery (cohort B-surgery; ref. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Otherwise, if the tumor had Ki67 â¤ 10% at week 2â4 or there were insufficient tumor cells in the specimen to quantify proliferation, it was recommended that patients remain on their endocrine treatment (cohort B-endo). Patients enrolled onto cohorts A and B had tumor specimens collected prior to start of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment and at surgery, for research purposes. cohort B also had a research tumor specimen collected after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. These specimens were sent to Washington University, St. Louis, for storage, central immunostaining (Ki67) and gene expression microarrays, as per the clinical trial protocol for ACOSOG Z1031 (NCT00265759, Clinical Trials Support Unit, NCI; ref. <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Participants in ACOSOG Z1031 signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)âapproved, protocol-specific written informed consent document for use of their data and samples, in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines (U.S. Common Rule). In addition, the central data analysis reported in this study was approved with waiver of consent (not human subjects research) by the IRB at MD Anderson Cancer Center (protocol LAB04-0093) and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (approval A151701).</p>
                <p>Data collection and statistical analyses were conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center. Data quality was ensured by review of data by the Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center and by the principal investigator following Alliance policies.</p>

                <p>We analyzed the expression levels of 31 transcripts from preexisting gene expression data from Agilent 4Ã44K Whole Human Genome Microarrays that were processed from frozen tumor biopsy cores using methods described previously (4). The Z1031 investigators provided gene expression data for the 31 transcripts used in the SET2,3 algorithm to the non-ACOSOG bioinformatician (L. Du) in Dr. Symmansâs laboratory in 2018, who was blinded to patient treatment and clinical outcomes. SET2,3 index and its components, SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> and BPI, were calculated and provided to the ACOSOG trial statistician (V.J. Suman) to interrogate their association with clinical outcome under an Alliance for Clinical Trials data sharing agreement (A151701). All microarray data from Z1031 were subsequently made publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; ref. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>

                <p>SET2,3 was dichotomized using the cut-off point derived from the chemoendocrine treatment setting (namely, 1.77; ref. 7). Its components, SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> and BPI, were dichotomized using their median value (namely, 1.36 and 1.5, respectively) among the 379 women of cohorts A and B.</p>
                <p>Endpoints of this study included two biomarkers of early pharmacodynamic response, defined as the proportion of patients whose week 2â4 Ki67 â¤ 10% and the proportion of patients whose tumor was in complete cell-cycle arrest (CCCA), that is Ki67 â¤ 2.7% at week 2â4 of NeoET. Because prior to neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (pre-NeoET) Ki67 differed between patients with low versus high SET2,3, logistic regression was used to assess the effect of SET2,3 on week 2â4 Ki67 outcomes adjusted for pre-NeoET Ki67 level. Two additional endpoints of pathologic response at time of surgery were the proportion of patients with preoperative endocrine therapy prognostic index group zero (PEPI = 0) and the proportion of patients with ypStage0/I disease. Stage was evaluated in both cohorts and PEPI = 0 rate was evaluated in cohort B only (where it was a predefined endpoint). PEPI = 0 rate is defined as the number of patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) or ypT1â2 ypN0, ER-positive IHC (Allred score: 3â8), and Ki67 â¤ 2.7% in the residual invasive cancer, and was assessed among all the women in cohort B who began NeoET (12). Women in cohort B who either had a week 2â4 Ki67 &gt; 10% or failed to undergo surgery after 12 weeks NeoET were considered to have a nonzero PEPI score and not to have ypStage0/I disease. Fisher exact test was used to assess whether biomarkers of response differed with respect to SET2,3 and its components.</p>
                <p>The clinical outcome of interest was event-free survival (EFS) postregistration, defined as time from registration to local, regional, or distant disease progression/recurrence, second invasive primary cancer, or death due to any cause. Those who died without documented disease progression were censored at their last disease evaluation. Disease progression occurring during the neoadjuvant period was confirmed by imaging. Cox modeling was used to evaluate whether EFS differed with respect to the SET2,3 or its components among the women of cohort A and cohort B-endo. Because BPI is a discrete variable (possible values in increments of 0.5), it was dichotomized at median, whereas SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> was treated as a continuous variable in the Cox model. We used threshold plots to represent the odds of response (week 2â4 Ki67 â¤ 10%, CCCA, PEPI = 0) for SET2,3 index values at or above a given threshold relative to the odds for SET2,3 index below that threshold, plotting the threshold values from the 25th to 75th percentile of the SET2,3 index distribution. A similar approach was used for EFS with threshold plots to represent the hazard of EFS event for SET2,3 index values at or below each threshold relative to the hazard above that threshold. All analyses were based on the study database frozen on June 5, 2019 (5).</p>

EFS was significantly decreased among those with low SET2,3 index relative to those with high SET2,3 index value, using the predefined cutoff (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; HR, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34â0.80 for high SET2,3 relative to low SET2,3; log-rank <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0026).

              <p>The SET2,3 genomic signature for sensitivity to endocrine therapy provides a measurement of nonproliferative endocrine-related transcription that is adjusted for baseline prognosis (7). Using the published cut-off point for prognosis after chemoendocrine therapy (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), approximately 48% of patients from Z1031 had high SET2,3 index prior to NeoET and significantly improved EFS. Distant and locoregional event rates were numerically lower, but rates of second primaries (including non-breast primaries) were not different.</p>
              <p>Both components of SET2,3 contributed independently significant prognostic information in the Z1031 population, similar to our observations in the setting of NAC followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy (7). Furthermore, we observed from Z1031 that SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> was more prognostic in higher-risk tumors (low BPI) and, conversely, BPI was more prognostic in tumors with lower endocrine-related activity (low SET<sub>ER/PR</sub>). This illustrates that measurement of baseline endocrine-related activity was complementary to assessment of baseline prognosis in the setting of adjuvant endocrine therapy.</p>
              <p>Our observation that patients with high SET2,3 cancer were more likely to experience early pharmacodynamic response compares favorably with the rate of post induction Ki67 â¤ 10% results reported from the WSG ADAPT HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>â</sup> trial of 84% in the 89 patients with recurrence score 0â11 and 76% in 225 of patients with recurrence score 12â25 (13, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Indeed, WSG ADAPT, ALTERNATE, the endocrine treatment arms of PALLET, and NeoMONARCH, provide additional opportunities to evaluate the SET2,3 assay for prediction of early pharmacodynamic response (Ki67 suppression; refs. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15â17</xref>). However, Ki67 suppression is probably not an optimal response surrogate for neoET combined with a cdk4/6 inhibitor because prevention of cell-cycle entry is a direct pharmacologic consequence. Indeed, the profoundly greater suppression of Ki67 observed from neoadjuvant trials when cdk4/6 inhibition was combined with endocrine treatment does not appear to predict survival benefit (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16â19</xref>). Other response parameters may be needed for cdk4/6 inhibitors, such as change in intrinsic subtype score or residual cancer burden which are being considered in the CORALLEEN and NEOPAL trials (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20, 21</xref>). Meanwhile, it is conceivable that SET2,3 (and/or SET<sub>ER/PR</sub>) might identify patients who benefit from a cdk4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy (it has not yet been tested), and our plan would be to compare outcomes from a randomized trial using a survival endpoint.</p>
              <p>Suppression of proliferation occurs quickly in response to NeoET and generally remains consistent during the course of NeoET treatments. For example, in the PALLET trial, Ki67 levels were lower at 2 weeks but did not decrease further after 14 weeks in the letrozole and in the combined letrozole and palbociclib treatment arms (16). In general, tumors with low proliferation at baseline remain low after 2 to 4 weeks of endocrine therapy, whereas tumors with high proliferation at baseline may become low. The POETIC trial evaluated paired biopsies of operable HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>â</sup> cancer before and after 2 weeks of letrozole in 2,235 patients (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Using &lt;10% to define low Ki67, 31% of cancers remained low Ki67, 18% remained high, 49% became low, and only 1% became high Ki67 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Similarly, a multigene proliferation score evaluated in Z1031 had lower scores in the baseline (pre-NeoET) biopsies from tumors that suppressed Ki67 to â¤10% after 2 to 4 weeks of endocrine therapy (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We observed this effect with the baseline prognostic index, probably because BPI includes the proliferation gene aurora kinase A (<italic toggle="yes">AURKA</italic>; ref. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The other component index (SET<sub>ER/PR</sub>) was designed to exclude genes obviously associated with proliferation yet had a significant but weaker association with Ki67 at baseline and at 2 to 4 weeks. This might be from indirect association between more differentiated cancer and lower proliferation. Importantly, high SET2,3 remained predictive of pharmacodynamic response in the tumor at 2 to 4 weeks after adjustment for the baseline Ki67 level in the tumor before treatment began, with adjusted ORs of 5.18 for Ki67 â¤ 10% and 2.78 for complete cell-cycle arrest.</p>
              <p>Ki67 level after 2 to 4 weeks of endocrine therapy was prognostic in Z1031 and in the much larger POETIC preoperative window trial (5, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, there was prognostic advantage for patients whose cancer had low Ki67 at diagnosis prior to treatment (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). An exploratory analysis of POETIC determined that prognostically optimal cut-off points for Ki67 would be at 20% at baseline and at 8% after 2 weeks of endocrine therapy (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We did not study the 8% cut-off point in cohort B because we had seen similar results using cut-off points of 10% and 2.7%.</p>
              <p>The proportion of women with <italic toggle="yes">yp</italic>Stage 0âI or PEPI = 0 pathologic response was not found to differ with respect to SET2,3 (high vs. low) or SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> (high vs. low) prior to NeoET. However, the proportion of women with <italic toggle="yes">yp</italic>Stage 0âI or PEPI = 0 was greater in those with high BPI prior to NeoET than those with low BPI. When dichotomized at the median, more favorable BPI was associated with approximately 3-fold increase in the percent of patients with either <italic toggle="yes">yp</italic>Stage 0âI (30% vs. 9%) or PEPI = 0 (33% vs. 11%). Pathologic response from NeoET is usually limited, because complete response (pCR) is rare and only a minority (20% to 25%) achieve <italic toggle="yes">yp</italic>Stage 0âI residual disease or cell cycleâarrested <italic toggle="yes">yp</italic>Stage IâII residual disease (PEPI = 0; refs. 1â<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). PEPI is the better response measure for estimation of prognosis, with PEPI score 0 (group 1, PEPI-0) and PEPI score 1â3 (group 2) having better response than PEPI score â¥4 (group 3; refs. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 12, 24</xref>). One interpretation of this association with BPI is that lower pretreatment clinical stage increases the probability of having lower pathologic stage after NeoET, especially if treated with a shorter duration of NeoET. This is supported by a recent analysis of the literature and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) that reported patients with clinical node-positive disease had low probability of converting to node-negative status after NeoET (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The rate of nodal conversion was 10% overall in the literature review and reached 15% in the NCDB analysis of patients with clinical N1 disease (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Another interpretation is that lower proliferation at baseline (<italic toggle="yes">AURKA</italic> component of RNA4) increases the probability of achieving cell-cycle arrest at the end of NeoET that is necessary to be classified as PEPI = 0. Molecular subtypes are also associated with PEPI response. In Z1031, luminal A cancers had higher PEPI = 0 rate than luminal B (27% vs. 11%), although the PAM50 luminal subtypes were not prognostic (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, we propose that luminal subtypes combined with clinical stage would be prognostic, similar to what we observed with BPI (RNA4 with clinical stage; ref. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). On the other hand, higher SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index was associated with early pharmacodynamic response to NeoET and contributed independently to long-term EFS outcomes, but was not associated with PEPI = 0 rate, suggesting that it might provide additional prognostic information to molecular subtype and pathologic response, similar to the setting of NAC (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>There are several limitations to this study. Although we used a predefined cut-off point for SET2,3 index, that cut-off point had been developed from patients who received NAC followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy and would have included some with more aggressive disease characteristics (7). Therefore, we conducted the threshold analyses to compare SET2,3 levels with response and patientsâ outcomes. Throughout the IQR of SET2,3 index, a higher SET2,3 value was generally associated with greater odds of pharmacodynamic response to endocrine therapy and improved EFS. Inspection of the threshold plots suggests that there may be an improved cut-off point at approximately 1.9, above which there are less significant odds of CCCA at 2 to 4 weeks or improved EFS over 8 years of follow-up. It is intuitively appealing to think that a cut-off point of SET2,3 index used to select patients for NeoET would be higher than the cut-off point of 1.77 that we had derived from the chemoendocrine treatment setting. However, the majority of patients from the Z1031 trial would have also received post-neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, any inferred revision to the cut-off point based on these EFS results would still need to be interpreted pragmatically, such that patients with significant residual disease after NeoET might then be offered adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>
              <p>Another limitation is that SET2,3 results were inferred from Agilent microarray gene expression measurements rather than the platform used to develop or to perform this test (7, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It is likely that this introduces some technical inaccuracy, although we had calibrated SET2,3 between genomic platforms to measure SET2,3 from a similar microarray platform to evaluate the I-SPY2 trial (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We also note that cohort B followed and was informed by cohort A. Also, cohort B is a subset with 141 patients who had assessment of early pharmacodynamic response and PEPI = 0 pathologic response, and had reduced statistical power for the analyses of early pharmacodynamic response and PEPI pathologic response. In addition, NeoET in Z1031 was for 16â18 weeks duration and it is possible that longer duration of NeoET might further reduce disease burden. For example, it was reported from a cohort study that clinical objective response and pCR rates increased with longer duration of NeoET up to 1 year (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Finally, quantitation of IHC stains for Ki67 might not be the most reproducible measure of proliferation, although best available practices were followed for the IHC analysis of Ki67 in these biopsy samples (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, measurement of SET2,3 index prior to treatment predicted early pharmacodynamic response to NeoET and improved EFS, but not PEPI = 0. Both components of the SET2,3 index contributed independently significant prognostic information, demonstrating that measurements of endocrine activity, molecular subtype, and clinical stage of breast cancer are complementary for prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy. These results also indicate the potential for SET2,3 as an integral biomarker to enrich for patients with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer to consider neoadjuvant endocrine-based therapy, and it should undergo further evaluation in that clinical context.</p>
