              <abstract>
                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have neuroprotective effects potentially useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their potential efficacy is not well understood. Here we report that protein acetylation in urea-soluble proteins is differently regulated in post-mortem ALS spinal cord. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis reveals several protein clusters with similar molecular weight but different charge status. Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identifies glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as the dominant component in the protein clusters. Further analysis indicates six heavily acetylated lysine residues at positions 89, 153, 189, 218, 259 and 331 of GFAP. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting confirms that the larger form of GFAP fragments are acetylated and upregulated in ALS spinal cord. Further studies demonstrate that acetylation of the proteins additional to GFAP is differently regulated, suggesting that acetylation and/or deacetylation play an important role in pathogenesis of ALS.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that typically leads to progressive paralysis and death within a few years of onset. However, the mechanism underlying the selective motor neuron degeneration of ALS has remained elusive. Several toxic mechanisms have been reported, including protein misfolding and aggregation <xref rid="pone.0080779-Nordlund1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Carra1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0080779-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Valentine1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, glutamate excitotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0080779-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Weydt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Strong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, neuro-inflammation <xref rid="pone.0080779-Henkel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Przedborski1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, mitochondrial dysfunction, and different environmental and/or genetic factors that lead to selective motor neuron damage <xref rid="pone.0080779-BentoAbreu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These diverse toxic mechanisms may contribute to non-cell autonomous motor neuron damage <xref rid="pone.0080779-Boillee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, or toxicity by non-neuronal glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia <xref rid="pone.0080779-Boillee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Interestingly, toxicity incurred directly within motor neurons is a central contributor to disease initiation, but only a minor contributor to disease progression <xref rid="pone.0080779-Lobsiger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Conversely, toxicity incurred in non-neuronal neighboring cells may amplify the initial insult and drives rapid disease progression, but may not be sufficient to initiate the disease <xref rid="pone.0080779-Lobsiger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Vargas1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The precise cause of most ALS is still largely unknown.</p>
              <p>A well-known hereditary factor is the genetic abnormality on chromosome 21 coding for copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which is associated with approximately 20% of familial cases of ALS or 2% of all ALS cases. Recent reports demonstrate mutations over a dozen of different proteins (TDP-43, TAR DNA-binding protein 43; FUS, Fused in Sarcoma; Ubiquilin-2, etc.) from ALS patients <xref rid="pone.0080779-BentoAbreu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Traub1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The high degree of mutations found in apparently “sporadic” ALS cases without family history suggests that genetics plays a more significant role than previously speculated. Markedly, protein aggregation is found as a pathological hallmark for all ALS and a common feature for many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases <xref rid="pone.0080779-Hopkins1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Olzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Because the insoluble protein aggregate is found just before or at the same time that ALS symptoms begin, it can be at least one of the causes for diverse neurotoxic responses. The SOD1 mutation is sufficient to induce non-cell autonomous motor neuron killing by an unknown gain of toxicity <xref rid="pone.0080779-Bruijn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Ilieva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Tiwari1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Further studies demonstrate that the dominant SOD1 mutant is misfolded and aggregated into cytoplasmic inclusion bodies <xref rid="pone.0080779-Tiwari1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Son1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. SOD1 aggregation into insoluble complexes is also an early event in the pathogenic process <xref rid="pone.0080779-DiGiorgio1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, suggesting that SOD1 aggregation contributes to the toxic responses. These observations imply that the common motor neuron toxicity in ALS may be associated with the abnormal protein aggregation or any cause that leads to accumulation of aggregates or blockage of aggregate clearance.</p>
              <p>Notably, expression of the aggregation-prone mutant SOD1 has been recently demonstrated to promote tubulin acetylation, suggesting that HDAC6 impairment might be a common feature in various subtypes of ALS <xref rid="pone.0080779-Gal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Indeed, HDAC inhibitors have been discovered as potential neuroprotective agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including ALS <xref rid="pone.0080779-EchanizLaguna1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, a major limitation lies in the broad spectrum of toxic side effects and even adverse effects. We hypothesize that the toxic side effects are due to the non-specificity of the HDAC inhibitors that may change the acetylation status of yet undefined substrates of deacetylases and/or products of acetylases, particularly in the insoluble protein aggregates relevant to the pathogenesis of ALS. In this study, we report protein acetylation recording in post-mortem spinal cord tissues with or without ALS using tandem mass spectrometry.</p>

In each case, the diagnosis of ALS was confirmed by post-mortem neuropathological examination and documentation of extensive neuronal loss and gliosis typical of ALS throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels of the spinal cord. Spinal cord tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) with 8 M urea (GE Healthcare), and proceeded with sonication in a W-225 sonicator (Heat Systems Ultrasonic Inc). The tissue lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant were collected as whole tissue lysate (urea-soluble proteins) for further analysis. Protein concentration was examined on NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the user’s manual. The soluble and insoluble protein fractions were obtained by dialysis of the urea-soluble proteins against PBS and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected as the soluble protein fraction for immunoprecipitation analysis; the pellet was used as the insoluble fraction for Western blotting by re-suspension in the SDS sample buffer.</p>

                <title>Differentially Expressed Protein Clusters in ALS and Non-ALS Spinal Cords</title>
                <p>Age-matched post-mortem spinal cords with ALS (n = 4) and non-ALS (n = 4) were requested from ALS Brain Bank. Whole tissue lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer containing high concentration of urea to increase the solubility of the protein aggregates. 300 µg of pooled urea-soluble proteins (whole tissue lysates) were analysed by 2D SDS-PAGE as described in Materials and Methods. No significant change was observed for most proteins; however, a few laddered protein clusters with molecular weight between 40–55 kDa, indicated as A1-8, B1-5, S1-5 and S6-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>), were significantly different in ALS and non-ALS. Notably, the proteins in each ladder were apparently similar in molecular weight, but different in the isoelectric points, suggesting different modifications on the charged residues in association with ALS. To identify these proteins, gel slices from the clusters were excised and digested with trypsin; peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080779-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was dominant in all clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>), while a few other neurofilament proteins such as NFL and Vimentin were also identified (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s003">S3</xref></bold>). Because each ladder of spots had 4–8 proteins apparently similar in molecular weight but different in isoelectric points, we reasoned that different ladders were from truncated/degraded GFAP fragments whereas the spots with similar molecular weight were due to varying degrees of modification at the charged residues.</p>

                <title>Heavily Acetylated GFAP in ALS Spinal Cord</title>
                <p>Because the laddered GFAP appeared as a few clusters of differently charged fragments, we hypothesized that these GFAP fragments were probably modified at the hydroxyls of serine/threonine/tyrosine residues by phosphorylation, and/or the amino group of lysine residue by acetylation. To test this hypothesis, the urea-soluble proteins were resolved and the dominant GFAP bands were excised and digested with trypsin. The tryptic GFAP peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS with the option of modification for acetylation and phosphorylation. GFAP was identified with 73% coverage (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Although no phosphorylation was observed within this sequence range, six peptides containing the acetylated lysine residue were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080779-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>
<bold>)</bold>. MS/MS spectra of three identified peptides with acetylated lysine were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>. Acetylated lysines were spread within the α-helical coiled-coil domain of the filament structure <xref rid="pone.0080779-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> at positions 89, 153, 189, 218, 259 and 331 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). Considering that a few acetylated lysines might have been missed in the uncovered GFAP sequence, the six acetylated lysine positions fairly matched the pattern of the laddered GFAP clusters, i.e. 4–8 protein spots of the similar molecular weight on the 2D gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Thus, it supported our hypothesis that the truncated GFAP fragments in each ladder might have different degrees of acetylation at the identified lysine sites.</p>

Thus, we hypothesized that lysine acetylation found in ALS spinal cords might be involved in inhibition of aggregate degradation. The urea-soluble proteins were divided to soluble and insoluble fractions as described in Material and Methods and analysed separately by SDS-PAGE and immune blotting using the anti-GFAP antibody. While different GFAP fragments were consistently observed, the larger forms of GFAP fragments were differently distributed between the soluble and insoluble protein fractions in ALS and non-ALS spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A, B</bold></xref>). In the insoluble fraction, the larger forms of GFAP (GFAP-a, b) were found more in ALS than in non-ALS spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). In the soluble fraction, however, they were found more in non-ALS than ALS. These findings were supportive of our hypothesis that, in ALS, the larger forms of GFAP were probably more resistant to the degradation process and thus accumulated in the insoluble protein aggregate.</p>

                <title>Differentially Regulated Protein Acetylation in ALS and Non-ALS Spinal Cords</title>
                <p>To compare the difference of lysine acetylation additional to GFAP, the urea-soluble proteins from ALS and non-ALS were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane and detected by the anti-acetyl lysine antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>, the patterns of the acetylated proteins in ALS and non-ALS spinal cords were different. The acetylated lanes indicated with arrows were apparently present in ALS but absent in non-ALS spinal cords. Conceivably, these acetylated proteins were either the substrates of yet undefined deacetylase (HDAC) or the products of yet undefined acetyltransferase (HAT, Histone acetyltransferases). Therefore, it was conceivable that acetylation of these proteins was activated or deacetylation of these proteins was blocked in ALS spinal cords. Markedly, there were also lanes present in non-ALS but absent in ALS spinal cords (indicated with arrowheads). This could be explained as that deacetylation of these proteins was activated or acetylation was blocked in ALS spinal cords. In order to identify the different acetylated proteins in ALS postmortem spinal cord, we immunoprecipitated possible acetylated proteins from ALS and non-ALS spinal cords using immobilized anti-acetyl lysine antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins, theoretically the acetylated proteins, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Sypro Ruby as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g006"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>. In order to perform immunoprecipitation, the total urea soluble proteins were dialyzed to remove urea and the insoluble proteins; thus, the result reflected the acetylated proteins in the soluble fraction. Nevertheless, significantly more acetylated proteins were obtained from ALS spinal cord, especially in the range that was later identified as GFAP. It was consistent with the 2D gel analysis that different GFAP clusters were observed in ALS spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>

This provided additional support that acetylation was involved in the regulation of GFAP degradation. Interestingly, GFAP knockout mice undergo multiple degenerative processes including abnormal myelination and disruption of blood-brain barrier <xref rid="pone.0080779-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. U5 was PCP4L1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s006">Fig. S6</xref></bold>), the Purkinje cell protein-4 like 1; but the difference in expression as determined by the Mascot score was not significant. U6 was identified as myelin basic protein (MBP) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s007">Fig. S7</xref></bold>), an important protein in CNS myelination. Acetylation of MBP at the N-terminal end was known; however, acetylation at its side chain has not yet been reported. U7 was identified as histone 4 (H4) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080779.s008">Fig. S8</xref></bold>). Although HDACs and HATs were originally found in acetylation of histones, it needs further investigation to address why the acetylated H4 is enhanced in post-mortem spinal cord with ALS.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our proteomic approach reveals a significant difference in protein acetylation at the lysine residues between the post-mortem ALS and non-ALS spinal cords. Because the acetylated proteins are the substrates of deacetylase (HDAC) and/or the products of acetyltransferase (HAT), our results demonstrate that yet undefined HDAC, HAT or the factors that affect their activities are impaired in ALS. Our findings are consistent with a recent study from another group reporting that ALS-linked mutant SOD1 can modulate HDAC6 activity <xref rid="pone.0080779-Gal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, suggesting that HDAC6 impairment might be a common feature in various subtypes of ALS.</p>
              <p>Generally, because the deacetylation activity of yet undefined HDACs specific for these proteins may be inhibited in ALS spinal cord, one may assume that inhibition of the HDAC activity, <italic>i.e.</italic> HDAC inhibitors, would have a toxic effect, whereas enhancement of this activity would be protective against ALS. Indeed, some HDACs have neuroprotective, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory properties across multiple neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0080779-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Schmalbach1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Saha1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. For instance, HDAC6 has shown protective effects and certain HDAC inhibitors are shown to cause a variety of toxic side effects <xref rid="pone.0080779-Schmalbach1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Selvi1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. SIRT1 deacetylase protects against neurodegeneration in models of Alzheimer’s disease as well as ALS <xref rid="pone.0080779-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, although enhancing SIRT1 activity by resveratrol did not affect functional improvement or increased longevity in an SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS <xref rid="pone.0080779-Markert1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The most apparent effect of protein acetylation is the inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein degradation <xref rid="pone.0080779-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0080779-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It is thus conceivable that deacetylation of certain acetylated proteins would ameliorate disease progression. In our study, 2-dimensional gel analysis reveals differently modified GFAP clusters of urea-soluble proteins in ALS spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Significantly higher levels of the larger GFAP fragments are found in the insoluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>), supporting the notion that protein degradation may be impaired in ALS. In consistent, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with the acetyl-lysine antibody confirms that the larger forms of GFAP fragments in the soluble fractions are acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080779-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). In particular, the acetylated larger GFAP fragments are upregulated in ALS spinal cord, suggesting that protein acetylation is involved in GFAP degradation in ALS.</p>
              <p>The biological function of non-histone substrates of HDAC/HAT might have been underestimated. A question is raised whether HDAC is required for protein degradation especially under ALS condition. It has been demonstrated that genetic mutations play an important role and aggregate-prone mutations could trigger insoluble protein aggregate in ALS <xref rid="pone.0080779-Gal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. When the production of misfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of the chaperone refolding system (CRS) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), misfolded proteins are actively transported to cytoplasmic aggregate inclusions that will be eventually cleared by autophagy <xref rid="pone.0080779-Olzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080779-Knaevelsrud1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Recent studies indicate that UPS targets misfolded proteins for degradation, while autophagy acts as a compensatory degradation system when UPS is blocked <xref rid="pone.0080779-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Interestingly, autophagy compensates for UPS dysfunction in an HDAC6-dependent manner, while HDAC6 is a microtubule-associated histone deacetylase that interacts with poly-ubiquitinated proteins and the dynein motor protein. Overexpression of HDAC6 in a fly model of neurodegenerative disease indeed accelerates the degradation of the aggregate-prone protein by autophagy and protects the flies from neurotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0080779-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the spectrum of HDAC substrates of whether and how they are involved in protein degradation of the insoluble protein aggregate in ALS spinal cord.</p>
              <p>Notably, GFAP is not previously known as a substrate of acetylation and this is the first report that GFAP is heavily acetylated. GFAP is an essential component of filament in astrocytes and plays an important role in astrocyte-neuron interactions as well as cell-cell communication. Many studies have shown that ALS is at least partially a non-cell autonomous disease and that non-motor neuron cells such as astrocytes expressing mutant hSOD1 contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS. Mutant SOD1 within non-neuronal cells including astrocytes is an important contributor to motor neuronal toxicity and disease progression <xref rid="pone.0080779-Ilieva1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, because mutant SOD1 has been shown to modulate HDAC6 activity and increases tubulin acetylation <xref rid="pone.0080779-Gal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, it is possible that GFAP acetylation is also a consequence of abnormal HDAC6 activity in astrocytes of ALS spinal cord.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
