                <p>The purpose of this feasibility pilot study was to assess benefits of 8 weeks of yoga in
people with chronic pain. Participants completed baseline assessments and were randomized
to yoga or usual care. Yoga was offered twice a week for 8 weeks. We assessed feasibility
and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was the primary outcome, assessing pain-severity and
pain interference on daily activities. Eighty-three people were recruited; 67 people
completed the study and were included in the analyses. Average age of participants was
50.78 ± 10.43 years and most participants had pain &gt;10 years. The intervention appeared
feasible and there were significant improvements (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in multiple
measures for the yoga group, including a decrease in BPI interference scores from 7.15 ±
1.70 to 6.14 ± 2.21 (<italic>P</italic> = .007). There was a significant difference in
body responsiveness and pain management scores between groups at 8 weeks. It appears that
yoga was feasible and positively influenced multiple outcome measures for people with
chronic pain.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Chronic pain is a significant national issue that leads to decreased quality of life and an
annual cost of $635 billion a year.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Direct and indirect costs are associated with loss of paid work and increases in
disability benefits, and increased use of opioids.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As society finds itself in an opioid epidemic, treatment costs and mortality rates are
quickly increasing.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, despite increased use of opioids and other treatments, chronic pain continues
to be disabling and persistent for many individuals. Perhaps this is why treatment of chronic
pain requires multifaceted interventions that address the complex accumulation of physical,
psychological, and social factors that contribute to chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For example, there may be biological factors behind the sensation of pain, but the
cognitive awareness of and the emotional response to the pain contribute to the overall
experience of chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Given the complexities of pain management, and that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention recommends nonopioid treatments, research on innovative nonpharmacological
treatments to improve management of chronic pain is urgently needed.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
</p>
            <p>Because chronic pain involves multiple facets, the whole person is affected, and is likely
why individuals with chronic pain are large consumers of complementary and integrative
therapies (CIT).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, a holistic mind-body intervention that is capable of simultaneously
targeting multiple factors may be the most effective intervention for people with pain.
Integrative therapies, such as yoga, address the whole person, connect the mind and body, and
are holistic. Additionally, emotional or cognitive responses to the physical pain may lead to
a disconnect between the mind and body, which may also be addressed via yoga.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The sense of the mind and body reconnecting through yoga may be associated with
improved awareness of afferent (sensory) feedback allowing for more effective efferent (motor)
commands to muscles, reducing muscle tension, spasms, and associated pain.</p>
            <p>Hatha yoga is considered gentle and is the foundation of other types of yoga most often found
in the United States. As a result, Hatha yoga was used in this study, and the yoga components
included in the intervention were physical postures, composed of stretching and strengthening (asanas)<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>; diaphragmatic breathing (pranayama)<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; positive affirmations (mantras); and meditation (dhyana).<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Physical asana or postures simultaneously address flexibility and strengthening<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> needs of the individual, often times cited as common issues for people with chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, yoga may do more than heal the physical aspects of pain. For example, yoga may
lead to changes in cognition<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> or in emotional regulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Yoga may also help people reduce pain interference,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> defined as the interference pain has on everyday life and functioning.</p>
            <p>Authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses tend to focus on specific locations of pain
(low back pain, neck pain), but indicate that yoga decreases pain severity and pain-related
interference on activities; however, authors note that additional research regarding yoga and
pain is still needed.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr19-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, research has been completed in tightly controlled randomized controlled
trials and most often only includes participants with one type or location of chronic pain
(ie, back pain, low back pain, arthritis, migraines, fibromyalgia).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Maintaining one type of pain in a study, such as low back pain, neck pain, or
headaches, is an important and logical first step in the yoga and pain research trajectory.
However, based on systematic reviews, yoga has been shown to work for many pain populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr19-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important to begin to translate the research that supports using yoga
for pain into the real world (moving from research bench to bedside). Our local chronic pain
clinic serves clients with any type of pain and were excited about the opportunity of adding
yoga to the clinic. We therefore developed and tested a yoga intervention for participants
with different types or locations of pain. Currently, there is no published research regarding
the use of yoga in a community-based setting for individuals with any type or location of
pain. Therefore, this study is unique in that the purpose of this study was to assess the
feasibility and benefits of an 8-week yoga intervention delivered in a community-based pain
clinic (Clinic) to people with any type or location of pain. All participants received usual
care, including monthly self-management programming. Self-management is an interdisciplinary,
multifaceted intervention shown to be effective to improve pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Self-management allows participants to dynamically participate in their treatment,
focusing on perceived problems and concerns.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>

                <p>Feasibility data were collected and included information regarding: recruitment; adverse
events/safety; attendance; maintenance of blinding; study participants’ ability to
complete the intervention; acceptability; and fidelity. The assessor was blinded to
randomization and did not attend the yoga intervention. To assess acceptability,
participants randomized to yoga completed an evaluation form after the completion of the
eight-weeks of yoga. The form included 7 questions on a 1-to-7 Likert-type scale with a
score of 7 being the best or the highest. Participants were also asked what was helpful or
not helpful and for recommendations for future yoga classes. Fidelity, or the yoga
teachers’ adherence to the yoga intervention protocol, was documented using a prepared
check-off form, including specific components, such as specific planned yoga postures,
breath work, poses paired with breath, eye movements, mantra, and meditation at the end of
class. Both the yoga teacher and an observer completed the fidelity check-off form. If a
part of the intervention was missed, the item was noted and the yoga teacher was reminded
to include the item in the next session (as appropriate).</p>

                <p>Self-report assessments were completed by participants on their own time and were
returned to the study personnel within 2 weeks of the intervention beginning or ending. An
assessor who was blinded to randomization allocation assisted participants as needed to
complete all assessments. Demographic information and data related to pain characteristics
(eg, time since pain onset, reason for pain, limitations due to pain, medications) were
included. Once participants returned their baseline assessment package to the study
personnel, they were randomized to yoga or the usual care group. Randomization was
completed at the individual level using a random number generator.</p>
                <p>Pain severity and pain interference on daily activities was measured with the Brief Pain
Inventory (BPI). The BPI is considered a reliable and valid assessment to understand pain
related interference on everyday life and has been used in hundreds of studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The BPI has 2 subscales, assessing both pain severity and pain interference. The
pain severity subscale includes 4 items and each item is rated between a 0 (no pain) to 10
(pain as bad as you can imagine) to assess the intensity of pain now and during the past
week. The 7 items that assess pain interference on daily activities address general
activity, mood, mobility, work, relationships, sleep, and enjoyment in life. Scores for
each item ranges from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (interferes completely). Mean scores
are included for the 2 subscales and the total score. Lower scores indicate less pain
severity or less pain interference.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>

individuals with chronic pain. There are 8 domains, including current physical and mental
health, limitation of activities due to health, and functional items such as housework and mobility.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> As it is now common in the literature, we calculated a single total score by

                <p>As all participants received monthly self-management programming as part of usual care,
we included assessments regarding self-efficacy to manage chronic pain. We included the
Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSS) and the 6-item Stanford Self-Efficacy for Managing
Chronic Disease (SSMCD-6) assessments. The CPSS has been used in people with chronic pain
and is considered reliable and valid.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The CPSS includes 3 domains and a total score, domains include items assessing
self-efficacy for pain management (9 items), physical function (5 items), and coping with
symptoms (8 items).<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Participants indicate the percent, from 0% to 100%, of their confidence to address
each item. We included mean domain and total scores (each with a range from 0% to 100%),
increased scoring indicates improved self-efficacy. The SSMCD-6 includes 6 items related
to pain and chronic disease and how confident a person is, from 0% to 100%, to complete
each item.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Valid and reliable items address management of fatigue, physical discomfort,
emotional distress, other health symptoms, daily activities, and medication use. Increased
scoring indicates increased confidence and scores range from 0% to 100%. Finally, we
assessed body responsiveness using the Body Responsiveness scale by Daubenmier.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The scale includes 7 items and participant answers indicate if the statement is
“not at all true about me” or “very true about me.” Items address the mind-body connection
and includes items such as asking whether the participants “listen to their body,” if they
“suppress bodily feelings,” and whether “my mind and my body often want to do different
things.” Increased scoring indicates increased body responsiveness or enhanced mind-body
connection.</p>

                <p>Yoga was offered twice a week for eight weeks (16 sessions); each session lasted 60
minutes and the program was standardized and progressive, moving from sitting postures, to
then include standing and floor postures. To best accommodate the needs of participants

physical therapist. Yoga postures were modified as needed so that individuals could
successfully complete each posture. Multiple props were used to enhanced modification of

in the Clinic includes monthly visits with the medical provider, recording of vitals (ie,
blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygen), pain medication management, goal setting,
nutritional counseling as needed, a set number of visits to a massage therapist or
acupuncturist, and monthly self-management programming. All individuals treated in the
Clinic were expected to attend 1 monthly self-management education session. While
attendance to the self-management sessions was tracked and recorded, visits to massage or
acupuncture were not, as those visits were to professionals outside of the Pain Clinic
network. Decisions about self-management educational topics were selected by an
interdisciplinary team that included the physician, nurse, nutritionist, and psychologist.
The monthly 1-hour self-management education sessions were led by the Clinic nurse as part
of the standard of care for this clinic. Self-management education sessions included
information regarding health and wellness, but not necessarily pain management. For
example, participants received education on smoking cessation, which is not directly
linked to pain management, but may be helpful to general improvements in health.</p>

                  <p>Time since the start of pain ranged widely and is presented as a dichotomous variable
of less than or more than 10 years since the start of pain. In the sample, 43 (66%; n =
65) of the individuals reported their pain began over 10 years ago. As we included any
chronic pain (not limiting to only back pain), the type or location of pain and reason
for pain varied greatly. The majority of people reported that pain was located in more
than one area or joint and 24 participants (36%) reported headaches or migraines.
Participants were asked to identify the primary reason for their pain, 34 individuals
(57%; n = 60) indicated that their pain was related to trauma (eg, automobile accident,
work injury, fall). The other participants indicated that their pain was disease
oriented (eg, arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraines, stroke). When asked if participants
felt they had limitations related to their pain (yes or no), 51 participants (88%; n =
58) said yes, they sustained limitations secondary to chronic pain. Finally, all
participants, except one, were using opioid medications for pain management and
participants were taking an average of nearly 10 medications every day.</p>

yoga intervention included the following: a participant came to yoga very ill, found to
be related to an overdose of medications that led to nausea and dizziness, Clinic staff
called for an ambulance and client was hospitalized; and a participant was found in her
home deceased, related to her comorbidities. Nonserious adverse events reported that
were likely related to yoga included dizziness (likely from forward folds for an
individual with low blood pressure); increased muscle or joint pain, likely related to
increased movement; a fall to the floor, without injury, for a participant who had
impaired mobility and who used a walker, but who refused to use the walker when
completing the standing postures (study staff were assigned to work with her; however,
she still sustained a fall); and nausea and diarrhea for a client who came into yoga
feeling ill but who did not report her symptoms, the twisting postures and forward folds
in the yoga session likely exacerbated her symptoms making her sicker during the
session.</p>

completed data and were therefore included in the data analysis. Attendance to yoga was
tracked, and on average, for those participants included in these analyses, 12.11 ± 2.3
sessions were attended out of a possible 16 sessions. Missed yoga classes were related
to lack of transportation, illness, new job, did not like yoga, worried that yoga would
increase pain, worried that the medical doctor would alter or stop the opioid
prescription if participant reported decreased pain due to yoga, or yoga increased pain.
Attendance to usual care self-management monthly classes were tracked, all study
participants were offered 2 sessions during the eight-week period. On average,
participants in both groups attended 1.9 ± 0.28 self-management sessions, there were no

props (bolsters, wedges), or provide verbal or physical cueing to facilitate completion
of the yoga intervention. When a certain pose was not accessible to an individual
participant, a modification was provided or the participant was reminded to just take a
breath, perhaps imagining their body in the pose. It is common practice in yoga to ask
participants to honor and listen to their body, making modifications or rest a normal
part of a yoga practice. The yoga teachers were also an occupational or physical
therapist, both adept at modifying poses.</p>

0.5), and the physical environment (6.4 ± 0.8). Participants found the breathing,
relaxation techniques, instructors, and stretching exercises particularly helpful. There
were few recommendations for improvement. When asked what they would change about the
intervention, participants concluded, “Nothing! Everything was great. The teacher was
great!” or “Nothing, I learned a lot from yoga.” The only recommendations offered
included the possibility of increasing each class session from 1 hour to 1.5 hours and

                <p>Interestingly, QoL total scores increased significantly for both the yoga (15%) and the
usual care control group (about 14%; <xref rid="table3-2515690X19863763" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Average QoL total scores did not significantly differ between yoga and
usual care control groups at 8 weeks, adjusting for baseline QoL score (<italic>P</italic>
= .906; <xref rid="table4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). All 3
domains and the total score for the CPSS significantly improved for the yoga group but not
for the usual care control group. The total score for the CPSS improved by 27% from 49.08
± 24.76 to 62.27 ± 22.44 (<italic>P</italic> = .008) for participants in the yoga group.
This change in score indicates improved self-efficacy surrounding pain management,
physical function, and coping with symptoms. A moderate effect size was found for the CPSS
pain management, physical functioning, and coping domains (<italic>d</italic> ≥ 0.5).
Average CPSS total, pain management, and physical function 8-week scores significantly
differed between yoga and usual care control groups, adjusting for the baseline score,
with participants in the yoga group having a higher average CPSS in these domains (<xref rid="table4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The 8-week average CPSS
coping score did not significantly differ between yoga and usual care control groups,
adjusting for baseline CPSS coping score (<xref rid="table4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>SSMCD-6 scores significantly improved for individuals randomized to the yoga group (30.11
± 12.08 to 36.68 ± 12.27, <italic>P</italic> = .006). The 22% improvement in SSMCD-6
scores indicates improved confidence to address pain and chronic disease. There was not a
significant difference between yoga and usual care control groups 8-week average SSMCD-6
scores, adjusting for baseline SSMCD-6 score (<xref rid="table4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Finally, Body Responsiveness Scale scores
significantly improved by 18% in the yoga group (from 26.46 ± 6.25 to 31.32 ± 6.28,
<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) with a moderate effect size (≥0.5). The average 8-week
body responsiveness scores significantly differed between yoga and usual care control
groups, adjusting for baseline body responsiveness, with yoga average body responsiveness
higher than usual care control group body responsiveness (95% CI 1.79-7.46; <xref rid="table4-2515690X19863763" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Other than the QoL
scores, there were no significant differences between baseline and 8-week scores for the

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Through this feasibility and pilot RCT, we found that providing 8 weeks of yoga at a
community pain clinic to people with different types and location of pain was both feasible
and beneficial.</p>
              <sec id="section20-2515690X19863763">
                <title>Feasibility</title>
                <p>Within the pain clinic, where individuals already receive pain management, we recruited
83 people in only 5 months. This may indicate a great need for novel pain interventions,
perhaps specifically nonpharmaceutical interventions. While there were not severe adverse
events related to the study, it seems most events were related to study participants not
listening to their bodies and trying to “push through” to be part of the yoga class. While
participants were taught to honor and listen to their bodies, it was also clear that some
of them came to yoga and participated in yoga when they should have maybe taken a rest or
a break. For example, someone who was dizzy after forward folds was encouraged to take a
break but instead continued her yoga practice but became dizzier.</p>
                <p>On average, participants randomized to yoga attended 75% of the 16 sessions (12.11 ±
2.3). This is a similar attendance rate to our other 16-session/8-week interventions. We
did have 16 participants drop out of the yoga group (16/44 = 36%). This dropout rate is
higher than we have seen in our other studies, where it has been more likely to see 5% to
20% attrition rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> This dropout rate may be attributable to this study having limited resources
through a small internal grant. The dropout rate perhaps was also related to us including
individuals with any type of pain. Perhaps future trails should not include any type of
pain, but instead limit to musculoskeletal pain. Musculoskeletal pain would still be more
inclusive than studies that only included low back pain, but would not mix people with
migraines or complex regional pain syndrome with people with musculoskeletal pain. It may
be that migraine or complex regional pain syndrome pain is inherently different and
requires a different yoga intervention. However, we must also question the feasibility of
an 8-week yoga intervention for people with significant pain and who are also
underresourced and underserved. Yoga class attendance was likely not a priority for people
who were homeless or underemployed, thus the delivery of the intervention may need to be
additionally flexible. We included evening classes, but to enhance attendance and decrease
attrition it may be necessary to also include classes on the weekend or alter the “dose”
of yoga and offering it weekly instead of twice a week. Further feasibility testing is
likely necessary.</p>
                <p>Additionally, while participants did not quite use these exact words, we also had the
sense from participants who dropped out or who missed many sessions, that they were
somewhat attached to their pain, and their pain medicines. It seems that some participants
had their personal identify wrapped up with their chronic pain and were not sure how to
handle a shift in this identity. For others, we heard concern that if their pain
decreased, their prescription for their pain mediation might be changed and they were
concerned about being able to manage their pain with less medications. These are important
and complex issues to manage, likely requiring additional therapy or interventions.</p>
                <p>It appears the study and intervention were completed as planned. For example, the
assessor remained blinded for 76% of the assessments. This was a challenge, as while
individuals randomized to yoga were asked to not talk about yoga or changes they
attributed the yoga, some participants were very enthusiastic about the yoga programming
and their improvements. Therefore, some participants “slipped” and disclosed that they
were randomized to yoga. In our future studies we will provide an active control group,
rather than a usual care control group, which should alleviate some issues related to
blinding. Through modification of the yoga practice, all individuals were able to complete
the yoga intervention. Additionally, participants determined the yoga teachers and the
yoga sessions were acceptable. For example, on a scale of 1 to 7 with a 7 being the
highest score, scores for all 7 items on the acceptability form were a 5 or greater.
Finally, the yoga teacher and an observer completed the fidelity check-off form. Of the 80
classed offered, 88% of the classes were completed precisely to the protocol. There were
only 10 yoga sessions (with 23 instances) where a component of yoga being missed. Most
often, poses where omitted in order to complete the class on time.</p>

                  <title>Outcome Measures</title>
                  <p>Participants with chronic pain who were randomized to receive 8 weeks of yoga
significantly improved in all outcome measures, except for BPI pain severity. Effect
sizes were small to moderate for the BPI pain-related interference score (0.493) and
moderate to large for the QoL Rand-36 total scores, CPSS pain management and physical
functioning scores, and body responsiveness scores (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> ≥ .50).<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the usual care control, only the QoL Rand-36 scores increased significantly
and had an effect size of 1.20, nearly the same as changes demonstrated by individuals
randomized to the yoga intervention. This is perhaps secondary to the high level of care
received as part of usual care, including monthly self-management programming. Treatment
in the Clinic likely includes more time with a clinician and resources than typical pain
management settings. The Clinic has not studied their outcomes related to their
programming, but it is possible that usual care received in the Clinic is enough to
improve QoL scores, but not other constructs measured as part of this study.</p>
                  <p>To our knowledge, this is the first yoga study to include people with any type or
location of chronic pain (ie, back pain, low back pain, arthritis, migraines) and to be
embedded into a community-based clinic, not completed in a research laboratory. In
studies or in reviews that include people with only one type or location of pain, pain
severity has improved.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr19-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This is in contrast to the results from the current study, where BPI pain
severity scores worsened by 1% (not clinically significant). However, after yoga, BPI
pain interference scores, or how pain interferes with day to day life, significantly
decreased (<italic>P</italic> = .007) by 14% with an effect size of 0.493. This
indicates that the physical pain severity did not change for individuals, perhaps due to
the different types of pain sustained in the group. A review of the literature indicates
that different types of yoga or different yoga protocols are included for different
types of pain. For example, we used Hatha yoga in this study; Hatha yoga is a common and
gentle type of yoga and has been used to improve pain for individuals with low back pain,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> irritable bowel syndrome,<sup><xref rid="bibr39-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> pain after stroke,<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> muscle soreness,<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> arthritis,<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and even individuals on hemodialysis.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Other researchers found positive impacts on pain using Iyengar yoga in people

                  <p>Some participants in our study had low back pain, but others had migraines, cancer
related pain, stroke related pain, trauma or arthritis in other parts of the body,
cervical neck pain, fibromyalgia, or neuropathies. As we included individuals with many
types of pain in differing locations and stemming from many different causes, we were
not able to target certain body parts or needs. We therefore delivered a more
generalized yoga protocol that addressed the whole body and included breath work and
meditation. We included language about listening to the body and not pushing through
pain. The yoga teacher also included “letting go” of the pain during the practice and
the meditation, and stated that sometimes the pain would not decrease or change, but
that participants could change their relationship (interference) with the pain. This may
have led to the significant improvements found in BPI interference and body response for
the people in the yoga group (moderate effect size).</p>
                  <p>As this was a pilot study, we did not expect to see differences between yoga and usual
care control groups, there was however a difference in body responsiveness and 2 of the
CPSS domain scores at 8 weeks. CPSS scores were improved in pain management and physical
functioning for individuals randomized to yoga. Perhaps, as yoga improves neural
connectivity, executive functioning, and memory,<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> participating in yoga may have enhanced comprehension of self-management
education. Using yoga to change the internal conversation about pain may have allowed
for the improvements in body responsiveness scores (or listening to your body), as well
as pain-related interference, and self-efficacy. Additionally, yoga may be used as a
coping tool, and may thereby enhance the ability to cope with pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The delivery of our yoga protocol in this manner may have allowed for the
improvement we found in pain interference in daily activities. Importantly, using the
same yoga protocol for all participants, regardless of type or location of pain,
increases the generalizability of the yoga program and allows participants to more
easily transition to local beginner yoga classes that may be offered in the
community.</p>
                  <p>In the yoga group, there were significant improvements in CPSS domain and total scores
and SSMCD-6 scores. Improved scores indicate improved self-efficacy surrounding pain and
chronic disease management. A moderate effect size was demonstrated for CPSS management
and physical function. Participants in the yoga group and usual care control group both
received self-management education, but there were no improvements found for people in
the usual care control group. Additionally, self-management is effective with people
with chronic pain and improves the ability to manage pain on a daily basis.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Self-management interventions often include education regarding the importance of
physical activity, however do not include guided activity. Also, individuals with pain
are often fearful of movement or that exercise may elicit increased pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2515690X19863763" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> We addressed the need of guided physical activity by adding yoga to ongoing
self-management and provided a low intensity activity that was easily modified with less
risk of increasing pain.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This was a pilot RCT and therefore had limitations. We were not powered to detect
differences between groups, instead, the sample size was simply based on the number of
individuals who could be recruited in a short recruitment period. An additional
limitation, is that on average, only about 75% of the yoga classes were attended. As
common in smaller studies, results cannot be generalized because of the size of the study
and also because the Clinic is in a smaller city in the Southwest United States. As this
was a complex sample (ie, pain &gt;10 years, high opioid use, high activity limitations
due to pain), it may have been warranted to have a longer treatment duration to have
greater treatment effects. Additionally, the Clinic is a safety net facility caring for
people who are underserved and have less resources (ie, homelessness, poverty, low
education rates). When basic needs are not met there are other challenges related to pain
management and self-management that cannot be addressed with yoga. Most participants were
not able to financially afford to continue with yoga outside of the Clinic, thus limiting
sustainability of their improvements. However, the administrators at the Clinic witnessed
the results of the study, and began to offer free weekly yoga classes. Finally, there was
variance seen in multiple outcome measures at both baseline and follow up. These issues
were controlled for and may be eliminated with a larger study, but may have affected
results in our smaller pilot study.</p>

                <title>Future Directions and Conclusion</title>
                <p>In future studies, yoga should be compared with active exercise control groups but may
also be added to pain specific self-management. Protocols that combine yoga and
self-management education may also be helpful for other populations who suffer from
chronic pain or who have other needs commonly addressed with self-management.
Additionally, there may be a possibility to continue to transition yoga further into the
community by taking yoga out of the clinic and making yoga more adaptable and affordable
in the community. Our general yoga protocol appears to have worked for people with
different types and location of pain and would therefore allow for use by increased number
of people to improve pain related outcomes.</p>
