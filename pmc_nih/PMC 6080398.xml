                  <p id="Par1">Disparities in the prevalence of HIV persist in the southern United States, and young African American women have a disproportionate burden of HIV as compared with young women of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. As a result, engaging young African American women in the HIV care continuum through HIV testing is imperative. This study is designed to reach this key population at risk for HIV. The study seeks to test the efficacy of two formats of a gender-focused, evidence-based, HIV-risk reduction intervention—the Young Women’s CoOp (YWC)—relative to HIV counseling and testing (HCT) among young African American women between the ages of 18 and 25 who use substances and have not recently been tested for HIV.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Using a seek-and-test framework, this three-arm cross-over randomized trial is being conducted in three county health departments in North Carolina. Each county is assigned to one of three study arms in each cycle: in-person (face-to-face) YWC, mobile Health (mHealth) YWC, or HCT. At study enrollment, participants complete a risk behavior survey via audio computer-assisted self-interview, and drug, alcohol, and pregnancy screening tests, and are then referred to HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing through their respective health departments. Participants in either of the YWC arms are asked to return approximately 1 week later to either begin the first of two in-person individual intervention sessions or to pick up the mHealth intervention preloaded on a tablet after a brief introduction to using the app. Participants in all arms are asked to return for a 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up, and repeat the survey and biological testing from baseline.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">HIV continues to be a significant public health issue in the United States. Disparities in the burden of HIV persist with regard to ethnicity, geographic area, age, and gender. Although African Americans account for 12% of the U.S. population, they are disproportionately affected by HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, 57% of African Americans living with HIV reside in the southern United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and many are emerging adults. Unfortunately, HIV incidence among young African American women is also striking. For example, African American women aged 20–24 are diagnosed with HIV at almost 12 times the rate of their White counterparts. In North Carolina, young African American women are the most affected group of young women; of the newly diagnosed cases of HIV among young women in 2016, approximately 61% were among African American young women compared with 36% among White young women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These statistics illustrate the gravity and need for interventions to reach young African American women for increased HIV testing and more gender-focused prevention.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Engaging young African American women in HIV testing is essential to improving the health of those who are HIV positive and reducing the risk of transmission to others. Only 45% of African American women reported being tested for HIV in the past year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; however, African American women who engage in heterosexual sex account for about 21% of undiagnosed HIV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consequently, many young African American women may be unaware of their HIV-positive status and unknowingly transmit HIV to others. Many young women know it is important to get tested, but they face barriers to testing. Some women may not believe they are at risk for HIV and, as such, do not get tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Stigma and shame may also influence their decision to get tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a study of African American college students in the South, participants cited that barriers to getting tested were lack of knowledge of testing sites, a fear of harming a relationship, and a fear of breaches of confidentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">The disproportionate burden of HIV among young African American women is largely attributable to high community-level HIV prevalence coupled with condensed sexual networks that increase the risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given the increased risk of HIV, it is imperative for young African American women to protect themselves during sex. Condom use is the most accessible and inexpensive means of HIV protection to date. However, only 21% of African American women used a condom every time they had sex with their partners in the past year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], indicating that a significant proportion of women are potentially at risk for HIV.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Several factors have been associated with condomless sex among young African American women. Gender-based violence (GBV) and substance use are associated with sexual risk behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. During their lifetime, about 36% of African American women have experienced sexual violence and 45% of African American women have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), including sexual and physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. IPV often creates power inequalities among heterosexual couples—women may not feel empowered to negotiate condom use out of fear for their safety or resistance from their partners—leading to inconsistent condom use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, African American women may feel that asking their partner(s) to use a condom may imply infidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or that condoms are unnecessary because they believe they are in an exclusive relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Inconsistent condom use is also associated with substance use, because young women who drink alcohol or smoke marijuana are less likely to engage in condom use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. More than half (52%) of African American young adults have engaged in illicit drug use, and in a population of students at a historically black college or university (HBCU), 38% and 34% of female students reported binge drinking and marijuana use, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Much like GBV, alcohol or other drug (AOD) use may diminish a woman’s power when engaging in sexual encounters with male partners. Consequently, it is imperative for HIV prevention interventions to address not only sexual risk behaviors but also substance use and violence, and help to promote women’s empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">The original Women’s CoOp (WC) is an HIV behavioral risk-reduction intervention that is gender-focused and based in empowerment theory and African American feminism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The WC was developed for African American women who used crack cocaine and tested during a randomized controlled trial in North Carolina. The findings indicated that the women in the intervention arm significantly reduced condomless sex at 6-month follow-up, and had reductions in homelessness and increases in employment at 3-month follow-up, compared with the control and standard-HIV intervention (4-session HIV counseling and health education intervention with HIV testing) group arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, women in all groups significantly reduced crack use and sex trading at follow-up. The WC was classified as a best evidence intervention by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and has been adapted for other populations who use AOD in North Carolina and other settings in the US and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The most recent WC adaptation, the Young Women’s CoOp (YWC), seeks to reduce sexual risk behaviors, AOD use, and violence among young African American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Among young women aged 16–19 who had dropped out of school or considered dropping out of school, the YWC demonstrated efficacy in reducing condomless sex, and participants in the YWC also had reductions in other outcomes, such as marijuana use and emotional abuse from partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Of the approximately one-third of participants who opted to test for gonorrhea or chlamydia, 28% tested positive.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Since its inception, the WC and its adaptations have been administered in-person by trained interventionists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; however, the advent of mobile health (mHealth) technologies—the delivery of medical and public health information and services through mobile devices—is an innovative approach to HIV prevention that has been used among populations such as female California youth and female African American emerging adults to address barriers to HIV prevention strategies such as condom use and HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, the literature does not widely address HIV prevention mHealth interventions geared toward sexual risk and HIV testing together with the nexus of substance use and victimization that contribute to HIV risk among young African American women. Given the significant role of AOD use and violence in influencing sexual behavior, creating an mHealth intervention that is woman-focused and addresses the intersections of AOD use, sexual risk, and violence may be essential to alleviating the disparities that persist with HIV.</p>

                <p id="Par31">This study seeks to determine the efficacy of a behavioral health intervention, the YWC delivered in two formats, relative to standard HIV counseling and testing (HCT) in reducing risk behaviors such as condomless sex and substance use. More specifically, this study has four aims, as follows: (1) Conduct formative research activities to develop a new, age-appropriate WC intervention (YWC), develop strategies to reach young African American women who use AOD, and develop the YWC interactive mHealth application; (2) test the efficacy of the YWC delivered face-to-face or via mHealth app, relative to HCT; (3) estimate the total costs of delivering the face-to-face YWC and mHealth YWC; and (4) examine participant and health clinic staff perceptions of the face-to-face YWC and mHealth YWC. Below, we discuss the study design, methods, and ethical considerations for the second aim, a randomized trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par32">This study utilizes a randomized three-group, crossover design with two intervention arms and one control arm (shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each county was first randomized to one of three conditions: face-to-face YWC (intervention), mHealth YWC (intervention), or HCT (control)—Cycle 1. Then, controlling for the previous condition, counties were randomized again to determine their study arm for Cycle 2. For Cycle 3, counties will be assigned the remaining study arm. Randomization was conducted via SAS software. We considered each county as a cluster to limit contamination between study conditions, and used a crossover design to account for county differences. This crossover design results in all counties receiving each study arm at some point. Cycle 1 (with the original randomization) occurred from January 2017 to January 2018; Cycle 2 (the first crossover) began in January 2018 and is anticipated to end in October 2018; and Cycle 3 (the second crossover) is anticipated to occur from October 2018 until July 2019.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2018_5796_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                  <p id="Par35">During the baseline (i.e., intake) assessment visit, trained project staff first obtain written consent from the potential participant. After the participant signs the consent form, detailed contact information is collected to contact participants for subsequent appointments. Next, participants complete an adapted version of a risk behavior questionnaire (Revised Risk Behavior Assessment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] via audio computer-assisted self-interview software, regarding the participant’s AOD use, sexual risk and sexual activity, experiences of victimization and violence, gender roles, communication, and current health status. Participants undergo biological testing for pregnancy and drug use and complete an alcohol breath scan. In addition, participants are referred to the health department for HIV and STI (chlamydia and gonorrhea) testing. These procedures are repeated at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits.</p>

The YWC is an age-appropriate, woman-focused intervention that seeks to reduce sexual risk behaviors, reduce AOD use, and develop female empowerment in young African American women. The intervention involves two sessions that include developing personalized action plans and providing participants with condoms and lubricant to practice skills learned during the intervention. The first session of the intervention addresses alcohol, drugs, sexual risks, and relationships, and the second session addresses HIV and condom use, GBV, and conflict resolution. This session also includes a demonstration and rehearsal of both male and female condoms. Throughout the intervention, videos of African American women sharing their stories about these topics are shown. At the end of each session, participants work on personalized action plans to create realistic and achievable risk-reduction and life goals and steps to work toward these goals.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39"><bold>Face-to-face YWC:</bold> Participants in the face-to-face arm are asked to return to the health department, or another public location with privacy that is convenient, approximately 1 week after their intake appointment for the first of the two individual intervention sessions with a trained interventionist.

The staff member shows them how to operate the tablet and navigate the app. Participants create a personal identification number (PIN) for accessing the app, and perform a test upload with the device to ensure that it can connect to Wi-Fi and transmit their encrypted data, to allow for monitoring of their progress. Wi-Fi is not required to use the app, but participants are asked to upload their data periodically, and an upload button in the main menu of the app serves as a reminder. Participants are given the same risk-reduction kit that face-to-face participants are given, which includes male and female condoms and lubricant, as the app contains video demonstrations of how to use them. Participants are also asked to practice during these demonstrations. Participants then take the tablet home to begin the intervention. The mHealth YWC was designed to mirror this in-person delivery via a self-guided mHealth application on a mobile device that allows participants to cover the material at their own pace. The mHealth YWC was developed on the Personal Health Intervention Tool (PHIT) platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which is a generalized toolkit for implementing mHealth applications. Data are stored locally on the mobile device using an encrypted database to await upload to a secure server, where they are available via a password-protected website dashboard. These data are monitored. Participants are asked to return their tablet at their 6-month follow-up appointment.</p></list-item></list></p>

                  <p id="Par44">This randomized trial aims to enroll up to 700 young women, with an expected enrollment of 600 based on the power calculation for the study design. We used the Stata command <italic>sampncti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which is based on the equation developed by Chow, Shao, and Wang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] to calculate the detectable difference in primary outcomes between participants in the control arm and participants in the face-to-face YWC arm. We hypothesize that the participants in the face-to-face YWC arm and participants in the mHealth YWC arm would not have statistically significant different primary outcomes at 6 months; therefore, we calculated the detectable difference based on the control and face-to-face YWC arms.

Project staff frequent hotspots—such as bus stops, shopping malls/centers, public housing, and local colleges and universities—and distribute recruitment flyers and cards. These traditional approaches are supplemented with innovative recruitment strategies via digital platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and local radio advertisements. In addition, recruitment occurs in each health department—this method of recruitment is referred to as in-reach. With permission, marketing of the study is conducted throughout the health department by project staff. As a supplement to these forms of recruitment, a peer consultant program, which allows for referrals from both study participants and nonparticipants, was implemented to assist in recruitment of potential study participants.</p>

              <p id="Par53">HIV among African American women remains disproportionate compared with other racial/ethnic groups of women, especially in the southern United States. It is critical to engage young African American women in the HIV care continuum. This randomized trial seeks to test the efficacy of two formats of the YWC—one is an innovative mHealth delivery and the other is face-to-face delivery—relative to standard HCT. A woman-focused intervention delivered via an mHealth app may be appropriate, especially when adapted for this 18- to 25-year-old population. If this format is found to be efficacious, an mHealth app may succeed in expanding the reach of the HIV risk-reduction intervention, making the YWC more accessible to young women who use mobile devices.</p>
