              <abstract>
                <p>Broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bnAbs) are typically highly somatically mutated, raising doubts as to whether they can be elicited by vaccination. We used 454 sequencing and designed a novel phylogenetic method to model lineage evolution of the bnAbs PGT121–134 and found a positive correlation between the level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and the development of neutralization breadth and potency. Strikingly, putative intermediates were characterized that show approximately half the mutation level of PGT121–134 but were still capable of neutralizing roughly 40–80% of PGT121–134 sensitive viruses in a 74-virus panel at median titers between 15- and 3-fold higher than PGT121–134. Such antibodies with lower levels of SHM may be more amenable to elicitation through vaccination while still providing noteworthy coverage. Binding characterization indicated a preference of inferred intermediates for native Env binding over monomeric gp120, suggesting that the PGT121–134 lineage may have been selected for binding to native Env at some point during maturation. Analysis of glycan-dependent neutralization for inferred intermediates identified additional adjacent glycans that comprise the epitope and suggests changes in glycan dependency or recognition over the course of affinity maturation for this lineage. Finally, patterns of neutralization of inferred bnAb intermediates suggest hypotheses as to how SHM may lead to potent and broad HIV neutralization and provide important clues for immunogen design.</p>

                <p>A majority of the over 30 million HIV-1 infected individuals worldwide live in poorly resourced areas where multiple boost strategies, which are likely needed to generate highly mutated antibodies, present formidable logistical challenges. Accordingly, developing new vaccination strategies that are capable of generating highly mutated antibodies should be an active area of research. Another approach, that is not mutually exclusive, is to identify new bnAbs that are both broad and potent in neutralization, but are much less mutated than the bnAbs that currently exist. Here, we have identified bnAbs that are approximately half the mutation frequency of known bnAbs, but maintain high potency and moderate breadth. These less mutated bnAbs offer an important advantage in that they would likely be easier to induce through vaccination than more mutated antibodies. By characterizing these putative intermediates, we can also better estimate how affinity maturation proceeded to result in an antibody with broad and potent neutralization activity and offer more focused strategies for designing immunogens capable of eliciting these less mutated bnAbs.</p>

              <p>A successful vaccine against HIV will likely require the elicitation of antibody responses capable of neutralizing a majority of global isolates. Recent work has suggested that 5–20% of HIV chronically-infected individuals naturally develop broadly neutralizing responses to some degree, but how these responses emerge and mature are unclear <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Kwong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003754-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A common observation among bnAbs is their unusually high level of somatic hypermutation (SHM), which on average constitutes around 20% divergence (range: 7–32%) from the putative germline nucleotide sequence (nt) for the variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub>) region (D<sub>H</sub>-genes were left out of these analyses because of ambiguity associated with D-gene assignment) <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pejchal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For example, the CD4 binding site bnAb VRC01 is 30% and 19% mutated in its variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub>) and light (V<sub>L</sub>J<sub>L</sub>) chain sequence, respectively <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The V2 quaternary epitope-specific bnAbs PG9 and PGT145 are relatively less mutated with 14–19% mutation frequency in V<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub> and 11–17% in V<sub>L</sub>J<sub>L</sub>, but both have unusually long CDRH3s of 30–33 amino acids <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Finally, the recently described PGT121, 128 and 135 antibodies, which bind to protein-glycan epitopes in the variable V3 and V4 regions and demonstrate the highest potency yet observed against a broad panel of HIV isolates, are 17–23% divergent in V<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub> and 11–28% divergent in V<sub>L</sub>J<sub>L</sub>

Of note, a number of the bnAbs also have insertions or deletions (indels) in their variable regions and recent crystal structures have identified indels as critical for protein or glycan contacts on HIV Env <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pejchal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Interestingly, gp120-reactive antibodies that show no or low neutralizing activity from chronically HIV-infected individuals demonstrate a relatively high but lesser degree of SHM than bnAbs, in the range of 9–12% in V<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub>

              <p>In contrast to HIV bnAbs, antibodies from vaccination in general have an average nt mutation frequency of 6% (range: 1–30%) in the V<sub>H</sub>, which has cast doubts on the likelihood of eliciting bnAbs through vaccination <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Wrammert1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003754-Liao2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We note that while these previous studies are caveated by insufficient sampling of antibody responses, due in large part to technological limitations, they nonetheless provide an approximation of the large discrepancy in mutation frequency between antibodies typically elicited through vaccination and HIV bnAbs. Currently, no immunogen has reliably elicited significant levels of HIV bnAbs to circulating viruses. Part of this failure might be due to inadequate immunogen design, but assuming high mutation levels play a significant role in enabling neutralizing breadth and potency, it is also possible that current immunization approaches are failing because of an inability to elicit sufficient levels of SHM. In one report, immunization with monomeric gp120 in humans was only capable of eliciting antibodies with an average mutation frequency of ∼6% <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Moody2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Similarly, Env trimer immunization in rhesus macaques produced an average V<sub>H</sub> mutation frequency of 10% <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Sundling1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A further complexity is the association of broad neutralization with indels, sometimes relatively long, in some bnAbs as described above. The frequency of indels is associated with the extent of SHM; typical immunization procedures that produce moderate levels of SHM produce a relatively low number of indels and the frequency of longer indels is particularly uncommon. The frequency of indels among bnAbs may therefore present another obstacle for their elicitation by vaccination <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Briney1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Given the large gap between the average mutation frequency of antibodies elicited by vaccination and bnAbs, it will prove helpful to identify broad and potent neutralizing antibodies with lower mutation frequencies as viable candidates for bnAb elicitation by vaccination. The levels of SHM that are necessary for broad and potent neutralization is poorly defined. Much work has been done to demonstrate that complete reversion of V<sub>H</sub>D<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub>J<sub>L</sub> sequences of HIV bnAbs to the corresponding germline sequences generally abrogates neutralizing and binding activity, which suggests that some degree of SHM plays an important role in the development of neutralizing breadth and potency <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pancera1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003754-Hoot1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. More recent studies involving reversion of all framework (FR) mutations was shown to affect binding and neutralization for bnAbs but not for non-broadly neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that high levels of SHM are necessary for neutralization breadth and potency <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similarly, a 12 amino acid reversion in the V<sub>H</sub> of VRC01 was sufficient to negatively affect neutralization breadth <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In a different study, characterization of inferred intermediates from longitudinal samples identified less-mutated CD4bs bnAb intermediates, though these putative precursors were greatly limited in neutralization breadth and potency <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Liao3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Based on longitudinal serum neutralization data, it appears that neutralization breadth generally requires up to 4 years post-infection in order to develop, further supporting the idea that antibodies are going though many rounds of maturation before gaining breadth of neutralization <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Sather1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Longitudinal analysis of a SHIV-infected macaque, however, demonstrated the rapid emergence of neutralization breadth and potency against the N332 epitope suggesting potential differences in the dependence on SHM levels <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Walker3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Previous work has attempted to map the maturation process from germline to affinity matured antibody for a group of highly broad and potent CD4 binding-site antibodies using deep sequencing analysis <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, less mutated antibody intermediates identified by traditional phylogeny in that study did not demonstrate neutralization activity. To identify less-mutated intermediates with broad and potent neutralization, we used deep sequencing to study the development of neutralization breadth in the donor from whom bnAbs PGT121–123 were isolated. These antibodies are among the most potent bnAbs described to date and provide protection in macaques at relatively low serum levels <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Moldt1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, the PGT121–123 family of antibodies are promising vaccine leads because their high potency suggests that even modest titers of antibody in the serum might be capable of contributing to protection. Ideally, the evolution of a bnAb response would be followed in longitudinal samples as infection progressed. However, since such samples were not available for this donor, we used 454 pyrosequencing to probe the memory B cell antibody repertoire and model the lineage evolution of the PGT121–123 family. We performed this analysis on PBMCs drawn at the same time point as that previously used to isolate PGT121–123 <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To analyze the resulting set of sequences, we developed a novel method called ImmuniTree, which is an alternative approach to conventional phylogenetic analyses and is designed specifically to model antibody SHM. Our results suggest that the PGT121 family of antibodies is capable of demonstrating appreciable breadth and high potency at relatively modest levels of SHM.</p>

                <p>To define unique clones, the V and J gene for each read was determined along with its percent mutation from the corresponding germline sequence. We then analyzed the clustering quality using multiple values for the cutoff range. The distribution of cophenetic distances in the hierarchical clustering linkage tree showed that a cutoff of 4–5 “edits” was optimal, because at that distance, the distribution had a qualitative change most likely associated with sequencing error. Given the average length of the International Immunogenetics (IMGT)-defined complementary determining region 3 (CDR3), 4–5 edits corresponds to a 90% identity using USEARCH's iddef 1 option <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Target PGT antibody sequences were manually selected for further analysis as follows. Each read was scored on its identity to a PGT antibody and on its mutation level from the IMGT reference germline sequence. The vast majority of reads formed several large, low-identity clusters in a divergence-mutation scatter plot; in some cases, there existed small clusters of high-identity reads separate from the large clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s002">S2</xref>). These small clusters were manually extracted and carried forward for phylogeny. This approach identified a total of 97 heavy-chain and 530 light-chain sequences as PGT121–134 variants. The greater number of light chain variants is likely due partly to more raw reads from the sequencing run and partly to library preparation, which has also been observed by other deep sequencing studies of HIV antibody repertoires <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Indeed, the primers we used to amplify the heavy chains were not as specific as the light chain primers and so there may have been less enrichment for heavy chain sequences. Sequence variants were then used to model the history of the PGT121–134 antibody lineage so as to experimentally characterize early less-mutated variants. We designed a new Bayesian phylogeny algorithm, ImmuniTree, to model the SHM of this lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s027">Text S1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Existing approaches to phylogeny were suboptimal for our experiment because of two principal issues. Firstly, existing algorithms treat 454 read errors as true somatic mutations, thereby leading to excessive branching in the phylogeny and difficulties in interpretation. ImmuniTree addresses this obstacle by taking advantage of the distinctly different nucleotide transition characteristics between clonal SHM and 454 sequencing errors. Secondly, traditional phylogeny algorithms do not explicitly model whether or not to generate an internal node. Instead, these algorithms either always infer an internal unobserved intermediate (e.g. neighbor joining), or never do so (e.g. minimal spanning trees). This poor representation inaccurately models reality, where noisy yet highly clonal data are observed from only a subset of leaves and internal clones.</p>
                <p>Though emerging methods address only one or neither of these issues <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Barak1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, ImmuniTree addresses both explicitly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s027">Text S1</xref>). For each antibody clone, the algorithm models SHM as a birth-death model, where reads are generated from clonal populations using a known sequencing error model. The algorithm jointly models sequencing error alongside somatic mutation and collapses reads that differ due to sequencing error. The approach reduces inference variance and facilitates human interpretation when choosing sequences for the subsequent evaluation of binding and neutralization.</p>
                <p>The ImmuniTree algorithm relies on a probabilistic model that describes both the expansion process of a clone and the sequencing process. It iteratively explores this probabilistic space using the Markov chain Monte Carlo framework <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Hastings1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, producing a new hypothetical tree in each iteration, aimed at describing how the data were generated. In the hypothesized tree, each node is associated with one sequence, and the reads are associated with the nodes of the tree. The disagreements between the sequence of a node and its parent represent new hypermutations. The disagreements between a read and the sequence of its node represent sequencing errors. The mechanics of the algorithm guide the search to high-likelihood areas of the probabilistic space. During each iteration the tree is constantly manipulated, intermediate nodes are stochastically added and deleted, and if such nodes contribute to a tree that better explains the data, they are likely to stay. Then, the DNA sequences of all the nodes in the hypothesized tree, including intermediates, are jointly updated by an exact inference algorithm <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pearl1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. At the end of the search, the algorithm returns the tree with the highest likelihood.</p>
                <p>Given the tree topology, and the association of reads to nodes in the tree (the “evidence”), we use belief propagation algorithm to infer the sequences of all the nodes, including intermediate nodes. The belief-propagation algorithm is a message-passing algorithms, a generalization of the backward-forward algorithm for hidden Markov models (HMMs), which computes the set of sequences that yield the highest likelihood according to the mutation model.</p>
                <p>Each node in the tree receives “messages” from its children stating their best estimate for its sequence. Each child's estimate is based on the evidence in its subtree, taking into account the mutation model. Those messages are integrated with the evidence at the node itself into a new message that is sent to its own parent, estimating the parent's sequence. Once the root of the tree received all the messages from its children, it sends to each of its children its best estimate, now fully informed, for their sequence. This process is repeated until all the nodes in the tree are instantiated with their optimal sequences, given to them by their parent.</p>
                <p>When applied to the PGT121–134 variants, ImmuniTree generated trees for heavy and light chain sequences with a total of 37 nodes (named 1H through 37H) and 120 nodes (named 1L through 120L), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Within these two trees, 13 internal nodes in the heavy chain tree and 28 internal nodes of the light chain tree were inferred statistically, and did not have direct sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>). As expected, trees built without correcting for sequencing error resulted in a larger number of nodes and branches, which confounds lineage analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Overall, compared to the inferred internal nodes, the observed nodes in both heavy and light chain trees were relatively highly mutated with an average divergence from germline of 18% for V<sub>H</sub> and 24% for V<sub>L</sub>. The observation that only highly mutated sequences were found suggests that early precursors might be absent in the B cell memory compartment or are present at very low levels, possibly because the donor blood samples were obtained several years into the infection. Indeed, this observation is consistent with other antibody lineage studies for which inferred intermediates were calculated because less-mutated sequences were absent or were present at very low frequencies in the sequencing dataset in both late time point samples and even in early blood draws from longitudinal studies <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Liao3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We were particularly interested in whether these less-mutated inferred precursors could also exhibit broad neutralization.</p>

                <p>To see if observed and inferred sequences were capable of generating functional antibodies, we paired heavy and light chain sequences from nodes of varying mutation levels and measured neutralization activity on a cross-clade 6-virus panel to evaluate neutralization breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Simek1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

We selected the intermediates based only on mutation frequency. For example, we chose the least mutated nodes 3H for heavy chain and 3L for light chain to determine if neutralization activity was achievable at these levels of SHM. Additionally, we chose nodes that followed consecutively in SHM levels (e.g. 9H to 10H to 13H for heavy chain and 84L to 87L to 109L for light chain) to determine if the level of SHM correlates with neutralization breadth and/or potency. Surprisingly, pairing of the least mutated nodes (3H+3L) resulted in a variant that demonstrated notable neutralization activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Also, antibody clones comprising heavy and/or light chain sequences that are more divergent from germline consistently demonstrated greater neutralization potency and/or wider breadth on the 6-virus panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

                <p>To investigate further, we chose to characterize putative intermediates for the affinity matured PGT121 and PGT124 antibodies, which lie on different branches of the evolutionary tree and have slightly different neutralization profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s006">S6</xref>). As an inferred precursor to both antibodies, we chose the least mutated nodes 3H from the heavy chain tree and 3L from the light chain tree. To investigate intermediate levels of SHM, we chose 9H as a heavy chain precursor of PGT121–123 and 32H as a precursor of PGT124. Finally, we also tested pairing with node 87L from the light chain tree as it demonstrated very high neutralization breadth and potency when paired with various heavy chains.</p>

With a few additional nucleotide mutations in the heavy chain (11% in V<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub>, overall nt mutation frequency of 10%), the 32H+3L pair neutralized 80% of viruses that are sensitive to PGT124 with only 1.5-fold higher median IC<sub>50</sub> than PGT124.

                <p>To better evaluate the neutralization activity of the antibodies of intermediate divergence, 3H+3L and 32H+3L were tested on a 103 cross-clade virus panel in comparison with b12 and PGT121 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s009">Figure S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s010">S10</xref>). b12 was one of the first CD4bs bNAbs isolated and demonstrates moderate neutralization breadth compared to more recently isolated bNAbs <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The results show that the least mutated pair 3H+3L is 6% less mutated than b12, but demonstrated equivalent breadth (26%) and its median IC<sub>50</sub> was still 3-fold more potent than b12 and 15-fold less potent than PGT121. The pair 32H+3L, meanwhile, was capable of neutralizing 48% of viruses on this panel and its median IC<sub>50</sub> is 15-fold more potent than b12 and only 3-fold less potent than PGT121. PGT121 was capable of neutralizing 58% of viruses on this panel. Thus, while SHM does enhance neutralization breadth and potency for this family of antibodies, we are still able to observe relatively high levels of neutralization activity with substantially lower levels of SHM than the fully matured clones.</p>

                <title>Residues arising through SHM are important for neutralization at different stages of antibody maturation</title>
                <p>In order to determine if residues in the variable region are a result of SHM or are due to polymorphisms in the donor, genomic DNA from the PGT121–123 donor was extracted and V and J genes from both heavy and the light chains were amplified and Sanger sequenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Based on the results, there are no unique polymorphisms in the donor that distinguish the germline sequence from those reference sequences found in the IMGT database. Additionally, the sequence results indicate that the deletion in FR1 and the insertion in FR3 of the light chain, which are present in the PGT121–134 mAbs, were features that developed following VDJ or VJ recombination.</p>
                <p>We next determined how individual mutations at different stages of antibody maturation enabled greater neutralization breadth or potency to gain insight into the most critical steps of SHM for this family of antibodies. For the antibody 3H+3L, single amino acids were individually reverted to the corresponding germline residue and residues comprising a framework light chain 3 (FRL3) insertion and CDR3 regions were individually substituted by alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g006">Figure 6A–G</xref>). The parent 3H+3L mAb and mAb variants were then tested for neutralization on a 6-virus panel and the fold changes in IC<sub>50</sub> are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s012">Figure S12</xref>. For the heavy chain of antibody 3H+3L, most of the neutralization activity for the majority of isolates is apparently mediated through the CDRH3; simultaneous reversion of all the heavy chain residues of 3H to germline, except for the CDRH3, resulted in loss of neutralization or reduced potency for only 20% of isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s013">Figure S13</xref>). For the light chain of antibody 3H+3L, residues critical for neutralization activity were found in both framework and CDR regions, although these residues become less critical when paired with more mature heavy chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s014">Figure S14</xref>). Crystallographic studies of a putative PGT121 germline Fab, which is similar (0.4 Å core RMSD) to a previously reported crystal structure of another PGT121 putative germline antibody, suggested that the mutations from germline not only involved likely antigen contact residues, but also involved structural rearrangements in the heavy and, most notably, light chains as a result of somatic mutation in CDR and framework regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g006">Figure 6C–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s014">Figure S14</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s026">Table S1</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Mouquet1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>

                <p>Having identified the residues mutated from germline that are most crucial to neutralization by antibody 3H+3L, we were interested in determining those that were most important to the increased breadth of antibodies 32H+3L and 3H+87L as compared to 3H+3L. Accordingly, the more mutated intermediate heavy chain 32H was reverted to the less mutated 3H heavy chain, paired with light chain 3L, and tested for neutralization breadth. A similar approach was taken for reversion of light chain 87L to 3L, paired with heavy chain 3H. Surprisingly, single amino acid changes did not show demonstrable effects on neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> for the 32H reversion or for the 87L reversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Strikingly, only variants for which at least two amino acids were reverted did we see a large increase in IC<sub>50</sub> between parent and variant mAb in an isolate-specific manner. Such a pattern may present extra challenges to the guided evolution of an antibody response through vaccination.</p>
                <p>To gain further insight into the effects of the insertion and deletions on neutralization activity, we tested neutralization breadth and potency of the PGT122–133 antibodies without the FRL3 insertion and restoring the framework light chain 1 (FRL1) deletion on a cross-clade 6 -virus panel. Upon removal of the FRL3 insertion, we observed a partial loss of neutralization in an isolate-specific manner that varied somewhat among the somatic variants of the lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g007">Figure 7A–D</xref>). The isolate 92BR020, for example, became resistant to neutralization by PGT123 lacking the FRL3 insertion, but was still sensitive to the corresponding PGT122, PGT124, and PGT133 variants. Meanwhile, the isolate IAVI C22 became resistant to PGT122 lacking the FRL3 insertion, but remained sensitive to PGT123, PGT124, and PGT133 variants. Notably, the isolate 92RW020 remained sensitive to all the antibodies in the absence of the FRL3 insertion. These results suggest that the FRL3 insertion is beneficial but not absolutely crucial for neutralization breadth and that the antibody maturation process may have proceeded some way before the insertion occurred. These results also argue that, if an immunogen is capable of eliciting this lineage of antibodies without the FRL3 insertion, neutralization breadth may be achieved through the complementary neutralization profiles of somatic variants. Finally, we were unable to find large effects on neutralization breadth or potency upon restoration of the 7-amino acid N-terminus deletion in FRL1 suggesting that this feature is not crucial for bnAb activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>

                <p>Many research groups have generated germline derivatives or close equivalents (unmutated germline ancestors) of known bnAbs, but these constructs do not bind most recombinant gp120s or neutralize most virus strains <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pancera1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Hoot1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Alam1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Indeed, the putative germline of PGT121 was unable to bind gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g008">Figure 8A–B</xref>). However, the intermediate 3H+3L antibody did bind weakly to monomeric gp120 from multiple isolates. Most notably, the 3H+3L antibody bound to monomeric gp120 with notably lower apparent affinity than to trimeric cell surface Env in contrast to mature PGT121, which bound with similar apparent affinities to monomeric gp120 and trimeric Env (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g009">Figure 9A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s016">Figure S16</xref>). We confirmed by competition assays that, despite these binding differences, antibodies 3H+3L and PGT121 do share overlapping epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). To determine if the preference of antibody 3H+3L for trimeric Env was due to avidity effects, we generated Fab fragments and tested neutralization activity and binding by flow cytometry. The results demonstrate that 3H+3L loses neutralization potency as an Fab compared to IgG, despite little difference in apparent affinity for cell surface trimer between Fab and IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g010">Figure 10B–C</xref>). Conversely, PGT121 maintains neutralization potency as a Fab. These results suggest that the early intermediate antibodies may be crosslinking between Env on virions in order to achieve neutralization <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pejchal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, but the lineage becomes less dependent on crosslinking following affinity maturation. Overall, these results indicate that the PGT121–134 antibody lineage may have been selected for native Env binding at some point during maturation, possibly on whole virions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The conclusions described here can help guide immunogen design to elicit PGT121-like antibodies. Specifically, the presentation of native Env instead of monomeric gp120 in germinal centers appears to be important for the maturation of this family of antibodies. This preference for native Env over monomeric gp120 may be due to avidity effects or to the presentation of epitope residues on native Env that are not fully recapitulated on monomeric gp120. Additionally, we observed an evolution in the dependency of glycan binding between putative intermediates and fully mature antibody. As conventional protein-glycan interactions are usually in the micromolar range, the avidity offered by binding to multiple glycans may be an important factor in triggering glycan-dependent bnAb lineages. By comparing the differences in glycan contact residues between putative precursor and affinity-matured antibody, it may be possible to rationally target residues for maturation in order to achieve greater neutralization breadth.</p>
              <p>Compared to less-mutated bnAbs that target the CD4 binding site <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Liao3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> the less-mutated intermediates presented here are notably broader and more potent suggesting potentially important differences between the CD4 binding site and the N332 region as vaccine targets that may give some advantage to the latter region. One possible explanation is that antibodies targeting the CD4bs may require more SHM in order to fold into specific conformations that enable binding into the CD4bs pocket. The epitope that PGT121 binds to, on the other hand, may be more exposed and may accommodate different antibody binding angles <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pejchal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Pancera2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Julien1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, the PGT121 lineage may not necessarily require extensive levels of SHM in order to bind its epitope. It would likely be informative to perform similar analyses for other known bnAbs in order to better define the minimal amount of mutations necessary to achieve neutralization breadth and potency for different bnAbs.</p>
              <p>Despite the lower levels of SHM associated with PGT121-like, more VRC01-like antibodies than PGT121-like bnAbs have been isolated from various donors. This apparent discrepancy may be due to the fact that many B cell selection studies have used a bait (RSC3) engineered for isolating VRC01-like antibodies . Additionally, there are many donors in various cohorts who show N332 serum reactivity whose antibodies have not yet been isolated and thus new PGT121-like antibodies may be forthcoming. Finally, antibodies targeting the N332 epitope appear to derive from several V<sub>H</sub>D<sub>H</sub>J<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub>J<sub>L</sub> combinations, while VRC01-class antibodies utilize only a single V<sub>H</sub> germline gene, the V<sub>H</sub>1-2 gene. Thus, given the greater diversity of antibody responses targeting the N332 epitope, the probability of identifying an exact or highly similar PGT121 response from other infected donors may be low.</p>
              <p>Importantly, as shown here, deep sequencing and phylogeny with ImmuniTree has the potential to identify intermediate antibodies that may not be as broadly neutralizing as some individual affinity-matured Abs, but have considerably lower levels of SHM. In this regard, considerable neutralization breadth may be achieved by eliciting less-mutated antibodies with complementary neutralization profiles, probably targeting a range of epitopes. Such an approach may circumvent the need for long-term prime/boost strategies, which are likely required to elicit high levels of SHM and suggests that, given the right immunogens, more conventional vaccination strategies than have been contemplated may be sufficient for an HIV vaccine.</p>
              <p>Strikingly, it appears that higher levels of SHM concurrently enhance neutralization breadth and increase potency against the majority of isolates recognized by putative precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s007">Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s008">S8</xref>). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that SHM results in some antibodies becoming both very broad and potent by “homing in” on a conserved site of vulnerability (“sweet spot”) from a response that initially recognizes a somewhat different footprint on the virus Env. One hypothesis suggests that Env escape variants drive maturation to avoid variable residues and/or glycans adjacent to the most conserved residues by directing contacts to converge on the smallest and most conserved binding site on Env (compare ref. <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Ekiert1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>). An alternative hypothesis suggests that the antibody matures to avoid variable residues and/or glycans without substantially changing the size of its footprint but by refining its angle of approach (compare ref. <xref rid="ppat.1003754-Dreyfus1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>). By either of these mechanisms, antibody selection can occur on the basis of affinity for diverse isolates with a concomitant increase in neutralization breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003754-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s017">Figure S17</xref>). Indeed, calculations of an antigen-antibody interaction model are consistent with the idea that bnAbs are characterized as antibodies that form a small number of stronger interactions with conserved residues compared to antibodies that are able to make many contacts with many variable residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003754.s018">Figure S18</xref>). Further dynamic modeling of antibody SHM in response to Env escape in concert with targeted immunization studies will help to design vaccines and vaccine strategies that hone antibody responses onto the the PGT121 epitope.</p>

The scores were kept low, as we were interested in sequences that were very highly mutated. The V region is aligned first, then removed, followed by J, then removed, followed by D. The IMGT-defined CDR3 sequence of each read was then extracted. The CDR3 sequences were sorted by abundance and clustered with USEARCH5.1 with the options “–minlen 0 –global –usersort –iddef 1 –id 0.9”. Finally, each CDR3 sequence was aligned to the “target” antibody sequences of PGT121–123 to determine a “divergence” value from these antibodies.</p>

                <p>The divergence-mutation plots are used as a tool to identify reads that are similar to the known PGT121–123 antibodies. High-identity clusters of sequences and clusters that are above background are manually identified and used as input for a phylogeny inference with Immunitree. Immunitree implements a Bayesian model of somatic hypermutation of clones, including probabilistic models of SHM and sequencing error and performs Markov chain Monte Carlo over the tree structure, birth/death times of the subclones, birth/death, mutation, and sequencing error rates, subclone consensus sequences, and assignment of reads to nodes. The tree structure is also used for multiple computations and to overlay different information. We estimate the selection pressure that a given node has experienced using the BASELINe algorithm. It performs a Bayesian estimation of selection pressure by comparing the observed number of replacement/silent mutations in the CDRs/FWRs of the node consensus sequence.</p>

Breadth can either develop by converging onto or by reorienting onto a highly conserved region on HIV Env as illustrated. This convergence or reorientation is directed by virus escape mutations, which select for antibodies that interact with conserved regions (glycans, conserved side chains and main chain atoms) and less dependency on variable residues (variable side chains). By this process, affinity selection can lead to greater neutralization breadth and potency.</p>
