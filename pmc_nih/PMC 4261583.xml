                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Impaired T cell function in sepsis is associated with poor outcome, but the mechanisms are unclear. In cancer, arginase-expressing myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) deplete arginine, impair T cell receptor CD3 zeta-chain expression and T cell function and are linked to poor clinical outcome, but their role during acute human infectious disease and in particular sepsis remains unknown. Hypoarginemia is prevalent in sepsis. This study aimed to determine whether neutrophils that co-purify with PBMC express arginase, and if arginine depletion constrains T cell CD3 zeta-chain expression and function in human sepsis.</p>

                  <p>Using flow cytometry, cell culture, HPLC, arginase activity and mRNA detection, our study examined whether neutrophils, with reduced buoyant density isolated in the Ficoll interface, metabolise L-arginine and suppress T cell proliferation in sepsis. A total of 35 sepsis patients (23 with septic shock) and 12 hospital controls in a tertiary referral hospital in tropical Australia were evaluated.</p>

                  <p>Only sepsis patients had interphase neutrophils, neutrophils co-purifying with mononuclear cells (≤1.077 specific gravity). The percentage of interphase neutrophils in sepsis was proportional to sepsis severity and correlated with plasma IL-6 concentrations. <italic>Ex vivo,</italic> sepsis-derived interphase neutrophils expressed arginase, metabolised culture L-arginine and suppressed T cell proliferation and CD3 zeta-chain expression. <italic>In vivo</italic>, in septic shock there was a longitudinal inverse association between interphase neutrophil number and CD3 zeta-chain expression. Depletion or inhibition of interphase neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> restored zeta-chain expression and T cell function.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>For the first time during an acute human infection, interphase neutrophils that express arginase were found to circulate in sepsis, in proportion to disease severity. These neutrophil-MDSCs impair T cell CD3 zeta-chain expression and T cell function via L-arginine metabolism, and likely contribute to the T cell dysfunction seen in sepsis. Modulation of neutrophil-MDSC or their downstream effects warrant consideration as targets for novel adjunctive therapies in sepsis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite improvements in its management, septic shock has a mortality rate of 30 to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is a leading cause of death in ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although sepsis patients have high levels of inflammatory mediators, some components of their immune system are strongly suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and sepsis has been described as an immunosuppressive disorder or a state of immunoparalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clinical trials demonstrate that anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies may be harmful in sepsis and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> evidence of T cell dysfunction in sepsis is demonstrated by impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus re-activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This is supported <italic>ex vivo</italic> by impaired T cell proliferation, cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and lymphocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Loss of T cell function is associated with sepsis mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], other poor outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and decreased resistance to secondary infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The mechanisms of T cell suppression in sepsis remain incompletely understood.</p>
              <p>Sepsis patients have decreased plasma concentrations of L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], a conditionally essential amino acid critical for immune function and for surface expression of a fully functional T cell receptor (TCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The TCR trans-membrane molecule consists of an antigen-specific αβ heterodimer receptor coupled to invariant γδϵ and ζ homodimer chains that mediate signal transduction - enabling T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. <italic>In vitro</italic> L-arginine depletion impairs T cell zeta-chain expression and cell proliferation, which both recover when L-arginine is restored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Arginase or arginase-producing cells also impair T cell zeta-chain expression through local depletion of L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our previous characterisation of reduced L-arginine levels in sepsis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] led to the hypothesis that T cell zeta-chain downregulation contributes to T cell dysfunction in sepsis.</p>
              <p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogenous group of cells which can downregulate T cell receptor zeta-chain expression. MDSC suppress T cell activation and proliferation and have been described in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], healthy volunteers systemically challenged with endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], mouse models of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and other murine infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In human peripheral blood two major subpopulations of MDSC are described; granulocytic and monocytic. Monocytic MDSC express CD14 and exert suppression via arginase, iNOS and suppressive cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Granulocytic or neutrophil-MDSC express CD15 and may suppress via the production of arginase or reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Activated neutrophil MDSC have been shown to co-purify with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after density gradient separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As immature neutrophils have been reported in PBMC from three patients with sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we hypothesised that neutrophils co-purifying with PBMC in sepsis are activated MDSC which suppress T cells via arginase.</p>
              <p>Here we report that sepsis patients have impaired T cell zeta-chain expression and patients with shock have significantly more neutrophils co-purifying with PBMC compared to sepsis patients without shock. These low density neutrophils suppress T cell proliferation and <italic>in vitro</italic> depletion restores T cell zeta-chain expression and T cell proliferative capacity. Consequently, these cells can be considered neutrophil-MDSC. These data provide a mechanism for T cell dysfunction in adults with severe sepsis and suggest the potential for adjunctive therapies to restore T cell function and improve outcome.</p>

                <p>Sepsis patients had suspected or confirmed infection, the presence of two or more criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) within the last 4 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and were classified as having septic shock, or sepsis without shock. Septic shock was defined at the time of enrolment as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or a reduction ≥40 mmHg from baseline despite adequate fluid resuscitation, or the need for vasopressors to maintain these targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sepsis severity was estimated using the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score from the first 24 hours of admission and daily modified sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Patients were enroled within 24 hours of ICU admission or within 36 hours of ward admission. Control subjects were recruited from hospital patients who had not met SIRS criteria within the last 30 days and who had no clinical or laboratory evidence of inflammation or infection. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or next of kin. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Menzies School of Health Research and the Department of Health and Community Services.</p>

                <p>Venous blood was collected in lithium heparin tubes at enrolment (day 0), days 2 to 4, and day 7 until discharge from the hospital or death. Whole-blood differential white cell counts were measured by Coulter Counter. Plasma was separated within 30 minutes of collection and stored at −80°C. To exclude <italic>ex vivo</italic> neutrophil density changes, cells were separated within 2 hours of collection using Ficoll-Hypaque™ Plus (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient. Interphase cells (those at the 1.088 specific gravity interphase), including neutrophils and/or PBMC, were either stained fresh or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen in 90% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (GIBCO, Invitrogen, USA) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, USA). Neutrophils collected from the interface of Ficoll, that is, co-located with PBMC in the interphase layer were termed interphase neutrophils. In a subset of samples, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were collected from beneath the Ficoll-Hypaque™ Plus layer (bottom fraction).</p>

                <p>All longitudinal samples cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen were thawed simultaneously and tested in a single experiment. The proportion of interphase neutrophils in total interphase cells was calculated in 23 out of 24 sepsis patients and all control patients. For cryopreserved samples, media with 50 units/mL benzonase nuclease (Novagen, Denmark) was used in thawing to reduce cell clumping, and the interphase cells were immediately stained and analysed. Freshly-isolated cells were examined to confirm quantification of neutrophils in fresh versus thawed samples and to validate phenotypic and functional analyses.</p>
                <p>Antibodies to CD3, CD16, CD56, CD11b, CD15, CD33, CD49d, CD54 and CD62L were sourced from Biolegend (CA, USA); CD4, CD8, CD66b and CD14 from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen, CA, USA); and CD155 from eBioscience (CA, USA). CD247 (Beckman Coulter, Immunotech, USA) was used to measure CD3 zeta-chain expression in cells surface stained, fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and permeabilised with 100 μg/mL digitonin (Cayman chemical company, Michigan, USA) while kept on ice for 10 minutes. To control for inter-experimental variation in CD3 zeta-chain mean fluorescence, cells from a single donation, from a healthy donor, were cryopreserved in aliquots and one aliquot was thawed with every experiment to establish a normalization factor. All cryopreserved cells and a proportion of freshly isolated cells were read on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, MA, USA) and analysed using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Oregon, USA). Freshly-isolated cells and some cryopreserved cells were analysed later using a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman coulter) and Kaluza 1.2 for data analysis.</p>

                <title>Isolation of interphase neutrophils and T cell proliferation assays</title>
                <p>Interphase neutrophils were enriched from total interphase cells by labeling with CD66b FITC (BD Biosceinces) followed by anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) magnetic bead selection (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Proliferation assays were arranged in 96- or 48-well plates using a minimum of 200,000 cells/well of either total interphase (including interphase neutrophils) or after depletion of CD66b + interphase neutrophils. For some experiments isolated interphase neutrophils or PMN were added back to cultures after CD66b-depletion. Proliferation was determined by labeling cells with 100 μM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) and stimulating with immobilized anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL OKT-3; Biolegend) and soluble anti-CD28 (0.1 μg/mL CD28.2, Biolegend) antibodies. Proliferation was measured 3 to 4 days later by flow cytometry following surface staining of T cells. Cell division was confirmed by stimulating cells and on day 4 staining with Ki67 (BD Biosciences). Culture experiments used custom-formulated Advanced RPMI 1640 (Formula number 07-5074EA, GIBCO, Invitrogen) with L-arginine at 150 μM. The selective, competitive and high-affinity inhibitor of arginase N-Hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, diacetate salt (nor-NOHA) (Calbiochem, CA, USA) was used at a final concentration of 50 μM in culture as indicated. The peroxynitirite scavenger uric acid (Sigma, USA), was added to culture at a final concentration of 500 μM.</p>

                <title>Neutrophils co-purify with PBMC in septic shock patients</title>
                <p>Interphase cells from septic shock patients collected after density gradient separation contained atypical neutrophils with reduced buoyant density (≤1.077 specific gravity), referred to as interphase neutrophils. Flow cytometry revealed a similar forward and side scatter profile (representing size and granularity) for both the interphase neutrophils and the polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) recovered from below the Ficoll-Hypaque layer (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Cryopreserved interphase cells from 12 septic shock patients, 12 non-shock sepsis patients, and 12 hospital controls (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were assessed for the presence of interphase neutrophils. Only sepsis patients had detectable interphase neutrophils (≥10% of all viable cells). Septic shock patients had significantly more interphase neutrophils compared to sepsis patients without shock, both on the day of enrolment (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02 Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) and on day 2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05 Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). The interphase neutrophils in septic shock patients were a mix of bands (immature) and segmented (mature) cells by microscopy and were found at multiple, but not all, longitudinal time points (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Detailed phenotypic characterisation of interphase neutrophils in fresh and frozen samples revealed high expression of the granulocyte markers CD66b (a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linked protein), CD15 (a carbohydrate structure), and CD11b (an integrin expressed by monocytes and granulocytes that is upregulated on neutrophils after activation) (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Interphase neutrophils also expressed CD45RO (leukocyte common antigen), CD49d (integrin) and intermediate levels of CD16 (the Fcγ III receptor) (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). The interphase neutrophils were negative or low for CD33 (a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on monocytes and myeloid progenitors), CD62L (L-selectin) or CD54 (ICAM-1), the major histocompatability complex class II antigen HLA DR and the monocyte markers CD14 and CD115 (colony stimulating factor -1 receptor) (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). In only the fresh (non-cryopreserved) samples, the more buoyant interphase neutrophils were compared to PMN and found to express significantly more CD15, while CD16 (total or the high population) was similarly expressed between both (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). The lack of CD33 expression distinguishes these cells from most human neutrophil-MDSC previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and intermediate to high CD16 expression and the lack of CD62L or CD54 distinguishes these cells from those previously described to be induced by endotoxin challenge by Pillay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In total, the phenotype of the interphase neutrophil fits that of a mature neutrophil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and in shock patients the percentage of interphase neutrophils correlated with the mature PMN count derived from an automated cell counter.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic characterisation of interphase neutrophils in sepsis patients.

                <p>Cryopreserved cells collected longitudinally from patients with septic shock, non-shock sepsis, and hospital controls were tested to measure associations between sepsis disease severity, T cell zeta-chain expression, and the percentage of interphase neutrophils. To allow the direct comparison of longitudinal sepsis and control samples, cells were cryopreserved and all samples from each patient run on the same day with a zeta control that was run at every experiment. Only cryopreserved cells were evaluated for T cell zeta-chain allowing the direct comparison of longitudinal sepsis and control samples within experiments.</p>
                <p>On admission, septic shock and non-shock patients had significantly reduced T cell zeta-chain expression (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). However, by day 2, non-shock patients had recovered T cell zeta-chain expression, while septic shock patients with interphase neutrophils had not (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In six septic shock patients with a day-7 sample there was no significant recovery in T cell zeta-chain expression, suggesting continued immunosuppression for at least one week.

The <italic>ex vivo</italic> longitudinal inverse association was statistically significant in a mixed effects model (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02), suggesting that interphase neutrophils mediate T cell suppression via downregulation of the CD3 zeta-chain.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Inverse association between T cell zeta-chain expression and interphase neutrophil number.

                <p><italic>In vitro</italic> culture experiments examined the direct effect of interphase neutrophils on T cell CD3 zeta-chain expression.

In a different individual, isolated CD66b cells (which contained 94% CD66b + interphase neutrophils with 1.4% lymphocytes and 1.9% monocytes) were then returned to CD66-depleted interphase cells at increasing concentrations and cultured. Culture experiments demonstrated an inverse association between CD3 zeta-chain expression and the CD66b + interphase neutrophils (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Culture data confirmed the inverse associations observed in <italic>ex vivo</italic> cross-sectional (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C) and longitudinal (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D) samples, and established that only the CD66b + interphase cells were responsible. In culture supernatant, L-arginine consumption increased with increasing numbers of interphase neutrophils (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Functional characterisation of interphase neutrophils in sepsis.

                <p>T cell proliferation experiments sought to determine whether interphase neutrophils compromised T cell division. CD66b + interphase neutrophils were depleted from interphase cells using magnetic beads, and T cell proliferation was tested following CD3 and CD28 stimulation, either in the presence or absence of the CD66b + interphase neutrophils. Presence of CD66b + interphase neutrophils suppressed T cell proliferation (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3), with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell division compromised (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). The interphase neutrophils were able to suppress the highly stimulatory T cell responses elicited by plate-bound anti-CD3 plus soluble anti-CD28. Suppression of proliferation was mediated by only the interphase neutrophils that co-purify with the PBMC and not the PMN (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). While the number of interphase neutrohpils appeared to determine the inhibition of T cell division, heterogeneity was observed in the timing (day) of suppression within individuals.</p>

                <title>Interphase neutrophil L-arginine metabolism mediates T cell suppression</title>
                <p>We hypothesised that interphase neutrophils suppress T cell function and CD3 zeta-chain expression via L-arginine depletion. In proliferation assays, addition of the arginase inhibitor nor-NOHA restored T cell division (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Evidence for the specificity of the inhibition of interphase neutrophil arginase included the lack of inhibition by nor-NOHA of T cell proliferation in cells from control patients (none of which had interphase neutrophils), and the inability of the peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid to inhibit T cell proliferation in cells from sepsis patients. In addition, in longitudinal sepsis samples, nor-NOHA increased T cell proliferation only when interphase neutrophil function was demonstrated (that is, only on day 2, when depletion of the neutrophil-MDSC restored proliferation, Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A day 2). No increased proliferation was observed on day 0 and 7 following depletion of interphase neutrophils, suggesting the interphase neutrophils were inactive.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Arginase expression by interphase neutrophils.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study is the first description of interphase neutrophils metabolising arginine and constraining T cell function during an acute human infectious disease. Septic shock patients have increased numbers of circulating interphase neutrophils that downregulate expression of T cell zeta-chain and suppress T cell function. Arginase-mediated metabolism of L-arginine by these cells suppresses T cell proliferation; hence, these low-density neutrophils are MDSC. Sepsis patients with higher numbers of circulating interphase neutrophil MDSC had more severe disease, higher concentrations of plasma IL-6 and slower recovery of T cell zeta-chain expression. The slower recovery of T cell zeta-chain expression in septic shock patients is consistent with reports that patients with more severe sepsis have longer durations of T cell dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Slower recovery of T cell function appears at least partially attributable to interphase neutrophil-MDSC, suggesting these cells contribute to T cell dysfunction linked to greater risk of secondary bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and mortality in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>MDSC are evident in cancer and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], chronic hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and cystic fibrosis patients with chronic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but there are no reports of them in any acute human infectious disease, except in a few cases of convalescent influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. MDSC have been described in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis where MDSC appear to improve survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In contrast, our results from humans with sepsis suggest that excessive numbers of circulating interphase neutrophil MDSC may be harmful. Perhaps MDSC that are activated to resolve inflammation blunt cellular responses, enhancing susceptibility to secondary infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This is consistent with studies that show that impaired T cell function in septic shock is associated with poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our sepsis data also concur with data from cancer patients where increased circulating MDSC are associated with more aggressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study is the first characterisation of diminished T cell zeta-chain expression in human sepsis patients. Downregulation of T cell zeta-chain is a frequent mechanism of immune suppression occurring in patients with chronic hepatitis B, HIV, leprosy, lupus and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] (see also review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]).</p>
              <p>Although some human MDSC have staining profiles consistent with immature granulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the neutrophil-MDSC co-purifying with PBMC from sepsis patients appear to be mature granulocytes. In particular, high CD66b, high CD45RO and low CD33 expression are all consistent with mature granulocyte staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and concur with the mature neutrophil phenotype described in renal cell carcinoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and in patients with other advanced cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The reduced buoyancy of the interphase neutrophils in sepsis patients may represent hyperactivated, degranulated mature granulocytes. Hypodense granulocytes have been described in patients with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1ß, IL-6 and VEGF can induce MDSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and it was notable that interphase neutrophils correlated with plasma IL-6 concentrations, but not plasma VEGF concentrations in sepsis. Perhaps the inflammatory environment of sepsis may contribute to the accumulation of neutrophil-MDSC. Indeed Schmeilau <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that PMN from a healthy donor activated with <italic>N</italic>-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine co-purify with PBMC and suppress T cells in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, neutrophils induced by acute inflammation, following LPS administration to volunteers, fulfil the role of MDSC and suppress T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>The role of neutrophils in sepsis has long been controversial with variations in their circulating number (high, low, or with &gt;10% of immature cells) and conflicting reports concerning their functional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The inability to distinguish PMN and interphase neutrophil-MDSC in automated cell counts may have clouded the interpretation of sepsis neutrophil data. While PMN are beneficial through appropriate responsiveness to chemotactic factors released by infection and bacterial phagocytosis, our data suggest that excessive induction of neutrophil-MDSC will suppress T cell responses by downregulating the zeta-chain compromising cellular responsiveness. Interphase neutrophil-MDSC may represent a mechanism to sequentially downregulate T cell zeta-chain and extinguish effector responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] during the transition to memory cells. We speculate that neutrophil-MDSC have a role in modulating T cell responses in sepsis, but excessive numbers and prolonged detection appear to contribute to greater disease severity.</p>
              <p>Our initial use of cryopreserved samples precluded direct comparisons between the atypical interphase neutrophils and the PMN. To compare suppressive capacity of the neutrophil-MDSC and matched PMN, additional patients were recruited and comparative assays on fresh samples were done. Suppressive capacity was only detected in the atypical interphase neutrophils. The role of PMN, the triggering of neutrophil-MDSC and the functional differences between the populations deserves further evaluation. Indeed further studies are warranted to determine if interphase neutrophil-MDSC frequency, duration or apoptosis/necrosis are predictors of patient mortality.</p>
              <p>Although we did not investigate associations between MDSC number and arginase mRNA, our results suggest that arginase is one mode of action of interphase neutrophil-MDSC suppression in sepsis. Interphase neutrophil-MDSC express arginase and consume L-arginine, and the addition of an arginase inhibitor restores T cell proliferation. Our inability to detect arginase in culture supernant suggests that arginase was active internally in the interphase neutrophils and not liberated in cell culture. These data are consistent with a mechanism of suppression attributable to human MDSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and in particular, mature activated granuloctyes in renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that neutrophils which co-purify with PBMC are MDSC that suppress T cell proliferation by impairing T cell zeta-chain expression. The percentage of interphase neutrophil MDSC in sepsis patients is proportional to disease severity and correlates with plasma IL-6 concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest the inflammatory milieu of sepsis increases circulating interphase neutrophil-MDSC, which suppress T cell function. As in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], neutrophil-MDSC are associated with more severe disease and may be a major link between inflammation and T cell suppression in sepsis. This study indentifies for the first time neutrophil MDSC as mediators of impaired T cell responses during acute human infection. A clear understanding of the role of interphase neutrophil-MDSC in severe sepsis may help identify new targets for novel adjunctive treatment.</p>
