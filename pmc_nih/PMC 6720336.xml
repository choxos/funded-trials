                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Adolescents with brain injury frequently have difficulties with social competence, which persist into adulthood affecting their participation in daily life. To date, there has been limited research into the efficacy of social competence interventions in this population. Research from the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) has demonstrated significant improvements in social competence skills, maintained at 1-year to 5-year follow-up, for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. PEERS has not yet been tested among adolescents with brain injury. This protocol describes a pragmatic, parallel two-group pre-test post-test randomised waitlist control trial across two sites in Australia, which aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of PEERS in adolescents with brain injury compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Forty adolescents with an acquired brain injury or cerebral palsy will be randomly assigned to either the 14-week PEERS group or waitlist care as usual group. The waitlist group will then receive PEERS following the 26-week retention time point. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 14 weeks (immediately postintervention) and 26 weeks follow-up (retention). The primary outcomes are self-report and parent report on the Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales immediately post PEERS at 14 weeks. Secondary outcomes include increased frequency of get-togethers with peers with reduced conflict and increased adolescent self-reported knowledge of social skills. Acceptability and feasibility will be examined through qualitative analysis of focus group data collected after the completion of each group.</p>

              <p>Social competence has been defined as ‘an individual’s ability to achieve personal goals in social interactions while simultaneously maintaining positive relationships with others over time and across settings’ (Rubin <italic>et al</italic>, p285).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A person’s ability to make friends and relate socially with others contribute to the development of meaningful relationships, long-term psychological well-being, academic and career achievement, community participation, avoidance of criminal activity and substance abuse, thereby positively impacting quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref> Adolescence is a time of increasing social expectations requiring the interpretation and mastery of complex unspoken social rules, which underpin the development and maintenance of relationships.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Additional challenges in developing social competence are encountered by adolescents with disability.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

              <p>Usually delivered in a group format, social skills training aims to teach individuals how to adjust their verbal and nonverbal behaviours and read subtle cues in social interactions. The effectiveness of social skills training has been investigated primarily with children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who as a group exhibit significant social skill deficits and poor friendship quality.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomised trials concluded that group social skills interventions for youth with ASD demonstrated a medium overall aggregate effect on improving social competence (standardised effect size (ES)=0.51).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A previous smaller systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomised trials found that social skills training for children and youth with ASD improved overall social competence (ES=0.47), friendship quality (ES=0.41) and quality of life (ES=0.41).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> For adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a systematic review of 11 randomised trials concluded that there was insufficient high-quality research to support or refute social skills training to improve social competence.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

              <p>Brain injuries in childhood can be acquired or congenital. Acquired brain injury (ABI) refers to any damage to the brain that occurs after birth<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and can lead to significant difficulties with physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioural functioning.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> A 2003 survey of disability in Australia identified approximately 20 000 children under 15 years as having had an ABI.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Social dysfunction is one of the most significant difficulties for adolescents with ABI, with problems with social-affective, cognitive-executive skills, behaviour and social participation, which often persist into adulthood.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4 5 16–21</xref>

              <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture resulting from maldevelopment or injury to the developing fetal or infant brain.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In high-income communities, CP occurs in one in every 500–700 births.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> In addition to the activity limitations associated with the motor disorders of CP, many children experience other comorbidities impacting their sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behaviour. Significant restrictions in social functioning and communication have been demonstrated across this population including children with mild-to-severe functional motor limitations. Additionally, there is a trend for social functioning to diminish over time.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, very few published studies describe the efficacy of social skill interventions for adolescents with ABI or CP.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 18 26</xref>
</p>
              <p>One social skills programme developed in the USA, PEERS, has demonstrated efficacy to improve social competency in adolescents with ASD (ES=1.0–1.2)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> and ADHD,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> with generalisation of skills outside the treatment environment and retention of treatment effects (social competence) 1 to 5 years postintervention.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Parent involvement in social coaching after the intervention was likely to have contributed to the maintenance of gains.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> PEERS uses a publicly available treatment manual, is evidence-based, teaches ecologically valid social skills, includes homework assignments to facilitate generalisation to other settings and includes parents and/or teachers in the intervention.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref>
</p>
              <p>Provision of an evidence-based treatment manual may assist in standardising interventions.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Ellingsen and colleagues note the importance of didactic instruction in teaching concrete rules and components of social behaviour in a small group setting that allows for practice and performance feedback from group leaders. PEERS applies these principles and uses other recommended strategies such as behavioural modelling, behavioural rehearsal of skills and parent/caregiver social coaching to facilitate generalisation of skills to different settings.</p>
              <p>Adolescents with brain injury present with social deficits similar to those experienced by individuals with ASD and ADHD, including difficulties with social communication, impaired social cognition and reduced understanding of social cues. It is postulated that PEERS may positively impact the social competency of youth with brain injuries but may need to be adapted to accommodate the physical disabilities experienced by teenagers with brain injury and to suit the Australian cultural context. The current study will be the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a social skills training programme with an evidence-based treatment manual and structured parent group for teenagers with brain injuries.</p>

It is a pragmatic, parallel two-group pre-test post-test RCT and will be conducted at two sites in two states of Australia, the QCPRRC at the Centre for Children’s Health Research in Brisbane, Queensland, and Cerebral Palsy Alliance in Sydney, New South Wales. The intervention group will be compared with a waitlist group receiving care as usual (the target populations in both states receive minimal direct therapy related to social competency). The control group will go on to receive the PEERS at 26 weeks. Forty adolescents and their caregivers (at least one caregiver per participant) will be recruited between October 2017 and February 2019 across the two sites.</p>

                  <title>Social Skill Improvement System-Rating Scales (SSIS-RS)</title>
                  <p>The SSIS-RS is a 75–83 item revised version of the original Social Skill Rating Scales available for three different age groups: preschool (3–5 years), younger children (8–12 years) and adolescents (13–18 years). The SSIS-RS measures social behaviour, including social skills and competing problem behaviours that influence overall social competence. Parent and student versions of the SSIS-RS will be used in this study and assess students across two domains: social skills (subscales of communication, cooperation, assertion, responsibility, empathy, engagement and self-control) and problem behaviours (subscales of externalising, internalising, hyperactivity/inattention, autism spectrum and bullying).<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Parents are required to rate the frequency of an item, using a four-point scale from ‘never’ to ‘almost always’. Students rate how true a statement is using a four-point scale from ‘not true’ to ‘very true’. Parents and older students also rate the importance of a student’s social skills and problem behaviours. ‘Behaviour levels’ (below average, average and above average) describe the individual’s raw scores in each subscale in relation to the normative sample. Norm-referenced standard scores are provided for each of these domains (mean 100, SD 15), with higher scores indicating greater frequency of behaviour.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> All adolescents will complete the student report and their caregiver will complete the parent version.</p>
                  <p>The SSIS-RS manual demonstrates evidence of content validity through a broad review of the literature guiding item selection.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Internal structure and internal correlations between scales and subscales were examined and only items with moderate to strong correlations were retained. In addition, the rating of students, teachers and parents indicating the importance of items also added to the validity of test items. High internal consistency for the Social Skills and Problem Behaviours scales was demonstrated on every age group on each form (α=0.91–0.97) and most correlations between the Social Skill and Problem Behaviour scales showed the predicted moderate and negative effect (α=−0.42 to −0.65). Evidence for criterion validity exists with moderate to high correlations with other social and behavioural scales demonstrated.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
</p>
                  <p>The SSIS-RS demonstrated test–retest reliability for Social Skills, Problem Behaviours and Academic Competence scales (SS Parent form α=0.84, SS Student form α=0.81; PB Parent form α=0.87, PB Student form α=0.77; Academic Competence α=0.92). Special population studies show statistical significance between ratings on the SSIS-RS in the special education populations with impairments that are expected to have problems with social competence and a non-clinical reference group. The SSIS-RS was designed for use in intervention studies and has been frequently used to show change preintervention and postintervention.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46–48</xref>

                  <p>The 12-item QSQ (adapted from the Quality of Play Questionnaire for children with ASD) is administered separately to adolescents and their caregiver to measure the frequency of hosted and invited get-togethers over the previous month and level of conflict during get-togethers.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The total number of get-togethers give a composite score based on two questions, ‘How many get-togethers did your child organise in the last month?’ and ‘How many get-togethers was your child invited to last month?’ Parents then rate the quality of aspects of their adolescent’s socialising on a four-point scale (higher scores indicating increasing conflict). Summing the scores gives a total Conflict Scale score with scores greater than 3.5 indicating significant conflict. The QSQ has been used successfully to measure frequency of social engagement in clinical trials examining the PEERS with adolescents and young adults with ASD.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 50</xref>

              <p>This study details the protocol for a waitlist RCT investigating the efficacy of the PEERS on improving social competence for adolescents with a brain injury. It is hypothesised that participation in the 14-week PEERS group will lead to significantly greater gains in adolescent self-reported and caregiver-reported social skills on the SSIS-RS compared with waitlist control. In addition, the PEERS intervention group will increase the frequency of get-togethers with peers with reduced level of conflict during get-togethers and increase student self-reported knowledge of social skills. The study will also report on the acceptability and feasibility of the PEERS with adolescents with brain injury in Australia and detail any modifications required.</p>
              <p>The challenges of measuring social functioning are acknowledged, with potential limitations of this study including a reliance on adolescent and caregiver questionnaire data. The teacher version of the SSIS-RS was considered but decided against based on the significant difficulties in gathering teacher questionnaires with complete data encountered in a previous trial.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Other limitations include a relatively small sample size and sample heterogeneity, which will enable the study to detect only large effect sizes for the whole sample. The use of a delayed treatment group as a waitlist control provides opportunity for all participants to access the intervention, particularly as usual care involves minimal intervention for improving social competency in this population of adolescents in Australia. The waitlist control group will not control for the effects of attention, and this is a potential limitation of the study. The PEERS requires participants to be motivated to improve at making and keeping friends. Given that adolescents with brain injury are at risk of having reduced insight into their difficulties, PEERS will only be suitable for the subset of adolescents with reasonable awareness of their challenges with social functioning and the motivation to improve their skills.</p>
              <p>PEERS has a strong theoretical basis with explicit teaching of social skills as well as incorporating caregiver coaching sessions to generalise new skills into the adolescent’s own community. Very few RCTs have examined social skill interventions with adolescents with brain injury, and to our knowledge, this will be the first pragmatic RCT utilising the PEERS in this population, as well as the first in any population in Australia. It is expected that results of this study will guide further investigation of social competence interventions for children and adolescents with brain injury and should the results support use of PEERS, it has the potential to be used in clinical practice in this area.</p>
