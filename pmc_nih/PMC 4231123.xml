                  <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persistence in latently infected resting memory CD4+ T-cells is the major barrier to HIV cure. Cellular histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important in maintaining HIV latency and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) may reverse latency by activating HIV transcription from latently infected CD4+ T-cells. We performed a single arm, open label, proof-of-concept study in which vorinostat, a pan-HDACi, was administered 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days to 20 HIV-infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). The primary endpoint was change in cell associated unspliced (CA-US) HIV RNA in total CD4+ T-cells from blood at day 14. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01365065). Vorinostat was safe and well tolerated and there were no dose modifications or study drug discontinuations. CA-US HIV RNA in blood increased significantly in 18/20 patients (90%) with a median fold change from baseline to peak value of 7.4 (IQR 3.4, 9.1). CA-US RNA was significantly elevated 8 hours post drug and remained elevated 70 days after last dose. Significant early changes in expression of genes associated with chromatin remodeling and activation of HIV transcription correlated with the magnitude of increased CA-US HIV RNA. There were no statistically significant changes in plasma HIV RNA, concentration of HIV DNA, integrated DNA, inducible virus in CD4+ T-cells or markers of T-cell activation. Vorinostat induced a significant and sustained increase in HIV transcription from latency in the majority of HIV-infected patients. However, additional interventions will be needed to efficiently induce virus production and ultimately eliminate latently infected cells.</p>

                <p>The major barrier to curing HIV is the long term persistence of latently infected resting memory T-cells in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). One strategy being pursued to eliminate latently infected cells is to activate HIV production from latently infected cells with the aim of killing latently infected cells via virus induced cell death or stimulation of an HIV-specific immune response. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important in maintaining HIV latency. Vorinostat, an inhibitor of HDACs (HDACi) licensed for the treatment of some malignancies, has been shown in laboratory studies and a clinical study of selected individuals to disrupt HIV latency. We examined the ability of standard dose vorinostat given daily for 14 days to activate latent HIV infection in unselected HIV-infected individuals on ART. The study showed evidence of activation of latent HIV infection in 18/20 (90%) of individuals and was safe and generally well tolerated. There were significant early changes in host gene expression, which persisted during and after the period of vorinostat. No changes were seen in immune activation or number of latently infected cells. Vorinostat was able to activate latent HIV infection in most individuals. Additional interventions will be needed to eliminate latent HIV infection.</p>

The pan HDACi vorinostat, the first HDACi to be licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Prince1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> is a less potent activator of latent HIV than other HDACi such as romidepsin <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but has been clearly shown to induce virus production from resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells from HIV-infected patients on cART <italic>ex vivo</italic> by some groups in both the absence <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bouchat1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> or presence <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Archin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Archin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> of activated feeder cells while other groups have shown minimal virus production <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Blazkova1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. There has been recent data suggesting that HDACi may only activate HIV transcription through stimulation of a host gene promoter leading to the production of chimeric host-HIV transcripts, or read-through transcripts, and not true CA-US HIV RNA raising a concern that HDACi are unable to induce virion production <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, studies using other models of ex vivo stimulation of resting CD4+ T-cells from HIV-infected patients on ART have not supported these findings <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, recent data from a clinical trial of the HDACi romidepsin clearly demonstrated that virus could be produced in vivo following intravenous administration of this HDACi to HIV-infected patients on ART <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Sgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Recently, vorinostat was demonstrated to activate HIV transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> in resting memory CD4+ T-cells in HIV-infected subjects on ART who had been selected based upon <italic>ex vivo</italic> increase in HIV transcription by vorinostat <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Archin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Archin3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We hypothesized that a multi-dose course of vorinostat would increase HIV transcription in CD4+ T-cells in blood from unselected HIV-infected patients on suppressive ART. We aimed to determine the safety and tolerability of short course vorinostat in HIV-infected patients on ART and to determine the effect on cell associated unspliced (CA-US) HIV RNA in CD4+ T-cells and the number of latently infected cells in blood and rectal tissue.</p>

                <title>Vorinostat induced dynamic changes in host gene expression in the 24 hours following the first dose of vorinostat</title>
                <p>We next used Illumina microarrays to characterize the kinetics and nature of host gene expression changes in whole blood following vorinostat administration and to determine whether there was a distinct transcriptional profile associated with changes in CA-US RNA. We observed highly significant changes in expression of multiple host genes compared to baseline at all time points including at two hours post vorinostat (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004473.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). HDACi compounds mediate dynamic changes in chromatin states by binding to HDACs, promoting open chromatin structure, DNA hypomethylation, and histone and non-histone protein acetylation which can lead to enhanced accessibility for the basal transcription machinery. This leads to a reduction in replication fork velocity and an increase in DNA replicative stress culminating in DNA damage and double strand DNA breaks <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bhaskara1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. DNA double-strand break repair is essential for maintenance of genome stability following vorinostat administration. We were able to track temporal changes in gene expression associated with enhanced transcriptional activity and the DNA damage response (DDR) over the course of 24 h after the 1<sup>st</sup> dose of vorinostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g006"><bold>Figures 6A and 6B</bold></xref>) and subsequent time-points up to 70 days after the last dose.</p>

                <p>Since previous studies found that a switch in the subunit composition of the switch/sucrose-non fermenting (SWI/SNF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes between BRG1-Associated Factor (BAF) and PBAF was required for nucleosomal repositioning and initiation of transcription at the HIV LTR, we searched for differential expression of variant subunits exclusive to PBAF complexes <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Rafati1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004473-Tolstorukov1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

In addition, recent studies suggest that loss of SNF5 activity results in the disruption of nucleosome occupancy at transcriptional start sites (TSS) of gene promoters resulting in the upregulation of E2F target genes associated with cell cycle and proliferation <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Tolstorukov1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>

                <p>The rapid up-regulation of HDACs and chromatin co-repressor complexes two hours after the initial dose of vorinostat result in restoration of the normally repressive chromatin architecture leading to a shutdown of the transcription of early response genes by 8 hours that was maintained at 24 hours after vorinostat administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bhaskara1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study of 14 days of continuous daily dosing, vorinostat was safe, relatively well tolerated and induced a sustained increase in CA-US HIV RNA in CD4+ T-cells from blood in the majority of participants, suggesting that the latent HIV provirus in most virally suppressed adults is susceptible to HDAC inhibition.</p>
              <p>Despite the significant increase in CA-US HIV RNA following vorinostat, there was no significant change in plasma HIV RNA in all but one subject. This may be because vorinostat induced an increase in HIV transcription, as measured by CA-US HIV RNA, but subsequent blocks in virus production were not reversed, including synthesis or export of multiply spliced HIV RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Lassen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and/or inhibition of translation by cellular microRNA <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Alternatively, this may be due to induction of HIV transcription in only a small subset of latently infected cells <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Cillo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Saleh1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> or the production of incomplete short or read through transcripts, as described in ex vivo models <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Lassen2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Recent studies using resting CD4+ T-cells isolated from HIV-infected patients on ART stimulated with vorinostat and other HDACi, have also demonstrated that production of free virus from latently infected cells was rarely observed, even when an increase in CA-US HIV RNA was clearly detected <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Cillo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our in vivo findings are consistent with these in vitro observations although it is important to note that we did see evidence for the upregulation of genes associated with splicesome assembly and nuclear export of mRNA at 2 h suggesting functional splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>).</p>
              <p>HDACi have a broad range of effects on both the adaptive and innate immune responses, and have been shown to induce both the number and function of regulatory T-cells <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Tao1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, as we show in this study. Vorinostat has also been shown to reduce anti-CD3 mediated T-cell proliferative responses in a dose dependent fashion <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, although interestingly, in this study we observed a significant increase in mitogen-specific IFN-γ CD8+ T-cell responses over the duration of follow-up. However, despite these diverse changes in global T-cell function, we still saw no change in gag-specific T-cells in this study most likely because translation and HIV protein expression were insufficient to induce priming or recall of HIV-specific T-cells.</p>
              <p>The timing and magnitude of increase in both CA-US HIV RNA and histone acetylation were highly variable, consistent with previous reports of HDACi in patients with malignancy <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Gojo1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The lack of a statistically significant relationship between changes in HIV CA-US RNA and any of the markers of acetylation supports recent data suggesting that the activity of HDACi in stimulating HIV transcription may not occur by the direct effects on histone acetylation, but via effects on other proteins such as the release of free P-TEFb from the inhibitory complex 7SK snRNP <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bartholomeeusen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. HDACi have a wide ranging effect on acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bose1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and therefore other, yet unidentified, proteins may also have played a role in activating HIV transcription.</p>
              <p>Using gene array we showed a strikingly consistent change in expression in multiple genes in all subjects as quickly as two hours following the initial dose. Although it is difficult to ascribe direct effects of vorinostat on specific pathways associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional activation, spliceosome activity or mRNA export with expression of CA-US HIV RNA, our analysis of host gene expression showed that vorinostat can effectively promote or prime a favorable epigenetic environment for HIV transcription. The coordinated and highly consistent changes in host gene expression that favour HIV transcription, also argues against random, non-specific read-through <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, we acknowledge that distinguishing between read-through transcripts and viral CA US-RNA would need to be measured directly on these samples to confidently exclude the possibility of only read-through transcription occurring. Hence, the mechanisms by which vorinostat and perhaps other HDAC inhibitors affect HIV reactivation might be multi-factorial, with the drug directly stimulating HIV transcription and indirectly altering expression of other host genes that affect this process. Induction of HIV transcription is a critical first step in activating virus production from latency. Therefore, HDACi such as vorinostat are likely to play an important role in combination activation strategies given the significant synergism demonstrated when combining HDACi with other agents, such as protein kinase C activators and/or BET inhibitors, leading to the induction of virus production from latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients on ART ex vivo <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Reuse1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p>
              <p>It remains unclear what the optimal dosing of vorinostat should be in activating HIV transcription. A recent study using an unconventional dosing schedule of 3 days per week of vorinostat demonstrated an increase in CA-US HIV RNA in 3 of 5 participants following multiple but intermittent doses of drug <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Archin3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The authors noted a reduced response in production of CA-US HIV RNA after the 11th and 22nd doses, compared to the first dose, although there were too few patients and time points studied to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences in the magnitude of the changes observed <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Archin3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our study, multiple doses of vorinostat were clearly well tolerated and there were similar robust changes in host gene expression following the first and seventh doses. Although an increase in CA-US HIV RNA was observed in all participants who responded within 8 hours, in some participants the maximum fold increase in CA-US HIV RNA was only observed after 7 or 14 doses, arguing that multiple doses of vorinostat may be needed to maximize any changes in HIV transcription. Whether this is the case for other HDACi remains unknown. There are now more potent HDACi than vorinostat in clinical trials for malignancy and activation of latent HIV <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Rasmussen2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, that have significantly enhanced potency in activating latent HIV infection in vitro, including panobinostat, entinostat and romidepsin <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Rasmussen2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Wightman1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, and these more potent agents will hopefully show greater potency than vorinostat in vivo <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Rasmussen2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p>
              <p>An unexpected finding in our study was the unique changes in host gene expression detected out to day 84–70 days off vorinostat when compared to baseline. This was despite a return to baseline levels of histone acetylation upon cessation of drug following the sustained increase whilst on vorinostat. It will be important to determine if the expression of IFN inducible genes (ISGs) associated with antigen processing and Class I antigen presentation at day 84 reflects long-term epigenetic changes at the viral LTR that might facilitate virus reactivation and/or that promote innate immune responses. These changes may explain the observed increased CA-US HIV RNA expression to day 84 in this study. The correlation between baseline and both peak and day 84 levels of CA-US HIV RNA suggests activation of transcription may be more efficient in patients with higher levels of basal HIV transcription.</p>
              <p>Latently infected resting memory CD4+ T-cells represent the most significant barrier to HIV eradication. In this study we demonstrated that although short-course vorinostat clearly induced CA-US HIV RNA, there was no evidence of production of free virus or elimination of latently infected cells. Vorinostat may be a feasible component of larger HIV eradication studies given its tolerability and the induction of HIV transcription in the majority of participants without the need for <italic>ex vivo</italic> screening, although the prolonged changes in host gene expression require careful long term follow up. The lack of change in the number of infected CD4+ T-cells suggests that vorinostat did not impact the size of the HIV reservoir despite a clear effect on HIV transcription. Additional interventions will be needed to efficiently induce virus production and ultimately to eliminate latently infected cells.</p>

                <p>Participants received vorinostat 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days. Blood was collected at 0, 2, 8 and 24 hours, and on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 84. Rectal biopsies were performed at baseline and on day 14. Participants were monitored for clinical and laboratory adverse events, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 4.0). A Data Safety Monitoring Board reviewed safety and tolerability data after the first and tenth participants had completed dosing.</p>

                <p>The primary study objective was to evaluate the effect of vorinostat on HIV transcription.

Secondary efficacy endpoints were a sensitive measure of plasma HIV RNA with a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 0.3 copy per mL <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> cell associated and integrated HIV DNA (a measure of the total number of infected CD4+ T-cells); and histone (H3, H4 and lysine) acetylation (a pharmacodynamic marker of vorinostat activity). Safety endpoints were plasma HIV RNA measured using a commercial assay with a LLOD of 20 copies per ml (TAQMAN v2, Roche), adverse events, serious adverse events, dose limiting toxicity, CD4+ T-cell count and plasma trough concentrations of antiretroviral agents. Because HDACi can activate DNA viruses we quantified cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA at baseline and day 28.</p>

                <p>CD4+ T-cells were isolated from stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using a CD4+ T-cell isolation kit and magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Teterow, Germany; purity &gt;95%) and RNA and DNA extracted (Allprep isolation kit, Qiagen). For quantification of CA-US RNA, a semi-nested real time quantitative (q) PCR was used with a first round amplification of 15 cycles to ensure that following second round amplification the assay was in the linear range between 1 to 46,000 input copies, as previously described by Pasternak et al <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Pasternak1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The second round used primers to gag <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Lewin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. HIV RNA copy numbers were standardised to cellular equivalents using an 18s RNA real time LUX PCR primer set (Invitrogen). The LLOD for CA-US HIV RNA was 1 copy per well. PCR amplification of cDNA for CA-US HIV RNA was performed in quadruplicate with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of 32%. In all assays, a no reverse transcriptase (RT) control was used. If there was any amplification from the no RT control, ie. evidence of DNA contamination, a second stored sample was re-extracted. If contaminating DNA persisted, the reading was excluded.

                <p>Blood was collected directly into Paxgene tubes and cells lysed for RNA extraction as per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription reactions were performed to obtain cDNAs which were hybridized to the Illumina Human HT-12 version 4 Expression BeadChip according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using an Illumina iScan System. The data were collected with Illumina GenomeStudio software. Analysis of the genome array output data was conducted using the R statistical language <xref rid="ppat.1004473-The1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and the LIMMA statistical package <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Smyth1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> from Bioconductor <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Gentleman1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. First, arrays displaying unusually low median intensity, low variability, or low correlation relative to the bulk of the arrays were tagged as outliers and were discarded from the rest of the analysis. Quantile normalization followed by a log2 transformation using the Bioconductor package LIMMA was applied to process microarrays. The LIMMA package was used to fit a linear model to each probe and to perform a (moderated) Student's <italic>t</italic> test on various differences of interest. For data mining and functional analyses, genes that satisfied a p-value (0.05) were selected. Probes that did not map to annotated RefSeq genes and control probes were removed. When indicated, the expected proportion of false positives, the false discovery rate (FDR), was estimated from the unadjusted p-value using the Benjamini and Hochberg method <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The full dataset was composed of 9 patients with 8 time points each. Samples were stratified into the following groups: Day 0 (baseline), 2 hours, 8 hours, Day 1, Day 14 (all on vorinostat); and Day 84 (off vorinostat). One set of analyses compared each time point to baseline (to show the persistent effect of vorinostat over time). The other set compared baseline gene expression at 2 hours, 8 hours and 1 day (to isolate the early effects of vorinostat following the initial dose). In 5 individuals, the additional time points including Day 7 and Day 7+ 2 hours were collected to determine if changes seen 2 hours after the first dose were the same as those seen at 2 hours following the 7<sup>th</sup> dose.</p>
                <p>Heatmaps of genes differentially expressed between different groups and baseline were produced (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004473.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>). Two ANOVA (F-test) heatmaps comparing the groups of interest: 2 hours, 8 hours, Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>) and Day 0+2 hours, Day 7, Day 7+2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g008"><bold>Figure 8A</bold></xref>) were produced. The top 50 statistically significant genes are shown as symbols and plotted on the row names of the heatmaps. Gene expression within each heatmap is represented as gene-wise standardized expression (Z-score), with p-value&lt;0.05 chosen as the significant level.</p>
                <p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> was performed on the various contrasts of interest. GSEA is a statistical method to determine whether members of a particular gene set preferentially occur toward the top or bottom of a ranked-ordered gene list where genes are ranked by the strength of their association with the outcome of interest. More specifically, GSEA calculates a net enrichment score (NES) that reflects the degree to which a set of genes is over-represented among genes that are differently expressed. We apply a nominal p-value cutoff of 0.05 when plotting the top enriched pathways on a checkerboard figure. The NES and p-value rankings usually go hand in hand i.e.: the top 10 NES pathway scores equate with the top 10 significant p-values). Since gene expression is tightly regulated, we do not apply statistical cutoffs on the actual FC's of genes when performing pathway enrichment. We try to include as many genes as possible to capture enriched and coregulated transcripts within a pathway that are an indication of relative pathway activity. The significance of an observed NES is obtained by permutation testing: resorting the gene list to determine how often an observed NES occurs by chance.</p>
                <p>Leading Edge analysis was performed to examine the particular genes of a gene set contributing the most to the enrichment. Two different databases were used: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity H Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) was used to mine canonical pathways while MSigDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb">www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb</ext-link>; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) was used to mine chromatin and splicing pathways.

                <p>Linear regression analysis was performed between CA-US HIV RNA at 2 hours and the gene expression 2 hours after the first dose of vorinostat versus baseline (n = 9). CA-US HIV RNA was plotted as a continuous variable and correlated with distinct gene expression profiles at low and high levels of CA-US HIV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>). About 2000 features passed the p-value cut off of &lt;0.05. Pathway analysis was performed on the regression features and a checkerboard figure with some of the top resulting pathways was produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>).</p>

Checkerboard figures were used as a representation of the pathway analysis results representing the top genes and the top pathways for a specific contrast. Checkerboard plots show the top 10 enriched pathways on one axis and leading edge analysis (genes contributing to that enrichment) on the corresponding axis. This approach allows quick visualization of what genes are up regulated (red) or down regulated (blue) in the respective pathway at the specified contrast. Checkerboard analysis was also performed on a cell subset level <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Nakaya1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and the same plots generated together with a subset enrichment heat map displaying the contrasts on the x-axis and the subset on the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004473-g009"><bold>Figure 9C</bold></xref>).</p>

                <p>A sample size of 20 patients gave 80% power to detect an increase in CA-US HIV RNA of 40 copies/million CD4 T cells (primary endpoint) and an increase in plasma HIV RNA using the single copy assay of 0.4 log (secondary efficacy endpoint) at a p&lt;0.05 level of significance. Categorical variables were summarised using frequency and percentage whilst continuous variables were summarised using mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and inter-quartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between virologic and immunologic measurements. Intra-individual comparisons of CA-US RNA and HIV DNA between baseline and post-baseline time points were performed using parametric summary measures of replicate PCR data and a parametric paired t-test as PCR replicate data were derived using a standard curve and thus approximated a normal distribution. Bonferroni adjustment was made for multiple comparisons.</p>
                <p>Whilst we were prepared to presume normality at the level of the individual replicate data directly derived from the standard curve, we were less prepared to extend this assumption of approximate normality to the more sparse, more severely skewed summary data items not directly derived from the standard curves, opting for the more conservative non-parametric approach. As such, comparisons of fold change MFI for acetylation, CA-US RNA, fold change in CA-US RNA, HIV DNA, SCA, activation and differentiation markers, integrated DNA, TILDA and ICS between baseline and subsequent time points across all patients used a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. For each statistical test, a sensitivity analysis was run consisting of parallel non-parametric testing where parametric analysis was chosen, and conversely parallel parametric testing where non-parametric methodologies were used. In each analysis there was no difference in the pattern of significance or, with regards to the modeling, the direction of the coefficients.</p>
                <p>Comparisons in CA-US HIV RNA, HIV DNA, SCA, integrated DNA and ICS between pre-vorinostat, on vorinsotat and off vorinostat time periods were also performed using a Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE), using a Gaussian family structure, a link identity function and an exchangeable within-group correlation structure. A robust variance estimator was used secondary to the small sample size and the deviations from normality exhibited in the summary measure data. We further extended the GEE modeling to estimate fixed effects for assay to correct for intra-assay variability by using approximations proposed by Sutradhar and Rao <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Sutradhar1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> for GEE and further developed by Feddag et al <xref rid="ppat.1004473-Feddag1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Outcome variables were log<sub>10</sub> transformed. All reported p values were two-tailed. A Bonferroni deflation of significance was applied for multiple comparisons, otherwise p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

(C) Radial plot (Nakaya modules) illustrating selective enrichment of gene expression in PBMC cell subsets of the day 0+2 hour (red) and day 7+2 hour (green) timepoints. The radial plot shows a wedge of color that points outward (increased expression) or inward (decreased expression). Genesets induced in a specific subset were significantly enriched (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 denoted by *) among genes upregulated or downregulated with respect to the enrichment score (NES) between groups. All subsets with the exception of myeloid dendritic cells (MDC) were enriched in the same direction between day 0+2 hour and day 7+2 hour timepoint. pDC = plasmacytoid dendritic cells; NK = natural killer cells.</p>
