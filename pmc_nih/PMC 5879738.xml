                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">HIV-infected people who use drugs (PWUD) exhibit the highest rates of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV. This contributes to poor treatment outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality, and HIV transmission. However, current interventions fail to address the unique barriers to adherence faced by this population. Life Steps is a brief, single session intervention that demonstrated increased ART adherence among HIV-infected individuals. This study protocol seeks to improve clinical practice by adapting Life Steps for HIV-infected PWUD and adding a brief motivational intervention addressing drug use. This intervention will incorporate educational, motivational, and behavioral skills components specifically aimed at improving adherence and linkage to substance use treatment among HIV-infected PWUD.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This project will consist of three phases using a mixed-methods approach. <italic>In Phase 1</italic>, qualitative interviews with HIV-infected PWUD and community providers, coupled with feedback from an expert review panel, will be used to enhance the existing Life Steps manual and interventionist training protocol. <italic>In Phase 2</italic>, the prototype will be pilot tested and qualitative exit interviews with HPWUD will identify the strengths and limitations of the intervention. Data regarding feasibility, acceptability, and barriers to delivery will guide modifications to finalize a modified Life Steps-Drug Use (LS-DU) protocol. <italic>In Phase 3</italic>, a pilot type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial will examine the effectiveness of LS-DU relative to a health education intervention control condition on ART adherence and viral load data at 1-, 3-, and 6-months. Data regarding clinic readiness for implementation and intervention sustainability potential will be collected.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Illicit drug use remains a common and significant problem among people living with HIV (PLWH). Drug use is one of the most significant barriers to antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, contributing to suboptimal treatment outcomes and increased transmission of HIV. As suggested by the syndemics model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], multiple morbidities such as drug use and HIV act synergistically to produce poorer health outcomes. Over 81% of persons living with HIV report a history of illicit drug use and nearly one in four meet diagnostic criteria for a severe substance use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Drug use remains prevalent among PLWH enrolled in primary care with one study showing that 24% report marijuana use, 9% report amphetamine use, 8.5% report crack cocaine use, 10% report polydrug use, and almost 3% report injection drug use in the preceding 3Â months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This study was conducted using the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) data which consisted of academically affiliated HIV clinics; thus, it is possible that these are underestimates of active illicit drug use. These data demonstrate that sustainable interventions and risk reduction programs addressing substance use are needed within the HIV clinical setting.</p>
              <p id="Par13">People who use drugs (PWUD) experience unique challenges with HIV treatment and adherence. HIV-infected PWUD are more likely to experience delayed treatment, suboptimal service utilization, increased rates of HIV transmission in the community, and inferior treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Relative to PLWH who do not use drugs, HIV-infected PWUD are more than twice as likely to be non-adherent to ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both interpersonal and social factors limit adherence in this population: HIV-infected PWUD are less likely to have primary care providers or strong patient-provider relationships and have lower levels of social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Socioeconomic factors prevalent in PLWH, including lack of stable housing and medical insurance, poor education and low literacy, and low health literacy pose further barriers to adherence. HIV-infected PWUD are also more likely to have medical (e.g., hepatitis C, tuberculosis) and psychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety) comorbidity, neurocognitive impairment, and increased risk for drug overdose, which contribute to reduced adherence and poorer health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>

                <title>Prior adherence interventions for HIV-infected people who use drugs</title>
                <p id="Par14">Several intensive treatment approaches have been shown to improve adherence among HIV-infected PWUD including the integration of HIV care and intensive drug use treatment, directly administered ART doses at the clinic, contingency management, and peer-driven interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although these interventions are effective in the short-term, adherence improvements are frequently not maintained after the direct observation has been terminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and such intensive interventions may not be feasible or sustainable in clinics with limited resources, which dampens the potential for widespread implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, these interventions do not teach HIV-infected PWUD the behavioral skills needed to maintain adherence once it is achieved. Behavioral interventions overcome these limitations by teaching adherence and problem-solving skills, using brief motivational interviewing (BMI) and cognitive behavioral approaches to sustain behavior change. These interventions have been successfully augmented with booster sessions and delivered by trained clinic nurses and staff. This approach has shown promise in promoting ART adherence and self-efficacy to adhere among PLWH, but evidence is severely limited by use of small sample pilot and case studies. To date, only one behavioral adherence interventionâthe Life Steps interventionâhas been evaluated in HIV-infected PWUD.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Life Steps was developed by Safren and colleagues using motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral techniques to teach the following: facts about ART and HIV, problem-solving around transportation to clinic appointments and obtaining medications, skills to improve communication with healthcare providers, strategies to cope with side effects, development of a daily medication schedule, storage of medications away from home, reminder cues for pill-taking, and responding to slips in adherence. This model consists of a brief, single session intervention that has been evaluated as both a stand-alone intervention and an adjunct to more intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Data from multiple studies indicates that Life Steps and similar interventions are associated with increased adherence relative to self-monitoring in PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], though meta-analyses suggest that these effects are modest across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations of life steps with HIV-infected people who use drugs</title>
                <p id="Par16">Prior research on the Life Steps protocol with HIV-infected PWUD is subject to several limitations. First, only one study to date has evaluated Life Steps among a drug using population and this study focused on depressed injection drug users who are unlikely to be representative of the full range of HIV-infected PWUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, both study conditions received Life Steps; the experimental condition also received CBT for Adherence and Depression which consisted of seven CBT-focused modules. Second, no prior studies have examined which specific components of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Model are likely to be most relevant for HIV-infected PWUD and if additional skills modules related to illicit drug use should be incorporated. Third, the Life Steps protocol focuses on skills acquisition and behavior modification related to HIV medication taking behavior, but does not address substance use or linkage to addiction treatment. Brief motivational interventions (BMIs) are especially well suited to this population, as both adherence to HIV treatment and drug use have been related to patient motivation for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Finally, there has been virtually no research examining barriers and facilitators of the implementation of behavioral ART adherence interventions within real-world clinics. Such research is essential in order to accelerate the translation of research into practice and improve the outcomes of this hard to reach, high risk population.</p>

The proposed project consists of three phases (see TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). <italic>In Phase 1</italic>, qualitative interviews with HIV-infected PWUD and community providers, coupled with feedback from an expert review panel, will be used to adapt the existing Life Steps manual and community clinician training protocol. <italic>In Phase 2</italic>, qualitative data from phase 1 will inform development of the intervention manual. The protocol will be pilot tested and in-depth qualitative interviews with HIV-infected PWUD and community clinicians will be used to make final refinements to the adapted Life Steps-Drug Use (LS-DU) model. <italic>In Phase 3</italic>, a pilot type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial will examine the effectiveness of LS-DU relative to a health education control condition on ART adherence and viral load data at 1-, 3-, and 6-months.

The primary objective for Phase 3 will be to determine a reasonable effect size for LS-DU rather than to determine statistical significance between groups. With 30 participants per group and effect size range of dâ=â.40 to .60, power to detect the difference ranges from .54 to .75. With Nâ=â60 we will have .80 power to detect effect sizes in the medium-large range above dâ=â.65.

Although heavy alcohol consumption affects ART adherence and cannabis use has demonstrated mixed results in the literature, we chose to narrow the target population to illicit drug use to have a more homogenous sample for this pilot trial. In Phase 3 (pilot randomized trial), participants must also report &lt;â100% adherence to ART regimen and have experienced a detectable viral load (&gt;â20Â copies/mL) within the last 6Â months. Our eligibility criteria for a substance use disorder is broad given the LS-DU will focus on improving ART adherence and linking patients to appropriate substance use treatment resources. Our goal is to create an intervention that is easily implemented in clinical settings. We will examine qualitative data from Phase 1 to assess the potential need for the intervention to take a more narrow approach and adjust the manual development based on these data.</p>

                  <p id="Par25">The Life Steps manual will be enhanced to address the most salient needs of HIV-infected PWUD while retaining the core elements of the intervention. Data from Phase 1 will guide modification of the manual. The manual will be evaluated based on the theoretical model, targeted outcomes, therapeutic strategies, and content. <italic>Substantive Changes Expected</italic>. Based on extant literature, there are two key areas in which substantive changes are expected in the adaptation of the Life Steps manual (see TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>): <italic>Content</italic>. The Information-Motivation Behavioral Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] will guide content targeting individual knowledge, motivation, and skills development (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Considering the synergistic interaction of HIV and drug use on nonadherence, syndemics theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] will guide the adaptation of intervention content to address contextual challenges of HIV-infected PWUD (e.g., stigma, stress, poverty). <italic>Delivery</italic>. Based on the hypothesized outcomes from Phase 1, we expect the adapted LS-DU protocol will contain a new drug use module focused on building motivation for change and linkage to substance use treatment; this module will be informed by best practices in the BMI literature. While we have anticipated preliminary adaptations based on the extant literature, changes to the protocol will be based on data obtained during the qualitative phase which will be sufficiently broad and open to assess for factors that we have not anticipated. Once the manual is developed, a review panel of five experts in HIV, addiction, and ART adherence will provide feedback about the intervention manual. We will use an affinity grouping procedure to merge similar recommendations. The draft of recommendations will be reviewed through two rounds of preliminary ratings, teleconference discussions, and written comments to result in a set of final recommendations which will inform revision and finalization of the manual.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>TableÂ 2</label><caption><p>Core elements of life steps and anticipated modifications</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Module</th><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left">Anticipated modifications to life steps</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3"><italic>Existing life steps protocol</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Step 1: Education and introduction</td><td align="left">Information about how medication adherence plays in successful treatment is provided.

                  <p id="Par34">Considering this is a pilot project, analyses will have the goal of establishing feasibility and estimation of effect sizes, with modest expectations for rejection of the null hypotheses. As a first step, the equivalence of treatment condition assignment with regard to key baseline variables will be assessed on demographic characteristics, baseline ART adherence measures (self-report and viral load), drug category and addiction severity, and baseline levels of potential treatment mechanisms and moderators using tests of proportions or t-tests as appropriate. Should conditions differ on any characteristic; these variables will be used as covariates in outcome analyses. Other preliminary analyses will include patterns of missing data, research dropout rates, distributional properties of dependent and other measures, and correlations among outcome measures.</p>

                    <p id="Par35">Given the developmental nature of this study, our primary goal is to establish feasibility and acceptability of the LS-DU and assessment procedures to be implemented in a future larger scale hybrid type 2 randomized trial. Our primary hypothesis is that participants completing and community clinicians delivering the LS-DU intervention will report high levels of acceptability of the intervention. Our secondary hypothesis is that the LS-DU intervention will demonstrate greater effectiveness than the health education outcome in terms of promoting days of adherence to HIV medication and reducing substance use. We will also collect exploratory data on implementation potential of the intervention and moderators of implementation effectiveness. Due to the small sample size, we will primarily be hoping to find a pattern of results that is supportive of the LS-DU rather than rigorously testing hypotheses to determine a stable effect size.</p>

                    <title>Effectiveness</title>
                    <p id="Par38">We will measure treatment effectiveness via adherence to HIV medication (MEMScaps), viral load (eligibility screener vs. baseline vs. 6-months), and days of drug use (Timeline Followback). Separate Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models for adherence will be generated for proportion of days on which study medication was taken (as indicated by MEMScap) and the proportion of expected pills taken at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Examining interactions between intervention and time will test differences in adherence over the course of the intervention across the intervention conditions. As our sample size limits our ability to conduct sophisticated longitudinal analyses, we will use GEE with caution and will revert to more standard general linear models should we encounter model convergence problems. Additional measures of treatment effectiveness, including self-reported adherence, viral load, and drug use, will also be analyzed using GEE.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par41">HIV-infected PWUD continue to experience poorer rates of ART adherence, lapses in treatment retention, and increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Existing adherence interventions have yet to prove effective among this high-risk population. This protocol seeks to improve ART adherence and promote linkage to substance use treatment by developing an adherence intervention tailored to HIV-infected PWUD. This behavioral intervention will utilize the syndemics framework to address critical factors aimed at improving adherence and reducing substance use. This study will use a pilot type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] given that Life Steps and BMI have both proven efficacious. In order to speed the translation of research to practice, we test the effectiveness of these interventions delivered in a real-world clinical setting, while simultaneously examining potential barriers and facilitators to implementation.</p>
              <p id="Par42">While this study will advance our understanding of treatment science and clinical practice with HIV-infected PWUD, there are a number of limitations which should be noted. First, since this is a pilot study the sample size is small and, therefore, will require testing in a larger trial to further examine effectiveness should this study produce a pattern of results that is favorable to the LS-DU intervention. Second, this is a brief, first-line intervention that aims to improve ART adherence and link HIV-infected PWUD to substance use treatment. Consequently, this will not be a comprehensive treatment intervention, and patients might require more intensive substance use intervention post-linkage to care. Third, participants will not be blind to study purpose and intervention condition due to the informed consent process and the nature of the content being addressed in each behavioral condition.</p>
              <p id="Par43">This research will result in the development of an ART adherence intervention tailored for PWUD and combined with a BMI aiming to link patients to appropriate substance use treatment services. Data from this study regarding implementation and sustainability potential will result in the development of an implementation manual for community-based HIV clinical settings. This work will inform a larger, multi-site study that places equal emphasis on both effectiveness and implementation outcomes. These results have the potential to make a significant impact on the management of ART adherence by improving the quality and utilization of evidence-based adherence interventions delivered to HIV-infected PWUD in the clinic setting. From both a clinical and a public health perspective, there is an urgent need to develop effective interventions to improve ART adherence and reduce substance use among HIV-infected people who use drugs. To our knowledge, no research has yet to adapt a brief, theory driven protocol that integrates HIV and substance use treatment among this high-risk population.</p>
