                  <p>Hands play a part in the transmission of infections. Handwashing with soap sufficiently reduces the level of hand contamination and the spread of infections. As soap is not usually available due to cost, ash is often used as a zero-cost alternative to soap in the rural settings of developing countries. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of ash to reduce microbial contamination of hands. This study is, therefore, designed to assess the effect of ash on microbial contamination of hands in the rural settings of northwest Ethiopia.</p>

                  <p>A two-arm clustered-randomised controlled trial will be employed. A total of 11 clusters per arm will be selected using simple random sampling technique. A total of 220 mothers or caregivers of under-5 children will be included in each arm. After providing health education on effective handwashing process, we will ask study subjects to do the usual activities. We will then take swab samples from the dominant hand before washing. After swabbing, participants will be asked to wash their hands with water only and with ash by following effective handwashing procedures. We will again take swab samples from the dominant hand after washing and drying. Finally, we will compare each intervention arm against the control. A generalised estimating equation (GEE) with robust SE estimation will be used to account the cluster nature of data.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>It is universal that the practice of good hand hygiene is one of the easiest and most important things that humans can do for themselves in their daily lives to reduce the risks of infection. Hands are especially important given that they are the last line of defence within the chain of transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens, either directly from hand to mouth or indirectly via the handling of food or water. Hands can also play a role in the transmission of respiratory tract infections where fingers turn out to be infected with breathing viruses, contamination can be transferred by way of rubbing the conjunctiva of the eyes or the nasal mucosa. The hands also can play a part in the transmission of skin, wound, eye and other infections.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref></p>
              <p>There is a clear causal link between hand hygiene and infection transmission. Hands are one of the most important mechanisms to transmit infection.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Evidence indicates that hands together with food contact or other environmental surfaces cause 60% of the spread of gastrointestinal infection. Contaminated hands could also cause up to 50% of respiratory tract infections.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Promotion of improved hand hygiene has been recognised as an important public health measure. Results from intervention studies show that handwashing reduces gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections up to 50%–60%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Handwashing education in the community reduces the number of people who get sick with diarrhoea by 23%–40%<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>; reduces diarrheal illness in people with weakened immune systems by 58%<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>; reduces respiratory illnesses, like colds, in the general population by 16%–21%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 9</xref> and reduces absenteeism due to gastrointestinal illness in schoolchildren by 29%–57%.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Microorganisms are removed from the hands by the mechanical action of rubbing and rinsing rather than killed by a special handwashing preparation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> The effectiveness of rubbing in the removal of microbes is determined by the degree to which microbes are bound to the surface of the skin. The use of soap greatly improves the elimination of bacteria on the hands compared with that accomplished by washing with water alone. In low-income societies in developing countries, soil or mud and ash are sometimes used as a zero-cost alternative to handwashing soap.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For instance, studies conducted in Bangladesh and India found that soil, ash and soap were all effective in removing faecal coliforms from hands.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> However, there is limited evidence on the effect of ash on microbial contamination of hands in Ethiopian context. This community-based clustered-randomised controlled trial is, therefore, designed to assess the effect of ash on microbial contamination of hands among mothers or caregivers of under-5 children in the rural settings of northwest Ethiopia.</p>

                <title>Research question and objectives</title>
                <p>Is handwashing with ash effective to reduce the burden of microorganisms on hands in northwest Ethiopia?</p>
                <p>Use of soap and other alcohol-based agents significantly increases the reduction of microbes on hands relative to that achieved by washing with water alone. As soap-based or alcohol-based agents are not usually available due to cost, ash is often used as a zero-cost alternative to soap for handwashing in the rural settings of developing countries.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, there is limited evidence on the effect of ash on microbial contamination of hands in Ethiopian context. This study is, therefore, designed to assess the effect of local handwashing agents, mainly ash on microbial contamination of hands among mothers or caregivers of under-5 children in the rural settings of northwest Ethiopia.</p>

                <p>This study was carried out in the rural settings of east Dembiya district. East Dembiya is one of the 13 woredas in central Gondar zone, the Amhara national regional state, Ethiopia. East Dembiya is bordered on the south by Lake Tana, on the west by west Dembiya, on the north by Lay Armachiho and on the east by Gondar Zuria and Gondar town. The district is subdivided into 28 rural and 4 urban kebeles (the lowest administrative unit).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The district health department report in July 2020 showed that the east Dembiya district had a total population of 210 761, of whom 192 020 (91%) and 18 741 (9%) were rural and urban residents, respectively. Of a total population in the district, 104 327 were men and 106 434 were women with 1:1 sex ratio.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Hygiene and sanitation-related communicable diseases were highly prevalent in the area. During June 2017, intestinal parasitic infections and diarrheal disease were the top four and five prevalent diseases, which accounted 5161 (9.97%) and 4981 (9.62%), respectively.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The population in the area had poor access to sanitation. During June 2017, clean water and latrine coverage in the district was 26.60% and 55%, respectively.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>

                <p>This trial will be implemented among mothers of under-5 children in east Dembiya district, northwest Ethiopia, where no similar interventions are not operating or planned in the intervention period. Participants will be recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: (a) presence of under-5 children in the household because we will link the results of this trial as a factor for another study titled exposure to enteric infection and environmental enteric dysfunction in under-5 children in northwest Ethiopia, (b) mothers or caregivers who are volunteer to be part of the experiment, (c) mothers or caregivers who are not using soap to wash hands and (d) geographical accessibility. Mothers or caregivers having acute or chronic nail or skin disorders/lesions, including dermal abrasion, trauma and infection, will be excluded.</p>

                <p>In this study, we will provide health education to both arms on effective handwashing procedures and local rubbing agents like ash to the intervention groups. The control arm will not use ash. Controls will be those mothers or caregivers who continue with their usual practice.</p>

                <p>Stata V.14 is used to calculate the number of clusters with the following assumptions: log<sub>10</sub> mean bacterial count before handwashing (right hand) with SD=3.17<italic toggle="yes">±</italic>0.71; log<sub>10</sub> mean bacterial count after handwashing (right hand) with SD=3.41<italic toggle="yes">±</italic>0.61<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; equal cluster size with average size (m)=20; intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.02 as recommended by Hayes and Bennett<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; 80% power; 95% CI with a 5% alpha level. With these assumptions, the number of clusters per arm becomes 10 and design effect (1 + (m −1) ICC) of 1.38. Assuming one extra cluster for loss of follow-up, the total cluster becomes 11 per arm. Therefore, a total of 220 mothers or caregivers will receive the intervention and 220 mothers or caregivers will be taken as control groups.</p>

                <p>The number of clusters will be selected based on simple random sampling method. Clusters will be defined by the presence of adequate households with under-5 children eligible for enrolment and geographical accessibility. We will conduct a pilot survey to determine the size of the clusters. As indicated in the sample size calculation section, the geographical area where we will get households with 20 under-5 children will be taken as a cluster. A buffer zone of a minimum of 15 min walking distance will be used before enrolling the next cluster, to minimise information contamination between enrolled clusters. Adjacent clusters will be defined to form a block and clusters will be randomly assigned to the study arms within the block. All households with under-5 children in the selected clusters and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria will enter into clustered-randomised controlled trial schemes.</p>

                <p>After providing health education on effective handwashing process, we will ask study subjects to do the usual activities. We will then take swab samples from the dominant hand before washing. After swabbing, participants will be then asked to wash their hands with water only and with ash by following effective handwashing procedures with instructions on length of time or thoroughness and will be informed to dry their hands in the air. We will again take swab samples from the dominant hand after washing and drying. In total, 880 swab samples will be collected and analysed for bacteria. Observational checklists will be used to observe sanitation condition of the living environment. The presence and type of domestic animals and their faeces will be also recorded. We will also check the microbial quality of the ash to check whether ash itself causes microbial contamination or not.</p>
