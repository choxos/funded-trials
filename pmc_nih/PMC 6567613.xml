                  <p id="Par1">In partnership with a state Medicaid home and community-based waiver program, this study tests implementation strategies for adoption and sustainability of an evidence-based intervention to support disabled and older adults who have difficulty with physical function and daily living tasks. A multi-level implementation strategy bundle will be directed at relationship, coalition, and team building; readiness to implement, leadership, and clinician attitude toward evidence assessments; intervention and facilitation training; interdisciplinary coordination; facilitation; and audit and feedback to support practice change.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Knowledge-to-Action model underpins this 2-arm, 3-year pragmatic mixed method randomized hybrid type III trial in 18 waiver program sites in Michigan. Data will be collected on sites, 775 clinicians (registered nurses, occupational therapists, social workers), and 15,000 disabled and older adults. Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guides examination of site, clinician, and beneficiary characteristics; clinician attitude and self-efficacy; leadership and readiness to implement; and intervention impact on beneficiary outcomes. Sites will be randomized to either usual waiver care with internal facilitation of the bundle of implementation strategies or usual waiver care with both internal and external facilitation of the bundle. Primary outcomes are site-level adoption and sustainability over 12 months, and intervention effects on these outcomes are hypothesized to be mediated by clinicians’ attitude and self-efficacy. At the beneficiary level, by addressing the individual’s capabilities and home environment, the intervention is hypothesized to improve secondary outcomes of activities of daily living, pain, depression, falls, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Baseline site readiness and leadership and stages of implementation at 6 months will be explored as potential moderators. Linear mixed effects models will be used to test intervention effects on primary outcomes, with bias-correcting analytic strategy in mediation analyses. Generalized linear mixed effects modeling will be employed for the analysis of intervention effects on secondary outcomes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">There are 962 million people aged 60 and older worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and 42% in the USA report problems with physical function, which can lead to difficulty with daily tasks and nursing home placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Interventions that optimize physical function to support aging-in-place are needed, particularly in settings that care for disabled and older adults. We propose to address this urgent need through the testing of an implementation strategy bundle on adoption and sustainability of an adapted intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that improves adults’ ability to conduct daily tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The implementation strategy bundle includes relationship, coalition, and team building; readiness to implement, leadership, and clinician attitude toward evidence assessments; intervention and facilitation training; interdisciplinary coordination; internal and external facilitation (IF, EF); and audit and feedback. Multi-level approaches are known to support incremental single strategy effects, as well as a synergistic effect from all the strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, we test two topics of import to the field of implementation science - adoption and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] - and explore mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to support uptake, while implementing a complex multi-component intervention in a disabled aging population. Real practice change and improved outcomes will not occur without adoption and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>

Evidence was created and efficacy established by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The intervention is a 16-week structured program delivered by occupational therapists (OTs) who conduct 6 home visits and provide assistive devices, RNs who conduct 4 home visits, and a handyman who provides home alterations (e.g., installs devices, environmental modifications, and home repair). The team provides consultation with older adults to help the individuals identify daily activity goals (e.g., taking a shower and walking to the bathroom), evaluates barriers to achieving those goals, and attains outcomes collaboratively. OTs assist older adults to carry out ADLs, IADLs, and discretionary activities that are challenging at home such as functional mobility, meal preparation, bathing, and dressing. RNs target underlying issues that influence ADLs and IADLs, such as pain reduction, improvement in mood, fall prevention, incontinence management, and medication review and management with the help of a pharmacist. In prior work, the intervention was adapted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] to fit the waiver setting and population: SWs were added to address social and emotional needs; the number, type, and timing of clinician visits were tailored to the beneficiary’s need; RNs were trained in medication management; and training and documentation modes were modified to fit the setting.</p>

                    <p id="Par67">Primary outcomes are implementation strategy impact on adoption and sustainability of the intervention. Stages of implementation completion will be derived via 3 SIC scores. First, the number of stages completed is a simple count of progression through stages; the score is the last stage in which at least one activity was performed. Second, time spent in each stage is calculated by taking the difference between the date of completion of the first activity in the stage and the date of completion of the last activity in the same stage. Skipped activities are not included. If a site skips the last activity in a stage and completes an activity in a subsequent stage, they automatically move to the subsequent stage. However, if they later complete the skipped activity, the duration score is adjusted for the original (earlier) stage to include the activity. Third, the date of completion of all stages is logged within stage 8. For sites that choose to discontinue implementation at any point in the process, the date is logged in the furthest stage that the site enters. In the case where data are summarized before the stage is complete but a site has not discontinued implementation, the site data are treated as being censored, just as it would in a standard time-to-event or survival analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Proportion of activities completed is calculated as the number of activities completed divided by the number of possible activities in each stage. Activities in each stage are ordered based on their logical progression up to the last activity the site completes in the stage or completion of the final activity in the stage. Achievement of either activity indicates completion of that stage. Secondary outcomes are intervention effects on beneficiary ADLs, IADLs, pain, depression, falls, ED visits, and hospitalizations.</p>

                  <title>Sample size and power calculation</title>
                  <p id="Par68">Site sample size was based on the number of available sites, with 9 randomized to each arm. Assuming correlation of 0.7 between pairs of 11 repeated measures, the adjusted effect size of 1.2 was detectable with power of 0.80 or greater in two-sided tests at 0.05 level of significance. The effect size is expressed as Cohen's d, difference between trail arm means in standard deviation units. If observed differences are smaller than 1.2 of the standard deviation, statistical significance will not be reached, then the estimate of the effect size will be obtained. For beneficiary outcomes, we assumed 750 beneficiaries per site and conservative intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01 to obtain the design effect factor of 8.49. In the comparison of the trial arms, the adjusted sample size is 795 per trial arm, which allows to detect effect size as small as 0.14. As larger effects were seen in the prior studies, a third of the standard deviation or larger is often used as a threshold for clinical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Small effects could be detected as statistically significant, and the study is powered to detect any meaningful differences between IF and IF + EF on beneficiary outcomes. The tests of mediation effects (aim 2) will have a greater power as further reduction in error variance will occur due to controlling for the mediator. Outcomes (aim 3) are benchmarked against a prior period and have no hypotheses; thus, power considerations are not applicable. Similarly, exploratory aims have no associated hypotheses.</p>

The number of beneficiaries and quality assessment scores will be used to block the 18 sites into a pair of similar attributes. A coin will be flipped to determine arm assignment of each pair.

                  <p id="Par71">After IRB approval, data use agreements will be obtained and contracts will be executed with the sites, the state, and the EHR company. To randomize, the sites’ number of beneficiaries and summed quality data scores (2015–2017) will be obtained from the state and the investigators will match site pairs and assign the trial arm. If the clinicians consent, characteristics, ILS, ORC, GSE, and EBPAS will be collected via survey (baseline). Waiver directors and investigator will select IFs. Clinicians, IFs, and EFs will be trained. The intervention will be provided to beneficiaries and documented in the EHR (12 months post-implementation). Monthly for 11 months following implementation, the SIC (via research assistant phone interview) and intervention fidelity checklist (via project manager chart audit) will be collected. Clinician EBPAS and GSE will be collected again via survey (9 months). We will obtain beneficiary assessment data prior to the intervention (last assessment before implementation), after the intervention (first assessment within 12 months post-implementation), and any assessments that occurred between the two time points after completion of implementation via a data use agreement. Analysis will occur and reports will be written.</p>

                  <p id="Par72">Research assistants will complete human subject training and orientation prior to collecting data or interacting with IFs. As part of orientation, a job description, which includes the role and responsibilities, will be reviewed and signed; a position manual, the manual of procedures, the data safety monitoring plan and board charter, the study protocol, the literature supporting project evidence and approach, and the quality assurance-monitoring plan will be reviewed. Research assistants will conduct dummy data collection until performed correctly, prior to data collection for the trial. Once trained, the research assistant will participate in team meetings and quality assurance activities and complete a weekly report of activities and/or issues that arise.</p>

                  <title>Analytic approach</title>
                  <p id="Par73">Preliminary analysis of the distributions of outcomes, mediators, and potential covariates will be assessed, outliers will be investigated by inspecting the residuals, and models described below will be fit with and without outliers to examine their influence on the results. Analyses will be implemented in SAS 9.4.</p>
                  <p id="Par74">Aim 1 primary outcomes (adoption and sustainability) will be analyzed using a linear mixed effects model with repeated measures (SIC and EHR 12-months; IF 9-months). Covariates will include trial arm, randomization variables, and time entered as a class variable to model potentially non-linear patterns. We will use a general linear model to analyze training fidelity. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard modeling will be employed to analyze time spent in each implementation stage. Tests of significance of the coefficient of the trial arm variable will yield the formal test of hypothesis for the effect of IF + EF compared to IF alone. Analysis of beneficiary outcomes will employ a generalized linear model with appropriately distributed errors and the random effect of site added to account for nesting of individuals within sites. For counts of falls and health service use, Poisson error distribution will be specified. Alternatively, a zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial model based on the distribution of the counts will be fit. Explanatory variables, including trial arm, will be evaluated as predictors of zero inflation (whether or not the count is zero) and as predictors of the magnitude of the count when it is not zero. Prior MDS will be used to obtain baseline data for each outcome, which will be included as a covariate to explain the variation in post-intervention outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par75">Aim 2 determines whether the effects of IF + EF compared to IF alone on adoption and sustainability are mediated by clinician attitude or self-efficacy at 9 months. The model fit will be at the clinician level with site as a random effect to account for nesting of clinicians within sites. To test for mediation, trial arm will be treated as the independent variable, with each potential mediator (one at a time) tested for their effect on the outcome. A bias-corrected bootstrapping analytic strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] will be used to estimate confidence intervals around the indirect effect of the trial arm on the outcome variable through the mediator. To establish mediation, the 95% confidence interval around the indirect must not include 0.</p>
                  <p id="Par76">Aim 3 benchmarks the effects of IF + EF compared to IF alone on beneficiary outcomes following implementation as compared to pre-intervention. Analysis will use 2 repeated measures of beneficiary outcomes, prior to and 12 months after the intervention. Time by trial arm interaction will be included. The least square means according to the interaction term will be output from this model, and differences from before and after the intervention will be evaluated for each arm to gauge the magnitude and meaning of improvements.</p>
                  <p id="Par77"><italic>Exploratory aims</italic>. Aim 4 compares potential mediators at 9 months and baseline leadership and readiness for sites with SIC (&gt; 50% to <underline>&lt;</underline> 50%) at 6 months by arm. General or generalized linear models (as appropriate based on outcome or potential mediator distribution) will include the binary indicator of whether SIC at 6 months (&gt; 50% or <underline>&lt;</underline> 50%) in interaction with the trial arm variable. Differences between least square means according to SIC level will be tested within each arm, and the effect sizes will be estimated. Aim 5 explores whether baseline site leadership and readiness moderate the impact of IF + EF compared to IF alone on primary and secondary outcomes within 12 months in order to determine which sites may require facilitation that is more intensive. A model similar to aim 1 will be modified to include trial arm by potential moderator interaction. Effect sizes that correspond to the interaction term will be estimated. Aim 6 evaluates clinician satisfaction at 1 month and the cost of implementation and policy impact for IF + EF compared to IF alone at 12 months. We will use descriptive statistics to summarize satisfaction with training and implementation cost. We will use qualitative thematic analysis to analyze the surveys. We will report on the policy in the state contract.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par78">This trial sets an ambitious agenda to explore ways to adopt and sustain evidence across a Medicaid program. There is a significant amount of work that presents challenges and opportunities. First, implementation and evaluation with a hybrid III design in an under-resourced real-world setting force a delicate balance of study design and voluntary participation. Our work with sites in a standardized manner encourages local adaptations to optimize implementation. Second, our selection of volunteer sites may limit heterogeneity in our sample. However, we expect to learn a great deal about stages of implementation to inform this project’s adoption and sustainability that may be generalizable to other settings or populations. Third, our measurement approach involves significant effort in data collection of sites, clinicians, and beneficiaries with surveys, interviews, and extraction of secondary administrative and clinical data across disparate clinician contexts. The challenges of data collection and management may be outweighed by the opportunity to generate a broader understanding in Medicaid settings to facilitate effective use of evidence in under-resourced, complex environments.</p>
