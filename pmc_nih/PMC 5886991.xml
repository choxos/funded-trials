                  <p id="Par2">HIV-infected children and adolescents have deficits in skeletal growth which include decreases in bone mass and alterations in bone microarchitecture. However, the mechanism by which HIV infection compromises bone accrual in children and adolescents is unclear. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationships between immune activation, bone turnover, and bone mass in a group of pre-pubertal HIV-infected children randomized to remain on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) or switch to efavirenz-based ART in South Africa virally suppressed at the time of this study.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">HIV-infected children and adolescents have deficits in skeletal growth which include decreases in bone mass accrual and alterations in bone microarchitecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We previously reported lower bone mineral content (BMC) in a group of South African HIV-infected children who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) early in life before 2–3 years of age and have had excellent virologic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In particular, among children remaining on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-based ART, we observe lower accrued bone mass compared to children switching to efavirenz-based ART. This disruption of bone accrual during critical periods of skeletal development can compromise adult peak bone mass and increase the risk of later life osteoporosis and fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">However, the mechanisms by which HIV infection compromises bone accrual in children and adolescents are not well defined. One hypothesized mechanism is that chronic immune activation associated with HIV infection, despite the use of ART, induces alterations in bone remodeling, i.e., increased bone resorption, decreased bone formation, or both, resulting in decreased bone acquisition during growth. In HIV-infected adults, higher serum levels of pro-resorptive cytokines and T cell activation markers are associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], suggestive of immune activation-mediated increased bone resorption. Due to the invasive nature of bone biopsy for performing histomorphometry, insights about mechanism are largely reliant on biochemical markers of bone turnover. In the few available studies of bone turnover markers in HIV-infected children, findings are inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the relationships between immune activation, bone turnover, and bone mass in a group of well-suppressed pre-pubertal HIV-infected children in urban South Africa randomized to remain on LPV/r-based ART or switch to efavirenz-based ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A better mechanistic understanding may assist development of effective interventions to optimize bone health during childhood.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p id="Par9">Of 219 HIV-infected and 219 HIV-uninfected children enrolled in the CHANGES Bone Study conducted at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], all 219 HIV-infected children and 180 (82.2%) of the HIV-uninfected children with available relevant measurements are included in this cross-sectional analysis of bone turnover and immune activation. The 219 HIV-infected children were previous participants in a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of preemptive switching to efavirenz compared with remaining on LPV/r [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

                <title>Measurements and procedures</title>
                <p id="Par10">At the study visit, demographic data were collected and all participants underwent physical examinations to obtain anthropometric measures and to assess pubertal development. For HIV-infected children, plasma HIV-RNA levels (lower limit of detection 40 copies/mL) were measured by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay (Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). CD4 counts and percentage were measured by the TruCount Method (BD Biosciences, Germany).</p>
                <p id="Par11">Additional plasma was stored at − 80 °C and shipped to the Biomarkers Core Laboratory, Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, NY, USA, where they were analyzed for bone turnover markers, including C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) (ELISA; Immunodiagnostic Systems, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) (RIA; Immunodiagnostic Systems, Scottsdale, AZ). Markers of immune activation were also analyzed, including pro-inflammatory, pro-resorptive cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) (ELISA; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and TNF-alpha (ELISA; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), as well as soluble CD14 (ELISA; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a marker of monocyte activation, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (Cobas Integra 400 Plus; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), an acute phase reactant and marker of general inflammation. In addition, plasma was analyzed for intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (RIA; Scantibodies Laboratory, Santee, CA, USA), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) (LCMS; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), creatinine (Cobas Integra 400 Plus; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and cystatin C (Cobas Integra 400 Plus; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Given limited reference values on markers of immune activation, renal function, and bone turnover for children, reference ranges provided by the Biomarkers Core Laboratory were utilized.</p>

The 219 HIV-infected children (49% male) and 180 HIV-uninfected children (55% male) were between 5 and 9 years of age (mean 6.7 years). One hundred thirteen HIV-infected children were previously randomized to remain on LPV/r and 106 were randomized to switch to efavirenz. Children were also receiving two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors including lamivudine and either abacavir, zidovudine, or stavudine. None had any past or current use of tenofovir and none was receiving corticosteroids or antiepileptic medications. The mean (SD) duration on treatment for HIV-infected children was 5.7 (1.1) years (range 2.8–8.7) and this visit occurred 1–4 years (mean 2.1 years) after randomization in the clinical trial.

              <p id="Par21">In this study of South African HIV-infected children on ART with mainly undetectable viral load on long-term effective ART, we found lower bone mass, limited evidence of immune activation, and lower measures of bone remodeling compared to HIV-uninfected children.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Though our bone turnover markers were lower in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected children, both groups fell within the range reported in other studies of bone turnover in children without HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our finding of less bone remodeling among HIV-infected children differs from results reported in older studies of HIV-infected children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These differences may be explained by varied study population characteristics with respect to level of viral suppression, duration and type of ART exposure, and differences in specific bone turnover markers assayed. We were unable to have the children fast for the blood measurement due to travel times to the study site and the age of the children. Mora et al. found that HIV-infected children and adolescents aged 6–17 years on ART, including indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir-based regimens, had higher bone formation (bone alkaline phosphatase, BALP) as well as higher bone resorption (N-telopeptide, NTX) than HIV-uninfected children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, Tan et al. reported higher bone formation, as measured by osteocalcin, in HIV-infected children on protease inhibitors ages 2 to 12 years, than HIV-uninfected controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast to these two studies in which children were receiving a variety of older protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir and nelfinavir) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., didanosine and stavudine), children in our study were initiated and suppressed early in life with currently recommended three-drug regimens. Over 90% of children in our study were virally suppressed, while only 40% of the participants in Tan et al. had HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at the time of study.</p>
              <p id="Par23">More recently, a European study of 54 HIV-infected children and adolescents aged 6–19 years reported that HIV-infected children had higher bone formation (BALP) than controls, possibly due to lower serum concentrations of sclerostin and Dkk1, inhibitors of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, a critical regulator of skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another study of adolescents aged 10–18 years in Thailand found increased bone turnover markers to be inversely associated with BMD <italic>Z-</italic>scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Differences in findings among publications may also be attributable to participant age and maturity, as well as variable time to ART initiation after HIV infection. For example, there was no age overlap between our study (5–9 years) and Sudjaritruk et al., and all but four HIV-infected children in our study were Tanner stage 1 whereas 73% of the population in Sudjaritruk et al. was Tanner stages 3–5. Of note, we observed low bone formation in a setting of no tenofovir use.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Also unexpected, we did not observe increased levels of pro-inflammatory pro-resorptive cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in our HIV-infected group. This may be due to ART initiation early in life and well-controlled virus for an extended period of time. In addition, the HIV-infected children had higher vitamin D than the HIV-uninfected children which is likely due to greater proportion of children with HIV receiving multivitamin supplements; vitamin D has recently been shown to attenuate immune activation in youth with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Aside from a weak negative association between IL-6 and P1NP, no evidence of immune activation-mediated increased bone resorption, as seen in other studies of children and adults, was seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Also observed were increased levels of soluble CD14, a marker of monocyte activation, in our HIV-infected group. Similarly, higher levels of plasma soluble CD14 at longitudinal time points following viral load suppression and normalization of CD8+ T cell activation have been reported in a study of HIV-infected children in Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In contrast to findings from a cross-sectional study of adolescents ages 14–25 years by Ruan et al., we did not observe a significant inverse correlation between soluble CD14 and our measures of bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Ruan et al. measured soluble CD14 and bone mass early in infection (2–3 years); although HIV-associated monocyte activation does not appear to be responsible for the decreased bone accrual we observe among HIV-infected children in our study, it may play a role closer to the time of infection or during periods of viremia. Persistent monocyte activation may be of great concern for HIV-infected children, since soluble CD14 has been proposed as an independent predictor of mortality as well as subsequent non-AIDS events (e.g., cardiovascular disease) in adults with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Of note, high-sensitivity CRP levels were elevated in 59.4% of the HIV-infected children and 43.3% of the HIV-uninfected children, possibly reflecting elevated levels of general inflammation in this setting.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Although we saw differences in bone mass between children remaining on LPV/r and children switched to efavirenz, bone turnover markers did not discriminate between the groups, and both treatment groups (i.e., LPV/r and efavirenz) had lower bone turnover markers compared to HIV-uninfected children. The null finding did not appear to be explained by growth velocity. As expected, we observed lower vitamin D levels in the children switched to efavirenz. Efavirenz has been implicated in induction of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), a cytochrome P450 enzyme that degrades 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D into an inactive form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The significance of this to bone metabolism is unclear given that iPTH concentrations were not elevated among those switched to efavirenz nor did they have lower BMC. Among the 19 HIV-infected children in the efavirenz group with low vitamin D (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> &lt; 20 ng/mL), iPTH ranged from 13 to 107 pg/mL, with a mean of 36.0 pg/mL, and few above 65 pg/mL.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Children remaining on LPV/r had higher levels of pro-inflammatory, pro-resorptive cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha compared to children switched to efavirenz. This may be a direct effect of lopinavir and ritonavir, which in ex vivo studies in macrophages induce IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression via ERK signaling pathways and unfolded protein response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, the relationship between markers of immune activation and bone turnover markers was not different between children on LPV/r and children on efavirenz. Furthermore, no relationship between the bone turnover markers and bone were identified. It is possible that the differences in bone mass between the treatment groups could have been related to differences in bone turnover that occurred close to the time of randomization that are no longer detectable. Future studies closer to the time of treatment switch may help clarify this.</p>
              <p id="Par27">ART initiation studies in adults suggest that the greatest declines in BMD occur around the time of ART initiation, likely due to a combination of direct ART effect and immune activation-mediated bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our findings suggest that in HIV-infected children with viral suppression on stable ART, decreases in BMD persist independent of immune activation and altered bone turnover. This study takes place well beyond the time of initial viral suppression and is limited by a single measurement of bone turnover markers and markers of immune activation, which vary throughout childhood lack established reference ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Longitudinal studies that include serial measures of immune activation, bone turnover, and BMD are necessary to fully appreciate the dynamics of immune activation and bone modeling and remodeling in growing children with HIV.</p>
