                  <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
                  <p>An artificial pancreas (AP) that automatically regulates blood glucose would
greatly improve the lives of individuals with diabetes. Such a device would
prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia along with associated long- and short-term
complications as well as ease some of the day-to-day burden of frequent
blood glucose measurements and insulin administration.</p>

                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>We conducted a pilot clinical trial evaluating an individualized, fully
automated AP using commercial devices. Two trials (<italic>n</italic> = 22,
<italic>n</italic><sub>subjects</sub> = 17) were conducted using a
multiparametric formulation of model predictive control and an
insulin-on-board algorithm such that the control algorithm, or
“brain,” can be embedded on a chip as part of a future mobile
device. The protocol evaluated the control algorithm for three main
challenges: <italic>1</italic>) normalizing glycemia from various initial
glucose levels, <italic>2</italic>) maintaining euglycemia, and
<italic>3</italic>) overcoming an unannounced meal of 30 ± 5 g
carbohydrates.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Initial glucose values ranged from 84–251 mg/dL. Blood glucose was
kept in the near-normal range (80–180 mg/dL) for an average of 70% of
the trial time. The low and high blood glucose indices were 0.34 and 5.1,
respectively.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>These encouraging short-term results reveal the ability of a control
algorithm tailored to an individual’s glucose characteristics to
successfully regulate glycemia, even when faced with unannounced meals or
initial hyperglycemia. To our knowledge, this represents the first truly
fully automated multiparametric model predictive control algorithm with
insulin-on-board that does not rely on user intervention to regulate blood
glucose in individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease that requires constant vigilance for successful
glucose control. Chronic elevation or fluctuations in blood glucose may result in a
number of long-term complications (blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and
lower-extremity amputations). Conversely, attempts to aggressively normalize glucose
concentrations increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia. Despite the introduction of
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps and programs that promote
intensive diabetes management, the glycosylated hemoglobin, an indicator of long-term
blood glucose control reported by major diabetes treatment centers, remains &gt;8%
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This value is well above the current
recommended goal of &lt;7% set forth by the American Diabetes Association or
&lt;6.5% recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Many factors contribute to this failure,
including the following: <italic>1</italic>) difficulties in correctly estimating the
amount of carbohydrates in a meal, <italic>2</italic>) missed meal boluses, and
<italic>3</italic>) fear of hypoglycemia that results in underinsulinization,
especially overnight. As long as diabetes treatment demands constant direct
intervention, the majority of individuals with diabetes will not meet the established
goals.</p>
            <p>An artificial pancreas (AP) that can control blood glucose without patient intervention
before meals or physical activity may be an intermediate solution until a cure for type
1 diabetes is discovered. By removing active patient participation from the loop, a
fully automated AP would allow individuals with type 1 diabetes to go about their
activities without the need to check their blood glucose, count carbohydrates, and take
insulin injections multiple times a day. The AP comprises three main components: a
continuous subcutaneous glucose monitor (CGM), a CSII, and a mathematical control
algorithm that processes data from the glucose sensor and implements insulin delivery.
In fact, initial studies of APs have demonstrated that subcutaneous sensors controlling
CSII pumps using a control algorithm can regulate blood glucose in subjects with type 1
diabetes in carefully controlled research settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
            <p>There are multiple challenges to optimizing this system, including the following:
<italic>1</italic>) the accuracy and precision of the CGM; <italic>2</italic>) time
lags in interstitial glucose measurements, especially when there are rapid changes in
the glucose concentrations; <italic>3</italic>) delays in the onset of insulin action
after a subcutaneous injection; and <italic>4</italic>) prolonged insulin action of
4–6 h following a subcutaneous injection. A subcutaneous-subcutaneous AP,
therefore, cannot fully mimic normal β-cell function, but initial studies
indicate that it would better maintain diabetes control than current open-loop
methods.</p>
            <p>Control algorithms, such as those used to determine insulin delivery, usually are
designed and tuned on the basis of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Models
can range from simple (rules describing whether an input increases or decreases the
output) to complex (sets of nonlinear partial differential equations detailing
physiology). These diverse modeling approaches consider trade-offs between ease of
design and implementation and quality of performance. In recent years, attempts were
made to design an AP system using various control algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) from a simple proportional-integral-derivative control
approach, as demonstrated by Steil et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>)
and Castle et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), to a fuzzy logic approach
aimed at imitating the decision-making process of a trained physician, as published by
Atlas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, the control approach
that seems to be most advantageous and has been widely used in recent years is model
predictive control (MPC), which Parker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) first published for glucose control. The advantage of an MPC strategy is its
ability to incorporate an explicit model of the glucose-insulin system. The controller
compares the model-predicted output with the actual output (glucose concentration),
calculates the next manipulated input value (insulin delivery), and updates the
prediction with new measurements at each control cycle.</p>
            <p>Recent publications have demonstrated the use of MPC to manage blood glucose in
single-hormone closed-loop trials of up to 24 h, with encouraging results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Other studies have used a dual-hormone approach to mimic normal physiology
and reduce the likelihood of postprandial hypoglycemia because of excessive insulin
administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, none of these studies presented a design that had both control
and safety algorithms and could operate as an autonomous system. Either a manual glucose
reading from the CGM, manual administration of insulin by the study personnel, or both
was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), or a three-pump system with
manual venous blood glucose input was implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Atlas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) contributed an AP
design that relied on the subject’s clinical parameters and medical
recommendation but lacked a safety module to prevent overdosing of insulin. Insulin was
delivered without human intervention in Atlas et al.; specifically, they used the
Artificial Pancreas System (APS) to facilitate communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The need for both a systematic design of the AP and the
inclusion of more than one algorithm to provide safe, effective glycemic control has
been recognized by Kovatchev et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The AP
that was clinically evaluated in the studies presented here was the first fully
automated AP to integrate both a multiparametric MPC (mpMPC) algorithm that can be
easily embedded in a chip and a safety layer that prevents overdelivery of insulin. The
objective of the present study was to demonstrate the feasibility of a system that would
not require user input for meals and would be based solely on insulin delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p>

              <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
              <p>The studies were designed as pilot prospective trials to evaluate a fully automated
design of an AP based on an mpMPC with insulin-on-board (mpMPC-IOB) control
algorithm. The study was exploratory, allowing subjects to come into the trial in
real-life settings without excessive control beforehand. This allowed the controller
to be challenged with a variety of likely starting points. Flexibility during
initialization of closed-loop control will be a critical element in future
commercial devices. Seventeen subjects with type 1 diabetes were recruited for the
study: 7 from The National Center for Childhood Diabetes of Schneider
Children’s Medical Center of Israel (SCMC) and 10 from the Sansum Diabetes
Research Institute (SDRI). Twenty-two in-clinic closed-loop trials were conducted at
SCMC and SDRI. Four studies from SCMC were excluded because of hardware failure or
lack of reference blood glucose data. Fifteen subjects (7 males and 8 females) with
type 1 diabetes for 8–18 years participated in the remaining 18 studies: 10
subjects at SDRI and 3 at SCMC were in a single study, and 2 at SCMC were in
multiple studies. Detailed results of each study are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, including demographic information and
clinical characteristics. The average duration of the 18 studies was 6.3 h (range
3.4–8.3 h). The study was approved by the SCMC ethics committee for the SCMC
studies and by both the Food and Drug Administration (through an investigational
device exemption [#G090129]) and the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital’s
Institutional Review Board for the SDRI studies. All subjects listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> signed an institutional review
board-approved informed consent form; the subject’s height and weight as well
as demographic data, diabetes history, and other significant medical history were
recorded. Inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 18 (SCMC) and 21 (SDRI) years,
disease duration of at least 1 year, and treatment with an insulin pump for at least
6 months. Patients with a concomitant disease affecting metabolic control or who had
participated in another study for drugs that could affect glucose measurements or

                <p>The MPC algorithm used for the clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) incorporated an explicit model of human type 1 diabetes
glucose-insulin dynamics. MPC is a receding horizon control strategy in which an
optimization is performed at each time step. If the optimization problem
includes constraints, an iterative solver must be used to find the optimal
solution. Multiparametric programming allowed for the reformulation of the MPC
problem into an explicit form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) where a single set of optimizations can
be performed a priori. The resulting control law was implemented in the form of
a look-up table, with each entry valid for a region in the state-space
representing the current state of the system. Each entry corresponded to a
simple function that evaluated the state vector and calculated the optimal
insulin delivery rate. The single degree of freedom for controller tuning was
the ratio of the tracking error to the control move, which was set to 0.1 for
all subjects. Software constraints ensured that insulin delivery rates were
bound between 0 and 72 U/h. At each time step, glucose prediction for the next
36 steps and the insulin infusion rates for the next 6 time steps were
calculated. Then, the insulin infusion for the current time step was
implemented. At the next time step, on the basis of the new measured glucose
value and the last insulin rate, the process was repeated. An IOB safety
constraint presented by Ellingsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was implemented as an upper limit on the insulin delivery rate
to prevent insulin stacking. This maximum insulin delivery rate was calculated
on the basis of nonlinear IOB decay curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and the subject’s correction factor (CF).</p>
                <p>Before the closed-loop trial was initiated, the look-up table for the control law
was developed in several stages. The subject first underwent open-loop
monitoring for 3 consecutive days before the closed-loop session, during which
CGM measurements, insulin delivery rates, blood glucose, physical activity, and
carbohydrate consumption were recorded. The data and corresponding insulin
profiles from the patient’s insulin pump were used as a basis for
developing individual models for the closed-loop controller. These models were
then evaluated based on physiological knowledge of acceptable parameter ranges.
The best model was chosen based on root-mean-square error analysis of
independent validation data. This model was used in the mpMPC algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>

              <p>One of the main challenges of the closed-loop design of an AP is to maintain glycemia
in the near-normal range (80–180 mg/dL) when faced with unannounced meals and
without significant hypo- or hyperglycemia. Traditionally, the analysis of results
is mainly based on reference blood glucose (e.g., YSI) to review the clinical
application and performance of closed-loop control. However, one should also review
and analyze CGM results to obtain a better understanding of closed-loop control
performance that can be achieved with current CGMs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the average and absolute maximum and minimum cumulative

&lt; 0.05) that closed-loop control minimized hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dL),
improved the time in the near-normal range (140–180 mg/dL), and reduced the
time in severe hyperglycemia (&gt;250 mg/dL), even though the sedentary
inpatient conditions limited insulin utilization. It should be noted that meal sizes
in the outpatient setting were similar to the inpatient setting, with 81 and 70% of
the outpatient meals &lt;50 and &lt;40 g carbohydrates, respectively.
Comparing CGM to YSI results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2<italic>C</italic></xref>, the time in the 80–250 mg/dL range was
almost identical, whereas in the low and high ranges, CGM values were not in
absolute agreement with the reference results (mean and median absolute relative
deviations 13.3 and 9.9%, respectively). Overall, although no statistical
significance can be derived from this comparison, the results suggest that current
CGM technology can be used for a fully automated AP when a safety algorithm such as
IOB is used to prevent overdelivery of insulin. The controller maintained glycemia
in the safe range (80–180 mg/dL) for an average 68 and 70% of the time under
closed-loop control according to the CGM and YSI data, respectively. No hypoglycemia
episodes were reported by YSI, and glucose levels of &lt;70 mg/dL were reported
only 2% of the time by CGM. Moderate postprandial hyperglycemia was reported by YSI
in only two trials, with postprandial peaks of 251 and 263 mg/dL.</p>

results of all closed-loop trials were in the A and B zones as measured by YSI,
which suggest excellent control. It is important to indicate that these results
represent the entire duration of the trial, including initial and postprandial
glucose levels. As can be noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>,
in three trials, the results of the CVGA based on CGM measurement were in the lower

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>We have demonstrated in this short-term pilot evaluation that a fully automated AP
device based on personalized MPC with safety components is capable of controlling
glycemia by delivering only insulin without postprandial hypoglycemia. Good glucose
control with 70% of the time in the near-normal range (80–180 mg/dL) was
demonstrated in the face of daily challenges, such as starting closed-loop control
at different glucose values, overcoming small unannounced meals, and hyperglycemia
in addition to the constraint of maintaining glucose control in the near-normal
range. Although the duration of the trials after meals was relatively short
(∼2 h), no subsequent hypoglycemia was observed, as can be seen in the
insulin and glucose tracings in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0948/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs. 1–18</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Two cases (5 and 11) had a negative rate of fall as measured by
the CGM at the end of the study, suggesting an impending trend toward hypoglycemia.
The risk of late (poststudy protocol) hypoglycemia could not be completely avoided
but was addressed by the protocol, which required the subject to eat a snack and
exhibit glucose values ≥90 mg/dL before release followed by a callback on the
next day. In all cases, no significant hypoglycemia episodes were reported during
the callback. Meal corrections were given by the controller based on the glycemic
state, with postprandial delivery equaling 0.2–1.4 times the insulin expected
if using conventional therapy, although it is recognized that CFs and
insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios are only estimates and may result in either under- or
overdelivery. Subcutaneous insulin delivery was based on interstitial glucose
information; the controller was constrained as needed from excessive delivery of
insulin, as demonstrated by the insulin delivery and dynamic IOB constraint results
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic> and
<italic>B</italic></xref>. Such a combination may be an effective trade-off
in control design in that elevated glucose levels are treated aggressively while
safety is maintained. Ideal glycemic control after unannounced, high carbohydrate
meals is not feasible with the current delays associated with subcutaneously
delivered insulin.</p>
              <p>The model for the control algorithm was developed using ambulatory data only. The
control law was evaluated off line for all possible scenarios, thus minimizing
on-line computation. Tuning was based on “trust” in the model, and as
a result, the closed-loop trials often were at the limit of the IOB safety
constraint. The IOB safety constraint was “tuned” using the
subject’s CF; hence, it is conceivable that future trials could tune the
controller on the basis of the CF only. In the future, the AP controller will be
updated as part of modifying insulin therapy during physician visits, using pump,
sensor, and food diary data.</p>
              <p>Closed-loop control transformed glucose variability to insulin variability as
indicated in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1<italic>A</italic></xref>, where the controller overcame the small
unannounced meal without overdelivery of insulin as a result of the dynamic IOB
constraint. The nature of intersubject variability in type 1 diabetes is
demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, where
the closed loop started when the subject was in the hyperglycemia zone. The
combination of mpMPC and IOB allowed the controller to facilitate recovery from
hyperglycemia while restricting subsequent delivery of basal insulin without
overdelivering. The AP managed to safely overcome this challenge as well as the
unannounced meal with excellent glucose control. For this subject, 85.7% of the time
was spent within 80–180 mg/dL (as measured by YSI).</p>
              <p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, the
closed-loop cumulative glucose plot is narrow between 80 and 180 mg/dL where the
outpatient CGM region spreads between 70 and 400 mg/dL. Although we acknowledge that
the inpatient and outpatient conditions were not identical, the feasibility of the
AP device to overcome the challenges set forth in the study was illustrated by the
improvement of glucose control in inpatient versus outpatient settings. In addition,
inpatient meals were largely of comparable size to outpatient meal records, and the
sedentary nature of the inpatient setting presented more of a challenge in
overcoming unannounced meals than in the ambulatory outpatient setting. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>, the average cumulative
glucose tracing is almost identical, with a narrower spread in the YSI tracing than
in the CGM tracing.</p>
              <p>We have demonstrated a systematic design of the AP that meets the predefined
requirements of full automation, safe regulation of glycemia without any human
intervention, use of insulin only, and ability to be incorporated into a future
portable device. The design of a future AP needs to follow a top-down approach that
addresses control challenges as part of the system layout. Such a system needs to
address issues with CGM accuracy and signal interferences to overcome sluggish
insulin kinetics and control for physical activity. These challenges are currently
