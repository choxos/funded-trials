              <p id="P2">Focal radiation therapy (RT) enhances systemic responses to anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in pre-clinical studies and in some melanoma patients<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, but its efficacy in inducing systemic responses (abscopal responses) against tumors unresponsive to CTLA-4 blockade remained uncertain. RT promotes the activation of anti-tumor T cells, an effect dependent on type I interferon induction in the irradiated tumor<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The latter is essential for achieving abscopal responses in murine cancers<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The mechanisms underlying abscopal responses in patients treated with RT and CTLA-4 blockade remain unclear. Here we report that RT and CTLA-4 blockade induced systemic anti-tumor T cells in chemo-refractory metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where anti-CTLA-4 antibodies had failed to demonstrate significant efficacy alone or in combination with chemotherapy<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Objective responses were observed in 18% of enrolled patients, and 31% had disease control. Increased serum interferon-β after radiation and early dynamic changes of blood T cell clones were the strongest response predictors, confirming pre-clinical mechanistic data. Functional analysis in one responding patient showed the rapid in vivo expansion of CD8 T cells recognizing a neoantigen encoded in a gene upregulated by radiation, supporting the hypothesis that one explanation for the abscopal response is radiation-induced exposure of immunogenic mutations to the immune system.</p>
              <p id="P3">The choice of NSCLC for testing the combination of RT with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, was supported by a case of a complete and durable abscopal response to this combination, in a patient with metastatic NSCLC<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To prospectively evaluate RT to one metastasis (palliative dose, 6GyX5 or 9GyX3) and concurrent ipilimumab thirty-nine patients were enrolled between June 2014 and April 2015 (NCT02221739, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>
<bold>and</bold>
<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). All patients had progressed after ≥1 prior systemic treatment, and 41% had pre-existing brain metastases controlled by surgery or radiotherapy at study entry. One patient had received prior immunotherapy.</p>
              <p id="P4">Twenty-one of 39 patients (54%) completed 4 cycles of ipilimumab and could be evaluated at day 88 by Response Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Adverse events were consistent with ipilimumab-induced side effects, and the addition of RT did not modify them (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). One additional patient received four cycles but did not undergo response evaluation. Seventeen patients received less than 4 cycles because they either died (n=8) or progressed (n=9) before day 88 and were taken off treatment. Patients who did not complete treatment had a more advanced disease at study entry, with significantly more organs involved by metastasis, more frequently had bone metastases and had received more courses of prior chemotherapy (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

              <p id="P6">To investigate the mechanisms underlying an abscopal response to RT and ipilimumab tumor tissue and peripheral blood were analyzed. PD-L1 expression in pre-treatment tumor was not associated with response, as it was detected in 6/10 non-responders, including 3 patients with progressive disease at evaluation (PD) and 3 non-evaluable patients (NE) who did not complete treatment, and in 4/5 patients with disease control out of the 15 patients with tissue available for testing. Likewise, CD8 T cell infiltration was not associated with response (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

However, the proportion of patients with EGFR mutated cancers, a feature associated with low total mutation burden<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and poor response to anti-PD-1/PDL-1<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> was significantly higher in patients with PD compared to patients with disease control (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Neither the radiation regimen used (9GyX3 versus 6GyX5) nor the location of the irradiated lesion was significantly associated with treatment response.</p>
              <p id="P8">A panel of circulating soluble markers and immune cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>) was analyzed in the 21 patients who completed treatment and were evaluable for response. At baseline, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was lower and regulatory T cells (T<sub>REG</sub>) were higher in responding compared to SD and PD patients. ICOS expression was also higher in responders in both regulatory and conventional CD4 T cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>

<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset 2</xref>). Changes in circulating soluble markers and immune cells occurring during treatment were evaluated by comparing values obtained at day 22 versus baseline. We also calculated the largest change from baseline in either direction (increase or decrease) in every parameter over the entire course of treatment, to account for different kinetics of change among patients (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>). During treatment, most patients showed an increase in ICOS expression on CD4 T cells and in proliferation of CD8 and CD4 T cells, evidenced by Ki67 expression, irrespective of response. Thus, two known pharmacodynamic biomarkers for anti-CTLA-4 activity<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> did not distinguish responders from non-responders in this study. Expansion in ICOS<sup>+</sup> T<sub>REG</sub> in melanoma patients treated with interleukin-2 was associated with worse outcome<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> but in our patients this subset was similarly expanded in responders and non-responders, suggesting a possible role in mitigating ipilimumab-induced inflammation rather than anti-tumor responses. In contrast to a reported melanoma patient<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, no significant changes in myeloid-derived suppressor cells were detected after RT in NSCLC patients. The percentage of PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells was increased during treatment in both responders and non-responders, whereas only responders showed a significant increase of PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. Approximately 20% of PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells were Ki67<sup>+</sup> in both responders and non-responders, suggesting an activated rather than exhausted state (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).

              <p id="P10">Elevated serum levels of soluble major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related protein A (sMICA) at baseline were associated with resistance to CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma patients<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In our patients baseline levels of sMICA did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders. During treatment, sMICA levels increased significantly in patients with PD while responding patients showed an increase in antibodies against sMICA and sMICB (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>
<bold>and</bold>
<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). These antibodies were shown to block sMICA/B-mediated downregulation of NKG2D receptor on effector CD8 T and natural killer (NK) cells, and restore tumor response to ipilimumab in some patients<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. An increase in NKG2D receptor expression was seen across all NK subsets only in patients with SD (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>), and thus it could not be attributed to increased anti-sMICA/B antibodies seen only in patients with CR/PR. Anti-MICA/B antibodies could have different functions, including blocking MICA/B shedding from tumor cell surface<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. RT-induced upregulation of surface MICA/B was shown to improve cancer cell killing by NK and CD8 T cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, but no post-treatment tumor tissue was available to investigate this hypothesis.</p>
              <p id="P11">Concordant with studies in mice<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, we found that RT induction of interferon-β (IFNβ) correlates with the abscopal response in this patient population. Serum IFNβ showed the most significant increase from baseline shortly after completion of RT (day 22) in the 7 responders (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>). IFNβ was also significantly but more modestly increased in the 5 patients with SD, whereas no significant increase occurred in the remaining 23 patients with PD and serum available for measurement, including those who did not complete treatment with ipilimumab.</p>
              <p id="P12">Next, we evaluated T cell clonal representation in peripheral blood with deep sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 regions (TCR-seq). A significantly larger number of T cell clones were expanded at day 22 compared to baseline in responders than in patients with SD and PD (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Responders also showed a significantly larger number of contracted clones (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). In a random Forest (RF) analysis the levels of IFNβ at day 22 and the TCR repertoire changes showed the highest predictive value (compared to other variables that were significantly altered at day 22) in classifying correctly the patients by response status: 7/7 responders, 6/8 patients with PD and 2/5 patients with SD were correctly assigned, and no patient with PD was classified as responder (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P13">We next assessed the tumor specificity of the T cell clones that were expanded in the blood early after RT completion. For this, we performed TCR-seq on archival tumors from four patients representative of different response status: 1 CR (subject #4), 1 with SD (#32), and 2 with PD (#36 and #38). TCR sequences obtained from tumors were designated as TIL-TCRs and compared to the sequences in blood. In each of the four patients there were TIL-TCRs whose frequency increased from baseline over the course of treatment, but their number was markedly larger in the patient with CR (#4) compared to the others (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Twenty of the clones present in patient #4 tumor were undetectable in the blood at baseline but showed a rapid increase during treatment and most remained elevated at follow-up. Patient #32, who had SD, showed expansion of a smaller number of clones already present at baseline that remained elevated at follow-up. In marked contrast, in the blood of patients #36 and 38, who had PD, there was an expansion of few pre-existing clones, and their increase was minimal and/or not sustained.</p>
              <p id="P14">We next asked if the number of TIL-TCRs expanded by treatment in blood was proportional to the number of pre-existing tumor-infiltrated CD8 T cells. The highest density of CD8 T cells was found in patient #36, who also showed the highest TCR clonality, while patient #32 had very few CD8 T cells, and patients #4 and #38 had an intermediate number (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Hence, the quantity and quality of the pre-treatment T cell infiltrate was not related to the treatment-induced expansion of TIL-TCRs in peripheral blood (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P15">We then examined the TCR CDR3 amino acid sequences relatedness<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> of the clones present in the two pre-treatment brain metastases of patient #4. Out of 51 TIL-TCRs increased in blood (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) 19 were common to both metastases and were found in multiple branches of the dendrogram, consistent with the expansion of a diverse repertoire. The largest TIL-TCR that was increased in blood had distinct features as it was found in a separate branch in each tumor (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Thus, the combination of RT and CTLA-4 blockade expanded a selected and diverse set of TCR clones.</p>
              <p id="P16">In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab and in NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies the mutational landscape is an independent determinant of response<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Thus, we assessed the number of antigenic mutations in the tumors of the 4 patients with different response to RT and ipilimumab. The number of single nucleotide missense variants (SNV) in patients #4, 32, 36 and 38 ranged from 199 to 345, and frameshift mutations from 11 to 22 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The lowest number of predicted mutation-associated neoantigens was found in patients #4 (CR) and #38 (PD). There were no significant differences between the four patients in the MHC-I binding affinity, variant allele frequency, or the wild type/mutant ratio of peptide MHC-I binding affinity of the predicted neoepitopes. Expression levels of the genes encoding the predicted neoepitopes, based on the lung adenocarcinoma TCGA data, did not differ among the 4 patients. None of the tumors had mutated <italic>TAP</italic> or <italic>B2M</italic> genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 4</xref>), which are required for antigen presentation and are often mutated in immunotherapy-resistant tumors<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. However, loss of heterozygosity at HLA-A and -C loci was found in patient #4 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Finally, no somatic mutations were identified in major genes of the interferon-γ pathway (<italic>JAK1/2</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic>, <italic>IFNGR1/2</italic>) in any of the 4 patients (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 4</xref>). Thus, known mechanisms of primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors could not explain the lack of response in patients #36 and #38.</p>
              <p id="P17">Although we did not find the global tumor mutation rates to correlate with response, we speculated that new tumor-specific T cell clones might be detected in patients who responded best to the combination of RT and anti-CTLA-4. To test this notion, we first tested the post-treatment peripheral blood of patient #4 for reactivity against the 33 top candidate neoepitopes identified using a neoantigen prediction pipeline (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Eight candidates were selected upon initial screening and two peptides (p15 and p16) were confirmed to be recognized by the patient’s CD8 T cells by ELISpot assay (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 b-d</xref>). Both peptides contain the same mutation but p15 was predicted to bind to HLA-A2402, while p16 was predicted to bind to HLA-C1203, the two alleles expressed by the tumor at the HLA-A and -C loci (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). While the mutation did not alter the predicted binding affinity of the peptides to the respective HLA alleles, the wild-type peptides did not elicit a response in ELISpot assay, indicating T cell specificity for the mutated peptides (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). We next interrogated the in vitro expanded T cells against these two peptides by TCR-seq. One clone from p15-reactive CD8 T cells and one clone from p16-reactive CD8 T cells were identified in the blood of patient #4 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). The clone reactive towards p16 was present in both pre-treatment metastases and its frequency in the blood went from barely detectable at baseline to markedly expand at day 22 remaining elevated at day 43 and at subsequent follow up more than 6 months later (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P18">We were intrigued by the robust CD8 T cell response in patient #4 and probed the biology of the protein from which the antigen was derived. The mutation recognized by the expanded clones derives from the protein, karyopherin α2 (KPNA2, also known as importin-α). Previous work has shown that KPNA2 is upregulated by RT in human colorectal cancer cells in vitro<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. To evaluate whether in vivo RT might increase expression of KPNA2 in NSCLC we implanted a patient-derived tumor into mice, then exposed these tumors to one or three fractions of 8 Gy (the latter a regimen similar to the one used in patients). We found that tumor-derived <italic>KPNA2</italic> gene expression was markedly upregulated at 24 hours (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P19">Collectively these results demonstrate that RT in combination with CTLA-4 blockade induces systemic tumor responses in NSCLC patients. The early changes in TCR clonal dynamic seen in responders are consistent with a diversification and expansion of the tumor-directed TCR repertoire induced by RT, as previously reported by us and others in pre-clinical tumor, models<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In depth analysis in representative patients suggests that expansion of a large number of tumor-specific T cell clones in peripheral blood, and their persistence over time correlate well with achievement of abscopal responses.</p>
              <p id="P20">Ipilimumab was similarly effective at activating the peripheral T cell compartment in responding and non-responding patients, while only responders showed a significant induction of IFNβ. Thus, the different outcome might reflect RT ability to elicit the activation of a response in the tumor that mimics a viral infection. This interpretation is consistent with pre-clinical data demonstrating the requirement for RT-mediated induction of IFNβ via the cGAS/STING pathway for the activation of anti-tumor T cells<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The contribution of the cancer cells themselves to the production of IFNβ was also shown to be essential to achieve abscopal responses in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Patients with PD in this study show an impaired RT-induction of IFNβ. While no mutations in cGAS and STING or other components of type I IFN signaling were found in patients #36 and #38, epigenetic downregulation of these genes, as recently shown in several tumors including lung cancer<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, cannot be excluded. Although we did not have viable tumor tissue to test this hypothesis, it is possible that in some tumors the RT dose threshold for the induction of the exonuclease TREX1, which controls RT ability to induce the activation of cGAS by cytosolic DNA, is lower, explaining the failure to activate type I IFN<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P21">Our most intriguing result was the identification of two T cell clones that are markedly expanded in the periphery or induced <italic>de novo</italic> in one patient with CR. Both clones recognize a mutation that was present in two separate brain metastases removed surgically before the patient entered the trial. The mutation-generated epitope is encoded in a gene, <italic>KPNA2</italic>, that is upregulated by RT. Linking all of our findings, it appears that, RT exposes immunogenic mutations by enhancing their expression in the tumor, followed by antigen cross-presentation and T cell activation inducing IFNβ. Although to date, our complete analysis has been restricted to a single patient, we believe that these results may represent a paradigm underling the synergy of RT and CTLA-4 blockade resulting in the induction of a robust anti-tumor T cell response.</p>

The radiotherapy regimen consisted of 6 Gy X 5 daily fractions in Phase I of the study, and 9.5 Gy X 3 in Phase II. Radiation was delivered by external beam with linear accelerator with image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques.</p>
                <p id="P30">All patients received intravenous Ipilimumab after the first radiation treatment, at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Ipilimumab was repeated every three weeks for four cycles, unless disease progression or death, unacceptable toxicity or patient decision to withdraw participation from the study. With the exception of radiation-associated mucositis and/or skin toxicity, the protocol required return to baseline of all grade 3–4 toxicities prior to the start of the next immunotherapy treatment. Dose modification for hematologic or gastro-intestinal toxicity were based on the worst toxicity observed during the prior dose. Specifically for &gt; Grade 3 diarrhea, immunotherapy was held until recovered to &lt; Grade 1.

                <p id="P31">Assessment of response by PET/CT occurred at day 88 from first dose of Ipilimumab. Patients were evaluated for abscopal responses (tumor regression of non-irradiated lesions) with baseline and post-treatment (day 88) PET/CTs. Assessment excluded the irradiated site, both in baseline measurement and at day 88. Metastases were measured on axial CTs in 2 perpendicular dimensions, per protocol, following irRC. Specifically, the products of the measurements (length x width) in all measurable lesions outside the radiation field were summed at baseline and compared to the sum of the measurements of the same lesions and potential new lesions post-treatment. The difference represented the abscopal response. Abscopal responses were assessed by PET/CT at day 88 and reported as: CR – complete resolution, PR – decrease in size ≥50% (irRC) or ≥30% (RECIST), PD – increase in size ≥25% (irRC) or <underline>&gt;</underline>20% or the appearance of new lesions (RECIST), and SD – insufficient shrinkage or growth to qualify for PR/CR or PD.

Staining was performed on a Ventana Medical Systems Discovery XT instrument with online deparaffinization and using Ventana’s reagents and detection kits. PDL1 was antigen retrieved in Ventana Cell Conditioner 1 (Tris-Borate-EDTA) for 20 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 4 minutes. PDL1 was diluted 1:50 in phosphate buffered saline and incubated for 60 minutes at 37C. Primary antibody was detected with hapten linked, anti-rabbit multimer incubated for 20 minutes followed by anti-hapten horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 20 minutes. The complex was visualized with 3,3 diaminobenzidene and enhanced with copper sulfate. A tissue microarray containing placental tissue was used as positive control.

Amplification and sequencing of TCRB CDR3 regions was performed at Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA) using their developed ImmunoSEQ platform<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. The TCRB CDR3 regions in the sequencing reads were defined according to the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) collaboration. A standard algorithm was used to identify which V, D and J segments contributed to each TCRB CDR3 sequence<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and only in-frame TCR rearrangements were included in the analysis. For all samples, a standardized amount of DNA was used to amplify and sequence TCRB CDR3 regions.

Statistical significance within and between groups was determined using a two-sided t-test (paired comparisons for within group analysis and assuming unequal variance for between group analysis). Secondly, we performed an in-depth analysis of the TIL TCR dynamics for patients 4, 32, 36, and 38, for which we were able to perform TCR sequencing on pre-treatment tumor tissue. Clones with statistically significant expansion in PBMC from baseline during treatment were determined and classified as TILs if also present in ≥ 1 tumor biopsy (patient 4 had two tumor tissue samples available).
