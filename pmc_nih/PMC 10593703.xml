                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The Prime Time Sister CirclesÂ®, a randomized controlled trial (PTSC-RCT), assessed the impact of a community-based peer support program on hypertension management among African American women 40â75Â years of age. While the PTSC-RCT was designed to evaluate changes in blood pressure control, subsequent sub-analyses revealed a high proportion of self-reported depressive symptoms in our sample. Accordingly, we conducted an ancillary investigation of the PTSC intervention on depression to ascertain its impact on reduced depressive symptoms in the study population.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Depressive symptoms were measured using an adapted version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CES-D-10). We used unadjusted and adjusted fixed effect models. Data for this study came from the PTSC-RCT. We collected data between 2017 and 2018 in Washington, DC. We used a balanced analytical sample of 172 African American, English-speaking women between 40 to 75Â years old with uncontrolled hypertension.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The intervention group participated in a 2-h, peer-based support group once a week for 13Â weeks. A trained PTSC facilitator facilitated sessions with experts who delivered content on various topics, including psychosocial wellness (e.g., stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety management, and self-esteem), physical health (e.g., hypertension, inflammation, and heart disease), physical activity, and healthy nutrition.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Results from the fixed-effects models indicated that participants in the PTSC program exhibited a greater reduction in CES-D-10 score at three months (Coeff: -1.99, 95% CI: -3.49, -0.49) and at 15Â months (Coeff: -2.38, 95% CI: -3.94, -0.83), as compared to those in the control group.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par5">Evidence suggests that the Prime Time Sister CirclesÂ® intervention reduced depressive symptoms among African American women with low socioeconomic status and hypertension.</p>

              <p id="Par7">Approximately 18.5% of adults aged 18 and over have reported experiencing any symptoms of depression in 2019,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> with higher prevalence observed among low-income African American (AA) women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Several factors have been proposed as contributors to this phenomenon, including residence in environments with higher poverty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> lower access to healthy foods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> lower access to mental health providers due to lack of health insurance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> higher prevalence of comorbidities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and a lower rate of social supports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> The promotion and adherence to cultural beliefs such as the âstrong Black womanâ trope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> may limit some AA womenâs emotional capacity to employ healthy coping strategies that are supportive of their mental health, including seeking care for psychological issues or availing themselves of support from members of their social networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> AA women are more likely than women of other races to face a unique constellation of stressors that can create and sustain depressive symptoms; these stressors include racism, sexism, poverty, and discrimination. AA women's depressive symptoms often differ from White women's, including increased appetite and weight, irritability and persistent physical symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the mental health of African Americans at large confers urgency to this pressing issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par8">Older AA women have higher rates of depressive symptoms than their White peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> The association between depressive symptomology and the occurrence of other health conditions is well established: Germain reports that AA women with high depressive symptoms have higher prevalence of functional impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Other studies have reported the co-occurrence of depression and poor cardiovascular health among AA women. Burroughs et al. (2019) reported that AA women were more likely to have high Cumulative Psychosocial Stress (CPS) scores (172.5âÂ±â54.9) and experience low ideal cardiovascular health (ICH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par9">The association between depression and many chronic diseases, including but not limited to hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> cardio-metabolic disorder syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and cardiovascular diseases (CVD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> can result in higher mortality rates and lower quality of life in AA women, especially those with lower incomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Research has shown that AA women with low-income status and hypertension suffer from depressive symptoms, which implies that this is a particularly vulnerable group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Yet, despite indication suggesting a strong link between high blood pressure and depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> AA women whose health care entails ongoing monitoring of their blood pressure may not be receiving adequate care for their depression;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> indeed, only a third of AA adults experiencing mental illness received services in 2019.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par10">While community-based interventions that address the unique behavioral, cultural, emotional, and social needs of low-income AA may be difficult to access due to comorbidities, scheduling, and various social risk factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> they are a necessary strategy to combat intransigent disparities observed in this population. The <italic>Oh Happy Day Class</italic> is an example of a culturally adapted intervention for African American adults, which reduced depressive symptoms in participants by 6.6 points from baseline to 3-month follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> The Prime Time Sister CirclesÂ® (PTSC) Program is another promising intervention. The PTSC Program incorporates peer support and didactic training that focuses on psychosocial health and well-being to: (1) address the sociocultural risk factors that mid- to late-life AA women with uncontrolled hypertension experience and (2) promote the adoption of primary and secondary prevention strategies to control their blood pressure and engagement in strategies geared toward psychosocial health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par11">We leveraged a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of the PTSC intervention on hypertension control to explore its effect on reducing depressive symptoms among mid-life, low-income AA women with uncontrolled hypertension. This was achieved through a secondary analysis of data collected between 2017 and 2018 as a part of this trial. We report on the impact of the PTSC intervention on participantsâ depressive symptoms.</p>

The studyâs secondary outcomes include health knowledge, self-efficacy, behaviors, and psychosocial health. For this analysis, we used data from the PTSC-RCT to study the impact of the PTSC intervention on depressive symptoms reported by our study population, low-income AA women with uncontrolled hypertension receiving care in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). We hypothesized that PTSC intervention would reduce the CESD-10 score in women who participated in the 13-week training session.</p>

                <p id="Par13">Data for this study came from the PTSC-RCT. The PTSC was a community-based intervention program targeting English-speaking AA women who were 40 to 75Â years of age, had been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressureââ¥â140Â mm Hg and diastolic blood pressureââ¥â90), resided in Washington, D.C., and were patients at Unity Health.

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par14">The main goals of the PTSC intervention were to help AA midlife women learn how to manage, lower, and control their high blood pressure; expand their repertoire of stress management techniques; increase their physical activity; and improve their nutrition. Study participants were assigned to cohorts of Sister Circles that met once a week, over a 13-week period, for 2Â h at a time. The PTSC intervention curriculum included culturally competent modules designed to help AA women manage their stress, an underlying contributor to depression. To that end, two sessions were devoted to stress and depressive symptom management. They were conducted by midlife AA women with extensive mental health expertise (i.e., psychologists or licensed clinical social workers). Each participant was taught general stress-management techniques such as deep breathing, communication skills, and time management strategies. They also developed a stress-management plan. Sister Circle sessions were held in meeting rooms provided by three churches in Washington, D.C.</p>

                  <p id="Par15">To identify participants with depressive symptoms, we employed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CES-D-10), a widely used self-reported measure of depression symptoms. The CES-D-10 comprises ten items (8 positively worded and two negatively worded) and has exhibited strong internal consistency (Cronbachâs Î±â=â0.86) and testâretest reliability (ICCâ=â0.85) among the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Further, the CES-D-10 is a reliable tool for measuring depression, with a value of the reliability coefficient of 0.7 (Cronbachâs alpha) and composite reliability of 0.72; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> as such, the scale is an excellent measure to identify individuals at risk for clinical depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Each item uses a 4-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating rarely or none of the time (less than one day per week) and 3 indicating all of the time (5â7Â days per week). Following the CES-D-10 guidelines, we reverse coded items 5 and 8 (two items that were negatively worded) and then calculated the total score by summing up scores of the ten items, resulting in a maximum scale score of 30 and a minimum scale score of 0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup></p>

Eligible participants were English-speaking women between 40 to 75Â years of age who self-identified as AA, received their primary care at a Unity practice, and had been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressureââ¥â140Â mm Hg or diastolic blood pressureââ¥â90).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Participants were randomly assigned to receive the PTSC intervention (<italic>n</italic>â=â216) or to the control group and proceeded with their standard clinical care at Unity (<italic>n</italic>â=â135).

We collected data at baseline, 3Â months, and 15Â months. Among the 341 participants who provided baseline data, 240 provided data at the 3-month mark, and 217 at the 15-months mark. Notably, nearly 30% of the participants dropped out of the study after randomization. Sub-analyses indicated that social risk factors (e.g., transportation) and personal health concerns were primary drivers for suboptimal participation. For this analysis, we excluded 25 participants with missing responses on two or more items on the CES-D-10. We constrained the analytic sample to those who furnished data during all 3 data collection time points. This reduced the sample to 172 participants (516 observations).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Prime time sister circles randomized clinical trial study at the 3 months and 15 months follow ups (CONSORT Flow Diagram).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11606_2023_8288_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

The parameter of interest in these models is the interaction between the group membership (PTSC vs. control) and the measurement timing (baseline vs. three months or baseline vs. 15Â months). Panel A columns 1 and 2 show that, compared to women in the control group, women who participated in the 13-week intervention program had a significantly greater reduction in their CES-D-10 scores from baseline to 3-month follow up (Coeff.: -1.99, 95% CI: -3.57, -0.41) in the unadjusted model. Results remained similar in the adjusted model (Coeff.: -1.99, 95% CI: -3.49, -0.49), and we found similar results at 15Â months. Those who participated in the PTSC intervention had a significantly greater reduction in the CES-D-10 score from baseline to 15Â months follow up (Coeff.: -2.42, 95% CI: -4.04, -0.80) in the unadjusted model and (Coeff.: -2.68, 95% CI: -4.51, -0.84) in the adjusted model (See Columns 3 and 4). Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> also contains the results of the regression models used to conduct per-protocol analyses in Panel B. The results of the adjusted model indicate that women who participated in the 13-week PTSC intervention had significantly reduced CES-D-10 scores from baseline to 3-month follow-up (-2.14; 95% CI: -3.98, -0.30) and baseline to 15Â months follow up (-2.22; 95% CI: -3.98, -0.38).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Regression Model Estimates on the Impact of PTSC on CESD -10 Score</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left" colspan="4">Baseline vs. three months</th><th align="left" colspan="4">Baseline vs. 15Â months</th></tr><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left" colspan="2">Unadjusted (Column 1)</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Adjusted (Column 2)</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Unadjusted (Column 3)</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Adjusted (Column 4)</th></tr><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Coeff</th><th align="left">95% CI</th><th align="left">Coeff</th><th align="left">95% CI</th><th align="left">Coeff</th><th align="left">95% CI</th><th align="left">Coeff</th><th align="left">95% CI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="9">Panel A: Intent-to-Treat analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="9">Â PTSC status (Ref.

              <p id="Par25">In this study, we used the CES-D-R (CES-D-10) scale to measure self-reported depressive symptoms among low-income AA women between 40 to 75Â years old with uncontrolled hypertension who participated in PTSC program in Washington, DC between 2017â2018. Our findings showed that the PTSC intervention effectively reduced women's depressive symptoms at 3Â months and 15Â months after the intervention. To our knowledge, there are very few studies to which we can compare our results. However, the decrease in depressive symptomology is similar to other group-based interventions. The reductions we observed may be due to aspects of the Sister Circles themselves, insofar as PTSC provided an environment that helped participants gain stress management skills with their peers. Being in a group of women with similar chronic diseases and mental health issues helped participants discuss their own situations, which could have lowered their stress and ameliorated other aspects of their psychosocial health associated with depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par26">Findings from our previous work showed that low-income AA women with hypertension have unmet depression care needs. Our cross-sectional analysis revealed that a majority of the women in the PTSC-RCT had experienced some level of depression, measured by CES-D-10 scores greater than 10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Based on the results of our current analysis, about 60% of participants with depression symptoms reported receiving some form of mental health services within the past six months, and about the same amount (58%) reported seeing a mental health professional. We expect these mental health needs to have increased as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and will continue after the SARS-COV-2 virus becomes endemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Since the pandemic disproportionately impacts low-income and AA communities, we anticipate that depression care needs will remain high among low-income AA women. This affirms the need for public health and healthcare policymakers, practitioners, and advocates to implement policies and programs that address the unmet depression care needs of this population. Given the high depressive symptoms among low-income AA women with hypertension, we recommend promoting awareness and strategies to diagnose people with depression as early as possible. One approach could include incorporating an assessment of depression symptoms within routine bi-annual screening for low-income AA women with hypertension. Our study also reinforces the critical importance of developing, implementing, and evaluating community-based interventions that are contextualized to low-income AA womenâs needs. We found strong evidence to suggest that a culturally responsive intervention, such as the PTSC Program, can reduce depressive symptoms among low-income AA women with hypertension receiving care at a facility.</p>
              <p id="Par27">There is an overall lack of access to treatment for mental illness in Americans, particularly among Black/African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> Several barriers have been enumerated by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and other bodies and include, but are not limited to: (1) lack of culturally adopted mental health treatments, (2) lack of access to high-quality care, (3) stigma and negative attitudes and beliefs ascribed to mental health conditions, (4) lower rates of mental health providers with diverse racial backgrounds, and (5) inability to pay for treatment because of lack of income or a lower rate of health insurance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> The PTSC partially addresses these barriers by offering a culturally tailored, community-based intervention that uses a peer group format to combat stigma and negative attitudes and trained lay facilitators to extend and support mental health providers. Public and private insurance should consider providing reimbursement to support interventions such as the PTSC.</p>
              <p id="Par28">This study has several important limitations. First, the study population was AA women ages 40â75 with low-income and uncontrolled hypertension who received primary care from a facility in Washington, DC. Our findings may not be generalizable to higher-income AA women or low-income AA women who cannot maintain consistent access to care. Second, the primary outcome of this RCT was hypertension, and the CES-D-10 scale (which is a screening tool) was collected as the secondary outcome to measure potential changes in depressive symptoms. While we powered the PTSC-RCT to detect changes in hypertension outcomes, we did not conduct power analyses to discern the impact of the intervention on depressive symptomology. This limits our ability to conclusively state that the PTSC intervention was solely responsible for reducing self-reported depressive symptoms among our study population. Third, we assumed the randomness of missing data with respect to our analyses; yet, given the sociodemographic profile of our study population, it is likely that missingness was linked to adverse social determinants of health that precluded full participation in the intervention and data collection strategies. Finally, we did not include other measures of psychosocial distress in the analyses, partially due to the unavailability of data.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Despite these limitations, this study has several strengths. The PTSC-RCT measured depressive symptoms in a largely homogeneous population with respect to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, health status, and geography<sup>.</sup> Further, because participants in this study had received their care at a facility, it is reasonable to consider that undiagnosed depression was not due to a lack of access to care. Indeed, the association between depressive symptoms and hypertension underscores the need for integrated models of care that facilitate access to mental health support for women with high blood pressure. It also reinforces the importance of strategies to monitor both the quality of mental health services provided and the extent of the uptake of such services to ensure receipt of adequate treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> Since the CES-D-10 is widely used to screen depressive symptoms, our study results are comparable to national survey results. Finally, there is a strong need to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate promising community-based interventions that reduce depression symptoms among AA women. This study builds our knowledge of effective interventions and can help equip lower-income Black women with much-needed tools to recognize symptoms of depression and seek help.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par30">The prevalence of depression is high among women with chronic diseases, especially hypertension, specifically African American women with lower socioeconomic status. Addressing the depression care needs of these women is a multidimensional mission that requires cooperation among mental health specialists, primary care providers, community-based programs, researchers, and public health officials. Interventions should consider addressing social determinants of health, including individual, sociocultural, environmental, and historical factors that impact the mental health of low-income African American women. There is a need for programs such as PTSC that empower women and help them better manage their emotional and physical health issues and depressive symptoms. Our findings show that free, culturally competent, community-based intervention programs such as the PTSC can effectively reduce depressive symptoms.</p>
