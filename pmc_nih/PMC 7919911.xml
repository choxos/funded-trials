                <p>‘Mother-to-child transmission of HIV’ can occur during the period of pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. ‘Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV’ (PMTCT) in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, is especially vital as the prevalence of HIV is 28.2% in women aged 15–49. PMTCT interventions resulted in a drop of MTCT rates in Mpumalanga from ∼2% in 2015 to 1.3% in 2016. This randomised controlled trial in Mpumalanga examined the potential impact of a lay healthcare worker administered intervention, ‘Protect Your Family’, on maternal and infant adherence, and to assess the relative influence of male partner involvement on infant and maternal adherence. This cluster randomised controlled trial used a two-phase and two-condition (experimental or control) study design where participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1399) did assessments both during pregnancy and post-postpartum. Only women participated in Phase 1, and both female and male partners participated in Phase 2. Results indicated that male involvement was associated with self-reported maternal or infant antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, but the intervention was not associated with ART adherence. Self-reported adherence was associated with depression, age, and partner HIV status. The study results provide support for the involvement of men in the antenatal clinic setting during pregnancy. Results also support further research on the meaning and assessment of male involvement and clarification of the constructs underlying the concept in the sub-Saharan African context. Outcomes provide support for male involvement and treatment of depression as adjuncts to improve uptake of both maternal and infant medication as part of the PMTCT protocol.</p>

              <p>Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV can occur during the period of pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Worldwide, as of 2015, there were ∼1.8 million children (&lt;15 years) living with HIV, with 150,000 new cases annually (CDC, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; UNAIDS, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Prevention of MTCT of HIV (PMTCT) has been specifically targeted in South Africa, a country with one of the highest HIV prevalence worldwide (Avert, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In 2016, there were ‘7,100,000 people living with HIV in South Africa’ (Council, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Of these, 86% were aware of their diagnosis, 65% were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 81% had achieved viral suppression (Avert, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Council, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, the HIV prevalence in women of reproductive age (15–49) is 28.2% (Council, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In 2014, the South African PMTCT guidelines were revised so that all ‘pregnant or breastfeeding women with HIV’, would receive lifelong ART upon diagnosis; currently, more than 95% of pregnant women are accessing treatment in South Africa (UNAIDS, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). All neonates with any previous exposure to HIV were to be tested with PCR, and neonatal prophylaxis with daily nevirapine was recommended for 6 weeks (Hurst, Appelgren, &amp; Kourtis, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). PMTCT interventions resulted in a drop of MTCT rates in Mpumalanga from ∼2% in 2015 to 1.3% in 2016 (Council, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Despite these achievements, challenges to PMTCT in Mpumalanga remain, including variable clinic data, uneven condom distribution, delayed PCR results, eventuating in delayed commencement of infant ART, and inconsistent male circumcision delivery and uptake (Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>Commencing ART in all pregnant or breastfeeding women and continuing lifelong treatment have been associated with improved outcomes for mothers, as well as decreased mother-to-child and women-to-partner transmission of HIV (WHO, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Without any preventative measures, MTCT rates range from 15% to 45% (WHO, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interventions during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding have reduced this rate to below 5%, and in women receiving ART and exclusively breastfeeding to 6 months, transmission risk can be reduced to 0–1% (WHO, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These interventions have included lifelong antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral prophylaxis, caesarean section prior to labour and ruptured membranes, and total avoidance of breastfeeding. However, maternal adherence antiretrovirals may be reduced by stigma and discrimination within the health infrastructure and community, delayed prenatal care, socioeconomic challenges, less education, and home delivery (Prudden et al., <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Woldesenbet et al., <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), as well as low community and partner support, healthcare staff shortages, limited access to healthcare facilities, and denial, depression, fear (Gourlay, Birdthistle, Mburu, Iorpenda, &amp; Wringe, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Stigma may also act as a barrier to adherence because it may hinder women from disclosing their HIV status to their partner (Sweeney &amp; Vanable, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, comparisons of self-reported adherence to biological evidence (dried blood spots) have found women to overestimate compliance (Alcaide et al., <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), suggesting that blood testing may provide a more accurate evaluation of adherence (Calcagno et al., <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>Male involvement during and after pregnancy is linked to positive outcomes for both maternal and infant health in low- and middle-income countries (Matseke et al., <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Yargawa &amp; Leonardi-Bee, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Broadly, male involvement is associated with a reduced maternal depression, fewer complications during childbirth, with greater use of healthcare services (Yargawa &amp; Leonardi-Bee, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV is largely dependent on maternal adherence to antiretroviral prophylaxis, it is also heavily influenced by the longitudinal support of male partners (Elias, Mmbaga, Mohamed, &amp; Kishimba, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), given that men are the primary decision makers in low- and middle-income countries. When male partners are involved, the overall risk of vertical transmission of HIV and subsequent infant mortality drops by 40% (Aluisio et al., <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Adherence interventions in South Africa include lay healthcare worker promotions, involvement in community and faith-based organisations, peer support groups (e.g. mothers-to-mothers<italic toggle="yes">)</italic>, and community-driven education and communication (Schmitz et al., <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Weekly reminders delivered by short text messages have also shown success by improving ART adherence by 13–16% in Kenya, though such interventions are limited by technology access (Pop-Eleches et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Among infants breastfed by mothers with HIV, both mothers and infants must adhere to ART to prevent MTCT, though few studies have investigated adherence among infants under 12 months of age. Interventions tested to enhance paediatric adherence have mostly been conducted with small samples and in the U.S. (Haberer &amp; Mellins, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In addition, depression and intimate partner violence (PV), frequently observed in South Africa, have been associated with poor ART adherence in both mothers and infants, suggesting that targeted treatment of maternal depression and ART compliance may further reduce MTCT rates (Cook, Peltzer, Weiss, Rodriguez, &amp; Jones, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As such, this randomised controlled trial in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa, examined the potential impact of a lay healthcare worker administered intervention, ‘Protect Your Family (PYF)’, on maternal and infant adherence, accounting for this synergy of factors (i.e. depression, disclosure, stigma, and knowledge) influencing maternal and infant adherence. In addition, this study examined the relative influence of male partner involvement, theorising that men’s involvement during pregnancy could improve both infant and maternal adherence.</p>

                <p>The study aimed to measure the effect of male involvement on the improvement of PMTCT. The study design was a two-phase and two-condition (experimental or control) cluster randomised controlled trial. In Phase 1 only women participated, while in Phase 2 both female and male partners. After randomisation, baseline assessments were completed between 6 and 30 weeks of pregnancy and participants were invited to participate in four group intervention sessions (or time-equivalent control sessions) antenatally and two post-partum individual sessions, led by lay healthcare workers. Women were re-assessed antenatally at 32 weeks of pregnancy, and postnatally at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Retention at 12 months postnatal assessments in Phase 1 was 60% and Phase 2 74% (see complete trial diagram at Peltzer et al., <xref rid="CIT0023a" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>

              <p>This randomised controlled trial examined the impact of the lay healthcare worker delivered intervention, Protect Your Family, on maternal and infant adherence, and the influence of male partner involvement on adherence outcomes in the context of the intervention. Male involvement, as measured by participation of men in the study, was associated with reported maternal or infant adherence, but contrary to expectation, the intervention was not associated with adherence. Similarly, adherence assessed by dried blood spot only associated with lower family planning knowledge, but not with male involvement or condition assignment.</p>
              <p>Study results suggest male involvement, which was promoted in Phase 2 of the study, supported adherence by mothers for themselves and when providing medication to their infants, even when controlling for other factors associated with adherence, e.g. depression, partner HIV status, and age. Although the male involvement scale (Byamugisha et al., <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) does not target specific factors predictive of adherence, the study design targeted increasing men’s involvement in the perinatal period, encouraging them to attend assessments and sessions in the antenatal clinics. As such, male involvement would likely have been stimulated by exposure to the clinic setting. Results promote the careful review of the elements of male involvement scales, as the elements included may not necessarily be the essential elements needed to enhance PMTCT. Previous research has shown that although male involvement is one of the most challenging components of PMTCT, it improves neonatal and maternal outcomes (Maonga, Mahande, Damian, &amp; Msuya, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, in a review of several studies, male participation during the pregnancy period improved women’s knowledge of risk factors during pregnancy, but it did not influence birth preparedness, antenatal care utilisation, or the rate of miscarriages. Male involvement was also related to increased use of institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance, but did not have an association with neonatal outcomes. In addition, male involvement was related to increased uptake in the postnatal period, but had a minimal effect on breastfeeding and survival (Aguiar &amp; Jennings, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that male involvement may be beneficial to women due to increased social support, but it may not be sufficient to influence neonatal and maternal health or increase PMTCT uptake. There are also systemic barriers to supporting male involvement in rural clinics, such as limited space, which may overshadow the positive benefits of promoting male partner participation (Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Results support previous studies (Cook et al., <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) underscore the relationship between depression and poor maternal adherence and suboptimal provision of medication to infants, as well as the relationship between maternal and infant adherence behaviours.</p>
              <p>Several issues may have influenced study outcomes, the primary one being attrition in Phase 1 compared to Phase 2. Some of the reasons for drop-out from the study included miscarriages, infant deaths, or relocation. Because men in Phase 2 were required to participate in the study, it is possible that women in Phase 2 may have received more support from their partners to attend clinic appointments. Though the influence of attrition was controlled for, and data imputation was performed to respond to participants with missing data, participants may have self-selected to leave the study due to depression, recency of diagnosis, or partner HIV status. The study results may have also been influenced by the high prevalence of non-disclosure of HIV status from women to their partners (39%). Although the intervention was aimed at promoting women’s disclosure of HIV status, 55% of the women were diagnosed during the current pregnancy; such a recent diagnosis prior to study initiation may not have provided women with sufficient time to disclose it to others. Study results also underscore the conundrum which arises when self-reported adherence and biological measurement of adherence disagreed, such that biological measurement of adherence remains the gold standard for assessment (Calcagno et al., <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As such, results must be interpreted with caution, as the most compelling outcomes are those provided by self-report. Future studies should ensure the use of DBS and biological assessment across longitudinal time points. Finally, many clinics, in addition to provision of the PMTCT protocol, now include programmes targeting PMTCT (e.g. mothers-to-mothers) the combination of which may achieve a ceiling effect with regard to adherence and PMTCT uptake.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study provides support for the involvement of men in the antenatal clinic setting, and results provide support for ensuring that men are welcomed in that traditionally female environment. Results also support further research on the meaning and assessment of male involvement and clarification of the constructs underlying the concept in the sub-Saharan African context. Finally, outcomes provide support for male involvement and treatment of depression as adjuncts to improve uptake of both maternal and infant medication as part of the PMTCT protocol.</p>
