                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Many women in low and middle-income countries enter pregnancy with low nutritional reserves with increased risk of fetal growth restriction and poor birth outcomes, including small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and preterm birth. Balanced energy–protein (BEP) supplements have shown reductions in risk of stillbirth and SGA, yet variations in intervention format and composition and limited evidence on the impact of BEP during lactation on growth outcomes warrant further study. This paper describes the protocol of the Maternal Infant Nutrition Trial (MINT) Study, which aims to evaluate the impact of a fortified BEP supplement during pregnancy and lactation on birth outcomes and infant growth in rural Nepal.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>MINT is a 2×2 factorial, household randomised, unblinded, efficacy trial conducted in a subarea of Sarlahi District, Nepal. The study area covers six rural municipalities with about 27 000 households and a population of approximately 100 000. Married women (15–30 years) who become pregnant are eligible for participation in the trial and are randomly assigned at enrolment to supplementation with fortified BEP or not and at birth to fortified BEP supplementation or not until 6 months post partum. The primary pregnancy outcome is incidence of SGA, using the INTERGROWTH-21st standard, among live born infants with birth weight measured within 72 hours of delivery. The primary infant growth outcome is mean length-for-age z-score at 6 months using the WHO international growth reference.</p>

              <p>Many women in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) enter pregnancy with low nutritional reserves, unable to meet the increased requirements for protein, energy, and micronutrients during pregnancy and lactation. Undernourished women are at increased risk of fetal growth restriction and adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth (&lt;37 gestational weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (birth weight &lt;10th percentile of a reference standard by gestational age and sex), two underlying biological causes of low birth weight (LBW) (&lt;2.5 kg).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> SGA infants are more likely to experience higher mortality, linear growth faltering and poor health outcomes, poor cognitive performance, and diminished educational and employment attainment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> In 2020, 23.4 million infants (17.4% of all births) were born SGA, with the highest prevalence in South Asia (40.9%).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Estimates from 2012 indicate that 22% neonatal deaths in LMICs, and 26% in South Asia, were attributable to SGA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref></p>
              <p>Infant size status at birth and growth in the first 6 months of life, especially among preterm and SGA infants, are critical determinants of childhood stunting and wasting associated with higher risk of mortality, morbidity and poor developmental outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Many maternal risk factors associated with pregnancy outcomes and consequent preterm or SGA are likely contributors to linear growth failure.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Postnatal factors, such as breastfeeding and feeding behaviours, infections and environmental factors, are also important drivers of infant growth.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p>
              <p>Nutritional interventions targeted to women during pregnancy and lactation provide an opportunity to break the intergenerational cycle of growth failure. The WHO recommendations on antenatal care (ANC) include balanced energy–protein (BEP) supplementation in undernourished populations to reduce the risk of stillbirth and SGA birth.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is based on a systematic review of BEP supplementation during pregnancy that has shown decreased risk of stillbirth (relative risk (RR): 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.94) and SGA (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.90).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> BEP also increased mean infant birth weight by 41 g overall and 100 g among undernourished women.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref></p>
              <p>Despite this context-specific recommendation, the variations in formats, ingredients and nutrient composition have hindered programmatic progress. Further, there is no recommendation for supplementation of women who are breastfeeding, despite high rates of growth faltering in early life in LMICs, where maternal undernutrition is high and exclusive breastfeeding is recommended in the first 6 months of life. Recently, an expert consensus developed specifications for a fortified BEP ‘ready-to-use’ food supplement for pregnant and lactating women in LMICs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Such a product requires testing in undernourished settings for efficacy in improving birth outcomes and infant growth.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we describe the study protocol for the Maternal Infant Nutrition Trial (MINT) at the Nepal Nutrition Intervention Project Sarlahi (NNIPS) research site in Sarlahi District, Nepal. The aim of the MINT Study is to evaluate the efficacy of daily fortified BEP supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on SGA and mean length-for-age z-score (LAZ) in the first 6 months of life. In this rural population, there is a significant burden of undernutrition among mothers and infants and high prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> However, breastfeeding through 6 months of life is high, presenting postpartum supplementation as a plausible mechanism by which to improve infant growth. Our primary hypotheses are that (1) fortified BEP supplementation versus no supplementation during pregnancy will reduce incidence of SGA, and (2) fortified BEP supplementation versus no supplementation during lactation alone or both during pregnancy and lactation will improve infant linear growth in the first 6 months after delivery. Several secondary outcomes will also be examined.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>The MINT Study is conducted in Sarlahi District, Madhesh Province, in the Terai region (low-lying plains) of Nepal by the NNIPS research team. The NNIPS field research site, established in 1989 and covering approximately one-third of the district, currently operates as a joint undertaking between the Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the non-profit organisation, Nepal Netra Jyoti Sangh, under a memorandum of agreement with the Social Welfare Council, Government of Nepal. Nepal’s Terai region has high rates of maternal undernutrition, neonatal mortality, adverse pregnancy outcomes and inadequate infant growth, and is representative of rural, low-income settings in much of South Asia.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Over half (56.9%) of households in Nepal’s Madhesh Province faced food insecurity with 10% being severely food insecure, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Of children under 5 years old, 29.3% were stunted and 10.1% were wasted in Madhesh Province in 2022.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Data from our most recent trial in the NNIPS study area, which had over 31 000 live births (2010–2017), reported neonatal mortality and stillbirth rates of approximately 32 per 1000 live births and 29 per 1000 births, respectively (unpublished). In that trial, the proportion of adverse pregnancy outcomes were: preterm birth 14.9%, SGA 48.5% and LBW 30.1% (unpublished). Nearly one-third of women in their first trimester of pregnancy were underweight (29.5%) (body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and the same proportion (29.5%) had a height less than 145 cm (unpublished). Over one-third of infants (35%) are breastfed within an hour of birth and 95% within 24 hours in our trial population (unpublished).</p>

                <title>Study population and recruitment</title>
                <p>The study area includes 34 wards selected from six rural municipalities (Haripur, Ishwarpur, Kabilasi, Malangawa, Chakraghatta and Chandranagar) with a population of approximately 100 000 people. MINT enumerated and recruited participants through a household census and pregnancy surveillance system. Due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial census and enrolment were divided into two periods.</p>
                <p>In July 2019, we conducted a census to enumerate the households in the study area with potentially eligible women. The census activity identified about 27 000 total households, including roughly 13 000 households with at least one woman meeting the eligibility criteria for pregnancy surveillance. The first enrolment period spanned November 2021–June 2022, enrolling 938 women.</p>
                <p>Between the original census and the start of pregnancy enrolment (which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic), many newly married women accumulated in the study area. In December 2022 and January 2023, we conducted a new household census update activity to add these newly married women, who would be eligible for enrolment in the trial, to our census and pregnancy surveillance roster. The census update activity added about 1400 newly married women to the census roster for a total of around 14 400 women eligible for pregnancy surveillance and subsequent enrolment if they become pregnant. The second enrolment period began in January 2023 and will run until the sample size of 1800 women is met.</p>
                <p>Pregnancy surveillance is conducted by local, female data collectors hired on the project to make household visits every 5 weeks to ask potential participants if they had a period since the last visit and offer a urine-based pregnancy test if not. All married women (15–30 years) resident in the study area at the time of the census who are identified as pregnant by our pregnancy surveillance system (&lt;24 weeks’ gestation) and consent to participate are eligible for participation in the trial. Women who self-report an allergy to nuts, milk or soy at enrolment are excluded.</p>
                <p>We have enrolled 1944 women as of August 2023.</p>

                <title>Randomisation/allocation</title>
                <p>The study uses a household randomisation scheme as there are joint families in which more than one woman could contribute a pregnancy, which would increase risk of sharing/crossover in the context of individual randomisation. At enrolment, randomisation is stratified by maternal height (&lt;150 cm, ≥150 cm). Using the median of three height measures of the first woman enrolled in the house, we assign each household to either supplementation or not during pregnancy within each height category. We assign any additional women who became pregnant in a household that had already been randomised to the same group. At the birth visit, we randomise within each height category and pregnancy allocation group, assigning each household to either supplementation or not during the postpartum period. Only households with at least one live birth are eligible for postpartum randomisation and follow-up. Since the likelihood of more than one woman from the same household becoming pregnant within the enrolment period is estimated to be low, at ~96.5% from prior data, this choice of randomisation approach allows us to gain the statistical strength of an individually randomised trial.</p>
                <p>We pre-generated randomisation sequences using the R software environment for statistical programming (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). We generated these sequences using randomly permuted blocks of size 4, 6, 8 and 12, to ensure sequential (ie, chronological) balance across the groups throughout the enrolment period.</p>
                <p>Blinding of participants or study data collectors was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention and control.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>At enrolment, households are randomly allocated to either supplementation or not for the duration of pregnancy. Women in the supplementation group receive at home a supply of fortified BEP supplement for daily consumption beginning at 14 gestational weeks until the pregnancy outcome. Both groups also receive (1) recommendation to enrol in ANC at a local health clinic and deliver at a certified birthing facility; (2) nutrition, hygiene, and breastfeeding and infant care counselling; and (3) a clean birthing kit. In pregnancy, women in both groups are provided iron–folic acid tablets and albendazole, if not provided via ANC at their health facility. At the birth visit, households where a woman reports at least one live birth are randomly allocated to either supplementation or not for the postpartum period until the infant is 6 months old. Counselling for exclusive breastfeeding is provided in the postpartum period but iron–folic acid tablets are not provided as per the policy in Nepal.</p>

                  <title>Composition of fortified BEP supplement</title>
                  <p>The fortified BEP supplement is a ready-to-eat snack in the form of lipid-based peanut paste packaged in individual sachets (72 g). The supplement was designed to meet the expert consensus specifications of a nutritious food supplement for pregnant and lactating women.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Each sachet is a daily portion that provides calories (~400 kcal), protein (~14 g) and multiple micronutrients at the estimated average requirement for pregnancy. The product is made by Nutriset (France), as a specially manufactured version of their product known as ‘Plumpy’Mum’. We previously conducted two formative research studies to evaluate the acceptability of and adherence to various flavours of the BEP product in this community.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> Due to unavailability of raw materials, Nutriset produced three variations of Plumpy’Mum for use in our study, each with different combinations of ingredients selected to produce a product with a similar nutritional composition. The changes to the original ingredients were to remove the soy isolate (first change) and soy flour (second change), which resulted in minor changes in energy, protein and micronutrient concentrations, deemed inconsequential from a nutrition perspective. The specific ingredients and nutritional composition of each variation are provided in the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 2</xref>.</p>

Since we are assuming no interaction between the marginal effects, this sample size will allow us to detect a difference in infant LAZ at 6 months after delivery of 0.16 z-scores with 80% power and 0.18 z-scores with 90% power. The MINT Study is designed to enrol approximately 1800–2000 women over a period of 20 months (split into two 6-month enrolment periods). This will yield the required sample of 1548 woman/infant pairs visited within 72 hours of delivery, after a reduction of 14% due to fetal death and loss to follow-up in pregnancy.</p>

We will assess the balance between the two pregnancy supplementation groups in baseline household-level and individual-level characteristics including maternal age, height, BMI, parity, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, education and socioeconomic status. If imbalanced variables are also associated with the primary outcome (p&lt;0.10), we will use multivariable log binomial regression modelling to adjust for potential confounding. We will compare the proportion of SGA, between those who were supplemented versus not according to their allocation status, using a log binomial regression model to estimate the relative risk and 95% CI with the control group as the referent both unadjusted and adjusted for identified confounders.

Due to the factorial study design, we will assess the interaction between pregnancy and lactation supplementation on the outcome of mean LAZ, although our sample size is not adequate to detect small interaction effects. We will use a multivariable linear regression model with an interaction term for treatment arms. If the interaction is significant (&lt;0.10), we will report both the main and interaction effects. If not significant, which we anticipate, we will report the marginal treatment effects for supplementation during lactation versus not and during pregnancy versus not. We will compare mean LAZ scores between supplementation groups using a multivariable linear regression model to estimate the risk difference and 95% CI with the control group as the referent both unadjusted and adjusted for identified confounders.</p>

                <p>The study team will disseminate MINT findings to the Sarlahi District Public Health Office, Sarlahi District Project Advisory Committee, Ministry of Health and Population, Nepal, Central Project Advisory Committee, and to various local organisations, including UNICEF-Nepal and UNICEF South Asian Regional Office, US Agency for International Development and other stakeholders in Nepal with interests in nutrition during pregnancy and lactation. We will share anonymised data with the Ki data repository and researchers involved in the BEP Harmonization Initiative organised and funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of meta-analyses using data from similar trials conducted around the world. The study team will also present results at international workshops and conferences with relevant researchers and programme or policy stakeholders. Members of the study team will publish results of primary and secondary analyses in peer-reviewed academic journals.</p>

              <p>Nepal has made progress in reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality, but a significant burden of undernutrition remains among mothers and infants.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Novel and effective interventions and practical implementation strategies are needed to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant growth faltering,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> and currently, the WHO<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> recommends use of BEP supplements in undernourished settings, but standard formulations of such interventions and data on implementation in programmes are lacking. The MINT Study will provide evidence to help refine and implement the WHO context-specific recommendation on BEP supplementation in pregnancy, especially using the fortified, enhanced ready-to-use formulation recommended by the expert consensus on BEP supplements.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> As multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) reduces risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including LBW and SGA, our trial will contribute evidence as to whether the fortified BEP intervention, which includes the same 15 micronutrients, provides additional benefit beyond MMS alone.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This trial will generate evidence on the potential of a maternal intervention to prevent early life growth faltering and improve maternal outcomes, such as anaemia and inadequate gestational weight gain, areas where a research gap exists. The results from the trial will inform health policy and programmes in Nepal, where there currently are no guidelines for community-level management of growth faltering in infants less than 6 months of age beyond exclusive breastfeeding. The primary strength of the trial is the 2×2 factorial randomised controlled trial design, which will enable understanding of the interconnections between maternal nutritional status in pregnancy and lactation and relationships to fetal and infant growth faltering. The trial includes frequent follow-up visits, over the continuum from early pregnancy to 6 months after delivery, which will generate data on many prenatal and postpartum factors that influence maternal and infant outcomes. The trial will describe maternal dietary intake, assess whether provision of BEP supplements leads to dietary substitution and measure adherence, yielding practical insights for implementation. Lastly, the trial structure allows for nesting various substudies, including those that assess the impact of BEP on the maternal and infant microbiome, infant neurodevelopment and maternal metabolites.</p>
