                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Little is known about violence against HIV-positive adolescents and young adults (AYA) in sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis examines experiences of violence victimization, and the perpetrators of this violence, among AYA living with HIV, aged 15–24 years, in Zambia.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We analyzed baseline data from 272 AYA (60.1% female, 71.0% perinatally infected) enrolled in Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success), a randomized controlled trial conducted in four HIV clinics in Ndola, Zambia. Violence measures were adapted from the ICAST-C and the WHO Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence. Youth could report up to 12 perpetrator types for past-year experiences of violence. We estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and forced sex, disaggregated by sex and age group. Estimates were weighted using sex and age data from the 2013–14 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey to be representative of HIV-positive AYA in Zambia.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Estimated lifetime prevalence of any violence victimization was 78.2%. Past-year prevalence was 72.0% among males and 74.5% among females. Almost half of AYA (46.1%) had ever experienced polyvictimization (2+ types of violence). Psychological abuse was most common (70.4% lifetime, 65.3% past-year), followed by physical violence (50.8% lifetime, 44.7% past-year) and forced sex (10.4% lifetime, 4.7% past-year). Among past-year victims, males experienced more violence than females from a friend/peer (74.3% vs. 45.1%, p&lt;0.001); females experienced more violence than males from a romantic partner (33.3% vs. 5.0%, p&lt;0.001), parent/caregiver (32.4% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.02), and stranger (19.7% vs. 5.2%, p&lt;0.001).</p>

                  <p>The widespread and overlapping prevalence of multiple types of violence highlights the critical need for prevention and response efforts that are tailored to youths’ sex and the perpetrator type. Future research should explore violence victimization and HIV outcomes, and the measurement of psychological abuse and sexual violence, among HIV-positive AYA in the region.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In many settings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), adolescents and young adults (AYA) face high levels of violence victimization. A systematic review found that over 50% of adolescents (aged 15–17 years) from 24 African countries had experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence, or bullying, in the past year [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a meta-analysis, roughly one-third to one-half of young women (aged 20–24 years) reported having ever experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence across 8 countries in Eastern or Southern Africa [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Literature from high-income settings and SSA alike has demonstrated that young people who are exposed to violence from a range of perpetrator types in home, school, and community settings, are at risk of negative health outcomes in the short- and long-term, including greater likelihood of depression [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], substance use [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suicidal ideation [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], anti-social behavior [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and risky sexual behavior [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Studies have identified intimate partner violence (IPV) as an important concern among HIV-positive adult women in SSA [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These studies have demonstrated that HIV-positive women have a higher risk of IPV than their HIV-negative counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and that experiencing violence can disrupt antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and prevent viral suppression [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, for adult women, violence or the fear of violence—particularly from intimate partners—has been associated with increased sexual risk behavior [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and HIV non-disclosure [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], additional barriers to the prevention of HIV transmission.</p>
              <p>However, comparatively little attention has been paid to violence from any perpetrator against AYA living with HIV in the region. This is despite research showing that AYA are undergoing cognitive, psychosocial, emotional, and social changes [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and therefore have different needs than adults. SSA is home to the majority of the world’s HIV-positive youth (84%, 1.7 million) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and three in four new HIV infections among 15-19-year-olds occur in SSA [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some studies—for example, in Tanzania [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and Malawi [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]—have assessed exposure to violence among HIV-positive youth as an independent or adjustment variable, reporting wide-ranging prevalence figures derived from widely varying measures and methodologies. Only one study was identified for which violence was the primary focus in a population of HIV-positive adolescents in SSA; this study by Cluver et al. found that between 41% and 47% of the sample of 1,060 South African boys and girls (ages 10–19) reported exposure to past-year physical or verbal violence from teachers, peers, or community members [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but did not measure IPV. While there is limited data on HIV-positive adolescents (up to age 19), there is virtually no information available on HIV-positive young men (aged 20–24 years) and violence victimization in SSA. This paucity of data is concerning since the forms and perpetrators of violence often differ for male and female youth; males, for instance, tend to be at higher risk of male-on-male interpersonal violence [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and females of dating and sexual violence from men [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is critical to ascertain the magnitude and perpetrators of violence against HIV-positive youth in SSA to inform the development of appropriate prevention and response efforts. Such efforts could impede the negative health and developmental consequences of violence, and also prevent HIV disease progression and reduce the onward transmission of HIV. Understanding the epidemiology of violence against both male and female AYA living with HIV is particularly needed in Zambia, which has among the highest prevalence of both HIV (12% among adults, [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) and partner violence (47% among ever-married women, [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) globally. Failure to recognize the role of violence in the lives of HIV-positive AYA could ultimately hamper global efforts to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To address this gap, the current study describes the prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and sexual violence from multiple perpetrator types against AYA living with HIV in Zambia.</p>

                <title>Design and procedures</title>
                <p>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from the Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success) randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The trial was designed to assess the impact of a peer mentoring intervention on viral load and other HIV-related outcomes among AYA living with HIV in Ndola, Zambia. Ndola, the capital of the Copperbelt Province, is a peri-urban community with a population of about 370,000, [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] located near the Democratic Republic of Congo border.</p>
                <p>Baseline data were collected from December 2017 through May 2018 in four purposively-selected HIV clinics, including a children’s hospital, an adult hospital, and two primary health facilities. AYA were consecutively recruited if they were aged 15–24 years, spoke English or Bemba, knew their HIV status, were on ART for at least six months, and were available for study activities over 18 months. AYA were ineligible if they were too sick to participate as determined by the recruiting healthcare provider, were attending boarding school, had a sibling already enrolled in the study, or had participated in a recent adolescent/caregiver intervention study held at two of the study clinics.</p>
                <p>Potentially eligible patients were approached by a health care provider and referred, if interested, to a trained research staff member who explained the study, screened for eligibility, and conducted informed consent. In line with Zambian law, written parental/caregiver consent and youth assent was required for participants aged 15–17 years [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Research staff members administered baseline surveys to all consenting and assenting youth participants, in either Bemba or English, during face-to-face interviews using Magpi software on tablet computers. Given that baseline surveys included questions about experiences of violence and suicide ideation, in addition to the potential for sensitive issues to arise during peer mentoring meetings, the team developed and implemented a safety protocol with referral procedures for both peer mentors and data collectors to connect youth participants with health care providers (HCP) for additional care (see further description under Ethics). Data were uploaded to a secure server and checked for quality. Additionally, participants’ ART start dates were abstracted from their medical charts.</p>

                <title>Measures</title>
                <p>Self-reported measures of violence victimization were adapted from the internationally-recognized and widely-used IPSCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool (ICAST) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and the World Health Organization (WHO) Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence against Women (WHO MCS) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The ICAST-C (Child Version) is shown to have good internal consistency and construct validity [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and has been administered in numerous settings in SSA, including Mali, Uganda, and Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given that the ICAST was designed for children ages 11 to 18, it was supplemented by items from the WHO MCS, which has been widely used to measure violence from intimate partners across the region. The WHO MCS items are similar to those items used to assess violence in the 2013–14 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
                <p>Surveys queried acts of physical (7 items), psychological (6 items), and sexual (4 items) violence victimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235203.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Participants were asked if they had ever experienced the act (yes/no), and if yes, how often they had experienced it in the past year: never, once, a few times, or many times. They were classified as having experienced any of the three types of victimization if reporting at least one of the associated acts. Experiences of physical violence were distinguished by severity level based on WHO guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with three items capturing ‘moderate’ violence (e.g. pushed/shoved) and four items ‘severe’ violence (e.g. choked/burnt). A single variable of forced sex from the WHO MCS was used to measure sexual violence. The remaining three items from the ICAST were not analyzed since they described sexual behaviors that may have been interpreted as consensual sexual experiences by older youth with intimate partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235203.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The age of first experience of forced sex was also measured. We found adequate reliability for the measures of physical violence and psychological abuse, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging between 0.61 and 0.66 [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Participants were classified as having experienced polyvictimization if they reported two or more types of victimization (physical, psychological, or sexual), ever or in the past year. Finally, for past-year measures, participants were asked who perpetrated the act and could choose all that apply from 12 possible perpetrator types: romantic partner, parent/caregiver, other family member, friend or peer, stranger, school staff member, employer, health care worker, neighbor, religious leader, military/police, or someone else the youth knows. Survey items were reviewed by Zambian coauthors to ensure their appropriateness. The full instrument was translated into Bemba and pilot-tested among youth in Ndola for comprehension and clarity.</p>

                <p>Socio-demographic characteristics measured in the baseline survey included the youth’s age (categorized as 15-19/20-24 years), sex (male/female), completion of primary school (did/did not complete), current employment status (employed/not), and orphanhood status (none/single orphan/double orphan). HIV measures included self-reported mode of HIV acquisition (from parents/through sex/another way/don’t know or refused) and length of time on ART (categorized as 6 months to &lt;3 years, 3 to &lt;6 years, or 6+ years, based on the dates the participant began ART and enrolled in the study).</p>

                <p>Descriptive analyses were conducted to observe distributions of study variables. Lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and forced sex was estimated using percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Prevalence figures were disaggregated by sex given recognized differences in experiences of violence for male compared with female youth [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Past-year prevalence was further disaggregated by youth’s sex and age group (15–19 and 20–24) since experiences of violence may differ for younger compared to older youth given their unique developmental stages [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and to facilitate comparisons with other international datasets, which have used these age groups [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To explore whether experiences of violence differ based on the youth’s self-reported mode of HIV acquisition, we compared the prevalence of past-year violence (all types) for those reporting acquiring HIV from their parents to those who reported any other mode of acquisition. We further summarized past-year prevalence according to perpetrator types. Venn diagrams were generated to visually depict respondents’ overlapping experiences of physical violence, psychological abuse, and/or forced sex victimization in their lifetimes and in the past year.</p>
                <p>Prevalence estimates were weighted for age (15–19 and 20–24 years) and sex (male and female) using the Zambian 2013–14 DHS [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to be representative of HIV-positive males and females, ages 15–24 years, in Zambia. We used Zambia DHS data to derive the number and proportion of HIV-positive individuals within the following four categories: males ages 15–19 years; females ages 15–19 years; males ages 20–24 years; and females ages 20–24 years. We then divided the DHS proportion by the proportion in our sample to derive a post-stratification weight for each of category that we subsequently applied to our population estimates (<xref rid="pone.0235203.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Reported sample sizes and percentages are all weighted. Differences in proportions were assessed using F tests to accommodate the complex sampling design resulting from the use of sampling weights.</p>

                <p>While a common threshold for physical or sexual violence is one or more acts of violence, researchers have questioned whether this same threshold should apply for psychological abuse, which has more variation in form and acceptability across cultures [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A single act of being insulted, for instance, is thought by many to be too low a threshold to constitute psychological abuse [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hence, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess whether using a stricter definition of past-year psychological abuse would affect the research results. Participants were classified as victims if they reported experiencing two or more acts of psychological abuse from at least one type of perpetrator in the past year. Analyses were carried out using STATA 14 [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>

                <p>Informed consent was obtained from each participant by a study team member in a private space in or near the clinic. Drawing on WHO ethical and safety recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], caregiver consent forms used broad terms to describe the research (e.g. health, safety) to protect minors who may be experiencing violence from the caregiver; youth consent forms included more details about the surveys. Research staff were trained on the ethics of violence research. To minimize under-reporting, violence questions were preceded by less sensitive topics. Introductory text was intended to help participants feel comfortable disclosing their experiences and avoid interpreting questions as judgmental or stigmatizing [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Based on the safety protocol, participants were referred to a HCP at each clinic if reporting severe past-year physical violence, lifetime sexual violence, or past-week suicidal thoughts. HCPs responded according to clinical practice, local policy, and Zambian law. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Review Board and the ERES Converge ethical review board in Zambia, along with the Zambia Ministry of Health through the National Health Research Authority, reviewed and approved the research.</p>

                <p>The estimated prevalence of violence victimization (physical violence, psychological abuse, or forced sex) among HIV-positive AYA in Zambia was 78.2% for lifetime reports and 73.5% for past-year reports (<xref rid="pone.0235203.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Across both timeframes assessed, psychological abuse was most common (70.4% lifetime, 65.3% past-year), followed by physical violence (50.8% lifetime, 44.7% past-year), followed by forced sex (10.5% lifetime, 4.7% past-year). Among victims of physical violence, over one third (36.9% lifetime, 34.0% past-year) experienced severe physical violence. There was weak evidence that females experienced almost twice as much severe physical violence in the past year than males (41.0% vs. 22.8%, p&lt;0.07). Among lifetime victims of forced sex, the age at the first experience of forced sex ranged from 15 to 21 years for males (mean = 16.8 years, SD = 1.8) and 4 to 24 years for females (mean = 16.3 years, SD = 4.8) (p = 0.44 for males vs. females).</p>

Both male and female victims of past-year violence experienced high levels from a friend or peer, especially psychological abuse. However, compared to females, male victims of past-year violence had significantly higher levels of any friend/peer victimization (74.3% vs. 45.1%, p&lt;0.001), with the strongest evidence for a difference by sex found for physical violence (compared to psychological abuse) from a friend/peer. Experiencing violence from multiple perpetrator types was common, as less than half of past-year victims were victims of violence from a single perpetrator type (42.0%).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Almost three-quarters of HIV-positive AYA, aged 15–24 years, in Zambia are estimated to have experienced both lifetime and past-year violence victimization, which is especially concerning since violence victimization may relate to poor HIV-care and treatment outcomes among HIV-positive youth in SSA [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similar to several Violence against Children Surveys (VACS) among adolescents in the region [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we found no statistically significant differences in the overall prevalence of physical violence and psychological abuse according to the youth’s sex. However, we saw weak evidence that the prevalence of past-year <italic>severe</italic> physical violence was almost twice as high among females than males. We also identified nuanced differences in the types of perpetrators: friends and peers were a dominant perpetrator of physical and psychological abuse against males, whereas experiences of violence for females spanned more evenly across a range of perpetrators (i.e. romantic partners, parents/caregivers, other family members, friends/peers). These findings are important because previous studies of violence against HIV-positive youth in SSA, albeit limited in number, have neither distinguished between severity levels of physical violence experienced nor disaggregated perpetrators of violence according to the youth’s sex [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Findings from this study have clinical and programmatic implications. HIV clinics offer a prime setting for identifying and supporting AYA living with HIV who have experienced violence. These clinics must recognize that a large proportion of their AYA patient populations may have experienced violence and need psychosocial support. While some SSA settings screen women for IPV in HIV centers as a standard care procedure [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], HIV-positive AYA should also be screened for multiple types of violence. AYA could be asked whether a given form of violence has occurred and who perpetrated the violence, with the perpetrator types read aloud to help prevent under-reporting. The Abuse Assessment Screening tool, designed for clinical screening of abuse during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], adopts a similar approach and could be adapted for such purposes. To make a screening program successful, however, additional resources either in the clinic or in the community are needed to fulfill the long-term support needs of AYA who have experienced and may continue to experience violence. Beyond clinics, our findings reinforce the need for broader violence-reduction efforts targeting general populations of AYA. We found that violence from friends or peers and family members was common, supporting violence prevention initiatives targeting schools and households [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our results suggest that for HIV-positive AYA, household interventions must engage other family members in the home beyond parents/caregivers. Finally, prevalence differences for male and female AYA highlight the need to tailor prevention and response efforts to the youth’s sex and the perpetrator type. For instance, programs designed to meet the unique needs of adolescent girls and young women living with HIV can integrate violence prevention and response content with a focus on the most common forms and perpetrators.</p>
              <p>Our findings also have implications for the measurement of psychological abuse and sexual violence. Results from our sensitivity analysis reinforce calls in the literature to expand data collection efforts and clarify operational definitions for psychological abuse [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Compared to physical and sexual violence, psychological abuse has received considerably less attention in studies of violence and HIV, reflecting its challenging measurement properties and a perception among some that it does less harm than physical or sexual violence [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A recent publication of WHO MCS data seeking clarity on measurement of psychological IPV will support these efforts [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Importantly, our results underscore the need for such initiatives to explore the measurement of psychological abuse among male as well as female HIV-positive AYA and to include multiple perpetrator types.</p>
              <p>Our removal of three ICAST-C measures of sexual violence suggests value in further testing these items among older youth in intimate partnerships. Youth may not interpret being “made” to do something as an act of coercion [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], particularly where items have been translated into other languages. The results regarding forced sex, however, found that male and female HIV-positive AYA have similar prevalence estimates. Although surprising since reports are typically higher among females compared with male adolescents in SSA [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]—including in Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]—one study conducted with adolescents in South Africa (aged 14–19 years) also found no significant differences in the lifetime prevalence of forced sex victimization (14.3% among females and 10.8% among males) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest a need for further research on the measurement and experience of sexual violence among young HIV-positive men in addition to women in the region.</p>
              <p>While methodological variations between studies make direct comparisons difficult, we situated our findings within existing literature by comparing them with studies that have also examined experiences of multiple forms of violence from a wide range of perpetrators. Our prevalence figures for past-year violence from caregivers and peers were similar to those reported by Cluver et al. in their study among HIV-positive adolescents (ages 10–19 years) in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, more than twice as many youth reported violence from a teacher/school staff member in the Cluver study (41%) compared to in our study (18% of youth aged 15–19). Additionally, whereas about a fifth of youth in the Cluver study reported past-year verbal victimization from a clinician (22%), virtually no participants in our study reported violence from a health care worker (grouped within the “someone else” category in Tables <xref rid="pone.0235203.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0235203.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). It may be that youth in our study felt less comfortable reporting experiences of violence from authority figures (e.g. teachers, clinicians) since surveys were being conducted within HIV clinics. Compared to the VACS among general populations of adolescents in Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and other SSA countries [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we found a roughly similar prevalence of physical violence but higher levels of psychological abuse—even in sensitivity analyses using a more conservative measure of psychological abuse. These findings offer additional support for further research on experiences of psychological abuse among HIV-positive youth in SSA.</p>
              <sec id="sec016">
                <title>Limitations and strengths</title>
                <p>There are limits to this analysis. Given that AYA were sampled from purposively-selected clinics in an urban area and had been on ART for at least 6 months, our findings may not be generalizable to AYA who are living in rural areas or not accessing HIV care/on ART. Results may underestimate the prevalence of violence since those who have experienced violence tend to be less likely to engage in HIV care than those who do not [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235203.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We did not ask youth if the violence they experienced was due to their HIV status—nor did we ask about, and therefore cannot discuss, the sexual orientation of the youth or the sex of the romantic partner perpetrating violence, though sexual minorities may be at higher risk of violence than heterosexuals [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, we did not measure the perpetrator type for lifetime violence exposures or whether the lifetime physical violence or psychological abuse exposure occurred in early childhood versus adolescence, which limits the comprehensiveness of our lifetime victimization results. We may not have captured the full range of youth’s sexual violence experiences beyond physical force, in analyzing only one sexual violence measure. The lower-than-desired Cronbach’s alphas for physical violence and psychological abuse may indicate that these measures did not perform as well as in the populations in which they were developed or were diluted by the presence of sub-categories of violence. Since Cronbach’s alphas are influenced by a number of factors (e.g. test length, dimensionality) [<xref rid="pone.0235203.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], future studies should include a formal assessment of the reliability of these measures among HIV-positive youth. Finally, the precision of our comparisons of victimization experiences by sex and age group may be limited by the small stratified sample sizes, though we note that this study is descriptive in scope and intended to generate rather than test hypotheses.</p>
                <p>Despite these limitations, this study fills an important gap in the literature on violence against HIV-positive AYA in SSA. Key strengths of this study include its focus on multiple types and perpetrators of violence against HIV-positive AYA, and its inclusion of both males and females, as well as adolescents (15–19 years) and young adults (20–24 years). In contrast, large international surveys have typically been limited to examining experiences of violence among general populations of either children up to age 18 (e.g. CDC’s VACS) or women only (e.g. DHS). There has been virtually no previous research on violence victimization among young HIV-positive men ages 20–24 years in SSA.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our findings from Zambia demonstrate that experiences of violence victimization are widespread among youth living with HIV, highlighting the need for greater attention to this public health problem among HIV-positive youth in the region. Study findings show the importance of developing targeted prevention and response efforts that are tailored to the youth’s sex and the perpetrator type. Such efforts are critical to addressing the harmful short- and long-term effects of violence and may also help to prevent the onward transmission of HIV. Future studies should further investigate the intersections between violence victimization and HIV care and treatment outcomes, as well as meanings and operational definitions of psychological abuse and sexual violence, among HIV-positive AYA in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
