                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for mental healthcare that can be delivered remotely and at scale to college students. This study evaluated the efficacy of online self-help for stress among students during the pandemic.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>College students with moderate or higher stress (<italic>N</italic> = 585) were recruited between November 2020 and February 2021, when COVID-19 had a major impact on colleges. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either online self-help using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychology principles to support resilience and coping with pandemic-related stressors (<italic>n</italic> = 301) or referral to usual care (<italic>n</italic> = 284). Stress (primary outcome), depression, and anxiety (secondary outcomes) were assessed at pretreatment, one-month post-treatment, and three-month follow-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Participants in the online self-help condition experienced significantly larger reductions in stress (<italic>d</italic> = –0.18, <italic>p</italic> = .035) and depression (<italic>d</italic> = –0.20, <italic>p</italic> = .018) from pretreatment to post-treatment than participants in the referral group. Reductions in stress from pretreatment to follow-up were also larger in the treatment versus referral group (<italic>d</italic> = –0.23, <italic>p</italic> = .005). Groups did not differ in change in anxiety. More time using the self-help program predicted greater improvement in depression at post-treatment (<italic>d</italic> = –0.41, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and follow-up (<italic>d</italic> = –0.32, <italic>p</italic> = .007), although usage was unrelated to change in stress or anxiety.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Online self-help targeting resilience and coping during the pandemic appears efficacious for long-term alleviation of stress and short-term alleviation of depression symptoms among the college students.</p>

            <p id="p0020">COVID-19 has caused over 260 million infections and over 7.7 million deaths worldwide as of December 2021. [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The pandemic has also caused major economic disruption, and efforts to limit contagion have profoundly changed lifestyles. Consequently, research has indicated heightened mental health concerns among adolescents during the pandemic. [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Despite these concerns, traditional mental healthcare services, such as in-person counseling, have posed infection risk. The pandemic has, therefore, caused a surge of need for mental health services that can be delivered remotely and at scale.</p>
            <p id="p0025">College students are a subsection of the adolescent population that is particularly in need of safe and scalable mental healthcare during the pandemic. Sawyer et al. have argued that adolescence should be defined as around ages 10–24 years, corresponding more closely to adolescent growth, and therefore, an age range of 18–24, the typical age of college students, maps onto this period of substantial social and neurological maturation. [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Research has suggested heightened mental health vulnerability among college students, especially during the pandemic. For example, before the pandemic, 27% of college students reported moderate or higher stress. [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Furthermore, students’ stress and mood disorder symptoms rose during the pandemic, suggesting deteriorating mental health among an already vulnerable group of adolescents. [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although many college counseling centers expanded teletherapy services during the pandemic, [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] such counseling centers have been historically overwhelmed by demand for services, [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the increase in mental health problems likely exacerbated this challenge. Furthermore, some counseling centers might not have been licensed to deliver teletherapy to students attending school remotely while living in different states. Evaluating alternative methods for providing care to college students is a public health priority.</p>
            <p id="p0030">Online self-help interventions, in which users guide themselves through therapeutic content delivered via the internet, could meet the need for remote and scalable mental healthcare among college students. Online self-help interventions are effective in addressing a range of child and adolescent mental health problems, [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] including among college students. [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Accordingly, researchers have suggested using online self-help programs to support mental health during the pandemic, [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and some college counseling centers have expanded online self-help resources offered to students. [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, arguments in favor of online self-help have relied exclusively on studies conducted before the pandemic. The few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining online self-help during the pandemic have provided inconclusive results. One large trial (<italic>N</italic> = 670) found that a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based online intervention targeting worry caused improvements in pandemic-related anxiety relative to a waiting list control, [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] whereas one smaller trial (<italic>N</italic> = 120) found that an expressive writing intervention did not improve stress, depression, or anxiety relative to treatment as usual. [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, neither study targeted adolescents or college students, instead targeting the general adult population. Evaluating online self-help among students is important to support the use of these interventions among students during both the pandemic and future crises affecting entire campus populations (e.g., other pandemics, disasters).</p>
            <p id="p0035">Online interventions should use evidence-based techniques to support resilience and coping with pandemic-related stressors. Positive psychology approaches that help people develop a sense of purpose, harness strengths, and foster social connections may be beneficial for promoting resilience to stress. [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Intervention studies have suggested that targeting these constructs can support mental health during times of stress, [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and perceptions of purpose, strengths, and support have been associated with better mental health in studies conducted during the pandemic. [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Additionally, traditional and third-wave CBT techniques such as relaxation, problem-solving, and mindfulness have substantial support as methods to provide online intervention for stress, anxiety, and depression, [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and they are likely to benefit students during the pandemic. Finally, to aid with pandemic-specific stressors (e.g., isolation, illness risk), it is important to help students identify coping strategies that can be pursued without the risk of contracting COVID-19. [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Because the pandemic’s effects on mental health likely vary across students, intervention components should be accessible at the pace and order of students’ choices.</p>
            <p id="p0040">The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of online self-help for college students facing stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. students with moderate or higher stress during the pandemic were randomly assigned to receive (1) access to a CBT-based and positive psychology-based online self-help program designed to support resilience and coping with pandemic-related stressors or (2) referral for usual care. Stress, depression, and anxiety were assessed at pretreatment, one-month post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. We predicted that the treatment group would experience larger reductions across outcome measures than the referral group.</p>

for a CONSORT diagram. Participants were recruited between November 2020 and February 2021. To be eligible, participants had to currently be a student at a U.S. college or university, 18 years or older, and score moderately or higher on the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-Short Form. [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] These criteria were assessed in an online Qualtrics screening survey that was emailed to students who had provided consent to be contacted regarding additional research opportunities while participating in a screening survey for another project (NCT04162847) and/or whose university administrators had approved survey invitations. In total, 56,939 students received invitations. Furthermore, advertisements for the study were posted in an online research participation bulletin, as well as Reddit forums for students at various colleges (54 forums total). Advertisements provided an email address that interested participants could contact to receive the screening survey. Recruitment materials informed potential participants that the researchers were studying student mental health during the pandemic and how online programs could be used to support mental health. Potential participants were informed that they would be asked to complete a survey that would indicate their eligibility for a second phase of the study involving assignment to one of two conditions designed to support mental health.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participant recruitment, randomization, assessment, and analysis summary.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>
                <p id="p0055">The screening survey showed participants an informed consent document and then assessed eligibility for the RCT. Participants fulfilling screening criteria were informed of their eligibility for the RCT and invited to the online pretreatment survey for the RCT. The pretreatment survey began with an informed consent document, followed by demographic and mental health measures. At the end of the pretreatment survey, participants were informed of their condition. Simple, parallel (1:1) random assignment was performed automatically using Qualtrics’ randomizer; thus, experimenters were blind to allocation. Participants had to reach the end of the pretreatment survey to be randomized and included in the RCT. Participants were emailed the post-treatment survey one month after random assignment and emailed the follow-up survey three months after random assignment. Because all assessments were conducted with online surveys, assessors were blind to condition.</p>

They were provided a link that they could use to create an account on SilverCloud Health and begin using the programs. Programs included several individual modules, each designed to take 20–30 minutes to complete. One program, “Space for Resilience,” used positive psychology principles to support mental health in the face of stress. The “Space for Resilience” program included seven modules: Building Resilience, Purpose, Self, Connection, Body, Mind, and Moving Forward. Modules are outlined in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
. Each module closed with personal stories outlining ways people have put the content into practice, as well as a mindfulness exercise. The other program, “Space from COVID-19,” was guided by the mass trauma intervention principles proposed by Hobfoll and colleagues: [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] promoting a sense of safety, calming, self-efficacy and community-efficacy, connectedness, and hope. These goals were targeted using CBT and grief therapy techniques.

[<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The DASS stress subscale consists of seven statements about stress in the past week, rated from 0 (<italic>Did not apply to me at all</italic>) to 3 (<italic>Applied to me very much, or most of the time</italic>). Item scores were summed and doubled to correspond with the full-length DASS. Participants were eligible if they scored 20 or higher, indicating moderate or greater stress. [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Secondary outcome measures included anxiety and depression, assessed with seven-item subscales on the DASS. The DASS possesses excellent construct validity. [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Cronbach’s alpha was .76 for stress, .81 for anxiety, and .91 for depression. The pretreatment survey also collected the following background information: gender, racial/ethnic minority status, sexual orientation, age, year in school, school geographic region, school sector (private vs. public), whether students were living away from college during the pandemic, and perceived change in mental healthcare access due to the pandemic.</p>

                <p id="p0080">Symptom changes over time were compared across conditions using robust multilevel modeling in the <italic>R</italic> package <italic>robustlmm.</italic> [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Robust multilevel modeling accounts for nonindependent repeated measurements and provides valid inferences in the presence of outliers. Models included main effects of time (pretreatment vs. post-treatment; pretreatment vs. follow-up) and condition (self-help vs. referral), as well as interactions between time and condition. Models also included fixed and random intercepts. Interactions were probed using simple slope analyses to examine symptom change over time in each condition. Missing data were handled using full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) under the missing at random assumption, which states that data are missing randomly after controlling for observed data. [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This assumption is rendered feasible when background variables, termed “auxiliary variables,” are included in analytic models. [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Therefore, models included fixed covariate effects of all background variables (gender, racial/ethnic minority status, sexual orientation, age, year in school, school geographic region, school sector, whether students were living away from college during the pandemic, and perceived change in mental healthcare access during the pandemic).

Additionally, to examine if the rate of program uptake affected results, we re-fit the main analysis models limited to treatment group participants who created accounts on the platform (and all control group participants). Finally, within the treatment group, to test how usage related to outcome, we fit robust multilevel models in which stress, depression, and anxiety were regressed on time (pretreatment to post-treatment; pretreatment to follow-up), usage characteristics (total time using the program; the number of logins to the program), and the interactions between the usage characteristics and time.</p>

Simple slope analysis revealed that participants in the treatment condition experienced large reductions in stress from pretreatment to post-treatment (<italic>ß</italic> = –5.79, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.64, <italic>Z</italic> = –9.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.81) and pretreatment to follow-up (<italic>ß</italic> = –6.79, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.74, <italic>Z</italic> = –9.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.83), whereas participants in the referral condition experienced medium reductions in stress from pretreatment to post-treatment (<italic>ß</italic> = –3.95, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.59, <italic>Z</italic> = –6.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.57) and pretreatment to follow-up (<italic>ß</italic> = -4.01, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.66, <italic>Z</italic> = –6.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.52). Thus, online self-help was associated with larger stress reduction than referral for usual care during the acute treatment period, and these stress reductions were maintained at follow-up.</p>
                <p id="p0110">On secondary outcomes, there was also a significant interaction between pretreatment to post-treatment time and condition in the prediction of depression (<italic>ß</italic> = –2.26, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.96, <italic>Z</italic> = –2.36, <italic>p</italic> = .018, <italic>d</italic> = –0.20), showing greater improvement in the self-help condition, but no interaction between pretreatment to follow-up time and condition in the prediction of depression (<italic>ß</italic> = –0.96, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.09, <italic>Z</italic> = –0.88, <italic>p</italic> = .379, <italic>d</italic> = –0.07). Simple slope analysis revealed that participants in the treatment group experienced a medium to large reduction in depression from pretreatment to post-treatment (<italic>ß</italic> = –5.29, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.71, <italic>Z</italic> = –7.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.65), whereas participants in the control group experienced a small to medium reduction in depression (<italic>ß</italic> = –3.03, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.65, <italic>Z</italic> = –4.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.40). In predicting anxiety, there were not significant interactions between condition and pretreatment to post-treatment time (<italic>ß</italic> = –1.02, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.82, <italic>Z</italic> = –1.24, <italic>p</italic> = .215, <italic>d</italic> = –0.10) or pretreatment to follow-up time (<italic>ß</italic> = –0.89, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.93, <italic>Z</italic> = –0.96, <italic>p</italic> = .337, <italic>d</italic> = –0.08). Thus, online self-help recipients experienced a significantly larger reduction in depression during the acute treatment period, although depression improvements were not different across groups at follow-up. Moreover, groups did not differ in change in anxiety over time.</p>

                <title>Exploratory analyses</title>
                <p id="p0115">Among the 301 participants in the treatment group, 158 accessed the self-help platform, indicating 52.5% uptake. Participants who accessed the platform averaged 2.04 total logins (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.57) and 13.58 total minutes logged in (<italic>SD</italic> = 33.50). Results from the analyses limited to treatment group participants who created accounts on the platform (and all control group participants) were identical to those from the main analyses (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A1</xref>). Within the treatment group, greater time using the program predicted greater reduction in depression from pretreatment to post-treatment (<italic>ß</italic> = –0.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.02, <italic>Z</italic> = –3.45, <italic>p</italic> = .001, <italic>d</italic> = –0.41), as well as greater reduction in depression from pretreatment to follow-up (<italic>ß</italic> = –0.06, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.02, <italic>Z</italic> = –2.72, <italic>p</italic> = .007, <italic>d</italic> = –0.32). No other usage characteristics predicted stress, depression, or anxiety changes (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A1</xref>). Thus, there was a dose-response relationship on depression but not on stress or anxiety, such that greater time using the self-help program was related to greater depression improvement.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0120">The results supported the efficacy of online self-help for stress in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who received access to online self-help experienced larger reductions in stress and depression during the acute treatment period than students who received referral information. The larger stress reductions in the treatment group were sustained at follow-up. Results did not favor the intervention for treating anxiety. Although effects sizes were small (0.18–0.23), they indicated potential for an important public health impact of self-help programs using positive psychology and CBT principles for students during the pandemic.</p>
              <p id="p0125">Online self-help was efficacious in treating stress and depression during the acute treatment period. The intervention group did not experience greater reductions in anxiety than the referral group, suggesting that the intervention might be less effective in treating anxiety. It is worth noting that anxiety was less elevated at pretreatment than stress and depression. Stress and depression may therefore be especially representative of mental health reactions during the pandemic and especially amenable to positive psychology and CBT-based stress management skills.</p>
              <p id="p0130">Stress reductions in the intervention group remained larger than those in the control group at three-month follow-up. Thus, the intervention appeared to promote durable improvements in stress. This finding suggests possible long-term benefits of providing online self-help programs to college students. Because the self-help programs emphasized building stress management habits, students might have continued to use the skills taught in the intervention after the one-month acute treatment period.</p>
              <p id="p0135">Within the self-help group, greater time spent using the program predicted a greater reduction in depression, indicating a dose-response relationship between usage time and depression improvement. This result converges with other findings that have suggested greater usage of online programs is associated with better depression outcomes. [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Interestingly, there were no such dose-response relationships between usage metrics and improvement in stress or anxiety. Other trials have also found an absence of dose-response relationships between usage and outcome in online interventions for students, [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] suggesting that there is no single optimal usage profile. Further understanding the causes and consequences of online self-help usage is another important direction for future research.</p>
              <p id="p0140">Important limitations of this study deserve note. First, the control group received a referral, and we do not have data on how many of these students sought treatment. Although this control group allowed examining the efficacy of online self-help above and beyond available resources, it precluded addressing questions such as how online self-help compares to more intensive (yet potentially costly) interventions (e.g., teletherapy). Additionally, there was a high rate of missing post-treatment and follow-up data, and the rate of missing data differed across the treatment and control groups. Although both of these problems are common in internet intervention research, [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and we used gold-standard methods for handling missing data, [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] collecting data from a greater proportion of the sample would strengthen generalizability.</p>
              <p id="p0145">In conclusion, the present study suggested that online self-help is an efficacious method for reducing stress and depression among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing widespread access to online self-help based on CBT and positive psychology principles could help alleviate widespread mental health symptoms in the student population during the pandemic and future campus-wide crises.</p>
