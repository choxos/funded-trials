                <p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The primary aims of this Stage I pilot randomized controlled trial were to establish the feasibility of integrating exercise and nutrition counseling with Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a novel intervention that unites training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills to target mechanisms underpinning appetitive dysregulation a pathogenic process that contributes to obesity among cancer survivors; to identify potential therapeutic mechanisms of the MORE intervention; and to obtain effect sizes to power a subsequent Stage II trial. <bold>Methods:</bold> Female overweight and obese cancer survivors (N = 51; mean age = 57.92 ± 10.04; 88% breast cancer history; 96% white) were randomized to one of two 10-week study treatment conditions: (<italic>a</italic>) exercise and nutrition counseling or (<italic>b</italic>) exercise and nutrition counseling plus the MORE intervention. Trial feasibility was assessed via recruitment and retention metrics. Measures of therapeutic mechanisms included self-reported interoceptive awareness, maladaptive eating behaviors, and savoring, as well as natural reward responsiveness and food attentional bias, which were evaluated as psychophysiological mechanisms. <bold>Results:</bold> Feasibility was demonstrated by 82% of participants who initiated MORE receiving a full dose of the intervention. Linear mixed models revealed that the addition of MORE led to significantly greater increases in indices of interoceptive awareness, savoring, and natural reward responsiveness, and, significantly greater decreases in external eating behaviors and food attentional bias—the latter of which was significantly associated with decreases in waist-to-hip ratio. Path analysis demonstrated that the effect of MORE on reducing food attentional bias was mediated by increased zygomatic electromyographic activation during attention to natural rewards. <bold>Conclusions and Implications:</bold> MORE may target appetitive dysregulatory mechanisms implicated in obesity by promoting interoceptive awareness and restructuring reward responsiveness.</p>

              <p>Among the myriad of identified risks associated with cancer development and poorer prognosis, behavioral risk factors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are potentially modifiable via preventive and interventive efforts. Wellness interventions that integrate personalized nutrition counseling and exercise training have achieved modest short-term weight loss, but do not target the underlying mechanisms of obesity onset and maintenance, resulting in more than 80% to 85% of individuals regaining weight lost or even exceeding pre-intervention weight within 3 to 5 years post-intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Among women, 55% of all cancers are associated with overweight and obesity, compared with 24% among men,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> yet effective long-term behavioral treatments for obesity remain elusive. Systematic reviews have repeatedly shown that obesity interventions among cancer survivors that utilize a comprehensive approach with dietary, physical activity, and behavior modification components are the most successful in the short term.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, to date, the behavior modification components of such interventions have largely been based solely on cognitive behavioral approaches, and few studies have evaluated the specific therapeutic components that contribute to intervention efficacy, or how underlying psychophysiological mechanisms are affected.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> There is, therefore, a pressing need for studies of obesity interventions for cancer survivors that disentangle the mechanistic effects of cognitive intervention components from exercise and nutrition components. Moreover, novel therapeutic interventions that target the underlying maladaptive cognitive and affective mechanisms of obesity development and maintenance are needed.</p>
              <p>The etiology and epidemiology of obesity is complex and multifactorial in nature, but is thought to be driven in part by appetitive dysregulatory mechanisms. Eating highly palatable food, such as energy-dense food with high fat and sugar content, is a potent reward that can be become increasingly salient and overconsumed in patterns that mirror other disorders of appetitive regulation such as addiction.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Animal models<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and human neuroimaging studies<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> demonstrate appetitive dysregulation in brain reward systems during both the development and maintenance of excess adiposity. Such reward dysregulation may be explicated by the allostatic model of addiction,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which proposes that overstimulation of neural reward circuits with potent and addictive rewards (like highly palatable and calorie-dense foods) can increase sensitization to appetitive stimuli coupled with reduced capacity to experience pleasure from natural rewards. With regard to obesity, this allostatic process of shifting reward thresholds may result in an attentional bias toward food cues<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and decreased sensitivity to nonfood natural rewards.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Decreased responsiveness to rewards has also been observed among cancer patients and may contribute to lower cancer-related quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Appetitive dysregulation may encourage eating behaviors triggered by the sight of palatable food (ie, “external eating”), especially when exacerbated by the deficits in interoceptive awareness that prevent overweight and obese individuals from detecting signals of satiety that could otherwise be used to regulate food consumption.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The conceptual definitions of interoceptive awareness proposed by both Mehling et al<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and Farb et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> integrate both metacognitive awareness of internal body signals and evaluative interpretation of those signals.

              <p>To remediate deficits in appetitive regulation and interoceptive awareness, a therapeutic integration of mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, and savoring techniques has been proposed.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Specifically, mindfulness may be used to enhance both attentional control and interoceptive awareness.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Disengagement of attention from appetitive cues coupled with awareness of interoceptive signals can then facilitate reappraisal—a reframing of the meaning of appetitive stimuli that can in turn increase contextually appropriate inhibitory control over urges. This process may then facilitate savoring, the practice of amplifying natural reward processing via intentionally focusing and sustaining attention on the sensory features of pleasant experiences (ie, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, etc) as well as one’s positive affective and somatic response to that experience.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> With regard to food-related reward, mindfulness training has been shown to increase food enjoyment and liking,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> which are in turn associated with increases in positive mood following eating<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and reduced caloric consumption.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Such effects might be understood in light of the <italic>restructuring reward hypothesis</italic>,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which proposes that using mindfulness, reappraisal, savoring to increase the value of natural, healthy rewards will decrease the relative reward value of maladaptive appetitive stimuli, and thereby attenuate attentional bias toward those stimuli with consequent effects on decreasing addictive behavior. To the extent that obesity is driven by allostatic mechanisms, shifting valuation toward natural nonfood rewards and away from unhealthy, calorically dense food rewards may treat appetitive dysregulation underlying obesogenic behavior.</p>

              <p>The aims of this Stage I pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) were the following: (1) to establish the feasibility of combining MORE with exercise and nutrition for overweight and obese cancer survivors; (2) to identify potential therapeutic mechanisms of the MORE intervention; and (3) to obtain effect sizes to power a subsequent Stage II trial. With regard to Aim 2, we hypothesized that adding MORE to an exercise and nutrition counseling program would result in significantly greater improvements in therapeutic mechanisms including interoceptive awareness, maladaptive eating styles, and savoring than exercise and nutrition counseling without MORE.</p>
              <p>We also examined natural reward responsiveness and food attentional bias as potential psychophysiological mechanisms of the MORE intervention. Measuring sensitivity to appetitive food and nonfood natural rewards through self-report scales is prone to shortcomings, including social desirability bias and deficits in interoceptive awareness.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Appetitive response to both food and nonfood rewards may instead be objectively examined via attentional performance on cognitive tasks like the dot probe<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and psychophysiological measures such as facial electromyography (EMG), which assesses emotional expressions based on the affective valence of sensory cues; zygomatic EMG activation, in particular, quantifies smiling in response to cues with positive affective valence.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Facial EMG indexes food palatability,<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> reward responsivity to positive food and nonfood stimuli among healthy controls,<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and deficits in processing both food and nonfood rewards in individuals with eating disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="bibr45-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr46-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Moreover, facial EMG in response to emotional stimuli discriminates obese from nonobese individuals.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Thus, intervention-related changes in zygomatic EMG activation in response to rewarding stimuli may indicate remediation of the appetitive dysregulation that undergirds obesogenic behaviors in cancer survivors.

Experiential exercises were also adapted to address cancer survivorship in order to enhance relatability to the target audience. MORE sessions involved mindfulness training to promote interoceptive awareness and increase control over appetitive automaticity; reappraisal training to promote negative emotion regulation; and savoring training to ameliorate reward processing deficits. MORE is typically conducted in weekly 2-hour sessions, but in order to match MORE to the established POWER program, session length was reduced to 1.5 hours; this reduction in length was achieved by abbreviating time spent in group processing. MORE sessions were administered by a Master’s-level licensed clinical social worker, who received intervention training and supervision directly from the developer of MORE. Each session was audio-recorded and reviewed by the last author to monitor therapist adherence to the modified treatment manual via a fidelity measure that specified both prescribed and proscribed therapist behaviors. Deviations from manualized treatment protocol were reviewed during weekly clinical supervision meetings and corrected by the therapist in subsequent sessions. No major deviations were noted, and minor deviations were observed infrequently, particularly as adherence improved over time.</p>
                <p>Each MORE session included formal mindfulness meditation and experiential exercises, debriefing of those exercises, homework review, and weekly didactic material covering the following topics: gaining awareness of automatic habits via mindfulness; regulating negative emotions through mindful reappraisal; savoring pleasant experiences derived from nonfood rewards; regulating food craving through mindfulness; overcoming craving by coping with stress; promoting acceptance; awareness of impermanence; defusing relationship triggers; cultivating meaning in life; and developing a mindful recovery plan.</p>

                <p>Of the 110 participants who were originally screened, 57 (52%) were excluded from participation due to a range of issues including BMI being too low (n = 3), no cancer diagnosis (n = 1), previous mindfulness experience (n = 2), medical complications related to cancer that prevented participation in a physical exercise program (n = 10), scheduling conflicts with study interventions (n = 21), geographic barriers (n = 8), and declined to participate or lost contact (n = 12). Of the 51 participants who were assessed and randomized to intervention conditions, 37 (73%) initiated the study interventions and attended one or more sessions, and 29 (79% of those who attended one or more sessions) completed the treatments. Four participants were lost to posttreatment assessment. The majority (77%) of nonstarters cited inability to meet the time commitment required by study involvement as a reason for their withdrawal from the study prior to the beginning of treatment. The remainder of the nonstarters withdrew due to unrelated medical issues that precluded their continued participation in the study. The treatment retention rate among starters was high, with 82% of those who began MORE receiving a full dose (N = 14; completed 7 or more sessions). Among control condition participants who started the POWER program, 75% also received a full dose (N = 15), demonstrating that the additive MORE component enhanced instead of detracting from retention rates despite the increased time commitment involved.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This Stage 1 RCT demonstrated the feasibility of integrating a mindfulness-based therapy, MORE, into an exercise and nutrition program for overweight and obese cancer survivors, as evidenced by a substantial number of eligible participants initiating and being retained in the combined mind-body intervention. Given the well-known difficulty of recruiting and retaining cancer survivors in behavioral intervention studies,<sup><xref rid="bibr67-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> interest in participating in the current study interventions was moderately high, demonstrated by the fact that we recruited the target sample size in less than a year and &lt;11% of participants declined to participate or maintain contact with study staff. Yet, barriers including scheduling conflicts, geographic distance, and medical complications precluding participation revealed key challenges in deploying group-based behavioral interventions for a cancer survivor population. Beyond issues of feasibility, the present study also identified therapeutic mechanisms of MORE, showing that the adding MORE to an exercise and nutrition program significantly improved cognitive and affective factors related to underlying mechanisms of appetitive dysregulation and obesogenic behaviors.</p>
              <p>Notably, MORE significantly decreased attentional bias toward food cue, and reduced self-reports of externally cued eating behaviors. Although we did not examine the neural correlates of this effect, decreases in attention to calorie-dense food stimuli might be associated with reduced activation in brain regions associated with food reward—a finding observed in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pilot study of obese cancer patients participating in a behavioral lifestyle intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr68-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> Taken together with data from previous studies demonstrating significant effects of MORE on attentional biases<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and neural responses to addiction-related stimuli,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> the present findings suggest that MORE may reduce the extent to which individuals are “triggered” to engage in appetitive behavior. It should be noted that effects were observed on dot-probe trials when food cues were presented for 50 ms, suggesting that MORE may reduce automatic attentional orienting to palatable food stimuli. In the present study, decreases in food attentional bias were significantly associated with improvements in waist-to-hip ratio, a marker of visceral adiposity that has been shown to predict cancer risk<sup><xref rid="bibr69-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> and mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr70-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Hypothetically, patients in the MORE POWER intervention whose attention became less biased toward the sight of palatable food stimuli may have been better able to reduce their consumption of calorie dense foods, resulting in decreases in abdominal obesity that might ultimately be protective against cancer recurrence.</p>
              <p>In addition, MORE significantly increased the self-reported capacity to savor positive experiences and heightened zygomatic EMG responses (eg, smiling) to natural nonfood rewards—replicating previously demonstrated effects of MORE on increasing autonomic,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> EEG,<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and fMRI<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> indices of natural reward processing. In these three prior studies, increased physiological indices of natural reward processing were associated with decreases in craving and/or consumption of addictive substances. Recently, in a sample of chronic opioid users, MORE was found to increase cardiovascular responsiveness to cues representing natural rewards relative to drug-related reward cues, with this shift in relative reward responsiveness predicting clinically significant decreases in opioid misuse.<sup><xref rid="bibr71-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> Data from the present study parallel these earlier results by demonstrating that increases in EMG indices of natural reward responsiveness mediated the effects of MORE on decreasing the food attentional bias, suggesting that MORE may indeed modify associative learning mechanisms by strengthening cognitive control functions to restructure the relative salience of food and nonfood rewards in line with goal states (e.g., weight loss and overall health promotion). Taken together with these earlier results, the current mediational finding provides evidence for the <italic>reward restructuring hypothesis</italic><sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> by suggesting that amplifying responsivity to natural rewards may attenuate the relative value of appetitive cues (manifested in the present study by a decrease in food attentional bias), and thereby potentially decrease addictive behavior.</p>
              <p>In the present trial, MORE was also associated with significant improvements in self-reported interoceptive awareness, a mechanism that may prevent overeating in the face of ubiquitous encounters with appetitive cues in the obesogenic sociocultural environment.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr72-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> By noticing body sensations via mindfulness techniques, individuals may become more attuned to interoceptive signals of hunger and satiety. Furthermore, the ability to self-regulate by mindfully attending to body sensations might provide a means of coping with food craving. Also, given that interoceptive brain activity has been shown to be dysregulated among breast cancer patients experiencing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy,<sup><xref rid="bibr73-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> the effects of MORE on enhancing interoceptive awareness may be especially beneficial for cancer survivors. To be clear, the observed effects were on self-reported interoceptive capacity. Future studies should examine the effects of MORE on performance-based measures of interoception (e.g., heartbeat detection tasks, testing of gastric capacity thresholds)<sup><xref rid="bibr74-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> to determine if increasing awareness of the physiological condition of the body can confer benefits for healthy eating.</p>
              <p>The primary limitation of the present study relates to the measurement of weight-related outcomes in a sample of cancer survivors, which is challenging given the potential long-term effects of therapies including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone modulation on fatigue, reduced mobility, loss of lean muscle mass, and increased adiposity.<sup><xref rid="bibr75-1534735419855138" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Future studies should control for individual differences in cancer disease progression and cancer treatment due to their potential to confound accurate measures of weight-related outcomes; unfortunately, we were unable to control for these variables as covariates in the present pilot study due to the modest sample size. Also, the present study was limited by the body composition measures utilized, which could not accurately differentiate changes in fat versus muscle tissue. Future studies should include more reliable, objective measures of fat and fat-free mass, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis. The effects of MORE on weight loss should also be investigated in overweight and obese participant samples without cancer, where measurement of adiposity is uncomplicated by the many potential confounders introduced by cancer and cancer treatment. In addition, given the pilot nature of this trial, the sample size does not provide optimal statistical power. However, the purpose of the present study was to obtain effect sizes to inform an optimally powered clinical trial. Larger and more ethnically/racially diverse samples composed of patients with a wider array of diagnoses would enhance the generalizability of future studies. In that regard, there was some cultural bias in the food dot-probe task, in that the food images presented might not be salient to other cultural groups, and thus expanding the diversity of the sample might require modification of food stimuli used in the task. It should be acknowledged that there were a number of attriters and nonstarters in the study, which may be due in part to the unstable health of recent cancer survivors. The study was also limited by the lack of follow-up data across all variables, which precludes an understanding of the duration of treatment effects, as well as a lack of process data including daily mindfulness practice, home exercise, and nutrition, all of which likely influenced intervention effects. Unfortunately, due to the absence of these data, we do not know to what extent the addition of MORE led to changes in diet and exercise patterns. Future efficacy tests of MORE for more diverse samples of overweight and obese individuals should employ full-scale RCTs with longitudinal assessment of clinical outcomes and process variables including daily measures of mindfulness practice, home exercise, and nutrition.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, study results indicate that although adding MORE to an exercise and nutrition program did not significantly improve weight loss among cancer survivors, the mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills taught in this integrative intervention may modulate mechanisms implicated in obesogenic behaviors, including interoceptive awareness, attentional bias, and natural reward responsiveness. Whether changes in these mechanisms are necessary or sufficient for clinically significant weight loss in this population is as yet unknown. Findings from this early stage pilot RCT suggest that MORE may have promise for targeting the appetitive dysregulation underlying loss of control over eating and excess adiposity, which might reduce risk for cancer-related morbidity and mortality.</p>
