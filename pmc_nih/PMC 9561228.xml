                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>We examined change in antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence after breastfeeding (BF) cessation using hair tenofovir (TFV) concentrations as an objective metric of medication consumption.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>A subset of postpartum women in Zimbabwe randomized in IMPAACT PROMISE to take ART while BF and post-BF cessation had hair TFV measured longitudinally. Using linear mixed-effect models, we estimated differences in hair TFV levels after BF cessation, accounting for trends in levels over time regardless of BF status and change in slope after breastfeeding cessation. We also estimated the relative risk of viremia (&gt;50 copies/mL) per doubling of hair TFV concentration.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Among 55 women (median age 26, interquartile range 24–29 years), hair TFV levels (n = 305) were available for a median of 9 visits per woman between 3 and 29 months postpartum. Hair TFV levels ranged from undetected to 0.25 ng/mg (median 0.04 ng/mg). Controlling for trends since delivery [decline of 2.2% per month, 95% confidence interval (CI): −5.3 to 1.0], TFV levels averaged 24.4% higher (95% CI: −5.1 to 63.1) post-BF cessation than during BF, with no change in slope (0.0% per month, 95% CI: −3.8 to 3.9). Postpartum, 42% of women were ever viremic. Higher TFV levels were strongly protective; relative risk of viremia per doubling of TFV was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43 to 0.63; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Leveraging an objective metric of ART use, we observed modestly declining adherence across the postpartum period, but no additional decline associated with breastfeeding cessation. High viremia frequency and varying postpartum TFV levels observed highlight the importance of enhanced adherence support with viral load monitoring among postpartum women.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, where breastfeeding is the norm, approximately 1.1 million women living with HIV became pregnant in 2020.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) can reduce the risk of perinatal transmission to almost zero and benefit maternal health.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite accessing universal ART, women can experience significant challenges to adherence and engagement to HIV care,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> with 20%–40% of women experiencing elevated viral loads postpartum.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Breastfeeding cessation may be critical juncture when intense contact with the health care system ends.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Moreover, when risk of transmission of HIV to the infant passes, women's capacity to adhere to ART could change. Declining adherence after pregnancy has been attributed to declining concern about in utero transmission and failure to optimize women's own health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Few studies measure adherence among healthy women, no longer at risk of transmitting HIV to their infant after breastfeeding cessation.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In addition, breastfeeding cessation is often followed by a subsequent conception (within 2 years) in settings with high fertility rates, underscoring the importance of sustained viral suppression to maximally reduce the risk of HIV transmission.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> UNAIDS estimates for 2020 showed that 37% of infants who acquired HIV were born to women who had initiated ART before the pregnancy, signaling the need to better understand adherence in this period.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Measuring adherence to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) is vital for monitoring response to treatment. Suboptimal adherence leads to virologic failure, development of resistance, and onward transmission, including transmission of resistant mutations.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Commonly used adherence measures such as pill counts may inadequately predict virologic outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Drug concentrations in hair provide an objective measure of cumulative adherence.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We assessed how ART adherence changed with breastfeeding cessation by longitudinally measuring hair TFV levels in a subset of postpartum women enrolled in the IMPAACT PROMISE randomized trial in Zimbabwe. In addition, we estimated the association between hair TFV levels and virologic suppression.</p>

It included a series of open-label, parallel randomization components. In the postpartum component (within 14 days postdelivery), women not requiring ART for their own health were randomized to either maternal ART (TDF/FTC+LPV/r) or daily infant nevirapine prophylaxis during breastfeeding.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Women on ART in the postpartum component at BF cessation were randomized to continue or stop ART (maternal health component) (consistent with the country guidelines at that time).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This analysis includes participants in Zimbabwe who were randomized to ART in both the postpartum and maternal health components and participated in a hair substudy throughout these 2 components at the 3 study clinics. Participants attended study visits at least quarterly, with more frequent visits in the first 3 months of each component. Hair samples and detailed breastfeeding questionnaires were collected at all visits, and HIV viral load was assessed at least every 6 months. All participants provided written informed consent before participation. This study was reviewed and approved by local and collaborating institutional review boards, relevant regulatory authorities, and reviewed for safety and efficacy by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board.</p>

The outcome was log<sub>2</sub> transformed hair TFV levels, and we included 3 predictors in the model to assess the impact of breastfeeding cessation on hair levels. First, the indicator variable for breastfeeding status described above: This variable quantifies the differences in hair TFV levels at postbreastfeeding visits vs. still-breastfeeding visits; second, a linear term reflecting months since delivery to account for changes in hair TFV levels over time regardless of breastfeeding status; and third, an additional linear term, measuring time since breastfeeding cessation, to quantify how the slope of TFV levels since delivery changed after breastfeeding cessation. Because quadratic terms for these time trends did not have <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values &lt;0.10, we only included linear terms in regression models. To facilitate the interpretation of associations between predictor variables and a log-transformed outcome, we back-transformed regression coefficients to reflect percent differences in hair levels associated with a unit change in each predictor.</p>

Nevertheless, a decline in hair TFV levels, although not statistically significant, continued at approximately 2% per month throughout breastfeeding and the first year after cessation, and this temporal trend itself would eventually lead to lower average levels after cessation.</p>
              <p>Consistent with previous studies, we confirmed that hair TFV levels strongly predicted viremia,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> including low-level viremia. Importantly, we observed viremia in over a third of women in the first 2.5 years after delivery which mirrors what has been reported in previous research about declining ART adherence among postpartum women who initiated on ART for life during pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The frequency of viremia we observed among women engaged in care and receiving intensive adherence support is concerning. Poor adherence and viremia during breastfeeding may result in HIV transmission to the child.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> WHO recently recommended that people living with HIV with viral load &gt;50 copies/mL should undergo enhanced adherence counseling with frequent viral load monitoring.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This will require health worker time and additional resources to implement. In this study, women received adherence support every 3 months with viral load monitoring every 6, but many still missed doses.</p>
              <p>In addition, an objective measure of adherence together with an elevated viral load, if availed in the public sector, could help differentiate between virologic failure because of poor adherence versus resistance and/or drug–drug interactions. Enabling health care workers to offer enhanced adherence counseling to those with challenges or to consider switching regimens or providing resistance testing earlier where appropriate. Thus, the early objective measurement could avoid development of resistant mutations which make treatment options challenging in the future.</p>
              <p>Within our study, we were not able to assess the role of pharmacokinetic variability. To counter this, we analyzed multiple hair samples collected at various time points and demonstrated a strong association between higher hair levels and reduced risk of viremia. Women who stayed on ART for their own health were not included in this analysis because they were deemed to be naturally different from those who were eligible for randomization. In addition, the ART regimen in this study was different. It included a protease inhibitor and multitablet dosing. The currently recommended single daily tablet of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir may promote better adherence and viral suppression, warranting further study of hair TFV trends postpartum and their associations with viremia. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate remains a common component of ART regimens globally; thus, the findings remain relevant. Future research on cost-effectiveness is warranted.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we observed modestly declining adherence across the postpartum period, but no additional decline associated with breastfeeding cessation, which is reassuring. Nevertheless, the frequency of viremia we observed highlights the vulnerability of the postpartum period, indicating the need for added focus on long-term ART adherence to achieve the ambitious pediatric HIV elimination target by 2030.</p>
