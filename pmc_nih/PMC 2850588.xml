                <p>The ongoing US Glatiramer Acetate (GA) Trial is the longest evaluation of
                    continuous immunomodulatory therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
                    (RRMS). The objective of this study was to evaluate up to 15 years of GA as a
                    sole disease-modifying therapy. Two hundred and thirty-two patients received at
                    least one GA dose since study initiation in 1991 (mITT cohort), and 100 (43%,
                    Ongoing cohort) continued as of February 2008. Patients were evaluated every 6
                    months using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Mean GA exposures were
                    8.6 ±5.2, 4.81 ±3.69, and 13.6 ± 1.3 years and
                    mean disease durations were 17, 13, and 22 years for mITT, Withdrawn and Ongoing
                    cohorts, respectively. For Ongoing patients, annual relapse rates (ARRs)
                    maintained a decline from 1.12±0.82 at baseline to 0.25 ±
                    0.34 per year; 57% had stable/improved EDSS scores (change ± 0.5
                    points); 65% had not transitioned to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
                    (SPMS); 38%, 18%, and 3% reached EDSS 4, 6, and 8. For all patients on GA
                    therapy (the mITT cohort), ARRs declined from 1.18 ± 0.82 to 0.43
                    ± 0.58 per year; 54% had stable/improved EDSS scores; 75% had not
                    transitioned to SPMS; 39%, 23%, and 5% reached EDSS 4, 6, and 8. In conclusion,
                    multiple sclerosis patients with mean disease duration of 22 years administering
                    GA for up to 15 years had reduced relapse rates, and decreased disability
                    progression and transition to SPMS. There were no long-term safety issues.</p>

              <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a lifelong, progressive disease and a majority of patients
                with relapsing–remitting (RRMS) disease develop secondary-progressive MS
                (SPMS) within two decades of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458509358088">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458509358088">2</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important to
                prevent accumulation of long-term disability and slow inflammatory and
                neurodegenerative MS pathology. Mechanisms related to relapse and remission during
                early MS may differ from those associated with an unremitting chronic progression of
                disease, and the findings of the multiple disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) trials
                in SPMS have demonstrated that they are for the most part unreliable in slowing the
                progression of disability over intervals up to 3 years (glatiramer acetate [GA],
                Copaxone; IFNβ-1a IM, Avonex; IFNβ-1a SC, Rebif;
                IFNβ-1b SC, Betaseron).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458509358088">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458509358088">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>As the availability of immunomodulatory therapy for MS is relatively recent (within
                the last two decades), data regarding their prospective long-term effects on
                disability is just beginning to be accumulated. Follow-up assessments of patients
                participating in the short-term controlled clinical trials of the interferon beta
                (IFNβ) drugs have found that patients continuing to take IFNβ
                drugs at the time of the later follow-up visit have better neurologic status than
                those who report more limited exposure to MS treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458509358088">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458509358088">12</xref></sup> Conclusions based on the
                findings of these studies must be tempered by the studies’ methodological
                limitations: importantly, data were collected after considerable intervals during
                which patients were not monitored and patients had frequently discontinued,
                switched, or added other immunomodulators to the IFNβ drug under study.</p>
              <p>Two recent prospective non-randomized open-label studies have attempted to assess the
                continuous use of DMTs for 7–8 years. Trojano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458509358088">13</xref></sup> evaluated the effects of DMT use over 7 years of follow-up and Brown et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458509358088">14</xref></sup> over 25 years of follow-up (the DMT treatment period in the latter study was
                up to 8.4 years). Although caution must be used in evaluating the results of these
                studies due to the uncontrolled nature of open-label studies, the findings of these
                studies suggest that, as a group, DMTs delayed accumulation of disability in RRMS
                patients as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and
                conversion to SPMS compared with no treatment.</p>
              <p>The ongoing US Glatiramer Acetate Trial is unique in that it is an open-label study
                that prospectively and regularly evaluates patients with RRMS on continuous therapy
                with a single immunomodulating agent for an extended period of time. Now at the 15th
                year of the study, patients ongoing in the study have an average of 13.6 years of GA
                treatment. Beginning in 1991, 251 RRMS patients enrolled in the multicenter
                placebo-controlled double-blind US pivotal trial. At the end of the double-blind
                placebo-controlled phase, placebo patients were crossed over to GA and the
                prospective open-label study was begun. The clinical effectiveness and safety of GA
                in this study have been reported at 2 and 3 years compared with placebo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458509358088">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458509358088">16</xref></sup> and at 6, 8,

                    intention-to-treat (mITT) population reported here differs from the original ITT
                    cohort (n ¼ 251) of the pivotal trial in that the mITT cohort

                    open-label extension and are excluded from the mITT cohort). The mITT population
                    is sub-divided into two patient cohorts, the Ongoing cohort, who are patients
                    that continued in the study as of February 2008, and the Withdrawn cohort, who
                    are patients that withdrew from the study at some point after starting GA
                    therapy. At the time of data cut-off for this analysis, February 2008, 100
                    patients continued in the ongoing study (Ongoing cohort). Patients who had
                    received GA from randomization had been treated for up to 15 years and patients
                    originally randomized to placebo had been receiving GA for up to 13 years.</p>

                <p>Neurological status is evaluated in the clinic every 6 months by EDSS. Patients
                    are examined within 7 days if they experience symptoms suggestive of a relapse
                    (appearance or reappearance of one or more neurologic abnormalities persisting
                    for at least 48 hours, preceded by a stable or improving neurological state of
                    at least 30 days duration). During the open-label phase, laboratory assessments
                    (chemistry panel) and vital signs are documented at 6-month study visits. In
                    most cases, patients are assessed by the same neurologists and study

                <p>Any patient who discontinued daily GA for any reason, or who took another
                    immunomodulator, was withdrawn from the study. Thus, while in the study, these
                    RRMS patients received only continuous GA monotherapy for disease modification.
                    Reasons for withdrawal were classified into three categories: (1) withdrawal due
                    to adverse events, (2) lost-to-followup, and (3) withdrawal due to
                    ‘patient decision’ or ‘other’. The
                    reasons under the patient decision/other category were further divided into
                    subcategories to gain a better understanding of why patients discontinued the

                <p>Demographic characteristics were collected for the year prior to patients
                    starting GA therapy. Time of ‘disease onset’ was defined
                    as the time patients experienced their first MS symptom (reported by patients at
                    study entry). Changes in disability were measured by mean yearly EDSS scores and
                    mean changes in EDSS from GA start to the last observation while on GA in the
                    mITT, Ongoing, and Withdrawn patient cohorts. EDSS at GA start was the EDSS
                    score of the patient when they began GA therapy (i.e. at randomization for
                    patients originally randomized to GA, and at entry into the open-label extension
                    study for patients who were initially randomized to placebo). Categorical
                    analyses of patients’ neurological status were performed; patients
                    were classified as ‘stable/improved’ if EDSS scores were
                    changed by ≤ 0.5 EDSS points, did not change, or decreased from onset
                    of treatment; ‘worsened’ status was used to describe
                    increases of more than 0.5 EDSS points.</p>

                    The propensity scores were constructed for each patient using a logistic

                    binary variables (the proportion of patients reaching EDSS scores 4, 6, and 8)
                    and /-tests were used for continuous variables (last EDSS score while on GA and

                    and urinary tract infections, headache, and pain. Adverse events thought to be
                    related to GA therapy were consistent with known side effects of GA
                    administration and included local injection-site reactions (e.g. erythema, pain,
                    nodules, edema) and symptoms associated with an immediate post-injection
                    reaction (IPIR), which may have included vasodilation, chest pain, palpitation,
                    tachycardia, or dyspnea. No apparent time-dependent adverse events emerged. No
                    evidence of hematologic, hepatic, or renal dysfunction; immunosuppression;
                    emergence of malignancy; or development of other autoimmune disease was
                    observed. There was one death due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia
                    that was not believed to be drug related.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Results of this prospective, ongoing, open-label study indicate that long-term
                continuous GA use is safe and that the majority of the patients continuing on GA
                therapy in the study have had few relapses and minimal disease progression. With a
                mean disease duration of 22 years and mean patient age of 50 years, two-thirds of
                patients receiving continuous GA as sole immunomodulatory therapy for 15 years have
                not tran-sitioned to SPMS, 57% have retained stable or improved EDSS scores over the
                course of the study, and 82% remain ambulatory without mobility aids. No unforeseen
                adverse events to GA therapy occurred.</p>
              <p>While receiving GA, the Withdrawn cohort, which included all patients who received at
                least one GA dose and subsequently left the study, and the Ongoing cohort patients
                appeared to do comparably well; however, it is important to remember that the mean
                disease durations in these cohorts were different (13 versus 22 years,
                respectively). Outcomes in the Withdrawn cohort reflect the last observed value
                carried forward, and patients who left the trial may have done so at any stage in
                their disease course. Although patients withdrew for many stated reasons, a
                significant proportion did so because they may have had more significant progression
                of clinical disability than those who stayed in the study. Approximately 41% of all
                patients who withdrew from the study indicated that they perceived that their
                disease was progressing or that they wanted to switch treatments. Of the withdrawal
                patients, those who progressed to SPMS had a mean EDSS of 6.2 with disease duration
                of 17 years. No follow-up neurologic assessment has been performed on the eight
                patients who have left the study since the 2003 assessment.</p>
              <p>Our results are prospective and should not be compared directly with those of recent,
                retrospective investigations on the benefits of long-term DMT use. In other
                long-term follow-up studies, patient assessments have been relatively infrequent,
                patient populations are different or less well defined, disease durations and
                follow-up intervals vary, subjects are not on a single drug and the studies use
                diverse methodologies and definitions for data collection and reporting. This
                open-label prospective extension study of GA as single immunomodulatory therapy,
                with highly controlled, consistent follow-up, is the only long-term study in MS in
                which patients were required to remain on a single immunomodulator and not switch or
                add concomitant immunotherapy. The long-term extension studies of IFNß-1b
                (16-year follow-up visit) and IFNß-1a SC (PRISMS 8-year follow-up visit)
                included time periods in which patients may have used other immunomodulatory therapy
                or none at all. In the 16-year follow-up study of IFNß-1b, the mean time
                since diagnosis in the long-term follow-up (LTFU) cohort (260/372, 70%) was 20
                        years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458509358088">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458509358088">24</xref></sup> Of patients who received IFNß-1b for more than 80% of
                the 16-year interval, approximately 44% reached EDSS ≥6 and 29% reached
                EDSS 8. The estimated median time to EDSS 6 in those patients was approximately 13
                years. For those patients on IFNß-1b for less than 10% and between 10%
                and 80% of the 16-year interval, 44% and 31% reached EDSS 8, respectively. In the
                current study, only 18% of Ongoing patients, with slightly longer disease duration
                (22 years), reached EDSS 6 and 3% reached EDSS 8 while on GA. In addition, the
                proportion of patients who were judged to have converted to SPMS in the
                IFNß-1b study was 45% versus 35% of Ongoing patients and 25% of mITT
                patients in this GA study.</p>
              <p>In the 7- to 8-year follow-up to the PRISMS study of IFNß-1a SC, 382 out
                of 560 patients returned for a single follow-up assessment (approximately 13 years
                from disease diagnosis for the ITT population).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458509358088">9</xref></sup> Of the original PRISMS ITT cohort, 20% (110/557) had reached EDSS
                ≥6 (regardless of treatment), roughly the same proportion of Ongoing
                patients in the current study who had a disease duration of 22 years. In PRISMS LTFU
                patients, mean increase from baseline EDSS score at 8 years from study start was 1.1
                point and approximately 60% of patients had a 1.0-point EDSS progression. In the
                current study, Ongoing patients had a mean increase of 0.6 EDSS points at the
                15-year follow-up and 57% had progressed ≥0.5 EDSS points.</p>
              <p>In long-term studies such as this, there are inherent limitations that make it
                inappropriate to draw definitive conclusions about the clinical efficacy of a
                therapy. Weaknesses of the current study include lack of a concurrent randomized
                control group and the potential for selection bias when patients with more
                aggressive disease drop out over time. At an observational level, the results of
                this study show that, for the patients with RRMS taking continuous daily GA for up
                to 15 years, there has been a consistent low relapse rate and slow progression of
                disability. It is also possible that these patients were destined to have relatively
                mild MS and have therefore chosen to remain on the medication longer than those with
                more severe disease. The reader will need to consider the implications of these
                opposing conclusions in interpreting the results presented.</p>
              <p>The safety of GA therapy in these patients has not changed from what has been
                reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458509358088">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458509358088">19</xref></sup> The commitment of patients in the study to take daily SC
                injections for 15 years underscores the long-term tolerability and patient
                acceptance of GA. The study will continue for 20 years of prospective followup.</p>
