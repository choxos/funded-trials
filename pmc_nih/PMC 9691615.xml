              <abstract>
                <p>High saturated fat diets have been shown to raise blood levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) and induce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). CCK receptors are expressed on stellate cells and are responsible for hepatic fibrosis when activated. The purpose of this study was to test the safety and dose of a CCK receptor antagonist, proglumide, in human participants with NASH. An open‐label single ascending dose study was conducted in 18 participants with clinical NASH based upon steatosis by liver ultrasound, elevated hepatic transaminases, and a component of the metabolic syndrome. Three separate cohorts (<italic toggle="no">N</italic> = 6 each) were treated with oral proglumide for 12 weeks in a sequential ascending fashion with 800 (Cohort 1), 1,200 (Cohort 2), and 1,600 (Cohort 3) mg/day, respectively. Blood hematology, chemistries, proglumide levels, a biomarker panel for fibrosis, and symptom surveys were determined at baseline and every 4 weeks. Abdominal ultrasounds and transient elastography utilizing FibroScan were obtained at baseline and at Week 12. Proglumide was well tolerated at all doses without any serious adverse events. There was no change in body weight from baseline to Week 12. For Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, the median percent change in alanine aminotransferase was 8.42, −5.05, and −22.23 and median percent change in fibrosis score by FibroScan was 8.13, −5.44, and −28.87 (kPa), respectively. Hepatic steatosis as measured by controlled attenuation parameter score significantly decreased with proglumide, (<italic toggle="no">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Blood microRNA biomarkers and serum 4‐hydroxyproline were consistent with decreased fibrosis at Week 12 compared with baseline. These findings suggest proglumide exhibits anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrotic properties and this compound is well tolerated in participants with NASH.</p>

                <p>The inclusion criteria comprised male and female participants' ages 18–85 years with radiographic imaging of fatty liver disease AND elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase, (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AND one of the following: body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes based on an abnormal HbA1c. Eligible participants included those with evidence of mild to moderate fibrosis (F1 to F3) by transient elastography FibroScan. Participants on statins were eligible, and statins were continued at the same dose for the duration of the study.</p>
                <p>The exclusion criteria included those with evidence of active drug/alcohol abuse, and those with chronic viral hepatitis B or C, autoimmune hepatitis, or drug‐induced liver disease.</p>
                <p>Those with evidence of cirrhosis on exam, by biopsy, by imaging, or with a kPa score on FibroScan ≥ 14, or a history of HCC were excluded. Laboratory tests that warranted exclusion included: leukocyte count &lt; 3.5 K/UL; hemoglobin &lt; 9.5 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen &gt; 30 mg/dL (hydrated); creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL; ALT/AST &gt; 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2× ULN; abnormal total bilirubin; and abnormal prothrombin time or increased international normalized ratio or a platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Those with a history of gall bladder disease without surgical removal were excluded. Those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were excluded. Participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, with HbA1C &gt; 8, or patients with diabetes that have not been on stable doses of antidiabetic medication for at least 90 days prior to the screening visit were excluded.

                <title>Study design and objectives</title>
                <p>This investigation was an open‐label phase I study in participants with clinical NASH. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and determine the recommended phase II dose of proglumide. The secondary objectives were to assess the effects of proglumide on serum liver transaminases, and fibrosis and steatosis scores by the FibroScan. An exploratory objective included evaluating a noninvasive blood biomarker panel for hepatic fibrosis improvement.</p>
                <p>The study was conducted using three cohorts of participants with increasing doses of the investigational drug, proglumide. Six participants were recruited for each of the three cohorts for a total of 18 participants in this study. Each cohort was treated with proglumide by mouth for 12 weeks in sequential order as follows: the first cohort received proglumide at 800 mg/day; the second cohort was treated with proglumide 1,200 mg/day, and the third cohort received 1,600 mg/day of proglumide. After obtaining informed consent, participants were evaluated at a screening visit with a complete history and physical exam, inclusion criteria laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasound, and FibroScan. Eligible participants were scheduled for a baseline visit within 28 days where weight and BMI were calculated, an interim examination was performed, repeat liver profile was obtained to assure persistent elevation of transaminases, a medication and symptom diary were provided, and medication was dispensed. A baseline blood sample was obtained for proglumide blood levels and for research analysis of the liver fibrosis using a biomarker panel. Participants were provided a schedule with follow‐up visits at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16. At each of the visits weight was recorded; laboratory tests were collected for safety analysis; an interim history and physical exam were performed; the adverse events and drug accountability were evaluated; and a new supply of medication was dispensed. At baseline and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 blood was collected for the proglumide levels and biomarker fibrosis panel. At Week 12, an abdominal ultrasound was performed and a fasting FibroScan was obtained to determine liver stiffness by transient elastography with steatosis evaluation by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. A follow‐up safety visit was scheduled after stopping proglumide (Week 16) where participants had repeat chemistries and complete blood count performed.</p>
                <p>After the participants in each cohort completed the treatment, the laboratory tests, adverse events, and imaging results were provided in a blinded fashion to the Safety Monitor for evaluation. The Safety Monitor was required to confirm there were no safety issues in each cohort before recruitment into the next dosing cohort was allowed.</p>

                <p>Proglumide is a water‐soluble CCK receptor antagonist manufactured using good manufacturing practice criteria by AMSA S.p.A. – Cosma S.p.A. (Milan, Italy). The bulk compound was &gt; 99% pure by ultra high‐performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Proglumide was compounded into vegan capsules with each capsule containing 400 mg by Custom Scripts Pharmacy (Lancaster, PA). Participants in Cohort 1 were administered proglumide using 400 mg by mouth twice daily for a total daily dose of 800 mg. Cohort 2 was treated with proglumide 400 mg orally three times daily or 1,200 mg/day, and Cohort 3 was administered proglumide 800 mg by mouth twice daily or 1,600 mg/day. The investigational pharmacist labeled the research medication at each site and dispensed it every 4 weeks during the treatment period.</p>

                <title>Study assessments</title>
                <p>Laboratory blood tests including a hematology panel, a chemistry panel, a liver profile, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test (as needed) were evaluated at each visit for safety analysis. Parameters were established in the clinical protocol for early stopping rules and halting of the study for certain elevations in hepatic transaminases and significant changes in other laboratory values.</p>
                <p>Participants' drug compliance and adverse events were recorded in patient diaries and reviewed at each visit. In addition, a side effect questionnaire was performed at each visit that specifically asked if side effects over the past month included the following: loss of appetite, itching, chest pain, shortness of breath, trouble urinating, diarrhea or constipation, and headache or confusion. Adverse events and any protocol deviations were recorded with the level of severity, whether the investigation drug was held or continued, and the likelihood of whether the side effect was related to proglumide. The adverse events were reported to the safety monitor, the respective Institutional Review Boards, and the FDA at the required intervals or during the annual progress report.</p>
                <p>Blood samples were collected to measure proglumide blood levels by mass spectroscopy in the Georgetown University Lombardi Core Metabolomics and Proteomics facility and serum 4‐hydroxyproline levels were measured in Cohort 3 using the ultra‐high performance liquid‐chromatography–mass spectrometry.

In Cohort 3, half of the participants had higher proglumide blood levels detected at Week 12 than at Week 8, suggesting that Cohort 3 had not yet reached steady state. However, this difference could be due to the fact that more of the Cohort 3 participants had afternoon appointments and their proglumide blood levels had started to decline. We previously showed<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> in participants with cirrhosis and healthy controls, peak blood levels occurred within 1 hour after injections. Once maximum, the drug concentration was reduced to half in about 2.5 hours (C<sub>max1/2</sub>). In the prior pharmacokinetics study, proglumide blood samples were collected after a single does several times over a 24‐hour period. Therefore, we believe the C<sub>max</sub> values are related to the time of ingestion before the sample was collected. All three participants with stage F3 fibrosis had C<sub>max</sub> proglumide values greater than 24,000 ng/mL. Two of these participants were in Cohort 3; however, neither of these participants experienced side effects or adverse events. The third participant with F3 fibrosis from Cohort 1 had a proglumide C<sub>max</sub> value at week 8 of 26,219.5 ng/mL. This participant (Participant 2) reported side effects with proglumide, including nausea, constipation, and increased thirst (see <bold>Table</bold>
<xref rid="cpt2745-tbl-0001" ref-type="table"><bold>1</bold></xref>). It is uncertain whether the side effects reported by this individual were related to the higher proglumide values, because others reported gastrointestinal side effects without elevated proglumide blood levels. These results may, however, suggest that those with more advanced liver fibrosis have the potential for acquiring higher blood levels; and if side effects are reported in these participants, dose reduction may be warranted.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This study represents a novel approach to managing the NASH epidemic by targeting the CCK receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, the trial was based upon evidence from murine models of NASH and represents true bench‐to‐bedside translational research. This investigation met its primary outcome by demonstrating that oral proglumide had a broad safety profile and was well tolerated without toxicity in participants with F1–F3 fibrosis and clinical NASH. The few side effects reported were minor and none led to discontinuation of the drug. Participants were compliant with self‐administration according to patient diaries and also confirmed by measurement of proglumide blood levels. We observed important changes in hepatic transaminases, fibrosis, and steatosis scores that would predict proglumide to be beneficial in proceeding with a phase II randomized placebo controlled trial. A 12‐week period is probably not long enough to demonstrate significant changes in fibrosis and liver inflammation, but we gathered this information to determine the feasibility and help with sample size calculation for a phase II trial. We noted significant improvement over the 12‐week period in ALT and steatosis scores and near‐significant decline in fibrosis scores as determined by FibroScan. These changes observed in our study occurred without any confounding documented weight loss; in fact the mean body weight of our participants slightly increased over the study in spite of the team’s recommendation to encourage healthy diets, weight loss, and exercise. Therefore, the improved transaminases and FibroScan scores most likely were the result of proglumide.</p>
              <p>We selected three doses of proglumide to use in this study; a low, medium, and high dose. Proglumide was developed years ago for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>; however, commercialization was halted with the development of the more potent proton pump inhibitors. These early trials included over 600 participants in 15 clinical trials that confirmed the broad safety profile of this compound. Pharmacokinetic studies performed in rats and human participants showed the metabolism and kinetics in the rats and humans were comparable and that the recommended oral dose of proglumide in people was 400 mg three times daily or 1,200 mg/day.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> We recently completed a pharmacokinetic single‐dose study testing proglumide in participants with Child‐Pugh A and B cirrhosis and found the C<sub>max</sub> and time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) were comparable to that of healthy controls.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Since the current study was the first clinical trial in participants with NASH, we selected a proglumide dose that was lower and a dose higher than the 1,200 mg/day dosing used in earlier peptic ulcer disease studies. Although all three doses were well tolerated in participants with NASH, we observed the greatest decline in ALT and liver stiffness by FibroScan using the highest dose. Furthermore, there were no reported adverse events in participants administered the highest dose of proglumide; therefore, 1,600 mg/day would most likely be the selected dose to move forward with a phase II trial. Measurement of proglumide blood levels was beneficial in this study because they not only confirmed patient compliance and a dose‐related effect, but we found that three participants with advanced F3 fibrosis experienced the highest C<sub>max</sub> proglumide values. Our protocol that accurately measures proglumide blood levels with mass spectrometry will be useful in future trials, in the event that side effects occur, thus allowing for dose reduction if necessary.</p>
              <p>The CCK peptide is a trophic hormone and has been shown to stimulate proliferation and DNA synthesis in the pancreas.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Proglumide is unique among this class of receptor inhibitors in that it is a nonselective CCK receptor antagonist with affinity to both the CCK‐A and CCK‐B receptors.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Proglumide may exert its effects in NASH by several different mechanisms of action.

GPCRs are known to “cross‐talk” or influence the action of other GPCRs, either by sensitizing or desensitizing the intracellular signaling or downstream pathways or by the formation of heterodimers.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Since proglumide reduces cytokine and chemokine expression in murine NASH livers,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> proglumide may exert its anti‐inflammatory effects in the liver by cross‐talk with chemokine receptors and reducing cytokines. Proglumide is the only CCK receptor antagonist that increases bile flow<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and decreases bile acid concentration in animal models; therefore, we studied the interaction of proglumide with FXR using a human luciferase reporter assay and demonstrated that proglumide interacted with FXR as a partial agonist.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Since bile acids are affected by the gut microbiome, chronic proglumide therapy in mice also altered the microbiome, rendering it less hepatotoxic and increasing beneficial bacteria species.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> These reasons are some of the myriad potential mechanisms through which proglumide may interact to decrease NASH.</p>
              <p>Numerous investigations are being done to explore noninvasive biomarkers or that predict response to therapy to avoid liver biopsy. Although liver biopsies are generally safe in those with mild liver disease, they are not without risk<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> and also deter some participants from participation in research trials. Due to their stability in the circulation,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> either protein‐bound or exosome‐encapsulated microRNAs have shown promise in evaluation of fibrosis in NASH.<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> In our mouse models,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> we found a significant portion of miRNAs that were upregulated by proglumide in tissues and blood (e.g., miR‐185‐5p,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> miR‐378a‐3p,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> miR708‐5p,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and miR‐346‐5p,<xref rid="cpt2745-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref>) had previously been shown to inhibit fibrosis, inflammation, or both from activated hepatic stellate cells. A significant fold increase in the expression of these miRNAs would imply there was fibrinolysis or cessation of fibrogenesis in the livers of our study participants while administered proglumide. Further investigation of these miRNAs in combination with other noninvasive tests including transient elastography, hydroxyproline, and protein biomarkers may help determine the response to therapy without performing a liver biopsy.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, therapy with the oral CCK receptor antagonist, proglumide, is safe and well tolerated in participants with clinical NASH. Due to its safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy, these results warrant further investigation to determine the efficacy of proglumide in those with NASH and its role in reversing hepatic fibrosis.</p>
