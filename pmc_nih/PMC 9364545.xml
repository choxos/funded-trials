                  <p id="Par2">168 (129 males, 39 females) who received an ICD for secondary prevention (SCA N = 65; other arrhythmia N = 103) were randomized to one of two study conditions: SCT intervention (N = 85) or usual care (N = 83). Outcomes were measured at baseline hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months: (1) Physical Function: Patient Concerns Assessment (PCA), SF-36 (PCS); (2) Psychological Adjustment: State Trait Anxiety (STAI), CES-D depression, SF-36 (MCS); (3) Self-Efficacy: Self-Efficacy (SCA-SE), Self-management Behaviors (SMB), Outcome Expectations (OE).

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par28">Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity that occurs without warning or with symptoms of &lt; 1 h duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Age-adjusted mortality rates for SCA in the U.S. have declined from 138/100,000 in 1999 to 97.1/100,000 in 2017, thus impacting about 180,202 adults/year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately 70,000 individuals are discharged from the hospital each year after combined out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the post-resuscitation period, the majority of survivors of SCA with cardiac disease will receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as the mainstay of treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par29">At the time this study was conducted, the criteria for receipt of an ICD for secondary prevention of SCA included: (1) survivors of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT), (2) structural heart disease with spontaneous sustained VT, (3) syncope with sustained VT or VF induced with electrophysiological study (EPS), or (4) non-sustained VT due to prior myocardial infarction (MI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)% ≤ 40%, and inducible VF or sustained VT at EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, survivors of SCA and those who receive an ICD are a heterogenous group, ranging from those who have no known cardiac disease to those who have complicated chronic cardiac conditions. SCA survivors present with unique cognitive, psychological, emotional, and functional needs as a consequence of resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These unique needs are known to prevent return to work, resumption of normal daily activities, and performance of family and social roles, impacting overall quality of life. Evidence suggests that consequences of SCA survival can exist for long periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Interventions have been tested to address these unique needs and promote post-SCA adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but a consistent structured and comprehensive approach to assessment and rehabilitation after SCA is not available or part of routine post-arrest care. This study was conducted because we have RCT data from a large sample of secondary prevention patients, some of whom had experienced SCA. As well, the study addresses specific questions about the impact of a focused intervention on SCA recovery outcomes apart from other patients who get an ICD for complex arrhythmias.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The purpose of this study was to describe longitudinal change in physical and mental health over the first year post-implant for two distinct ICD secondary prevention groups: patients who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and those who received an ICD for other complex cardiac arrhythmias. We hypothesized that intervention effects across time would be moderated by a history of SCA [intervention x time x ICD indication]. This study fills a major gap in the scientific literature by identifying potential differences between SCA survivors and other ICD secondary prevention patients in response to an intervention program, designed to enhance quality of life and return to functional status. This study provides findings to address specific needs and experiences of SCA survivors, and describes outcomes comparable to the general secondary prevention ICD population.</p>

                <p id="Par31">This secondary analysis is based on a longitudinal randomized clinical trial that tested the effects of a 2-month, combined education and telephone intervention, delivered by trained cardiovascular nurses, compared to usual care (UC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The original RCT was conducted between 1999 and 2003, a time that preceded implantation of ICDs for primary prevention of SCA. The short-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and longer term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] primary outcomes of the intent-to treat results were reported previously. During this trial, the use of therapeutic hypothermia was not a standard of care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. All patients in this study received implantation of a transvenous lead ICD system. Measurements were collected the first week after hospital discharge, and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months following hospitalization for the initial ICD implant. All research procedures were reviewed and approved by hospital Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the academic IRB prior to contact with potential participants. The protocol was conducted following relevant guidelines and regulations. Participants were identified during hospitalization by catheter laboratory nurses who worked in medical centers in the Pacific Northwest. All patients who agreed to speak with the study personnel were contacted by telephone the day after hospital discharge by the investigators who explained the study and obtained verbal consent to participate. Then, written informed consent and baseline measures were completed and participants were randomized to study condition (SCT intervention vs UC) using a random number generator program.</p>

                <title>Sample</title>
                <p id="Par32">Study participants (n = 168) included individuals who had experienced a first time out-of-hospital SCA or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia requiring ICD implantation for secondary prevention based on established guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this sample of 168, 65 patients had suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and were admitted and discharged from the hospital alive. The other 103 patients received an ICD for other secondary prevention reasons, including symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, with or without electrophysiologic (EPS) testing. Criteria also included the ability to read, speak and write English, having telephone access, and willingness to be followed for 1 year. Individuals were excluded from the study if they had significant clinical comorbidities that prevented their return home after hospitalization or if they were younger than 21 years of age. Confirmation of SCA and the need for ICD implantation were verified using medical records and EPS reports. All participants were screened at recruitment using the Short Blessed cognitive screening tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Short Blessed scores ≥ 10 indicated cognitive impairment too severe for participation. Two individuals were not eligible for study participation based on the Short Blessed criteria.</p>

                <title>Social cognitive theory (SCT) intervention</title>
                <p id="Par33">The SCT intervention consisted of two key components: (1) structured information (SI) provided in a booklet mailed to study participants, and (2) nursing telephone support (NTS) conducted by expert cardiovascular nurses. Expert cardiovascular nurses had a minimum of 5 years of experience as a cardiovascular nurse and had extensive training in the NTS protocol. Intervention nurses were part of the research team, not employed as staff nurses in the participating medical centers, and did not deliver usual care.</p>
                <p id="Par34">The intervention components were based on Bandura’s SCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and previous research with survivors of SCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A complete description of the theoretical framework used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the nursing intervention is published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The nursing intervention was unlike any interventions currently used in clinical practice and was specifically designed to match the Domains of Concern previously validated with this population. The SI booklet, Sudden Cardiac Arrest: A Survivor’s Experience, contains two components: (1) a descriptive component including individual verbatim statements about experiences of others during the first year of recovery and (2) a management component outlining successful strategies (skills) used by others in dealing with issues in recovery. The purpose of the SI booklet was to describe the experiences one can expect to encounter during recovery after an ICD and offer suggestions for behavioral strategies to deal with the issues.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The NTS protocol was a telephone intervention delivered over 2 months subsequent to ICD implantation. The purposes of the NTS intervention were to (1) teach specific knowledge and behavioral skills needed to manage ICD recovery, (2) enhance self-confidence (self-efficacy) in one’s ability to deal with illness demands, and (3) reduce emotional arousal and anxiety. Telephone calls were designed to last approximately 15–20 min. Each call was carefully scripted to include the following elements: (1) check-in about current concerns, (2) assessment of the topic for the week, (3) review of common recovery experiences, (4) discussion of behavioral strategies for dealing with the topic for the week, (5) provision of positive feedback for strategies already working well, (6) anxiety reduction statements, (7) practice of new behaviors using role-playing and problem solving techniques, (8) summarization, (9) setting specific goals for the upcoming week, and (10) collaborating on a learning assignment for the subsequent week. Content of the nursing intervention included physical symptoms, activity progression and exercise, emotional reactions, ICD shocks, partner relationships, safety and maintenance of the ICD, and dealing with health care providers.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Intervention participants received study materials following completion of the baseline questionnaire. Participants were asked to read the SI booklet within the first week after hospital discharge and to refer to it during NTS calls. All intervention calls occurred during the first 2 months following ICD implantation. In addition to the NTS calls, intervention participants could access the intervention nurse during regular business hours via a toll free telephone Monday to Friday, or via pager after hours (24 h/day). Over a 2-year period, 16 (19%) of 84 individuals used the nurse pager a total of 18 times, the majority of whom called about the ICD (75%). The other 25% of calls were related to general medical topics.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Usual care participants received standard treatment from their health care providers. Usual care consisted of standardized hospital-based education about the ICD in the form of a booklet, videotape, or both. A pre-study program review revealed that the type and content of information provided during hospitalization were similar across the ten recruitment sites. Both groups were monitored for exposure to additional interventions, participation in educational or support groups, and counseling. In both groups, 97% reported receiving ICD device information and/or viewing an ICD related videotape during their hospitalization for ICD implantation. Both groups received outpatient follow-up clinic visits at times and frequency as designated by their health care providers.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Initially, the distributional properties of the study variables, outlier cases, and missing data were characterized. As the proportion of missing data was less than 5%, imputation procedures were not used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD) and histogram displays were used to compare sociodemographic variables for the full sample, and the four independent groups defined by ICD indication and intervention condition. Oneway ANOVA was used (SPSS version 19.0) to describe baseline differences among four groups defined by (1) SCT Intervention or usual care) and (2) ICD indication: sudden cardiac arrest or other cardiac arrhythmia. The effects of ICD indication on intervention outcomes were compared using a two-factor, repeated measures design with generalized estimating equations (GEE), comparing changes from baseline to 12 months for indicators of physical function, psychological adjustment, and self-efficacy (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). The effect of ICD indication on intervention outcomes was examined across the 12-months post-ICD (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), adjusting for the baseline values of outcome measures as well as age, gender, site, and ethnicity. These analyses were exploratory, designed to uncover potential differences associated with SCA, thus no adjustments were made for multiple tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

In brief, 243 patients were screened for study participation and 168 (69%) were randomized to either the SCT intervention (N = 85) or to usual care (N = 83). Of the 243 individuals who were screened, 28 (11.5%) were ineligible based on ventricular arrhythmia criteria; 8 (3.3%) did not return baseline questionnaires within 1 month of hospital discharge and were not enrolled; 18 (7.4%) chose not to continue after reviewing the questionnaire packet; 20 (8.2%) did not want to participate in the telephone intervention or could not be contacted after hospital discharge; and 1 person wanted to receive more money to participate. Of the 168 who were randomized over 12 months, 10 participants did not want to complete follow-up questionnaires; 2 developed terminal cancer and decided not to continue; 3 died from heart failure,1 due to renal failure, and 1 due to valvular heart disease; and 1 participant withdrew. Complete data were available on 150 of 168 (89%) at all time points over 12 months. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes for those who did vs did not complete all data collection. With two exceptions, there were no statistically significant differences between the study groups on baseline characteristics. Specifically, participants in the intervention group were more likely to live with a significant other or spouse with whom they had an intimate relationship (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and to have experienced a myocardial infarction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05) prior to receiving the ICD.</p>

There were no significant intervention group differences noted by the PCS.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par49">This study indicated that SCA survivors who received an initial ICD, compared to individuals who did not suffer a SCA but had an ICD implanted for a ventricular arrhythmia, had differing trajectories of recovery in physical function, psychological adjustment, and self-efficacy outcomes over 12 months while participating in a SCT intervention. The new findings from this analysis demonstrate that SCA survivors compared to patients with other arrhythmias had: (a) higher numbers of self-reported symptoms regardless of the intervention, (b) non-linear trajectory of recovery in self-reported mental health (decline in mental health at 6 months in intervention group, return to baseline by 12 months), with both indication groups ending up with similar mental health at 12 months, (c) lower numbers of ICD shocks over 12 months in the SCT intervention compared to those with other arrhythmias, and (d) lower outcome expectations over 12 months, but similar levels for both groups at 12 months.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Prior systematic reviews (N = 4) of QOL, physical, and psychosocial function following SCA have demonstrated there is significant heterogeneity in survivor characteristics, methodologies and measurement tools used, limiting conclusions that can be made of the impact. Elliott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] conducted a review of 70 studies of patient reported outcomes post-SCA, concluding that QOL after SCA was generally good in 46 studies, neutral in 17 studies, and poor in 7 studies. When survivors were asked to compare current QOL with the pre-SCA QOL, two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] noted that almost all judged they were happy with current QOL. Green et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reviewed cognitive function, QOL, and mental health post-SCA, concluding that fatigue is a common long term symptom, some survivors suffer from lack of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) early in recovery, and mental health concerns are prevalent (61% experienced anxiety, 45% depression, 27% PTSD). Haydon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reviewed 36 studies noting that QOL post-SCA was good, and did not differ markedly from the general population, ICU patients, or other survivors of cardiac disease. The 2 papers reporting QOL &gt; 15 years post-SCA, demonstrated that QOL was acceptable longer term. This variability in measurement times and instruments has prompted suggestions that a more standard approach to assessment of patient centered outcomes following SCA be adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par51">In this study, those who had a SCA reported higher symptoms and fewer ICD shocks across 12-months. Higher levels of physical symptoms may be expected in SCA participants given they are recovering from resuscitation, ICU stays, and prolonged hospitalization. In addition, SCA participants reported lower physical health in the first month after the ICD implantation. However, from 3 to 12 months, SCA survivors reported improved physical health that became superior to the participants receiving an ICD for other cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Following hospital discharge, SCA survivors may experience a number of significant physical health impairments including musculoskeletal (MSK), neurological, and cognitive issues lasting weeks to months. Muscle weakness (7–17%), fatigue (50%), chest wall pain from CPR and procedures (4–66%), and speech or swallowing difficulty (0–11%) can be present for 3–12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Physical and occupational therapy, exercise interventions, and other specific therapies have been shown to improve physical function. Education to patients and families about expectations post-arrest can improve adaptation to physical impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par53">Psychological adjustment was lower in SCA survivors in overall mental health, anxiety, and depression across the first 6 months. However, at 12 months, SCA survivors reached similar levels of psychological adjustment to those who did not have a SCA in all three psychological adjustment outcomes. The longest follow-up report in SCA survivors (up to 8 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] noted that PTSD was present in 27%, with these individuals also reporting lower quality of life, self-care, and more pain and depressed mood. Those who were younger reported higher levels of PTSD. Dougherty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] noted that anxiety, depression, anger, and stress was elevated in SCA survivors who received an ICD shock compared to those who had no ICD shock over the 1st year following resuscitation. Kamphius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] followed SCA survivors over 12 months noting that significant anxiety was present in 61% at hospital discharge that was reduced to 49% over 12 months, depression was present in 37% and was not reduced at 12 months of follow-up. Comparing SCA survivors who received therapeutic hypothermia to those with STEMI after 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], SCA survivors had more frequent anxiety (24% vs. 13%) and more depression (19% vs. 8%). Factors related to more anxiety and depression included receiving ICD shocks, younger age, being female, and having more disease burden. Interventions used to address psychological recovery after SCA have included medications, cognitive behavioral therapy, self-management interventions, and psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">Dimensions of self-efficacy had a similar trajectory independent of having a SCA. Self-confidence to care for oneself, self-management behaviors, and outcome expectations were similarly stable in all groups over time. Self-efficacy is the belief about one’s capabilities to exert control or self-confidence to perform a behavior, and is thought to be the most powerful causal determinant of motivation and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interventions to improve physical and psychological adjustment in post-ICD recovery have been developed, but self-efficacy, a potential mechanism of intervention effectiveness, has not often been studied as a mediator or an outcome of interventions. Evidence from RCTs that have tested the use of the SCT interventions demonstrate outcome benefits in a variety of chronic and cardiac conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In our intervention research, we have demonstrated the important role of self-efficacy in impacting physical and psychological outcomes after an ICD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In SCA survivors, strengthening elements of the intervention to impact self-efficacy and outcome expectations need to be considered.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Importantly, while resuscitation care for SCA has evolved over the last decade, little has changed in the post-SCA assessment, rehabilitation, and chronic illness management to address the longer term physical and psychological effects of survival. This SCT intervention was one of the first studies to implement a home-based telephone nursing intervention to impact health outcomes after ICD implant in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the time the study was conducted, little was known about the trajectory of recovery in physical and mental of SCA survivors compared to all others who had a secondary indication for ICD implant. By determining the specific response to the SCT intervention in SCA survivors, we have uncovered unique aspects of recovery that are commonly impeded after SCA. The study provides clinically relevant knowledge for post-SCA supportive care that can be used to address these unique needs of SCA survivors, including recognition and management of symptoms, provision of more assessment and management of mental health issues, and increasing confidence that implementing self-care will improve one’s overall health.</p>
              <sec id="Sec19">
                <title>Strengths/limitations</title>
                <p id="Par56">There are decided strengths to this analysis. There was a relatively large number of SCA survivors who participated in the study over a short period of time. Data were collected prospectively so that changes and trends in outcomes could be described and reported. The SCT intervention was carried out with high fidelity, and there were few drop-outs over 12 months. Reliable and valid measures were used to represent each outcome of interest. The limitations of the analysis include the data were collected prior to the widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia post-resuscitation, thus certain outcomes (e.g. cognitive function) may not be similar to SCA survivors today. This RCT was conducted before the approval of ICD implantation for primary prevention of SCA. Thus, the generalizability of the findings are not applicable to persons who receive an ICD for primary prevention. The programming of ICDs for treating ventricular arrhythmias has changed since the original study was conducted, and thus may impact the total number of ICD shocks received by this study sample compared to patients managed with current ICD programming algorithms. The analysis was not powered to detect statistically significant differences between SCA patients and those with other cardiac arrhythmias, thus the study is exploratory and descriptive.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par57">Post-SCA care has changed little over the last several decades. However, because of improvements in EMS systems and post cardiac arrest resuscitation algorithms, there is a growing cohort of SCA survivors across the U.S. The study results demonstrate that SCA survivors have a different recovery trajectory following resuscitation and ICD implantation than do patients who receive an ICD for secondary prevention. Despite the SCT intervention, SCA survivors reported higher physical symptoms, lower levels of mental health and outcome expectations, and experienced fewer ICD shocks over 12 months. Future research should address the unique and special needs of SCA survivors in the early post-resuscitation period, as well as the longer term physical and mental health sequelae of SCA survival. Comprehensive assessment of physical and mental health at the time of hospital discharge should be instituted, so that important issues can be discovered and addressed to improve overall QOL in the aftermath of SCA. Following assessment, symptom management, psychological support, and rehabilitation interventions should be made available during the first year after SCA to facilitate recovery.
