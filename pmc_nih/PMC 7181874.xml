                <p id="Par1">Crosstalk between liver and skeletal muscle is vital for glucose homeostasis. Hepatokines, liver-derived proteins that play an important role in regulating muscle metabolism, are important to this communication. Here we identify apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) as a novel hepatokine targeting muscle glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity through a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2 (LRP2)-dependent mechanism, coupled with the insulin receptor (IR) signaling cascade. In muscle, LRP2 is necessary for insulin-dependent IR internalization, an initial trigger for insulin signaling, that is crucial in regulating downstream signaling and glucose uptake. Of physiologic significance, deletion of hepatic ApoJ or muscle LRP2 causes insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance, pioglitazone-induced improvement of insulin action is associated with an increase in muscle ApoJ and LRP2 expression. Thus, the ApoJ-LRP2 axis is a novel endocrine circuit that is central to the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Many metabolic organs mediate various aspects of interorgan communication through secreted factors, including leptin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, interleukin-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, FGF21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, adiponectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, selenoprotein P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and ghrelin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Among these molecules, liver-derived proteins, such as FGF21 and selenoprotein P, now known as hepatokines, can directly affect glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, liver, or muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The identification of hepatokines has greatly advanced the field of metabolic physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Over the past decade, researchers have put forth intensive efforts to identify critical mediators in the muscle that control glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear how peripheral tissue-derived circulating metabolic signals regulate insulin-mediated muscle metabolism.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and is associated with plasma lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities, including reduced HDL cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels with increased hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich VLDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition to these risk factors, various apolipoproteins particles, such as ApoCIII have gained increasing attention as new indicators for type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ, also called clusterin) was first described as a secreted sulfated glycoprotein that is ubiquitously found in metabolic tissues and body fluids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. ApoJ exists as multiple protein isoforms including the 75–80 kDa highly glycosylated secreted form, and the smaller intracellular forms that are not well characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The secretory isoform of ApoJ is thought to have molecular chaperone activity depending on the degree of glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and binds to specific cell surface receptors in mediating its biological effects, such as endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although the exact role of ApoJ in many conditions remains unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, ApoJ has been implicated in altered pathophysiologic disorders, including atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">ApoJ is found in plasma HDL and LDL, though its functions in lipoprotein metabolism are unclear, while nuclear-localized and cytoplasmic isoforms of ApoJ have been described, each with distinct functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a recent study reported that the serum ApoJ level closely correlates with insulin resistance and decreases according to improvement of insulin sensitivity in humans with type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, suggesting a functional link between ApoJ and insulin action. This is further supported by the findings that ApoJ in HDL is correlated with insulin sensitivity but ApoJ in LDL/VLDL is associated with insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, a lack of knowledge of how ApoJ links with the metabolic actions of insulin in skeletal muscle has been a limitation in the field.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2 (LRP2, also called gp330/megalin) is a member of the LDL receptor family of lipoprotein receptors that bind to their extracellular ligands, such as ApoE and ApoJ before endocytotic uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. LRP2 also binds to leptin and mediates leptin transport crossing the choroid plexus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In addition, LRP2 interacts with selenoprotein P and promotes its uptake in the proximal renal tubules of the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although LRP2 has not been suspected to participate in obesity, a study with whole-exome sequencing analysis suggests that LRP2 could play a role in the development of early-onset obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. While important roles of LRP2 have been reported, nothing is known about the metabolic action of LRP2 on muscle glucose metabolism.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this study, we investigate the physiological roles of ApoJ and LRP2 in insulin-dependent metabolic responses, with particular focus on sources and tissue targets of ApoJ in the context of interorgan crosstalk. Here, we identify the ApoJ → LRP2 axis coupled with the IR system as a key endocrine circuit regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.</p>

                <p id="Par8">To determine tissue targets and/or sources of ApoJ, we generated mice lacking ApoJ in liver (liver-specific ApoJ-deficient mice (L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>)) by mating ApoJ-floxed mice with albumin-Cre transgenic mice. A lack of serum ApoJ was found in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), suggesting that the liver is the major source of circulating ApoJ. In addition, levels of ApoJ were very low or absent in numerous metabolic organs of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which were not due to altered gene expression of ApoJ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Collectively, these data lead to the observation that ApoJ released by the liver into the circulation has access to multiple metabolic tissues, where ApoJ could play a role in the regulation of cellular metabolic events.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>ApoJ levels in serum and multiple organs of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold> ApoJ protein levels in serum of liver-specific ApoJ-deficient mice (L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>).

                <p id="Par9">To test the hypothesis that liver-derived ApoJ can be transported to metabolically active organs, an adenovirus carrying secretory ApoJ was administered to L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice via the tail vein. Circulating ApoJ levels in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice injected with adenovirus ApoJ were greatly elevated compared with the mice injected with a control virus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Consistently, increased ApoJ content was seen in multiple metabolic organs of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice injected with the adenovirus expressing ApoJ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). These data were further confirmed with global ApoJ-deficient mice (ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). Together, our results clearly demonstrate that liver-derived ApoJ can accumulate in metabolically active tissues, raising the possibility that hepatic ApoJ plays a key role in interorgan communication.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Liver is a major source of circulating ApoJ.</title><p><bold>a</bold> ApoJ protein levels in serum of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice injected with ApoJ or GFP adenovirus.

                <title>Circulating ApoJ is normal in mice lacking ApoJ in muscle</title>
                <p id="Par10">To further test the hypothesis that ApoJ protein in muscle is preserved in mice, where ApoJ was deleted in muscle, due to ApoJ produced by the liver, muscle-specific ApoJ-deficient mice (M-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>) were studied. We found that serum ApoJ levels did not differ between control and M-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice, indicating that muscle ApoJ is not a major source of circulating ApoJ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Importantly, M-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice had normal content of ApoJ protein in muscle and other metabolic organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). ApoJ mRNA was absent in muscle, whereas ApoJ mRNA was intact in the other organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Our current results, combined with the results from L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice injected with ApoJ adenovirus, suggest that ApoJ in muscle comes from circulating ApoJ produced by the liver, and the relative contribution of muscle ApoJ to total circulating ApoJ levels is quite limited. Rather, liver-derived ApoJ would represent the major source of ApoJ in muscle.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>ApoJ levels are normal in serum and muscle of M-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold> ApoJ protein levels in serum of muscle-specific ApoJ-deficient mice (M-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>).

                <title>L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice display insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling</title>
                <p id="Par11">To determine the physiological function(s) of liver-derived ApoJ, we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice fed a normal chow diet. No significant differences emerged in body weight, fat mass, O<sub>2</sub> consumption, and CO<sub>2</sub> production between control and L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a–c</xref>). Blood glucose levels in the fasting state were significantly increased, but insulin levels were normal in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice compared with control mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice had normal circulating levels of IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and selenoprotein P (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>), but increased serum IGFBP-1 levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Neither serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), TG, nor cholesterol levels were altered in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d, e</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g–h</xref>). The contents of hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol were not different between control and L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i–j</xref>). These data were confirmed by H&amp;E staining of the liver (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>). In addition, deletion of hepatic ApoJ had no effects on hepatic VLDL production and selenoprotein P levels, as well as hepatic gene expression of key enzymes involved in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2g–h</xref>). Interestingly, muscle LRP2 mRNA level was increased in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice compared with control mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2i</xref>). This could be a compensatory effect, due to lack of its ligand.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Loss of hepatic ApoJ leads to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance without obesity.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Body weight (<italic>n</italic> = 7 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 9 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>b</bold> fasting blood glucose (<italic>n</italic> = 7 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 9 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>c</bold> fasting serum insulin (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per group), <bold>d</bold> serum IGF-1 (<italic>n</italic> = 10 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 9 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>e</bold> serum IGFBP-1 (<italic>n</italic> = 10 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 9 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>f</bold> plasma IGFBP-3 (<italic>n</italic> = 11 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 12 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>g</bold> serum triglycerides (<italic>n</italic> = 6 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 7 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>h</bold> serum cholesterol (<italic>n</italic> = 6 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 7 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>i</bold> liver triglycerides (<italic>n</italic> = 7 per group), <bold>j</bold> liver cholesterol (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per group), <bold>k</bold> H&amp;E-stained liver sections, <bold>l</bold> hepatic VDLD-TG production (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group), <bold>m</bold> results of insulin tolerance test (ITT; <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group), <bold>n</bold> results of glucose tolerance test (GTT; <italic>n</italic> = 6 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 8 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>o</bold> glucose-stimulated insulin secretion test (GSIS; <italic>n</italic> = 3 for control, <italic>n</italic> = 4 for L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup>), <bold>p</bold> muscle insulin signaling, <bold>q</bold> liver insulin signaling, and <bold>r</bold> adipose tissue insulin signaling (<italic>n</italic> = 7 per group) were measured in control and L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice.

                <p id="Par12">Interestingly, selective deletion of hepatic ApoJ resulted in insulin resistance in the fasting state, as indicated by the fasting hyperglycemia, as well as failure to normalize glucose levels in the presence of elevated insulin levels. Such resistance was independent of adiposity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m</xref>). Of note, the slopes of the insulin tolerance test (ITT) curves are similar between control and L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m</xref>), suggesting possible normal insulin sensitivity. However, L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice still have reduced insulin responsiveness as maximal dose of insulin impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and signaling. L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice also displayed impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4n</xref>), which could result from impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4o</xref>). We further determined the mechanism underlying hepatic ApoJ deficiency-induced insulin resistance by investigating insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive tissues. Interestingly, insulin-stimulated IR phosphorylation was markedly reduced by ~50‒65% in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice compared with control mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4p–r</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2j–l</xref>). Subsequently, phosphorylation of downstream components of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, including IRS-1/2, Akt, AS160, and GSK3, was also impaired in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4p–r</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2j–l</xref>). These data suggest that insulin resistance caused by hepatic ApoJ deficiency is most likely due to decreased insulin signaling in insulin-target tissues, primarily at the level of IR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4p–r</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par13">We further determined whether high-fat feeding could exacerbate the metabolic phenotype of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Similar to the results of normal chow diet, however, high-fat feeding had no effects on body weight, and body mass between control and L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a, b</xref>). Blood glucose levels were increased but serum insulin levels were normal in L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c, d</xref>). L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice were insulin resistant and glucose intolerant, and displayed impaired insulin signaling (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e–i</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that hepatic ApoJ is involved in the regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vivo, and further suggest that a functional crosstalk exists between liver-derived ApoJ and insulin signaling in multiple tissues.</p>

                <title>LRP2 is a potential receptor of ApoJ in muscle</title>
                <p id="Par14">Given that LRP2 is a potential receptor of ApoJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, it could be hypothesized that ApoJ levels would increase in serum and decrease in muscle if muscle LRP2 was deleted. We confirmed that LRP2 mRNA levels in muscle were significantly decreased (by ~80%) in muscle-specific LRP2-deficient mice (M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup>) compared with control mice, while LRP2 mRNA levels in other metabolic organs were normal (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). The ability to detect muscle LRP2 protein by western analysis is constrained by the fact that its content is very low in muscle. However, using in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), a powerful technology for detecting proteins with high specificity and sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, we were able to observe LRP2 protein in muscle of control mice but not in muscle of M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4e</xref>). In addition, endogenous ApoJ interacts with LRP2 in muscle of control mice: this effect was not detected in muscle of M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4f</xref>). These findings were confirmed by in vitro studies showing that exogeneous ApoJ treatment significantly increased the interaction between ApoJ and LRP2 in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> muscle cells, as evidenced by increases in the number of red spots at the cell surface of the cells. However, no interaction of LRP2 with insulin was found (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4g</xref>), suggesting a specificity of ApoJ binding to LRP2.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Consistent with our hypothesis, serum ApoJ levels measured by ELISA were elevated by ~18% in mice lacking LRP2 in muscle (M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup>) compared to control mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Concurrently, muscle ApoJ levels of M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, determined by immunoblotting analysis, were lower than that of control mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Normal levels of ApoJ were found in other metabolic organs of M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Our results demonstrate that circulating ApoJ is retained in muscle via LRP2 and that LRP2 signaling could play a role in the maintenance of ApoJ homeostasis in circulation, at least in part.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>LRP2 deletion in muscle increases circulating ApoJ and causes insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.</title><p><bold>a</bold> ApoJ protein levels in serum of muscle-specific LRP2-deficient mice (M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup>).

Muscle-specific deletion of LRP2 had no effect on body weight or blood glucose levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>). However, M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice had a higher risk for insulin resistance, as revealed by higher serum insulin levels in the fasting state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Correspondingly, M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed insulin resistance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>), as evidenced by a blunted decrease in blood glucose levels after insulin injection over control mice.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par23">A major challenge in the field of metabolic physiology has been to understand the interorgan communication networks linked to muscle glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. One critical factor for this interorgan system is now identified as hepatokines from liver-derived proteins, which play a pivotal role in regulating glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Discovery of an unidentified hepatokine that is involved in insulin control of glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle is thus of particular interest. Here, we show that ApoJ functions as a hepatokine targeting insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle; this action is mediated via the LRP2 signaling cascade. We propose a model for the involvement of the ApoJ → LRP2 signaling pathway in the maintenance of normal insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis.</p>
              <p id="Par24">We investigated the role of ApoJ in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling. Strikingly, our studies with animal models, including L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice, global ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice, and M-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice, demonstrated that the liver is a major source of circulating ApoJ and that liver-derived ApoJ appears in metabolically active organs, such as muscle, suggesting that ApoJ likely plays a role in interorgan communication networks. The fact that hepatic ApoJ deletion leads to impaired insulin action on muscle glucose uptake without any changes in body weight further suggests direct actions of liver-released ApoJ on insulin-dependent glucose metabolism. Given that LRP2 is found to be a potential receptor for ApoJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, it is conceivable that ApoJ released by the liver effects the action of insulin on glucose disposal in skeletal muscle via LRP2. Consistent with this, experimental evidence revealed that insulin’s ability to stimulate glucose uptake is decreased in the absence of muscle LRP2. Thus, these findings suggest that ApoJ acts as a hepatokine that plays a pivotal role in modulating muscle glucose metabolism through LRP2, highlighting an interorgan communication network between liver and muscle.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The mechanisms for the involvement of LRP2 in the metabolic actions of insulin remain unknown to date. Here, we show that insulin receptors on the cell surface of muscle cells failed to internalize in response to insulin when LRP2 expression was suppressed, suggesting that LRP2 is required for insulin-induced insulin receptor internalization, an early step in insulin signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Correspondingly, phosphorylation of downstream signaling components for insulin, including IRS-1 and Akt, were greatly reduced in muscle of M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. As a result, glucose uptake stimulated by insulin was decreased, ultimately leading to insulin resistance. Therefore, it seems likely that the cellular mechanism underlying insulin resistance induced by LRP2 deletion involves a major defect in the internalization of insulin receptor at the cell surface of muscle. Given that ApoJ is a ligand for LRP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, a similar mechanism for insulin resistance caused by a lack of circulating ApoJ was also detected, i.e., insulin’s ability to activate insulin receptor was impaired in muscle of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that ApoJ/LRP2-mediated insulin action could be independent of insulin receptor. Because LRP2 has NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which are recognized by proteins containing a phosphotyrosine-binding domain, such as IRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, it is thus possible that ApoJ/LRP2 modulates PI3K signaling via an NPXY domain in a way that is independent of the insulin receptor. Indeed, ApoJ activates survival through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Interestingly, the current study found that while L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice have no circulating ApoJ, M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice show a high level of circulating ApoJ, yet both are insulin resistant. These observations seem to be contradictory. However, a possible explanation for this is that defective insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice is likely due to impaired LRP2 signaling caused by a lack of its ligand ApoJ, which ultimately inhibits insulin action on glucose uptake. On the other hands, in M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, circulating ApoJ could not act in muscle because of a lack of its cell surface receptor, thereby impairing insulin’s ability to activate signaling. Under this condition, circulating ApoJ would remain high, as it cannot be utilized by muscle. In this regard, several studies show that elevated circulating ApoJ level is associated with insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, as well as humans with PCOS, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerotic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, insulin-sensitizing interventions, including exercise training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and pioglitazone treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, lead to a significant decrease in circulating ApoJ in insulin-resistant humans. Thus, it is plausible that a certain level of ApoJ in the circulation may important in maintaining normal glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. If beyond a certain threshold or a lack of ApoJ, ApoJ could desensitize insulin action on glucose metabolism. Together, we suggest that ApoJ signaling plays a key role as a co-factor in coordinating insulin-mediated signaling events, i.e., if ApoJ signaling is functionally absent, insulin signaling is affected correspondingly. Conversely, ApoJ signaling could be augmented if insulin signaling is improved, as in the cases of insulin-sensitizer treatment and exercise training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Additional differences between L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> and M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice include the fasting hyperglycemia and impaired GSIS seen in the former animals, suggesting a role for ApoJ in regulating ß-cell function that is retained in the presence of normal-to-elevated circulating ApoJ levels in the M-LRP2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. ApoJ regulation of insulin secretion represents a fertile topic for further study.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In this study, we further characterized the functional role of hepatic ApoJ in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. We show herein that loss of hepatic ApoJ has no effects on hepatic lipid metabolism, including VLDL-TG production and hepatic lipid accumulation, indicating that metabolic dysfunctions caused by hepatic ApoJ deficiency is not likely due to changes in hepatic lipid metabolism. Moreover, in PCOS subjects, changes in muscle ApoJ by the insulin-sensitizer pioglitazone were observed in the absence of any alterations in lipoprotein levels. However, ApoJ is found to negatively regulate gene expression of SREBP1c, a master regulator of the lipogenic pathways, leading to reductions in hepatic lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and diet-induced obese mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Similarly, liver-specific overexpression of ApoJ prevents the development of diet-induced hepatic steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, suggesting a sufficiency of hepatic ApoJ in modulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Other studies revealed that treatment of HepG2 cells with recombinant ApoJ protein increased gene expression of key molecules involved in gluconeogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, the importance of hepatic ApoJ in hepatic lipid metabolism will require further investigations.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Of note, a recent study demonstrated that ApoJ is secreted from human adipocytes in vitro and its production is increased in response to palmitate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. However, a lack of detailed experimental conditions is found in this report, even no information of ApoJ antibody is provided. The composition of the media for adipocyte culture is critical, because the level of ApoJ protein in serum is used for culture is very high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, which could possibly effect the outcomes of these experiments. For example, it is possible that ApoJ in the media could be taken up by adipocytes, and then released from the adipocytes into the media in response to stimuli. This study only measured ApoJ level in the media but not adipocyte. Nevertheless, this observation should be confirmed in the context of in vivo milieu. From our studies with L-ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice and global ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice injected with an adenovirus encoding a secretory form of ApoJ, it is likely that ApoJ in adipose tissue could be that produced by the liver, as is the case with muscle ApoJ. However, this supposition would need to be confirmed by studying adipose-specific ApoJ<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
              <p id="Par29">On the basis of our findings, we propose a key mechanism for involvement of ApoJ and LRP2 signaling in the metabolic action of insulin on glucose metabolism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>); circulating ApoJ is secreted by the liver to enhance insulin-dependent muscle glucose uptake. Liver-derived ApoJ is delivered to skeletal muscle where it binds to its receptor LRP2 on the cell surface. ApoJ binding to LRP2 is a unique mechanism to amplify insulin action by specifically driving IR internalization. Thus, our study identifies ApoJ as a hepatokine that targets muscle LRP2 signaling, which plays a key role in regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling. This ApoJ → LRP2 signaling axis can be added to the current networks of peripheral tissue-derived signals that serve as autocrine or paracrine signals in the regulation of whole-body fuel metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><title>A role of the ApoJ → LRP2 signaling pathway in glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling.</title><p>Circulating ApoJ is dominantly produced by the liver. Liver-derived ApoJ then transports to skeletal muscle where it binds to its receptor LRP2 on the cell surface, leading to increased molecular interaction between LRP2 and IR. The complexes of LRP2 with the IR then undergo co-endocytosis, which is an essential step of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. As a result, downstream signaling components activate, leading to enhanced glucose transport system activity. Thus, the ApoJ → LRP2 signaling pathway is central in regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2020_15963_Fig9_HTML" id="d29e2690"/></fig></p>

The experimental protocol and post hoc analysis were approved by the Human Research Protection Program of the University of California, San Diego and VASDHS IRB. Our studies were performed prior to ClinicalTrials.gov identifier requirements. Twenty-eight PCOS and six non-PCOS subjects were recruited between March 20, 2002 and January 6, 2006. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects after explanation of the protocol. We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations regarding studies with human research participants. Briefly, subjects with PCOS were screened by medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on criteria recommended by the 1990 National Institutes of Health Conference on PCOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. All participants were pre-menopausal, and medication use was stable for at least 60 days before screening. None of the subjects were diabetic or had a family history of type 2 diabetes. Other exclusion criteria included pregnancy; weight loss or gain &gt;3 kg over the last 3 months; a basal 17-OHP value of &lt;3 ng/mL (9.1 nmol/L); or medication use, including glucocorticoids, antiandrogens, ovulation induction agents, metformin, and anti-obesity agents within 60 days prior to screening. All procedures were performed in the early or mid-follicular phase (d 2–8) of the subjects’ menstrual cycle, except in those subjects who did not have regular menses. Following pretreatment testing, including glucose clamp and percutaneous needle biopsies of vastus lateralis muscle before clamp steady-state insulin infusion, subjects with PCOS were given either placebo or pioglitazone, 45 mg/d, for 6 months. At the end of the treatment period, each subject underwent the same tests as in the pretreatment phase. All studies were performed after a 12–14 h overnight fast. Blood was collected and serum isolated and immediately stored at −80 °C. Insulin action in the fasting state was determined in all subjects by calculating the HOMA2-IR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. All of the subjects had maximal insulin action measured by a 3 h hyperinsulinemic (300 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min) euglycemic (5.0–5.5 mmol/L) glucose clamp; the GDR was measured during the last 30 min of the clamp steady-state period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. All of the prespecified primary outcomes of the parent study have been reported previously (57) and there were no predefined secondary outcomes in the study protocol. ApoJ levels were measured by ELISA kit (Boster biological technology, Pleasanton, CA, USA; sensitivity = 20 pg/mL, interassay cv = 6.9–7.5%, intraassay cv = 4.2–4.6%). Samples were diluted to be analyzed within range of the standard curve (0.78–50 ng/mL). Some samples of ApoJ levels were also assessed by immunoblotting analysis. Adiponectin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay kit from Linco (St. Louis, MO; sensitivity = 2 μg/mL, interassay cv = 7%, intraassay cv = 11%).
