                  <p>A parallel-group, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2015 to 2019 in 3 metropolitan cities in the US: Buffalo, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; and Memphis, Tennessee. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old with persistent asthma were recruited mainly through clinical practices and schools. Participants were followed-up for 15 months after the intervention. Double-blinding was achieved for baseline. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to June 2020.</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>The intervention group received a peer-led asthma self-management program; the control group received the identical program led by adult health care professionals. Peer leaders made follow-up contacts every other month for 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome was quality of life measured by the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, which consists of 3 subscales that measure symptoms (10 items), activity limitations (5 items), and emotional functioning (8 items) in the past 2 weeks. Each item was measured on a 7-point scale, with higher mean scores indicating better quality of life. Secondary measures included the Asthma Control Questionnaire and an asthma self-management index capturing steps to prevent and manage symptoms, self-efficacy, and lung function.</p>

Of 320 enrolled, 303 were included in the longitudinal analysis. Response rates were 80% or higher at all time points. The peer-led group had greater improvement in outcomes than the adult-led group, with adjusted mean differences (AMDs) between baseline and 15 months of 0.75 vs 0.37 for quality of life (between-group AMD, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.63) and −0.59 vs −0.31 for asthma control (between-group AMD, −0.28; 95% CI, −0.51 to −0.01). Outcomes were not affected by bimonthly contact doses.</p>

              <p>This multisite randomized clinical trial examined the long-term effects of a peer-led program on asthma outcomes in adolescents living in urban areas compared with a conventional adult-led approach in 3 US metropolitan communities. We hypothesized that a peer-led program would be more effective than an adult-led program in improving quality of life, asthma control, and asthma self-management over 15 months in adolescents from urban communities.</p>

Interaction terms between treatment group and sex and age (12-14 or 15-17 years) were added to these models. Significant interaction effects are reported.

Sociodemographic variables and asthma-related factors presented in <xref rid="zoi211062t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, along with study sites and season, were initially considered covariates. Of those, only season, site, and sex were associated with 1 or more outcomes measures and, thus, were adjusted for in the final models. For each model, we report the adjusted mean difference (AMD) for each time point compared with baseline for each group and the 95% CI for the difference. Outliers, if any, were examined in the residual analysis, but none were removed. We did not identify substantial departures from the model assumptions. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted with participants who completed at least 1 follow-up data point. We compared these results with sensitivity analyses that included only those with complete cases. Given no widespread differences in findings, this article reports results from the intention-to-treat analyses. In addition to the main effect of treatment groups, we fit models for moderation of the treatment effect by sex, age, or bimonthly contact dose.

Of 395 eligible adolescents, 35 refused, 38 did not show or were lost to contact, and 2 withdrew before randomization; in total, 320 adolescents (168 intervention and 152 control) were enrolled, including 131 from Buffalo, New York; 86 from Baltimore, Maryland; and 103 from Memphis, Tennessee. Of those, 17 (5.3%) lost after randomization were considered dropouts (9 intervention and 8 control participants). Reasons for dropouts were unknown as we failed to reach them. A greater percentage of White adolescents discontinued their participation after randomization than racial and ethnic minority adolescents (7 of 44 White participants [15.9%] vs 10 of 276 racial and ethnic minority participants [3.6%]). Dropouts did not appear different from those who remained in the study. Because of the high retention rate, this study has at least 80% power at α = .05 (276 participants were estimated to achieve 80% power).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Consistent with our earlier study,<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> we found an asthma self-management program led by peer leaders was more effective than one led by health care professionals in improving quality of life, asthma control, and self-efficacy in adolescents living in urban areas. Current findings affirm our earlier efficacy trial of a single site and provide empirical evidence supporting the adaptability of the intervention in various geographical locations and settings. Unlike our earlier efficacy study reporting the program being more effective in male and older adolescents, the current study suggests that intervention effects do not differ by adolescents’ sex or age.</p>
              <p>Positive effects of a peer-led program on asthma outcomes have been reported in school-based studies conducted outside the US.<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211062r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Because of a no-to-minimally treated control group, a question remained whether the effects were due to the peer-led approach or educational content the intervention group received. We used an attention control to maximize the comparability between the intervention and control groups in all aspects (education content and venues) to effectively examine the extent to which program leaders, peers vs adults, contribute to any changes in outcomes. Both groups improved for all outcomes including quality of life, asthma control, and asthma management after program implementation. Nonetheless, the effects were greater for the intervention group, suggesting the superiority of a peer-led approach for maximizing the impact of asthma education in adolescents in urban areas. These findings echo those reported in our earlier study<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and other studies espousing the superiority of a peer-led approach to those led by adults when delivering health education targeting adolescents.<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This study demonstrates the sustainability of program effects for 15 months for both groups. Throughout the study, the intervention group consistently showed greater improvement than the control group for all outcome measures. The 15-month observation period is longer than other studies of a peer-led asthma program including our earlier study for which the follow-up duration was 9 months. Remarkably, program outcomes for both groups were sustained for 15 months along with the group differences. Establishing long-term sustainability of the outcomes of a peer-led program has received little attention. One study<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> reported that a peer-led program effectively reduced smoking short-term (8 weeks) but failed to demonstrate sustained effect at 1 year.</p>
              <p>Our sustained program outcomes for 15 months may have been possible because of the bimonthly contacts conducted for 12 months. Dose-response analyses, however, showed that bimonthly contacts played essentially no role in sustaining program effects for the peer-led group. Despite the substantially lower number of successful bimonthly contacts in the peer-led group than the adult-led group, the peer-led group consistently performed better for most outcomes. The long-term outcomes of our peer-led program, largely independent of periodic follow-up contacts, are compelling, suggesting that the program alone as a free-standing intervention could yield sustainable positive long-term benefits.</p>
              <p>Asthma outcomes significantly improved in both groups, supporting beneficial effects of asthma education programs offered to children and adolescents in various formats or venues.<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211062r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> EPR-3<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> maintains that no person with asthma be left without adequate education. Asthma education programs specifically designed for adolescents are scarce,<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and their knowledge concerning asthma management is suboptimal,<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211062r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> particularly among racial and ethnic minority youth.<sup><xref rid="zoi211062r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211062r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> A peer-led asthma self-management program is a promising approach to asthma education that is effective, sustainable, and developmentally appealing to predominantly racial and ethnic minority, adolescents living in urban communities.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several limitations. First, the nonprobability sampling methods in selecting sites and participants limit generalizability. Caution is warranted in generalizing the findings to urban communities with high percentages of White or Hispanic populations. Second, bimonthly contacts for the intervention group were implemented with low fidelity compared with the control group, although the periodic contacts were not significantly associated with study outcomes. Third, the self-reported study outcomes were susceptible to response bias. Spirometry was conducted only at baseline and 15 months after the intervention. We did not collect other biomarkers to validate or complement the self-reported measure of asthma control. Fourth, the length of follow-up may be too brief to examine the extent to which the intervention affects adolescents’ asthma management as they transition to adulthood, for which a multiyear observation period is necessary.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Asthma education offered at a day-camp setting was effective in improving asthma outcomes and self-management in primarily minority adolescents living in urban areas, and the positive effects sustained for 15 months. Program effects were greater when led by peer leaders than health care professionals, suggesting that a peer-led approach leveraging adolescents’ high sensitivity to peer influences is a promising strategy to deliver asthma self-management education for racial and ethnic minority adolescents living in urban areas. A peer-led asthma program implemented in venues such as schools, houses of worship, or clinics can improve access to asthma education, ameliorating the disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity in racial and ethnic minority adolescents residing in large US urban communities.</p>
