                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), they are 20% more likely to die from CVD than whites, chronic exposure to inflammation and oxidative stress contributes to CVD. In previous studies, enhancing parasympathetic cholinergic activity has been shown to decrease inflammation. Considering that AAs have decreased parasympathetic activity compared to whites, we hypothesize that stimulating it with a central acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, galantamine, would prevent lipid-induced oxidative stress.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that tested the effect of a single dose of 16Â mg of galantamine versus placebo on lipid-induced oxidative stress in obese AAs. Subjects were studied on two separate days, one week apart. In each study day, 16Â mg or matching placebo was administered before 20% intralipids infusion at doses of 0.8Â mL/m2/min with heparin at doses of 200 U/h for 4Â h. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2 and 4Â h during the infusion.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par5">A total of 32 obese AA women were screened and fourteen completed the study (age 37.8âÂ±â10.70Â years old, BMI 38.7âÂ±â3.40Â kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Compared to placebo, 16Â mg of galantamine significantly inhibited the increase in F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs in PBMC (0.007âÂ±â0.008 vs. âÂ 0.002âÂ±â0.006Â ng/sample, Pâ=â0.016), and plasma (0.01âÂ±â0.02 vs. âÂ 0.003âÂ±â0.01Â ng/mL, Pâ=â0.023). Galantamine also decreased IL-6 (11.4âÂ±â18.45 vs. 7.7âÂ±â15.10Â pg/mL, Pâ=â0.021) and TNFÎ± levels (18.6âÂ±â16.33 vs. 12.9âÂ±â6.16Â pg/mL, Pâ=â0.021, 4-h post lipid infusion) compared with placebo. These changes were associated with an increased plasma acetylcholine levels induced by galantamine (50.5âÂ±â10.49 vs. 43.6âÂ±â13.38 during placebo pg/uL, Pâ=â0.025).</p>

              <p id="Par34">African Americans (AA) account forâ~â13% of the US population; they are at a disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is estimated to contribute to more than 2 million AA lives lost in the past decade (Gillespie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). The high prevalence of CVD in AAs is, in part, explained by the disproportionate presence of traditional risk factors such as obesity (55%), hypertension (44%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in this population, which affects particularly AA women (Carnethon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>; Hales et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>). However, non-traditional CV risk factors such as chronic sub-clinical inflammation and oxidative stress also contributes to the pathogenesis of CVD (Roger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). In this context, previous studies found that AAs have increased activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which is capable of producing large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Deo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>).Â Higher protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox as well as higher IL-6 levels has been reported in AA women than white controls (Feairheller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). In addition, lipid infusion, which enrich the production of ROS, increased plasma levels of F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane (F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs), a biomarker of endogenous oxidative stress, by two-fold in AAs compared with whites (Lopes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>). In this regard, previous work by Tracey and collaborators (Borovikova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>) showed that the PNS is an important regulator of inflammation and oxidative stress; its stimulation confers protection against heightened oxidative stress states induced by fulminant hepatitis or ricin poisoning (Mabley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Abdel-Salam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Likewise, central PNS cholinergic stimulation with galantamine, a central acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitor showed neuro protection in rat hippocampal slices stressed with oxygen and glucose deprivation through NADPH oxidase inhibition (Lorrio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>) Altogether, these studies led us to hypothesize that galantamine could reduce lipid-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, measured with F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs and cytokine levels in obese AAs.</p>

The study design was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2âÃâ2 crossover trial that compared the effect of 16Â mg galantamine versus placebo on lipid-induced oxidative stress. Participants were assigned randomly to treatment sequences (galantamine followed by placebo [sequence one], or vice versa [sequence two]). In between treatments, there was a 2-week washout period. Both, study team and study subjects were blinded to the study sequence (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All studies adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Title 45, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects. The Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board approved these studies, and they were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines.

We excluded pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension or any cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate, GFRâ&lt;â60%), impaired hepatic function (abnormal liver function test), or had a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Subjects were also excluded if they used potent inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP 2D6, AchE inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, bethanechol, or had a significant change in weightââ¥â5% in the previous three months.</p>
                <p id="Par37">After informed consent was obtained, the participants were invited to come to the CRC for a screening visit that consisted of a complete history, physical exam, laboratory assessment (complete blood count, fasting lipid profile, comprehensive metabolic panel, urine beta-hCG <bold>(</bold>human chorionic gonadotropin), and an electrocardiogram (ECG). In a separate visit, subjects returned to the CRC to complete a 75Â g oral glucose tolerance test and body composition measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar IDXA, GE Healthcare, CT, USA).</p>
                <p id="Par38">Subjects who met the eligibility criteria were admitted to the CRC for their first study day (treatment sequence one, see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Before admission, they were asked to collect 24-h urine for sodium, creatinine, and F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs measurements. An intravenous catheter was placed in one arm for blood sampling and another in the contralateral arm for lipid and heparin infusion. Blood samples were collected from non-Esterified free Fatty Acids (NEFA), triglycerides, plasma F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs, prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a), inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-6, IL-10), and acetylcholine levels. PBMC were also isolated for measurements of F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs. The study nurse administered the blinded medication one hour prior to a continuous infusion of 20% IntralipidsÂ® (Baxter Healthcare Crop. Glendale, CA) at a rate of 0.8Â mL/m<sup>2</sup>/min as previously described (Lopes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>). In addition, the study subject received a heparin bolus of 1000 units followed by a heparin infusion at a rate of 200U/h for 4-h to activate the endothelial lipoprotein lipase and accelerate the hydrolysis of fatty acids from the glycerol backbone of the triglycerides. Intermittent blood pressures and ECG were measured using the VITAL-GUARD 450c monitor (Ivy Biomedical Systems, Brandford, CT, USA). Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEU) was used to measure changes in microvascular blood volume in the skeletal muscle. All measurements were repeated at 2 and 4-h post lipid infusion. We only obtained the CEU measurements and urine samples for sodium, creatinine, and F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs assessments at 4-h. Subjects washed out for two weeks and the subject completed sequence two and underwent all the procedures outlined previously.</p>

                <p id="Par40">Our intervention was 16Â mg of galantamine hydrobromide (RazadyneÂ®) versus matching placebo. Galantamine is a competitive central AchE inhibitor that increases the availability of acetylcholine. This drug is FDA-approved for the treatment of Alzheimerâs dementia. We chose a dose of 16Â mg p.o. based on pharmacokinetic studies in normal volunteers and patients with dementia of Alzheimerâs type. The 16Â mg dose exhibits linear pharmacokinetics after an oral administration; the oral bioavailability is about 90%<sup>9</sup> and the maximum concentration is achieved at 1-h post-administration with a short half-life of 7-h. Our measurements at 2 and 4-h coincide with the peak concentration of galantamine after administration.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par62">The main finding of our study was that in obese AA women, galantamine increased PNS cholinergic activity and suppressed lipid-induced oxidative stress as measured by F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs in PBMC and plasma; this effect was associated with a decrease in the production of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNFÎ±.</p>
              <p id="Par63">The effect of galantamine on F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs was evaluated in three different organs (PBMC, plasma, and urine). PBMC is one of the largest sources of ROS; F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs, an endogenous biomarker of oxidative stress, is produced in vivo by nonenzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid esterified in membrane phospholipids, and therefore specifically assess lipid peroxidation. Then, F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs is released to the circulation by phospholipase A2 activities and excreted in the urine. In AA women, a single dose of galantamine decreased F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs in PBMC and plasma at 2-h during lipid infusion, which coincided with the drugâs peak effect and shown by the significant increase in Ach levels. Furthermore, at 4-h post-lipid infusion, F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs in plasma returned to baseline values, but it remained elevated in PBMC. In contrast, we did not observe a significant decline in F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs in urine collected at 4-h after drug intake, possibly because the maximum effect of galantamine on oxidative stress occurred at 2-h after intake.</p>
              <p id="Par64">Previous studies in animal models found that stimulation of the PNS conferred protection against oxidative stress (Borovikova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>). Stimulation of the PNS decreased malondialdehyde generated in response to various stimuli including ricin poisoning, myocardial infarction and fulminant hepatitis (Mabley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Abdel-Salam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). This effect was in part mediated through the Î±7nAChR (Hiramoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>; Parada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>) and vagal afferent nerves (Borovikova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>). Also, sub-diaphragmatic surgical vagotomy in rats exposed to endotoxin was associated with increased oxidative stress in the brain (Egea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>). Similarly, direct electrical stimulation of the peripheral vagus nerve during lethal endotoxemia inhibited TNF alpha synthesis in the liver (Hiramoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>) Altogether, these studies suggest that states of heightened ROS production can be targeted by increasing PNS activity either through direct vagus nerve stimulation or with drugs that increase cholinergic transmission.</p>
              <p id="Par65">In the present study, we selected continuous lipid infusion as stimuli to generate oxidative stress because it is safe to use in humans and AAs had a higher F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs production than whites (Lopes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>). This increased susceptibility to heightened oxidative stress production is unknown; previous studies in AA women reported an increased expression of NADPH oxidase, p47<sup>phox</sup> subunit, NOX2, and NOX4 in baseline conditions (Feairheller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). To understand the mechanism underlying the reduction in lipid-induced F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs production, we evaluated the activity of NADPH oxidase in PBMC of five subjects who showed a robust decline in F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs in response to galantamine. The NADPH oxidase activity depends on the assembly of the cytosolic subunits p40<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, and p67<sup>phox</sup> with the membrane-bound subunits p22<sup>phox</sup> and gp91<sup>phox</sup>. During activation of the NADPH oxidase, p47<sup>phox</sup> is phosphorylated, and the cytosolic subunits assemble and move to the membrane to form a functional complex with the membrane-bound subunits. Three subjects showed reduction in NADPH oxidase activity with galantamine through a substantial decrease in the association of p47<sup>phox</sup> with gp91<sup>phox</sup> during lipid infusion, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Further studies with a large sample size are needed to examine the effect of galantamine on activation of the NADPH oxidase.</p>
              <p id="Par66">The relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation is complex, lipid-induced IL-6 and TNF alpha production, a long side F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs, significantly decreased with galantamine. It is noteworthy that F<sub>2</sub>-IsoP and isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) work as neo-antigens leading to activation of antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and release of inflammatory cytokines. This autoimmune state has been associated with the development of salt-sensitive hypertension (Kirabo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>) which disproportionately affect AAs. In future studies, it would be important to determine if galantamine decreases protein-adduct IsoLGs, antigen-presenting cells, and T cell activation.</p>
              <p id="Par67">Finally, our results could have important clinical implications. African Americans, particularly women, have one of the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease, T2DM, and mortality in the US, which is in part explained by the disproportionate prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and T2DM. Increased plasma and urinary F<sub>2</sub>-IsoP concentrations have been associated with cardiovascular mortality (Liburd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>), and oxidative stress and inflammation are factors known to contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM and hypertension.Â A previous study showed that Galantamine decreased inflammatory cytokines in an obesity animal model (Satapathy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>). The fact that galantamine inhibited oxidative stress induced by lipids provided important evidence about the importance of the PNS cholinergic system in AAs; results from this proof-of-concept study could open new therapeutic pathways to treat conditions associated with enhanced oxidative stress in this population. Further, our study also demonstrated that circulating elevated levels of Ach, which increased with galantamine, can be used as a biomarker of galantamineâs action on lipid-induced oxidative stress.</p>
              <p id="Par68">The present study has several limitations; first, the sample was small; however, our strong study design (crossover study, which decreases interindividual variability) and the use of lipid infusion to enrich ROS production, allowed us to reach meaningful conclusions. A larger study would be required to determine the beneficial effect of Galantamine on clinical outcomes in AA. We did not measure other oxidative stress processes like protein and DNA damage derived from oxidation damage, which were shown to be reduced with galantamine in subjects with metabolic syndrome (Sangaleti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>). Nevertheless, our study focused on F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs measurements in different system, which is a reliable biomarker of endogenous lipid peroxidation. Lastly, the exact mechanism by which increased acetylcholine levels decreased F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs is still unknown.</p>
