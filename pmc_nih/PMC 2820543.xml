                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Successful object manipulation relies on the ability to form and retrieve sensorimotor memories of digit forces and positions used in previous object lifts. Past studies of patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) have revealed that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in the acquisition and/or retrieval of sensorimotor memories for grasp control. Whereas it is known that PD impairs anticipatory control of digit forces during grasp, learning deficits associated with the planning of digit placement have yet to be explored. This question is motivated by recent work in healthy subjects revealing that anticipatory control of digit placement plays a crucial role for successful manipulation.</p>

                  <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
                  <p>We asked ten PD patients off medication and ten age-matched controls to reach, grasp and lift an object whose center of mass (CM) was on the left, right or center. The only task requirement was to minimize object roll during lift. The CM remained the same across consecutive trials (blocked condition) or was altered from trial to trial (random condition). We hypothesized that impairment of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits in PD patients would reduce their ability to anticipate digit placement appropriate to the CM location. Consequently, we predicted that PD patients would exhibit similar digit placement in the blocked vs. random conditions and produce larger peak object rolls than that of control subjects. In the blocked condition, PD patients exhibited significantly weaker modulation of fingertip contact points to CM location and larger object roll than controls (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively). Nevertheless, both controls and PD patients minimized object roll more in the blocked than in the random condition (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
                  <p>Our findings indicate that, even though PD patients may have a residual ability of anticipatory control of digit contact points and forces, they fail to implement a motor plan with the same degree of effectiveness as controls. We conclude that intact basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits are necessary for successful sensorimotor learning of both grasp kinematics and kinetics required for dexterous hand-object interactions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Skilled object manipulation is learned through practice, leading to the formation of sensorimotor memories for grasp control (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Quaney1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). Sensorimotor memories are used to associate previously experienced object properties (mass, texture, weight distribution, etc.) with the digit forces appropriate for manipulation <xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Quaney1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Quaney2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Importantly, they are involved in anticipatory grasp control, i.e., for planning grasp <italic>before</italic> the onset of the manipulation (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>; for review see <xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). The advantage of anticipatory control is that it bypasses feedback delays associated with reflex-driven force adjustments triggered by object slip or tilt <xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Johansson5" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and therefore facilitates grasp stability.</p>
              <p>Basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits are known to be important for control of precision grip (for recent review, see <xref rid="pone.0009184-Prodoehl1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). Significant insight on the role of basal ganglia for grasp control has been gained through studies of patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Vaillancourt1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Schettino3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Numerous studies have found that PD results in deficits in the coordination of digit forces during grasping (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Ingvarsson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Santello1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>) as well as impairments in the acquisition and/or retrieval of sensorimotor memories of manipulative forces <xref rid="pone.0009184-Muratori1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
              <p>A common feature of studies of grasping in PD is the use of grip devices that constrain digit placement on force sensors at fixed locations on the object, thus preventing subjects from choosing digit placement. However, the ability to change digit placement according to object properties is a fundamental component of skilled manipulation <xref rid="pone.0009184-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Goodale1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Digit placement on an object must be secured <italic>before</italic> forces can be generated to lift the object.</p>
              <p>Anticipatory grasp control relies on the coordination of digit placement <italic>and</italic> forces <xref rid="pone.0009184-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It has recently been shown that subjects generate a given digit force distribution according to their choice of digit placement on a grasped object <xref rid="pone.0009184-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As the first grasp event is contact, successful manipulation can only occur if subjects are able to plan digit placement on the object such that coordinated forces can be generated during grasp. Although this coordination has been documented in healthy individuals, the effect of PD on the ability to learn to anticipate appropriate digit position during grasp has yet to be examined. Unlike forces, subjects rarely change digit placement after contact <xref rid="pone.0009184-Christopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, appropriate planning prior to grasp is critical to ensure a successful manipulation. As the basal ganglia are important components of the neural networks involved in planning and anticipatory motor control <xref rid="pone.0009184-Braak1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, it is important to understand how these brain structures are involved in the planning of this crucial grasp component.</p>
              <p>It should be emphasized that sensorimotor memories associated with the planning of fingertip placement and forces appear to involve different cortical regions <xref rid="pone.0009184-Davare1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and be retrieved through independent processes <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the known deficits exhibited by PD patients in using sensorimotor memories of digit forces might not generalize to anticipatory control of digit placement. Additionally, a task involving the choice of fingertip placement also has the potential to be more challenging than a task constraining digit placement. This is because the retrieval and use of sensorimotor memories associated with <italic>both</italic> grasp kinematics and kinetics may increase the computational load required for anticipatory grasp coordination.</p>
              <p>When healthy subjects can predict an object's center of mass (CM) through previous object lifts, they learn to modulate digit positions on the object in an anticipatory fashion <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The present study was designed to determine whether PD affects this anticipatory control of digit placement. Furthermore, we quantified the magnitude of object roll during lift to infer the extent to which digit forces were appropriately modulated to object CM. Similar to the task used by Lukos et al. <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, we asked subjects to grasp, lift, hold and replace an object whose CM either remained the same across consecutive trials (blocked condition), or was altered on a trial-to-trial basis (random condition). The only task requirement was to minimize object roll during lift.</p>
              <p>We hypothesized that impairment of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits in PD patients in a dopamine-depleted state would reduce their ability to use sensorimotor memories to anticipate appropriate digit placement as a function of object CM. This deficit would be revealed by PD patients exhibiting similar digit placement in the blocked vs. random conditions and produce larger peak object rolls than that of control subjects.</p>

                <title>Subjects</title>
                <p>Ten subjects with idiopathic PD (7 males, 3 female; mean age 68.6 years, range 50–82 years) and ten healthy age-matched controls (6 males, 4 females; mean age 68.2 years, range 50–77 years) participated in this experiment. A post hoc power analysis (G*Power3 software; <xref rid="pone.0009184-Faul1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>) on our behavioral measure, peak object roll (see below), yielded an adequate effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.667) and sample size [power (1-β) &gt;0.80; α = 0.5] for each group. The protocols were approved by the University of California, San Diego Institutional Review Board and the experiment was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Nineteen of the 20 subjects were right handed as measured by the Oldfield Handedness Questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0009184-Oldfield1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The remaining subject, a control subject, was ambidextrous. Subjects with PD were all mild to moderate in degree of symptoms (<xref rid="pone.0009184-Hoehn1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, stage 2 and 3). They had experienced symptoms of PD from 6–25 years, having a mean disease duration of 11.9 years. Early stage PD patients were tested to assure that they could perform the task as required (see <italic>Experimental task</italic> below), and that any between-group differences resulted from impairments of the basal ganglia circuitry rather than from advanced sensorimotor and/or cognitive deficits associated with later stages of the disease <xref rid="pone.0009184-Braak1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009184-t001">Table 1</xref> provides a description of the clinical characteristics of each subject, all of whom were referred and screened by a neurologist to exclude those with marked dyskinesia, tremor, or ON/OFF medication fluctuations that would prevent performance of the experimental grasping task or confound interpretation of the acquired kinematic data. PD subjects were also screened to exclude patients with depression or dementia using the Beck Depression Inventory and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Any patients having additional deficits in other neural systems (“Parkinson plus” patients) were excluded. The exclusion criteria for all subjects (PD and age-matched controls) were: (1) arthritis in the dominant upper extremity, (2) orthopedic or visual problems that would interfere with the task, (3) upper extremity weakness that would prevent task performance, and (4) other co-existing neurological or psychiatric disease. Patients were studied in the ‘OFF’ state, in the morning before receiving medication that day, being at least 12 hours off medication <xref rid="pone.0009184-Langston1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The rationale for testing patients in a dopamine depleted state (off medication) was to quantify the effects of more pure basal ganglia impairment on anticipatory grasp control than would be the case with medicated patients.</p>

                <p>We asked subjects to reach, grasp, lift and replace a cylindrical object with their right hand. The task and the object used for the present study are the same as used in two previous reports with healthy, young subjects <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The object consisted of a cylinder made of sturdy cardboard covered with black matte tape for uniform texture mounted on a wooden rectangular base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The cylinder was aligned with the subject's midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The distance between the start position of the hand and the center of the cylinder on the <italic>xz</italic> plane was at a comfortable reaching position ∼30 cm away from the subject. The object's center of mass (CM) was changed by adding a mass (0.4 Kg) in the base of the object in one of three slots: left, center, or right, thus creating an external torque of −0.55 N⋅m, 0 Nm, and +0.55 N⋅m, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The total mass of the object with the added mass was 0.81 Kg.</p>

IRED markers were placed along the midline of the cylinder on the back of the object and therefore did not come into contact with the digits during the grasp. Panel B shows a photo of the hand at the starting position outfitted with IRED markers on the fingertips, hand, radius and ulna as well as a diagram of the workspace of the task (top view; figure is not to scale).</p>

                <p>We asked subjects to perform this task by using the fingertips of all digits, but no instructions were given on where to grasp the object along the cylinder. The only task requirement was to keep the object as vertical as possible (i.e., minimize object roll in the <italic>x-y</italic> plane) while lifting the object ∼15–20 cm above the table. Subjects were informed that object CM was going to remain the same across blocks of trials (blocked condition) or be changed in a pseudo-randomized order from trial to trial (random condition). The blocked condition was used to quantify the time course of the adaptation of digit placement and forces (see below) as a result of repeated manipulation. The random condition was used to prevent planning of digit contact points and forces as a function of object CM location, since implicit knowledge of CM gained from trial <italic>n</italic> could not be used on trial <italic>n+1</italic>. Subjects' ability to plan digit forces was quantified indirectly by measuring peak object roll (see <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> for more details).</p>
                <p>One of the experimenters demonstrated the grasp, lift and replace task before asking the subject to perform one practice trial (center CM). Subjects were instructed to perform the task at a self-selected speed but as a single, smooth movement to prevent the gaining of information about CM location by stopping the movement shortly after object lift onset. Offline analyses revealed that all but one subject were able to follow our task instructions. PD patient #10 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009184-t001">Table 1</xref>) frequently performed several sub-movements during the object lift. Therefore this patient and his age-matched control were eliminated from statistical analyses.</p>
                <p>Subjects performed a total of 32 trials for both the random and blocked conditions, i.e., 12 trials for left CM, 12 trials for right CM, and 8 trials for center CM, for a total of 64 trials per experiment. In the blocked condition, the presentation of each CM block of trials was counterbalanced across subjects. The randomization scheme was designed to present the same number of right and left CM trials (<italic>n</italic> = 12) but a smaller number of center CM trials (<italic>n</italic> = 8). The rationale for using center CM trials was to increase the number of CM combinations throughout the random trial series, hence weakening subjects' ability to predict the CM trial sequence. However, unlike the left or right CM, the center CM does not generate a torque on the object. As the center CM does not challenge subjects' ability to minimize object roll during the lift, only the data associated with left and right CM were analyzed.</p>
                <p>Within each experiment, half of the subjects started with the blocked condition followed by the random condition and vice versa for the remaining subjects. The presentation of object CM was designed such that subjects never experienced the same CM location when transitioning from one experimental condition to another. The weight exchanges were performed out of subjects' view. The location of the added mass was blocked from view by a wooden board placed on the front side of the object facing the subject during the entirety of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

                <title>Data Recording</title>
                <p>Movement of the hand and object was recorded using an active marker 3D motion capture system (PhaseSpace, Inc., San Leandro, CA; frame rate: 240 Hz). Twelve cameras were placed in a semi-circle 1–2.5 m from the subject, who was seated at a table where the object was placed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). We calibrated the system prior to each data collection. Subjects were outfitted with light-weight infrared emitting diode (IRED) active markers (5 mm in diameter) on the center of the fingernail of each digit, on the back of the hand (approximately on the center of the second metacarpal bone), on the styloid processes of radius and ulna, on the lateral epycondile of the humerus and on the lateral aspect of the shoulder joint. We verified that placement of the IRED markers did not prevent motion of the digits and/or the wrist by asking subjects to fully flex and extend all digits as well as to grasp the object prior to the start of the experiment. The spatial accuracy of the recording system was ∼1 mm in the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic> planes, and its resolution was 0.1 mm.</p>
                <p>As described in our previous work <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, analysis of hand kinematics focuses on the spatial distribution of digit contact points as defined by the marker placed on the center of each fingernail. We also placed IRED markers on the top and bottom of the cylinder to measure object kinematics and the spatial distribution of the fingertips relative to the object (see below). The behavioral performance of the task – peak object roll – was used as an indirect measure of anticipatory force control, with smaller rolls being evidence of more accurate digit force scaling to the expected external torque following onset of object lift (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Salimi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Salimi2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; see <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> for more details). Note that using force sensors at fixed locations on the object to directly measure individual digit forces was not feasible since our protocol was designed to let subjects choose placement of all digits.</p>

We found that fingertip tangential velocity accurately defined the time of contact between the fingertip and the object (see <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> for details). We defined <italic>contact points</italic> as the anteroposterior and vertical coordinates of fingertip location at contact time.

                <p>The weaker modulation of contact points exhibited by PD patients in the blocked condition could have been due to action tremor.

However, assessment of peak vertical object velocity prior to peak object roll showed no between-group difference (controls: 0.34±0.02 m/s and 0.31±0.02 m/s and PD: 0.34±0.02 m/s and 0.35±0.02 m/s, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). Therefore, lack of between-group differences in vertical object peak velocity prior to peak roll fails to explain the above significant group differences in the magnitude of peak roll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

                <title>Sub-Optimal Use of Sensorimotor Memories for Anticipatory Modulation of Fingertip Contact Points and Forces in PD</title>
                <p>As expected, when object CM location could be predicted through previous lifts, control subjects were able to exhibit anticipatory control of fingertip contact points during object grasp by modulating digit placement as a function of CM location. This behavior was also associated with a greater ability to minimize object roll, implying that control subjects distributed fingertip forces on the object according to the direction and magnitude of the external torque. In contrast, PD patients in a dopamine-depleted state failed to use sensorimotor memories to significantly modulate contact point when object CM location was predictable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These results suggest that the basal ganglia circuitry play a significant role in the planning of digit placement for object manipulation.</p>
                <p>Surprisingly, despite an impairment in the ability to modulate contact points to object CM location, PD patients were nevertheless able to minimize object roll to a greater extent for consecutive lifts of the same object CM than when it changed randomly across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This finding points to a residual ability to generate, store and retrieve sensorimotor memories associated with previous object manipulations. This interpretation is consistent with the finding that the performance curves of control and PD subjects ran nearly parallel for both the blocked and random conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
                <p>It should be noted, however, that control subjects were better than PD patients at minimizing object roll as shown by the production of significantly smaller object rolls on every trial in both the blocked and random conditions. The difference in performance between groups was small (on average 1.3°) which may have been a consequence of testing relatively mild PD patients. Nevertheless, the consistency with which controls outperformed PD patients and difference in rates at which peak object roll minimization was learned in the blocked condition (3<sup>rd</sup> vs. 4<sup>th</sup> trial for controls vs. PD patients, respectively) point to a deficit in the planning and/or execution of digit force sharing patterns. This deficit, coupled with weak anticipatory modulation of fingertip contact points to object CM, suggest that PD patients were unable to take advantage of sensorimotor memories gained from previous manipulations to the same extent as their age-matched controls. As action tremor and slowness of movement were ruled out as potential contributors to these group differences, our results are consistent with other studies describing the effect of dopamine modulation on the ability to accurately store spatial memories <xref rid="pone.0009184-Gruber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our data provide insight about the sensorimotor memory deficits associated with dopamine depletion indicating that implicit learning of digit placement and forces during grasp are both affected when the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits are impaired.</p>

                <title>PD-Induced Deficits in the Coordination of Digit Placement and Forces</title>
                <p>Although past studies have revealed deficits in the coordination of digit forces during grasping in PD (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Ingvarsson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Santello1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>), these studies have been performed with grip devices that prevented subjects from choosing digit position on the object. Our task is the first to examine the effects of PD on anticipatory grasp control during a natural task devoid of digit placement constraints. This is a crucial difference in experimental design, since the ability to change digit placement according to object properties is a fundamental component of skilled manipulation. Furthermore, we have previously reported that sensorimotor memories for digit position and forces appear to be processed independently in healthy young adults <xref rid="pone.0009184-Lukos2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies have also shown that different cortical structures are responsible for digit position and forces <xref rid="pone.0009184-Davare1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> as well as use of explicit vs. implicit knowledge about object properties <xref rid="pone.0009184-Chouinard1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> for anticipatory grasp control. Therefore, previously reported deficits in anticipatory force control in PD might not have generalized to anticipatory control of digit placement on an object.</p>
                <p>As our task requires careful planning of both digit forces and positions prior to object manipulation, one can argue that it allows subjects to use many, equally valid strategies to counteract the external moment generated by the added mass. Therefore, these task conditions could be easier than a task where the position of the digits is always the same as performed in previous studies of grasp control in PD (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0009184-Rearick1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Muratori1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>) which limits the number of successful strategies. While this might be true for healthy individuals, anticipatory control of an additional variable (digit position) potentially increases the computational load associated with anticipatory grasp control in PD patients. For instance, trial-to-trial variability in digit position also requires a concurrent covariation of digit forces such that the same net digit moment is attained on each trial <xref rid="pone.0009184-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009184-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
                <p>We found that PD patients did not significantly modulate contact points whereas control subjects exhibited anticipatory control of digit placement. This suggests that the choice of contact points was not incorporated into the anticipatory grasp control strategy of PD patients. However, PD patients were able to minimize roll to a greater extent in the blocked compared to random conditions. Therefore, anticipatory control mechanisms were primarily used by PD patients in the force domain when object CM was predictable. In contrast to the present results, Muratori et al. <xref rid="pone.0009184-Muratori1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> found no differences in the ability to minimize object roll between PD patients and controls in response to predictable changes in object CM using a grip device that constrained digit placement. However, our findings cannot be directly compared to those of Muratori et al. <xref rid="pone.0009184-Muratori1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> due to differences in magnitude of object torque generated by the added mass. Nevertheless, these performance differences suggest that the additional choice of contact points in a grasping task may increase the computational load of the system for the generation and/or retrieval of sensorimotor memories. This may further challenge the ability of PD patients in a dopamine depleted state to effectively implement anticipatory grasp control.</p>

                <title>Anticipatory Control Deficits in PD</title>
                <p>One strategy that subjects could have used to limit object roll might have been grasping the object with larger than necessary grip forces and/or stiffening the wrist. Since we could not measure digit forces (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for rationale), we were unable to determine whether or to what extent such strategy was used. However, simply grasping the object harder might not result in smaller object rolls since object roll minimization requires the net digit torque to match the external torque (also note that the PD performance curves are not consistent with such strategy).</p>
                <p>The above findings indicate that PD patients may have an implicit understanding of the anticipatory control of digit contact points and forces necessary to produce a compensatory torque at object lift onset. Nevertheless, consistent with previous observations of deficits in anticipatory multi-digit grasp force planning <xref rid="pone.0009184-Santello1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, PD subjects fail to implement such a plan with the same degree of effectiveness as controls. Performance differences between controls and PD patients do not appear to arise from cognitive impairments in understanding the task requirements, as indicated by the fact that PD patients learned to minimize object roll after three trials (top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009184-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, behavioral deficits must be a result of inaccurate anticipatory control strategies generated from sensorimotor memories. Although it is unclear whether this impaired behavioral response is the result of deficits in motor planning, execution, or both, it is known that PD patients have deficits in sensorimotor integration <xref rid="pone.0009184-Abbruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. PD patients are excessively dependent on visual information to effectively execute hand kinematics for reaching to 2D or 3D targets <xref rid="pone.0009184-Adamovich1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0009184-Klockgether1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, preshaping their hands when reaching for and grasping objects of different shapes <xref rid="pone.0009184-Schettino2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and for coordination of arm and trunk movements <xref rid="pone.0009184-Poizner2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Since PD patients show normal early proprioception-related EEG-potentials, but altered cortical processing of kinesthetic signals at longer latencies, their deficits appear to be alterations in central integrative processes <xref rid="pone.0009184-Seiss1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, thus possibly affecting the storage and/or retrieval of sensorimotor memories.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>We have shown that PD patients are less able than age-matched controls to generate and/or use sensorimotor memories of digit placement and forces derived from repetitive object grasp and manipulation. Nevertheless, some degree of implicit learning was found as evidenced by PD patients' incremental ability to minimize peak object roll during consecutive object lifts. This suggests that, even though PD patients may have a residual ability of anticipatory control of digit contact points and forces, they fail to implement a motor plan with the same degree of effectiveness as controls. These results point to an involvement of basal ganglia circuitry in planning of accurate digit positioning prior to manipulation.</p>
