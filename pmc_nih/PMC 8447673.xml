                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">A quality improvement (QI) collaborative approach to enhancing integrated HIV-Tuberculosis (TB) services may be effective in scaling up and improving the quality of service delivery. Little is known of the role of organizational contextual factors (OCFs) in influencing the success of QI collaboratives. This study aims to determine which OCFs were associated with improvement in a QI collaborative intervention to enhance integrated HIV-TB services delivery.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a nested sub-study embedded in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Sixteen nurse supervisors (clusters) overseeing 40 clinics were randomized (1:1) to receive QI training and mentorship, or standard of care support (SOC). In the QI arm, eight nurse supervisors and 20 clinics formed a âcollaborativeâ which aimed to improve HIV-TB process indicators, namely HIV testing, TB screening, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) initiations, viral load testing, and antiretroviral therapy for TB patients. OCFs measured at baseline were physical infrastructure, key staff, flexibility of clinic hours, monitoring data for improvement (MDI), and leadership support. Surveys were administered to clinic staff at baseline and month 12 to assess perceptions of supportiveness of contexts for change, and clinic organization for delivering integrated HIV-TB services. Linear mixed modelling was used to test for associations between OCFs and HIV-TB process indicators.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">A total of 209 clinic staff participated in the study; 97 (46.4%) and 112 (53.6%) from QI and SOC arms, respectively. There were no differences between the QI and SOC arms scores achieved for physical infrastructure (78.9% vs 64.7%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.058), key staff (95.8 vs 92; <italic>p</italic> = 0.270), clinic hours (66.9 vs 65.5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.900), MDI (63.3 vs 65; <italic>p</italic> = 0.875, leadership support (46.0 vs 57.4; <italic>p</italic> = 0.265), and perceptions of supportiveness of contexts for change (76.2 vs 79.7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.128 and clinic organization for delivering integrated HIV-TB services (74.1 vs 80.1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.916). IPT initiation was the only indicator that was significantly improved in the parent study. MDI was a significantly associated with increasing IPT initiation rates [beta coefficient (<italic>Î²</italic>) = 0.004; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004].</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">MDI is a practice that should be fostered in public health facilities to increase the likelihood of success of future QI collaboratives to improve HIV-TB service delivery.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par27">Among high burden countries for tuberculosis (TB), South Africa ranks second highest for TB incidence rates, estimated at 615 cases per 100 000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Fifty-eight percent of new TB cases are co-infected with HIV and mortality rates among HIV-TB co-infected cases (62 per 100 000 population) are double that of TB mono-infected cases (38 per 100 000 population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organizationâs End TB Strategy set ambitious targets to reduce TB incidence and mortality by 90% and 95%, respectively, by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. South Africa has a significant contribution to make in achieving these targets and addressing the HIV-TB burden is a key public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To this end, the South African National Department of Health treatment guidelines, recommend integrated HIV-TB services, care, and treatment as routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent studies have highlighted gaps in integrated HIV-TB service delivery such as patients missed for screening and diagnosis of HIV and TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; missed viral load monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; and sub-optimal coverage of TB prevention treatment for eligible HIV patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">Missed opportunities to offer HIV-TB services to patients already accessing healthcare point to health systems weaknesses at the frontline of healthcare. Quality improvement (QI) methods offer an ideal solution to improve underlying systems for HIV-TB service delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. QI collaboratives offer a potentially effective strategy to facilitate scale-up of best practices in HIV-TB service delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While there are many adaptions of QI collaboratives, the essential components include (i) different facility teams work together to improve performance on a common health topic, led by a faculty of experts; (ii) sharing of experiences, change ideas, and best practices between clinic teams; and (iii) mentorship of clinic teams to develop and rapidly test change ideas for a given improvement aim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This approach is premised on the principle that group learning accelerates the generation of change ideas and optimally utilizes experts to facilitate learning and inform best practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">First becoming popular in high-income countries before spreading to low- and middle-income countries, QI collaboratives are widely adopted and utilized for improvement in a multitude of health topics since their introduction over 30 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As the strategy proliferated, concerns regarding lack of clear evidence of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and sustainability have been raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">A systematic review of QI to improve antiretroviral (ART) uptake reported modest improvement with wide variations between QI collaboratives from one setting to the next; median improvement was 22% ranging from 12.8 to 29.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, a review of 29 QI collaboratives, specifically from low- and middle-income countries, found variations in improvement; however, larger improvements were more likely when a training component was added to the QI collaborative strategy as opposed to QI collaborative alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On its own, QI collaboratives showed no to little improvement in patientsâ outcomes (median effect size (MES) less than 2%); however, combined with a training component, both patientsâ outcomes (MES of 111.6%) and healthcare provider practice outcomes (MES from 52.4â63.4%) improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">The variation between settings suggests that what works in one setting may not work in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Much of the explanations for the variations is attributed to âorganizational contextâ and the inherent differences and uniqueness of organizations, individuals, and teams from one setting to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework defines âcontextâ as the environment or setting in which people receive healthcare services, or the environment in which the proposed change is to be implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">The few studies that investigated contextual factors influencing the QI outcomes, attribute variations to baseline performance (low performing indicators have a larger room for improvement) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], simplicity of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and clinic team characteristics such as leadership, access to resources, and clinical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In recent literature, supportiveness of organizational contexts for change is emerging as a key factor for implementing new interventions or changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Given the use of experts, time away from clinics to attend collaborative meetings, and in-person mentorship activities, QI collaboratives represent a substantial investment in time and resources and have been cited as costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Understanding which and how contextual factors impact QI collaboratives is important to enhance success and sustainability of this strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">The Scaling up TB/HIV Integration (SUTHI) trial tested the effectiveness of a QI collaborative approach to enhancing integrated HIV-TB services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This is a sub-study of the SUTHI trial, to determine which organizational contextual factors influenced the QI intervention to improve HIV-TB services so that these factors can be strengthened in future scale-up efforts. A secondary objective was to determine if there were any major differences in organizational contextual factors (OCF) in the QI arm compared to the standard of care arm (comparator group) which may explain the differences in HIV-TB process outcomes observed in the two study arms.</p>

Briefly, SUTHI was a cluster-randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of QI methods in integrating HIV-TB services on mortality in TB, HIV, and HIV-TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Sixteen nurse supervisors (clusters) and the 40 primary healthcare (PHC) clinics under their oversight, were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a QI intervention (hereafter known as the QI arm) or to standard of care (SOC) support and supervision (hereafter known as the SOC arm). Eight nurse supervisors and their 20 clinics were assigned to the QI arm and eight nurse supervisors and their 20 clinics were assigned to the SOC arm. The study was implemented in the Ugu and King Cetshwayo Districts of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa from 01 December 2016â31 December 2018. All study clinics were followed up for 18 months.</p>

                <p id="Par36">The SUTHI trial adopted a QI intervention structured as a Breakthrough Series Collaborative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nurse supervisors and clinics in the QI arm formed the QI collaborative. The collaborative met for three 2-day learning sessions timed at 6-month intervals. Learning sessions included coursework on the principles and practice of QI methods and interactive group-based work. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the topics covered at each learning session. Six-month intervals allowed clinic teams time to develop and test changes ideas, and acquire best practices to present to each other. Between learning sessions, a QI nurse mentor, made in-person visits to clinics and provided QI mentorship, reinforced knowledge from learning sessions, and reviewed clinic data. The Model for Improvement was the methodological framework to identify, develop and test change ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rapid, plan-do-study-act cycles facilitated the development and testing of change ideas at the clinic level. QI mentorship visits were fortnightly for the first 12 months and reduced to once a month for the last six months of the study period.

                <p id="Par37">The QI collaborative worked toward a single goal of improving integrated HIV-TB service delivery and focused on eight HIV-TB process indicators, namely: HIV Testing Services (including testing TB patients); TB screening; isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) for eligible HIV patients; ART for all HIV-TB patients; cotrimoxazole therapy for HIV-TB co-infected patients; retention in care strategies; enhanced treatment adherence strategies including, viral load testing coverage; and a single integrated data management system for both HIV and TB data.</p>

                <title>Identification of organizational contextual factors</title>
                <p id="Par38">The PARIHS framework contributed to defining and identifying key OCFs measured in this sub-study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The framework proposes that successful implementation of evidence is a function of three inter-related key elements: (i) the strength of the evidence being implemented, (ii) the supportiveness of the context in which implementation is occurring, and (iii) the facilitation mechanism used to introduce change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this paper, reference to âorganizational contextâ pertains to the clinic-level where care is provided, and OCFs are the elements of organizational context that facilitate the adoption of changes.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The PARIHS framework identified key elements of a supportive organizational context, namely: physical infrastructure, human resources, leadership support, monitoring and evaluation of performance, and receptiveness of contexts to implement changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These key elements were adopted and assessed in this sub-study. In addition, we reviewed other studies that measured clinic-level factors and identified flexibility in clinic hours, and clinic-level organization and planning for integrated HIV-TB service delivery, as elements of organizational context that were relevant to this sub-study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

We extended the administration of the COACH survey to non-clinically trained staff. The survey has eight sub-scales, namely: resources, community engagement, monitoring services for action, knowledge sources, commitment to work, work culture, leadership, and informal payment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Sub-scale items are phrased as statements to which respondents could agree or disagree on a 5-point Likert-type scale;1 =Strongly Disagree and 5=Strongly Agree.

A total score was calculated by adding all sub-scale means and dividing by the number of sub-scales. A clinicâs score was calculated as the mean of all clinic staff who completed the survey. A cluster mean was calculated as the mean of clinic means in that cluster and finally, the study arm mean was the mean of all cluster means. The highest possible mean for both surveys was five. Means were converted to percentages by dividing by 5 and multiplying by 100. This was done to make survey scores standardised with other scores. If a survey question was missed by the researcher, a score for that question was replaced by the mean of all other items in that sub-scale.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Responses to items in the CPT were âYesâ or âNoâ responses and coded as a one or zero, respectively. As per Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, mean scores for physical infrastructure, staffing availability, flexibility of clinic hours, monitoring data for improvement and leadership support, were calculated for each clinic by adding all items in the sub-scale and dividing by the number of items in that sub-scale. The mean cluster score was the mean of all clinic scores in that cluster. The study arm score was the mean of the cluster score means.</p>
                <p id="Par53">A <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare scores between the QI and SOC arms. We compared baseline and month 12 scores for the COACH and Degrees of Integrated TB and HIV services as the QI intervention was at its full strength during this period. Linear mixed modelling was conducted to determine which OCFs best predicted improvements for each HIV-TB process indicator. Each OCF were analysed separately in the model adjusted for study arm, time, and the interaction of study arm and time. The model assumed an exchangeable covariance and time was nested within the cluster for HIV-TB process indicators. The statistical software used was STATA, version 15.1.</p>

                  <title>Awareness of service delivery gaps</title>
                  <p id="Par64">Lack of monitoring and evaluation of the IPT programme emerged as a possible reason for the low baseline IPT initiation rates in the QI clinics. Clinic staff in the QI arm reported being unaware that IPT initiation rates were low until it was highlighted during QI activities and the data was revealed to them. When asked to comment on how QI has improved HIV-TB integration, the QI group (without being prompted about IPT initiation) expressed how the QI highlighted IPT initiation and performance.<disp-quote><p id="Par65">...things like IPT, IPT coverage, initiating IPT within 28 days of ART and all of that, you do not realize it is a problem until you start plotting and seeing what is happening. It also has helped to see staff performance (QI group, Professional nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p id="Par66">In the SOC clinics, three nurses reported receiving regular feedback from the District Health Offices and facility managers, on service delivery gaps.</p>

                  <title>Motivation to make improvements</title>
                  <p id="Par67">In the QI clinics, interviewees mentioned several facilitators to making improvements in their clinic, including, a sense of shared responsibility for improvement efforts, clarity and transparency of individual roles and responsibilities, healthy competition, and benchmarking with other clinics in the collaborative. According to two nurses the QI trainings were too few learning sessions and limited to a small number of attendees which was a barrier to improvement in some clinics. Transfer of knowledge from learning session attendees to non-attendees was described as vague and incomplete which may have led to some clinic staff feeling âdistancedâ from the QI intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par68">SOC clinics reported having access to resources for improvement, such as file audit templates, and access to expertise from local non-governmental organizations for data analysis, and development of performance charts. However, a lack of formal training and in-house experience in implementing improvement were barriers mentioned.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par69">In the SUTHI trial, IPT initiation rates were dramatically improved in the QI arm compared to the SOC arm (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>D). After testing several OCFs for association with improvement in IPT initiation rates, we found that MDI and exposure to QI over time were the only factors significantly associated with increasing IPT initiation rates. Importantly, in this study MDI was a factor that was measured at baseline (before QI intervention implementation). In South Africa, an electronic health information system was designed for the purpose of collecting and analysing patient and process data and evaluating the HIV and TB programme for effectiveness. The practice of MDI is important for data-informed decision-making regarding the direction and effectiveness healthcare services and shows commitment to improving services to communities by clinic teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The range in MDI scores for the QI and SOC arms shows that all clinics were, to varying degrees, using routine data to monitor and improve the HIV-TB programme (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This suggests that the QI intervention was implemented in a context where the practice of using data for monitoring programme performance was already embedded and may have contributed to the success of the QI intervention in improving IPT initiation rates. âMonitoring services for actionâ was a sub-scale of the COACH tool (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and the high scores achieved by both study arms at baseline and even after month 12, supports this finding that the study setting had a culture of data use for improvement.</p>
              <p id="Par70">Although statistically significant, we acknowledge that the association between MDI and IPT initiation rates is very weak (low beta coefficient). IPT initiation rates improved by small increments every month. The small monthly differences in improvement and inclusion of several factors (study arm, time, interaction of study arm, and time) in the model produced low beta coefficients.</p>
              <p id="Par71">The importance of MDI is highlighted in other studies. Two systematic reviews that aimed to extract OCFs which predict outcomes in QI interventions, also identified the practice of MDI as key in influencing success of QI interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A South African-based study that adopted the Breakthrough Series Collaborative, reduced HIV transmission from mothers to infants from 7.6 to 5.0% in one sub-district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The researchers partially attributed this success to an existing culture of using routine data to reflect on clinic performance which facilitated the adoption of QI and was familiar to front-line staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Access to good quality routine data that is relevant to front-line staff was a further driver of uptake of the intervention that led to a positive outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par72">The low IPT initiation rates at baseline suggest that this indicator was not being monitored or if it was, little was done to improve performance. The FGDs confirmed that the poor performance went undetected until the QI intervention began and IPT initiation rates were presented to clinics. QI interventions to improve IPT initiation rates have been successful in other countries. A national QI programme in Namibia improved IPT by 16 to 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In comparison, a Nigerian study made a larger improvement in IPT (11% to 50%); however, their efforts were focused at one busy facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Both studies attribute this success to QI interventions building skills and confidence among clinic teams to make improvements.</p>
              <p id="Par73">In our study, the FGDs also confirm that QI clinics felt a positive shift in team motivation, in addition, there were other contextual factors that may have influenced the uptake of QI in the study. We observed that at baseline and at month 12, the QI and SOC arms achieved high scores on the degree of integrated HIV-TB services survey, which suggests that clinic teams are well coordinated and prepared to offer integrated services. The high ART initiation rates (&gt; 90%) among co-infected patients (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>E) support this finding. The implementation of the integrated HIV and TB electronic data system is an indication of the commitment of the South African Department of Health to HIV-TB integration. Similarly, clinic teams in both study arms perceived high levels of supportiveness (high COACH scores) in their clinic to implement changes and this persisted at month 12 in the study. Given that QI clinics showed high levels of organization to offer integrated services and felt supported to make changes in their clinics, the QI intervention thrived in these clinics, particularly when poor performance was detected.</p>
              <p id="Par74">There were no significant differences in any OCF scores between QI and SOC arms. SOC arm clinics were similar to QI arm clinics for perceived organization to offer HIV-TB integrated services and supportiveness of contexts for change. The FGDs suggest that SOC clinics only lacked improvement âknow howâ. This is promising for any future scale-up of the QI intervention in this context which appears to have the correct conditions to embed a successful QI programme.</p>

                <title>Recommendations</title>
                <p id="Par75">Little is known of how best to foster the practice of MDI among clinic teams. Very few systematic reviews and intervention studies have been conducted on this topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Based on our findings and a small number of studies and systematic reviews that have been conducted, we recommend promoting the practice of MDI through making routine data accessible to clinic staff, ensuring good quality data, and improving the technical skills of clinic staff to use and generate reports from electronic health information systems. A Nigerian study tested the QI collaborative approach in enhancing prevention of mother-to-child services and included data quality as a key indicator for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As data quality improved, clinic teams reported increased levels of confidence in their clinic data and the use of improvement cycles using routine data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Two studies demonstrated that electronic health information management systems are effective in assisting clinic teams and managers in making decisions about health programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Effectiveness studies of electronic information systems show that clinic teams will use data from electronic systems provided that the quality of data is accurate and reliable, reports are easily generated, skills and capacity to use the system is present, and no major hardware and software malfunctions occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par76">In addition, we found rapid assessments of organizational context using structured surveys useful to understanding the setting in which our QI intervention was implemented, and future QI initiatives should consider this approach and add to the knowledge base of how OCFs influence the success of QI.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec28">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par77">The study has several limitations. The accuracy of data collected on surveys, such as the COACH survey, cannot be guaranteed. Social desirability bias may have influenced some responses particularly those of a sensitive nature, such as leadership and commitment to work. Two studies which tested the reliability of the COACH survey reported similar challenges of eliciting truthful responses and strongly recommend that confidentiality and privacy of data be emphasized to respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Despite assuring respondentsâ confidentiality and anonymity, we received reports from study staff of hesitation among respondents to select answers that may reflect poorly on themselves, leaders, and the clinic team. Thus, COACH scores in this study may be inflated. In addition, we extended the use of the COACH survey to data capturers and lay counsellors, who may not have had some knowledge, such as clinic access to medication.</p>
                <p id="Par78">Using the validated measures repeatedly may not have been the ideal method to engage clinic staff. There were reports of âfatigueâ among respondents regarding the time it takes to complete the surveys and being asked the same questions. The small sample size of 16 clusters restricted and affected the analyses. We were unable to perform regression models for each study arm. Secondly, the CPT was not a validated tool and the scoring system was developed by SG and CC. Future studies should consider development of a validated measure to assess aspects of physical infrastructure and resources in low- and middle-income countries. Thirdly, all OCF scores were at the cluster level and therefore highly summarized.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par79">This study has shown that QI interventions are successful in contexts where clinic teams are encouraged and supported to use routine data for improvement. IPT is an important intervention in interrupting the transmission of TB and is seldom prioritized for improvement. Capacitating clinic teams with QI skills and tools, fostering the practice of using routine data to monitor improvement, and removing any threats to using routine data may be the key to improving IPT initiations and other poorly performing indicators.</p>
