                <p><bold>Objective:</bold> This study sought to describe changes in the
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of women who do and do not seek
naturopathic oncology (NO) complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) care
during and immediately after breast cancer treatment, and to explore the
predictive role of NO CAM care, demographic characteristics, and involvement in
decision-making on HRQOL in breast cancer survivors. <bold>Methods:</bold>
Matched cohorts of breast cancer survivors who did and did not choose to
supplement their breast cancer treatment with NO care within 2 years of
diagnosis participated. NO users were identified through naturopathic doctors’
clinics and usual care (UC) controls with similar prognosis were identified
through a cancer registry. The registry provided information about all
participants’ age, race, ethnicity, marital status, stage of cancer at time of
diagnosis, date of diagnosis, and use of conventional medical treatments
(surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and endocrine therapy). Data of participants’
self-reported involvement in decision-making and HRQOL were collected at study
enrollment and at 6-month follow-up. <bold>Results:</bold> At 6-month follow-up,
the NO patients reported significantly more involvement in decision-making about
care and better general health than did UC patients (<italic>P</italic> &lt;
.05). Self-reported involvement in decision-making about cancer treatment was
associated with better role-physical, role-emotional, and social-functional
well-being (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Race, age, marital status, and
congruence of preferred and achieved levels of involvement also predicted
aspects of HRQOL in breast cancer survivors (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both NO CAM care and involvement in
decision-making about cancer treatment may be associated with better HRQOL in
breast cancer survivors.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Breast cancer treatment often involves making important decisions about surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation, endocrine therapy, whether or not to use complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM), and whether or not to seek a CAM provider. CAM care can
include multiple supplements and recommendations for mind-body treatments including
exercise and meditation. Some of these treatments are intended to reduce the side
effects associated with conventional care and some are provided with the intent of
complementing that care and further reducing risk of cancer recurrence.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Some biologically based supplements should be evaluated in light of possible
interactions with conventional treatments.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> It is estimated that between 50% and
80% of cancer patients supplement their care with CAM treatments, while only a small
percentage use naturopathic oncology (NO) and receive care from naturopathic doctors
(NDs) with special training in oncology. While there is scientific evidence for many of
the CAM treatments patients use, and NO providers offer their patients, a review of the
literature found no studies describing the health and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) effects of NO care as commonly practiced in communities. This study sought to
fill that gap in knowledge.</p>
            <p>However, in evaluating CAM care it is important to realize patients seeking NO care might
differ from those who do not seek NO care in several ways including their desire to be
involved in decision-making about their cancer treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr8-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Patient involvement in decisions

            <p>Although most studies of involvement in decision-making about cancer treatment have
focused on perceived involvement in surgery choice among women with breast cancer,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> some have focused on decision-making about CAM, physician behavior, objective
assessments of involvement,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and congruence between patients’ preferred and perceived actual participation in

            <p>This article describes the results of a matched longitudinal study that recruited women
seeking NO care for breast cancer and comparison cases recruited via a cancer registry.
The purpose of the study is to describe the content and cost of NO care as provided in
community clinics and to explore the effectiveness of NO in improving breast cancer
patient HRQOL during early survivorship and any potential influence of involvement in
decision-making on this effect.</p>

              <p>This study is registered with clinical trials as (NCT01366248). Study methods and
questionnaires were approved by the institutional review boards of the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, and Bastyr University, Kenmore, WA.
The women involved are part of a longitudinal assessment of 2 matched cohorts of
women with breast cancer. Breast cancer patients in the NO cohort were eligible for
the study if they spoke English fluently enough to complete surveys, were over age
21, and were diagnosed with breast cancer less than 2 years prior to their visit to
a participating ND’s clinic. Usual care (UC) cohort members were selected from the
registry based on their similarity to an enrolled NO clinic patient. Potential
participants received a packet containing the informed consent form, a medical
records release, and the enrollment questionnaire. Participants included a group of
patients receiving treatment from local naturopathic physicians with specialty
training in NO, and a larger group of women recruited from the local cancer registry
that were matched on their similarity to the NO patients in demographic
characteristics and stage of cancer at time of diagnosis. Analyses describing the
similarities and differences between the 2 cohorts are described
elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Women seeking NO care either consented for the study and
completed the forms in the clinic or consented during a telephone call with the
documents returned by mail. UC women identified through the cancer registry
completed consent and recruitment documents by mail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534735418762543">Figure 1</xref> describes recruitment and retention

              <p>Reasons for ineligibility included in the “other” categories included a few women
from both cohorts were found to be ineligible to participate in the study and these
analyses after completing the enrollment paperwork because they were identified in
the registry for a second, not their first, cancer diagnosis. UC women could also be
disqualified for continued participation in the UC cohort if they visited an NO
clinic. After completion of the baseline questionnaire 5 women originally identified
as UC participants enrolled in the study at an ND clinic. Because these
participants’ use of NO care disqualified them from the UC cohort, and made them
eligible to participate in the NO cohort, they were dropped from the UC group and
enrolled as members of the NO cohort. New UC comparison women were recruited from
the registry to replace these women as comparisons for their original NO matches,
and as matches for them as new NO cohort members. In total 553 women (193 in the NO

              <p>In addition to the standard assessments of demographics, the enrollment questionnaire
for the study also included items assessing use of a variety of CAM supplements and
CAM activities, a 4-item measure of involvement in decision-making about cancer
treatment used in several prior studies,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the Short Form-36 (SF-36),
a commonly used measure of overall HRQOL.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Participants also signed medical records releases allowing for collection and
retention of information about participants’ diagnosis with and treatment for breast
cancer from the cancer registry and from their personal medical records, which were
abstracted by trained study personnel. Additional information about study procedures

                <p>The involvement in decision-making scale used in this study has been previously
used in several studies assessing the effects of involvement on HRQOL in breast
cancer survivorship.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> After assuring patients that<disp-quote><p>every condition is different as is every patient. Some people prefer to
make decision about their medical treatment themselves: other prefer to
have their physician or someone else make decisions for them. We want to
know how involved you feel you are or were in making some of the
decisions about your care.</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>The measure included items assessing involvement in decision-making about
surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, CAM, or “any other therapeutic activities”
received, and about overall involvement in decision-making. For each item
respondents were given response options, including 1 = “Not involved: others
made decisions for you”; 2 = “A fair bit”; and 3 = “Very involved: I made all
the decisions myself,” with an additional option “Not applicable: In my case
there were few if any decisions to be made by me or my doctors.” An item asking
about preferences regarding decision-making was also included. This item asked,
“Would you have preferred to be more or less involved in making decisions about
your treatment? Would you say:” For this item response options ranged from “Much
less involved” to “Much more involved.”</p>
                <p>Consistent with prior uses of these items, and consistent with the scales’ focus
on patients’ personal feelings of involvement in decision-making, women
indicating that a question (eg, CAM decision-making) was “Not Applicable” in
their case as there were “no decisions to be made” were considered to have been
“not at all involved” in that decision and given a score of 1 for that item.</p>
                <p>Responses to the items were used to create 2 involvement in decision-making
scales. Scale scores were calculated by summing the items to be included in each
scale. In the creation of both scales study participants who did not respond to
one or more questionnaire item did not have scale scores created due to missing
data. The first included 4 items: overall involvement, involvement in surgery
decision-making, involvement in chemotherapy/radiation decision-making, and
involvement in CAM decision-making. Although prior research suggested high
levels of correlation between the items suggesting that these items assess a
single factor about patients and their desire and ability to be involved in
treatment decision-making. A second scale was created that used only 3 of the
items, dropping the involvement in CAM decision-making item. This second scale
was used to examine the influence of the CAM decision-making item, as it could
be particularly important in differences between the study cohorts in this study
context.</p>
                <p>Scores ranged from 4 to 12 (for the 4-item version) and from 3 to 9 (for the
version excluding the CAM question). Cronbach’s αs for the 2 scales were
acceptable at .72 for the full 4-item scale and at .81 for the 3-item scale that
did not include decision-making about CAM. Suggesting that either scale assesses
involvement as a characteristic and/or ability of the participant and that the
situation-specific elements associated with each of the decisions assessed has
at most modest influence on scale scores. Scale scores were also examined for
correlation over time and this revealed the scale scores to be strongly
correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .61) for the overall scale from enrollment to
6-month follow-up, while the version of the scale excluding the CAM item was
also highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .59), suggesting good test-retest
reliability over a period of 6 months for either scale.</p>

CAM supplements, and the reliability of the involvement scales using standard
methods including χ<sup>2</sup> tests and <italic>t</italic> tests were used to
compare the cohorts. Power analyses reveal that using χ<sup>2</sup> test has, in
general, the ability to detect at power of 95%, a difference of about 12
percentage points between the groups with a significance level of .05, and with
continuous variables (eg, the SF-36 scales) a difference of approximately 4
points. Multivariate regression analyses examining the predictors of involvement
in decision-making and of HRQOL at enrollment and follow-up were planned. In
preparation for multivariate analyses minor simplifications of race, marital
status, stage, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and endocrine therapy variables
were made. Race was reduced to White/non-White, marital status to married or
partnered/single or divorced, and stage to 0-2/3-4. Surgery was simplified to
none/lumpectomy including breast conserving procedures, re-excision, excision,
lumpectomy, and segmental mastectomy, and mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy.
Individuals coded as “unknown” for chemotherapy, radiation, and adjuvant
endocrine therapy (AET) were recoded as “No.” These analyses were all conducted
using R (v 3.1.1), and differences were considered statistically significant at
the <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 level.</p>

                <p>The 2 cohorts did however differ, as was expected based on the recruitment
strategy in time since diagnosis at study enrollment. Women seeking ND clinic
care often sought care shortly after diagnosis and were, at median, enrolled
0.31 years (about 4 months) postdiagnosis. In contrast, the cancer registry
(CSS) identification and mail-based recruitment resulted in a UC cohort that was
at median 0.81 years, (9.7 months) postdiagnosis at time of study enrollment.
The averages for the cohorts are presented in <xref rid="table1-1534735418762543" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and were found to be
statistically significant at the <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 level, and thus
time since diagnosis was used as an adjustment variable in all multivariate
analyses.</p>
                <p>After review of the study matching criteria, we examined the 2 cohorts seeking to
identify any differences between them prognostic of HRQOL in survivorship. These
analyses including review of CSS collected breast cancer treatment data found
the 2 cohorts to be similar overall in their use of breast cancer surgeries,
chemotherapy, and radiation. A trend toward a difference between the cohorts was
found however in use of AET (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.925; <italic>P</italic> &lt;
.052). Women in the NO cohort appear less likely to use AET (56.0% vs 66.4%)
than those in the UC cohort. When women with unknown data were assumed to be
nonusers, the direction of the relationship was unchanged and was found to be
statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.8477; <italic>P</italic> &lt;
.02).</p>

                <title>Use of CAM and Involvement in Decision-Making and Use of CAM
Supplements</title>
                <p>As study enrollment for the NO cohort occurred at the initial ND clinic visit,
prior to the establishment of an ND patient-physician partnership, self-reports
of CAM supplement and activity use and decision-making about CAM at study
baseline would generally describe decisions patients made about CAM independent
of any specialist CAM provider. These would be decisions made in consultation
with friends, family, chiropractors, and conventional physicians including
oncologists or primary care providers. Many conventional providers do recommend
some CAM supplements and CAM activities for breast cancer patients including use
of vitamin D or may have suggested common CAM treatments for nausea and lack of
appetite during treatment including ginger and/or other herbal supplements.
Review of patient self-reports of these activities showed substantial use
consistent with other reports, but few statistically significant differences in
the frequency of use of CAM supplements between our cohorts at study enrollment
(data not shown).</p>
                <p>Participants generally reported being very involved in making decisions about
their care overall, about surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation (see <xref rid="table2-1534735418762543" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A majority
of women responded that they were “very involved” in decision-making on each of
these items. Most women also reported being very involved in making decisions
about any CAM treatments they had used or were using, although more women
reported decision-making about CAM to be “not applicable” in their particular
case than did so for questions about conventional therapies. Approximately 85%
of our participants reported that their level of participation in
decision-making about cancer treatment had been “about right for them.”</p>

                <p>Involvement in decision-making does appear to be different between the study
cohorts. At study enrollment prior to NO care, women about to be enrolled in the
NO cohort reported higher levels of involvement in cancer treatment
decision-making than those in the UC cohort on the scale assessing involvement
in decision-making about treatment that included decision-making about CAM (10.5
vs 9.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Differences, similar but smaller and not
statistically significant, were found using the second version of the scale that
excluded the CAM question (means 7.8 vs 7.5). Differences between the cohorts
were statistically significant on both versions of the scale at the 6-month
follow-up assessment with the members of the NO cohort again reporting greater
involvement in decision-making about their cancer treatment (<italic>P</italic>
&lt; .05 for each).</p>
                <p>Replication of the <italic>t</italic> tests exploring differences between cohorts
using the simplified versions of predictors selected for use in multivariate
analyses again revealed no statistically significant differences by cohort for
any of these patient characteristics other than marital status and AET. When
self-reported marital status was reduced to either “single” or “partnered.” With
the “single” category including those who reporting either being “single”
divorced, and the “partnered” category including both those who were married and
those reporting a domestic partnership, women in the NO cohort were more likely
to report being “single” than were those in the UC cohort. When women for whom
CSS recorded “unknown” regarding their AET use were considered nonusers, the
apparent difference between the cohorts was statistically significant (data not
shown).</p>

                <p>Analyses examining the HRQOL of patients in the cohorts at time of enrollment
revealed that women in the NO cohort reported reduced levels of HRQOL at study
enrollment in spite of their similarity in stage, demographics, and the

HRQOL on 4 of the 8 SF-36 scales, including Role Physical function, Social
functioning, Role emotional functioning, and Mental health (<italic>P</italic>
&lt; .05 in all cases). This might well be associated with the differences
between the cohorts in their time since diagnosis as a greater proportion of the
NO women were still undergoing primary chemotherapeutic treatment.</p>
                <p>When multivariate analyses were run to examine the effects of controlling for
study matching variables (age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and stage), time
since diagnosis at study enrollment, and treatment (type of surgery received,
use of chemotherapy, use of radiation), these models revealed age, stage,
marital status, time since diagnosis, and use of chemotherapy to be predictors
of several of the SF-36 HRQOL scales at time of enrollment. The inclusion of
these additional predictors reduced the estimated β coefficient for the cohort
effect to nonsignificance in all models where it had been significant in
unadjusted tests. In the adjusted models cohort was a statistically significant
predictor of physical functioning after adjustment. See <xref rid="table3-1534735418762543" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

                <p>At 6-month follow-up women’s self-reported HRQOL was improved on almost all
scales in both cohorts as would be expected in early posttreatment survivorship
although changes were small in some cases for the UC cohort. Differences between
the cohorts were not now statistically significantly different in unadjusted
tests, with the exception of the General Health scale where the difference
between the scores was slightly more than 4 points (NO mean 76.5 vs UC mean
72.1) and was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>[258 df] = 2.30;

included the following: study enrollment matching variables, time since
diagnosis at enrollment, treatment received (surgery type, use of chemotherapy,
and use of radiation), and involvement in decision-making (with each of the 2
involvement scales, and congruence of involvement with preferences run as a
separate models). These analyses revealed cohort to be a statistically
significant predictor of change in the General Health subscale of the SF-36 such
that women in the NO cohort reported larger improvements over the 6-month
interval immediately following the initiation of NO treatment
(<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; in all versions of analyses). This difference
appears to be in the range of 4 additional points on the general health

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study, which may be the first to report on the effects of specialist CAM
oncology care by NDs at community clinics, found evidence to suggest that patients
who seek NO CAM care experience improved HRQOL at 6-month follow-up associated with
that care. The difference found was modest, but at 4 points on the SF-36 general
health scale could be considered clinically significant.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Although this was not a randomized controlled trial as our NO seeking breast
cancer patient cohort, and the UC cohort patients we enrolled as a matched
comparison group, were found to have similar demographic and diagnostic
characteristics and received comparable primary course of conventional care, it
appears the improvement in self-assessed general health reported by NO women may be
attributable to the NO CAM care they received from their ND clinic providers. How
exactly specialist naturopathic oncology care improves self-assessed general health
status could not be assessed in this study given its whole systems approach
consistent with some recent calls to use health services research methods to better
understand CAM care in real-world settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Future studies exploring both the effects of NO care as a package of services
in this or other settings<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> would help confirm our findings as would explorations of the specific
supplements, recommendations, and/or CAM activities that might contribute to the
overall effect of NO care.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We also found that women who are involved in making decisions about their cancer care
also appear to report improved HRQOL including better role-physical, role-emotional,
and social functioning 6 months later. This is consistent with prior studies that
have found similar effects 5 to 30 years later.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> We also found women in NO care
reported higher levels of involvement in decision-making about their care both at
study enrollment and 6-months later, suggesting that NO patient may have benefited
from higher levels of involvement. However, the HRQOL subscales on which the
improvement associated with involvement was found were not the general health scale,
suggesting that patient involvement in decision-making and desire to be involved in
treatment decision-making were not confounding predictors of the improvements in
HRQOL found associated with NO clinic treatment. For self-reported congruence of
involvement with preferences, women who indicated their level of involvement was
“right for them” at study enrollment also predicted better HRQOL 6 months later, and
while this included the general health subscale the inclusion of congruence did not
reduce the significance of the NO cohort effect on HRQOL.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>Time since diagnosis served in this study as, perhaps, a proxy for current treatment
and may present a design explanation for the substantial improvements in
role-physical, social, and emotional functioning and in mental health NO care
patients report in the 6 months following the initiation of NO care that for some
women was during active primary treatment. This would suggest that much of the
return to usual functioning that we see here in the NO group might have occurred in
the absence of specific NO assistance. That said, the self-reported improved general
health status found at 6-month follow-up occurred when few patients were receiving
treatments other than AET. Differences in the general health scale at enrollment
were also particularly modest, limiting the degree to which these results are
amenable to any regression to the mean explanation. They appear to reflect a
genuine, if modest, advantage associated with receiving NO care. We did not control
for AET use in our multivariate analyses as it would not be clear if all
participating women for whom we have evidence of AET use would in fact have been
using AET long enough to experience arthralgia and mood-related side effects at the
time of our 6-month follow-up. In addition, AET use is a late element of primary
treatment that might be influenced by ND providers’ recommendations for or against
use. It was, thus, unclear if adjusting for this variable would, in principle,
adjust out a potential means by which NO care influences HRQOL among those who use
it.</p>
              <p>Differences in perceived involvement in decision-making likely reflect women’s
circumstances, personal internal control preferences, and biases in perception that
influenced both the degree to which they actively sought to be involved and the
degree to which they were inclined to indicate that they were “Very involved: I made
all the decisions myself” as contrasted with “a fair bit.” Again, this is consistent
with the small body of research on involvement in treatment decision-making that has
assessed health outcomes, all of which have found perceived involvement in
decision-making, not objectively assessed involvement, or physician perceptions of
involvement to be the significant predictor of outcome.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Still the differences of a few points on this measure would be associated
with clinically significant differences on multiple self-assessed HRQOL scales
suggests the potentially profound importance of perceived involvement, whether this
is a preexisting characteristic of women or something physicians can encourage and
promote. Analyses examining congruence between perceived and preferred levels of
involvement in care were also significant. Thus, congruence in involvement letting
patients be involved to the degree they desire may improve HRQOL. In reflecting on
the congruence findings it is important to note that very few women reported being
more involved than they wished to be and inability to be as involved as they would
have preferred was far more common, suggesting again that higher levels of
involvement are protective of long-term HRQOL.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735418762543" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Finally, women in this study were predominantly white, well-educated, and married.
Replication of this work including women in other parts of the country and those
receiving other forms of CAM specialist care would be valuable in describing the
generalizability of these findings.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>NO care may help women with breast cancer improve their HRQOL in early survivorship.
More research is needed to understand how ND’s care improves patient well-being,
both through the provision of specific treatments and through provision of care and
support more generally. Involvement in decision-making about cancer treatment also
improves HRQOL in early survivorship, and the effects of involvement appear to be
independent of use of NO care. This finding adds to the modest body of research
documenting positive health and psychosocial outcomes for patients who are involved
in decision-making about their cancer treatment, and for those who are able to
participate consistent with their preferences. NDs providing CAM services may assist
their patients through their ability to provide additional CAM care options where
women have greater leeway to be involved in treatment decision-making then may be
the case in conventional care offices where there are often a standard or
guideline-based treatment that is strongly encouraged to assure the best chance for
important clinical outcomes. NDs caring for breast cancer patients clearly have many
possible means by which they may improve patient well-being during treatment by
supporting patients’ efforts to be informed decision-makers in their own care, but
this alone does not explain their value. The degree to which individual CAM
activities or supplements contribute to the overall benefits found here associated
with NO care should be a topic of additional research.</p>
