              <abstract>
                <p>A hallmark of Fanconi anemia is accelerated decline in hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (CD34 +) leading to bone marrow failure. Long-term treatment
requires hematopoietic cell transplantation from an unaffected donor but is
associated with potentially severe side-effects. Gene therapy to correct the
genetic defect in the patient’s own CD34<sup>+</sup> cells has been
limited by low CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers and viability. Here we demonstrate
an altered ratio of CD34<sup>Hi</sup> to CD34<sup>Lo</sup> cells in Fanconi
patients relative to healthy donors, with exclusive <italic>in vitro</italic>
repopulating ability in only CD34<sup>Hi</sup> cells, underscoring a need for
novel strategies to preserve limited CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. To address this
need, we developed a clinical protocol to deplete
lineage<sup>+</sup>(CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup> and
CD19<sup>+</sup>) cells from blood and marrow products. This process
depletes &gt;90% of lineage<sup>+</sup>cells while retaining
≥60% of the initial CD34<sup>+</sup>cell fraction, reduces total
nucleated cells by 1–2 logs, and maintains transduction efficiency and
cell viability following gene transfer. Importantly, transduced
lineage<sup>−</sup> cell products engrafted equivalently to that of
purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from the same donor when xenotransplanted at
matched CD34<sup>+</sup> cell doses. This novel selection strategy has been
approved by the regulatory agencies in a gene therapy study for Fanconi anemia
patients (<italic>NCI Clinical Trial Reporting Program Registry ID

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare monogenic disease with a wide array and variable
presence of clinical symptoms, the hallmark of which is bone marrow (BM)
failure.<sup><xref rid="b1-1031806" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The
genetic basis of FA is a mutation in any one of 21 genes<sup><xref rid="b2-1031806" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> whose protein components make up the
FA/breast cancer pathway responsible for DNA repair of inter-strand crosslinks
through nucleotide excision followed by homologous recombination. Resulting
compromises in genetic integrity are associated with a nearly uniform decline in
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), a 50% incidence of
myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia by adolescence, and a 25%
lifetime incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or gynecological
cancer.<sup><xref rid="b3-1031806" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In some
patients, blood cell clones demonstrate spontaneous reversion to wild type (i.e.
somatic mosaicism) leading to improved and stable blood cell counts for up to 27
years.<sup><xref rid="b4-1031806" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="b6-1031806" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Thus, correction of the FA
hematopoietic defect could significantly alter the disease’s clinical
course, and this has driven decades of research in HSPC gene therapy for FA.</p>
              <p>While FA was recognized as an early candidate disorder for gene therapy, several
obstacles have been identified that have delayed clinical success.<sup><xref rid="b3-1031806" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Initial clinical trials
demonstrated a dramatic approximately 50-fold reduction in the number of true HSPCs
in FA patients relative to other gene therapy patients, such as those treated for
primary immune deficiencies.<sup><xref rid="b7-1031806" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Moreover, FA HSPCs were exceptionally fragile when manipulated
<italic>ex vivo</italic> for gene transfer. No treated patient has demonstrated
stable improvements in blood cell counts with long-term persistence of
gene-corrected blood cells. These studies highlighted two needs for innovation in
<italic>FA</italic> gene therapy: 1) to increase the number of available HSPCs
for gene transfer and infusion; and 2) to increase the engraftment potential of
these cells after gene transfer and infusion. Following the recommendations of the
International FA Gene Therapy Working Group,<sup><xref rid="b8-1031806" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we launched a phase I clinical trial of gene
therapy for FA complementation group A (FA-A) patients in 2011 (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: 01331018</italic>). This trial
design incorporates several features aiming to improve HSPC numbers and fitness.
These include: i) a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector (LV) for transfer of
the <italic>FANCA</italic> cDNA regulated by a human phosphoglycerate kinase (hPGK)
promoter; ii) a short, overnight transduction to minimize <italic>ex vivo</italic>
manipulation, as well as addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
throughout manipulation; and iii) culture under reduced oxygen (5%) to limit
oxidative DNA damage.<sup><xref rid="b9-1031806" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The target HSPC population for gene transfer expresses the CD34 cell surface protein
(CD34<sup>+</sup>). When stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibody against
CD34 and analyzed by flow cytometry, a small proportion of BM cells are
CD34<sup>+</sup>, representing both primitive stem cells and more committed
progenitors.<sup><xref rid="b10-1031806" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The
standard clinical procedure for isolating these cells first involves either BM
collection or mobilization of the cells into circulation through cytokine
stimulation with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or, in certain
clinical scenarios, a combination of G-CSF and the chemokine receptor CXCR4
antagonist plerixafor, followed by peripheral blood leukapheresis (mAPH). Initial
isolation technologies relied on CD34 antigen expression on the cell surface and
utilized biotinavidin affinity, panning, or immununomagnetic bead-based approaches.
Expected yields were 50% of available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with highly
variable purities, ranging from 20–90% across techniques.<sup><xref rid="b11-1031806" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Of these, immunomagnetic
bead-based positive selection is the most widely-applied today, with the first US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a clinical device for human use in
2014. Advances in this technology to include automation have improved reliability in
recovery to a mean yield of 70% with purities regularly over
90%.<sup><xref rid="b12-1031806" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-1031806" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, these values are
based on BM and mAPH products wherein 1–3% of total cells express
CD34 antigen, and the majority of these cells display high levels of CD34. For FA
patients, the frequency of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is much lower:
0.1–1.5% in BM.<sup><xref rid="b14-1031806" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-1031806" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This
implies that non-standard processes may be required to preserve the limited numbers
of HSPCs for gene transfer in FA.</p>
              <p>Here we report HSPC collection results for the first 3 patients treated on our study.
Initially, this protocol proposed direct isolation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from BM
without prior attempts at mobilization. The addition of a mobilization regimen with
subsequent leukapheresis collections has permitted the evaluation of CD34 expression
patterns in both product types and provided evidence for the need for alternative
HSPC isolation strategies.</p>

colony-forming potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031806">Figure

majority of CFC capacity in comparison with CD34<sup>Lo</sup> cells, and at much
higher levels as compared to the FA-A patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031806">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest repopulating capacity
is restricted to CD34<sup>Hi</sup> cell fractions, underscoring the need to

for collection of CD34<sup>Hi</sup> cells. However, in Patient 1, direct

resulting in an approximately 3% yield and only
5.34×10<sup>6</sup> total CD34<sup>+</sup> cells available for gene
transfer (<xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, the

47% loss in viable cells was observed during culture and gene transfer.

were expected to reduce the cell product available for transduction to a level
lower than observed for Patient 1. Thus, an urgent amendment was filed with the
FDA to permit elimination of the direct CD34 enrichment steps and allow
transduction of the entire red blood cell (RBC)-depleted BM product. This
processing change preserved more CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), with improved transduction and viability

Building on our previous work automating cell selection and gene transfer using

RBC debulking and immunomagnetic bead-based lineage specific depletion strategy

different bead-conjugated antibody reagents were used in this approach: anti-CD3

NK-cell removal), and anti-CD19 (B-cell removal). This protocol was designed for
both BM and mAPH products.</p>

apheresis product (mAPH) (1). BM products were first processed through
hetastarch sedimentation to deplete red blood cells (RBCs).
Leukapheresis products were first subjected to several washes to deplete
platelets. For direct CD34<sup>+</sup> cell selection, anti-CD34
antibody-bound immunomagnetic beads (microbeads) are used, whereas for
lineage depletion anti-CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>,
CD16<sup>+</sup>, and CD19<sup>+</sup>, microbeads are used (2). In
both cases, microbead-bound cells are retained on the column and
subjected to wash steps. When lineage depletion is used, CD34-expressing
cells undergo minimal manipulation during purification. Following
purification, cells are cultured and transduced with a VSV-G pseudotyped
lentiviral vector at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5–10
IU/ cell (3). Following ~16 hours of incubation cells are harvested (4).

CD16, or CD19) (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1A</italic> and

mAPH products were processed over 13 hours. Observed total nucleated cell (TNC)
reduction was approximately 1 log for both BM and mAPH products following
lineage depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4A</xref>). All
target lineage<sup>+</sup> cells were depleted to less than 10% of

Retention of available CD34<sup>Hi</sup> and CD34<sup>Lo</sup> cells was

Approximately 24% of BM CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were colony-forming in a

both cell product types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure

products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4E</xref>). Final cell

testing demonstrated values within criteria for patient infusion.
Lineage-depleted and transduced cells from six mAPH and BM products each were
infused into immunodeficient (NSG) mice at a target cell dose of

                <title>Lineage depletion protocol preserves limited FA CD34<sup>Hi</sup>
cells</title>
                <p>These data collectively suggest that lineage-specific depletion preserved
available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells without compromising transduction efficiency or
cell fitness. Under FDA approval, the clinical protocol was modified to include
both BM and/or mAPH products, with lineage depletion as the method of
CD34<sup>+</sup> cell enrichment. Patient 3 (the first treated under the
modified protocol) was a 5-year old male with FA-A confirmed by complementation
studies. Baseline neutrophils averaged 1.7×10<sup>9</sup>/L and baseline
platelets averaged 32×10<sup>9</sup>/L in the six months prior to
treatment, with declining neutrophils and platelets over the prior 2-year
interval (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>). Mobilization of
≥10 CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/ μL peripheral blood was achieved
(<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5A</italic>), and two successive
apheresis collections resulted in 8.5×10<sup>10</sup> TNC containing a
total 1.6×10<sup>8</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The patient required a total of two
platelet transfusions and two packed red blood cell transfusions during
mobilization and leukapheresis (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure
S5B</italic>). Due to column limitations, 5×10<sup>10</sup> TNC
(equivalent to 9.5×10<sup>7</sup> total CD34<sup>+</sup> cells) were
subjected to lineage depletion, and the remainder were cryopreserved. Lineage
depletion resulted in a 94% reduction in TNC and a 56% retention
of available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. CD34 purity was 1.6%, representing
a 1–2 log-fold increase in the total number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells
per kg available for transduction and infusion relative to Patients 1 and 2
(<xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A total of
52.8×10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were transduced at an MOI
of 5 IU/cell, resulting in a final cell dose of 2.4×10<sup>6</sup> total
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells per kg with 99.3% viability based on trypan
blue dye exclusion. Approximately 26% of CFCs in this cell product were
transduced, displaying a mean VCN of approximately 1 (0.9) (<xref rid="t3-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, limited numbers of
available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were indirectly enriched using lineage
depletion on a blood product from an FA-A patient without compromising
transduction efficiency.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Here we confirm prior reports of inefficient CD34<sup>+</sup> cell enrichment from FA
patient blood products by direct, immunomagnetic bead-based separation, which is the
current standard protocol for isolating HSPCs.<sup><xref rid="b15-1031806" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b19-1031806" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="b21-1031806" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
We also demonstrate substantially reduced levels of CD34<sup>Hi</sup> cells in FA
patients relative to healthy donors, which likely contributes to poor positive
selection results in blood products from FA patients. Colony seeding assays
demonstrate that only CD34<sup>Hi</sup> cells contribute to <italic>in
vitro</italic> colony-forming potential in both FA and healthy donor blood
products, underscoring the need to preserve as many available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells
as possible during <italic>ex vivo</italic> manipulation for gene transfer. We
demonstrate a clinically viable procedure for depleting lineage positive cells to
indirectly enrich for CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that preserves the limited numbers of
these cells in FA-A patients without compromising viability, gene transfer, or
engraftment potential.</p>
              <p>Importantly, the phenotype of limiting CD34<sup>+</sup> cell numbers is not
restricted to FA alone. Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients treated with hydroxyurea
also display reduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cell frequencies in BM, and there is a
contraindication to mobilization of available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells owing to an
increased risk of vaso-occlusive crisis.<sup><xref rid="b22-1031806" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Other inherited BM failure syndromes such as dyskeratosis
congenita also are associated with abnormal CD34<sup>+</sup> cell frequencies and
behavior.<sup><xref rid="b23-1031806" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> As a
larger number of disease targets become relevant for gene therapy, additional
patient populations will likely display variable CD34<sup>+</sup> cell frequency and
antigen expression. These disease targets could also benefit from clinically viable
alternative selection procedures such as we have developed here.</p>
              <p>Our observation of CFC potential in only the CD34<sup>Hi</sup> fraction in both FA
and healthy samples suggests that CD34<sup>Lo</sup> cells may not be contributing to
hematopoietic reconstitution. Notably, our data are from mAPH samples not BM, and we
will need more patients for confirmation. Additionally, the standard colony-forming
assay best defines progenitor cells, more so than true long-term repopulating
hematopoietic stem cells.<sup><xref rid="b24-1031806" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Alternatively, xenotransplant of purified cells into
immunodeficient mice could provide the most robust evidence for CD34<sup>+</sup>
cell function <italic>in vivo</italic>, but the very small numbers of these cells
may prove problematic to achieving relevant cell doses needed for these experiments.
Another <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, such as the long-term culture-initiating
cell assay,<sup><xref rid="b25-1031806" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> may provide
additional insight into the desired target CD34<sup>+</sup> subpopulations for gene
therapy if they are present in either the CD34<sup>Hi</sup> or CD34<sup>Lo</sup>
populations in FA patients. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that the
CD34<sup>Hi</sup>CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup> phenotype is
responsible for hematopoietic repopulation in non-human primates in the autologous,
myeloablative setting,<sup><xref rid="b16-1031806" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
and evaluation of this phenotype in the enrolled FA patients is ongoing. Critically,
our strategy of depleting cells expressing mature blood cell lineage markers
preserves all CD34<sup>+</sup> cell phenotypes for gene transfer and infusion, as
demonstrated by Patient 3, whose infused CD34<sup>+</sup> cell dose was the largest
received to date.</p>
              <p>One characteristic of lineage-depleted cell products requiring additional study is
the presence and impact of other supporting cells on engraftment. Especially for
BM-derived products, our procedure does not include a marker to deplete mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC). While the engraftment potential of MSC manipulated <italic>ex
vivo</italic> in CD34<sup>+</sup> cell supportive media is unexplored, two
recent reports suggest that these cells are integral to BM function in FA, and can
be LV-transduced and functionally corrected to facilitate hematopoietic recovery and
function in a mouse model of FA.<sup><xref rid="b26-1031806" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1031806" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> For
mAPH-derived products, such as that infused into Patient 3, additional follow up
will be required to determine if a selective advantage is observed <italic>in
vivo</italic>. The improved transduction efficiency of lineage-depleted cell
products could reflect non-repopulating CD34<sup>−</sup> cell uptake of LV.
However, we still observed a benefit in transduction of hematopoietic CFC, even at
the lower MOI of 5 IU/cell. One other possible explanation is the age and clinical
condition of Patient 3. To address this concern we compared our results in Patient 3
to the 4 FA patients enrolled in the FANCOSTEM clinical trial in Spain
(<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier:
02931071</italic>).<sup><xref rid="b28-1031806" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
These 4 patients were aged 3–7 years and demonstrated higher baseline blood
cell counts at the time of collection. All 4 patients received the same mobilization
regimen as Patient 3 reported here, but resulting mAPH products were subjected to
direct CD34 enrichment prior to transduction at an MOI of 100 IU/cell. The reported
mean VCN was 0.4±0.1 and ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 copies in individual CFC.
Our data with a higher VCN at lower MOI suggest that the mixed cell culture supports
transduction of hematopoietic progenitor cells, at least.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we describe an alternative strategy to a direct, immunomagnetic
bead-based selection of CD34-expressing cells that overcomes current barriers in
isolation of blood stem and progenitor cells especially for diseases like FA. Our
novel approach to preserve available CD34<sup>+</sup> cells during initial blood
product processing has the potential to improve gene therapy and gene editing in
settings of limited CD34<sup>+</sup> cell availability, including FA and other
diseases in which direct CD34 enrichment has proven inefficient, such as SCD.</p>
