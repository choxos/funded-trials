                <p id="P22">Cancer treatments have evolved from indiscriminate cytotoxic agents to
selective genome- and immune-targeted drugs that have transformed outcomes for
some malignancies.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Tumor
complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the “precision medicine”
paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the
individual patient.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> To date, precision oncology
trials have been based upon molecular matching with predetermined
monotherapies.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Several of these trials have
been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5–10%
range,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and low
response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels,
restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability or the
deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented.
We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would
improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of
this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional, prospective study
(I-PREDICT, <related-object id="RO1" source-type="clinical-trials-registry" source-id="ClinicalTrials.gov" source-id-type="registry-name" document-id="NCT02534675" document-id-type="clinical-trial-number">NCT02534675</related-object>) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely
recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We
found that administration of customized multi-drug regimens was feasible, with
49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a
larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher
“matching score,” was correlated with significantly improved
disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival
rates, as compared to when fewer somatic alterations were targeted. Our findings
suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which
pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating
molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized
agents.</p>

a prospective navigation trial, at two centers (University of California, San Diego
Moores Cancer Center and Avera Cancer Institute). Tissue genomic profiling using next
generation sequencing (NGS) (Foundation Medicine; 236–405 genes), and, if
possible, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutational burden (TMB),
microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and NGS of blood-derived circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) were performed. Based on this information, a Molecular Tumor Board consisting of
oncologists, pharmacologists, cancer biologists, geneticists, surgeons, radiologists,
pathologists, and bioinformatics experts focused on selecting customized, multi-drug
combinations to target a majority of the genomic alterations in each patient’s
tumor(s) while simultaneously considering potential overlapping drug toxicities. The
therapies ultimately administered were based on the treating oncologists’ choice,
with physicians crafting the regimen by incorporating Molecular Tumor Board discussions,
as well as patient preference, attention to co-morbidities, consideration of drug
toxicities, insurance payor coverage of off-label agent(s), and investigational agent
clinical trial availability, hence reflecting actual clinical practice in the United
States today.</p>
            <p id="P24">One hundred and forty-nine patients with previously treated, refractory, lethal
metastatic cancers (Stage IV disease) were consented to the I-PREDICT trial.
Eighty-three patients (56%) were treated and evaluable for analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These 83 patients
had a median of two prior lines of therapy. The other 66 patients were considered
inevaluable, mainly because they deteriorated or died before treatment could be
initiated (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). Patient
demographics of the 83 treated patients are described in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The most common primary tumor sites were gastrointestinal
(including hepatopancreatobiliary) (42.2%), gynecologic (16.9%), breast (14.5%), and
central nervous system (CNS, 7.2%). The median number of characterized genomic
alterations per tumor was 5 (range: 1–20; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P25">Of the 83 treated patients, 73 (88% of treated patients; 49% of enrolled
patients) were administered a personalized, precision therapy consisting of ≥1
molecularly “matched” treatments (≥1 MT), following receipt of
molecular profile results. No two molecular profiles were identical and, hence, most
treatment regimens were not exactly alike. The other 10 patients (12%) were not
administered matched therapies (no-MT), although 9 of them had potential matches for
receiving targeted therapies. Instead, they received only “unmatched”
standard-of-care drugs for their respective tumor types, most often due to the treating
oncologists’ choices (36.4%), patient preference (36.4%), clinical trial
availability of other investigational agents (18.2%), and consideration of drug
toxicities (9.1%) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table
3</xref>). The median time from study consent to treatment initiation was less than
one month (0.93 months, 95% CI 0.73–1.4). Since the protocol permitted use of
FoundationOne molecular tests performed as part of physicians’ routine practice
(before enrollment), the median time from molecular results until treatment initiation
was 2.0 months (95% CI 1.3–2.3).</p>
            <p id="P26">The 73 patients (≥1 MT) had previously been treated with a median of 2
(IQR 1–3) prior lines of therapy. They received a median of 2 drugs in their
on-study treatment regimens (range: 1–5, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>). <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref> details the percentage of matched genomic alterations in a
pathway, complex, or gene that were targeted by the customized therapeutic regimens
(median of 2 genomic alterations targeted per patient; range: 1–6). Of the 73
patients, all had matches linked to genomic alterations (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for molecular results
and drug matches with supporting references); in 67 patients (91.8%), the drugs were
gene product-targeted drugs, while the others were checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy,
based on the genomic profile (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Specifically, a checkpoint inhibitor was
administered (alone or in combination with other drugs) to 14 matched patients (19.1%)
based upon PD-L1 IHC positivity, high/intermediate TMB, MSI high status,
<italic>CD274</italic> (PD-L1) amplification, or when tumors had ≥8 genomic
alterations with unknown PD-L1 IHC, TMB, and MSI.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Four patients
(5.5%) were treated with hormone therapies in combination with other molecularly
targeted drugs based on positive hormone status. Only two patients had one genomic
alteration and were molecularly matched to one drug. Patients given no-MT (N=10)
received a median of 2 drugs (range: 1–3).</p>
            <p id="P27">As previously described,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a “Matching Score” score
system was then utilized for each patient. Blinded to patient outcomes, the
investigators calculated the total number of molecular alterations matched to the drugs
administered and divided that number by the total number of characterized genomic
aberrations. Further details for scoring are delineated in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref> (<bold>Matching Score</bold>).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
We next stratified patients based upon Matching Scores &gt;50% (designated as high;
N=28 patients) versus ≤50% [designated as low; N=55 patients including 10
patients with no-MT administered (Matching Scores = 0%)] (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The total number of molecular matches for the
high group was 67 (mean: 2.4 matches per patient). Patients with high Matching Scores
received a median of 2 drugs in their regimen (range: 1–5 drugs) as did patients
with low Matching Scores (median: 2 drugs (range: 1–4 drugs)(<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P28">Patients were followed until progression of disease, treatment intolerability,
or death. The overall median follow up was 10.8 months (95% CI 6.9–14.6; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Overall,
30% of patients evaluable for response achieved disease control [defined as stable
disease (SD) ≥6 months (N=4); complete response (CR, N=1); or partial response
(PR, N=16)]. When patients were stratified to high and low groups, a high Matching Score
was an independent predictor of an increased disease control rate (DCR); 50% of the
patients with a high Matching Score achieved disease control as compared to 22.4% of
patients with a low Matching Score (P=0.028, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table
2</xref>). Amongst the different variables tested, Matching Score &gt;50% was
the only parameter significantly associated with higher DCR (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).
The multivariable analysis confirmed that only a high Matching Score was an independent
predictor of higher DCR [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; 95% CI 1.1–11.8; P=0.033].</p>
            <p id="P29">A higher Matching Score was also an independent predictor of longer
progression-free survival (PFS) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and
<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and overall survival (OS) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure
1F</xref>) according to Kaplan-Meier analysis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. All treated patients (N=83) were included in the PFS and OS
analyses of high Matching Score versus low Matching Score (median PFS: 6.5 versus 3.1
months, P=0.001; median OS: not reached after a median follow up of 8.5 months versus
10.2 months; P=0.046). In multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for patient age,
gender, matching score, disease site, combination therapy, and therapy line, a high
Matching Score remained the most significant variable associated with a prolonged PFS
[HR for low versus high Matching Score: 0.34 (95% CI 0.19–0.62, P=0.0004)] and
with a prolonged OS [HR for low versus high Matching Score: 0.42 (95% CI
0.18–0.95, P=0.038)].</p>
            <p id="P30">Generally, PFS becomes shorter with each line of therapy administered. Thus, we
compared the PFS on the study (PFS2) with the immediate prior line of unmatched therapy
(PFS1), hence using the patient as their own control. Specifically, we compared the
frequency of patients with a PFS ratio (PFS2/PFS1) ≥1.3, based upon the work of
Von Hoff and colleagues who reported that 27% (18 of 66) of molecularly matched patients
had a PFS ratio of ≥1.3.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the
current study, a high Matching Score was the only parameter significantly impacting the
PFS ratio ≥1.3 in both the univariable (P=0.026) and multivariable analyses
(P=0.015) (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Indeed, 75% of patients reached a PFS ratio
≥1.3 if the Matching Score was &gt;50% as compared to 36.6% if the Matching
Score was ≤50% (P=0.026) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These
findings indicate PFS can be prolonged by 30% or longer in later lines of therapy when a
majority of the molecular alterations are targeted.</p>
            <p id="P31">We also attempted to understand if other parameters were impacting patient
outcomes in a sub-analysis that only included patients who received ≥1 MT (N=73)
(<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).
This sub-analysis demonstrated that both a time interval between the tissue biopsy and
molecularly matched treatment initiation of &lt;9 months, as well as the addition of
chemotherapy in the regimen, increased the rate of patients achieving disease control
(SD≥6 months/CR/PR) in a multivariate analysis (P=0.031 and P=0.033,
respectively). However, only the Matching Score remained a favorable independent
predictor in the multivariable analysis for the PFS and OS analyses (P=0.004 and
P=0.050, respectively), further validating earlier studies of this
methodology.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P32">We also evaluated the role of targeting downstream of <italic>RAS</italic> and
<italic>TP53</italic>, two common mutations in cancers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). To
date, there is not a specific drug known to directly target RAS. Furthermore, the
efficacy of MEK inhibitors has been circumstantial and mixed.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It is unclear if the weak efficacy of current
MEK inhibitors for <italic>KRAS</italic> targeting is a fundamental property of these
inhibitors or if it is related to the fact that <italic>KRAS</italic> alterations are
usually accompanied by other drivers that need to be targeted. Of interest in this
regard is a recent report demonstrating that a patient with Rosai Dorfman syndrome and a
single activating <italic>KRAS</italic> alteration had a remarkable response to the MEK
inhibitor cobimetinib.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In regard to
<italic>TP53</italic> aberrations, recent data suggest it may be
indirectly/partially target matched with VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors inhibitors (perhaps
because loss of p53 function is associated with upregulation of VEGF-A).<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Thus, we evaluated the DCR, PFS, and OS for patients with
<italic>TP53</italic> and/or <italic>RAS</italic> mutations that were treated with
VEGF/VEGFR and/or MEK inhibitors versus patients with <italic>TP53</italic> and/or
<italic>RAS</italic> mutations who were not matched to any therapy (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). There is no
difference between the groups, although the numbers are too small to draw definitive
conclusions. However, Wheler and colleagues did address this question in regard to
<italic>TP53</italic> alterations matched to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> That report showed that VEGF/VEGFR
inhibitor therapy was independently associated with improvement in all outcome
parameters for <italic>TP53</italic>-mutant patients (but not for <italic>TP53</italic>
wild-type patients) (who received no other molecular-matched agents) treated with
VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors (versus those not treated with these agents).</p>
            <p id="P33">Overall, 16 of 83 treated patients (19.3%) experienced ≥1 serious adverse
events (SAE) in the study [14 of 73 (19.2%) with ≥1 MT and 2 of 10 (20%) with no
MT administered]. The number of drugs in the regimen was unrelated to the number of
SAEs. The SAEs deemed at least possibly or probably related to drug trended to be less
common in patients with a Matching Score &gt;50% versus ≤50% [1 (3.6%) versus
7 (15.6%); P=0.14] There were no treatment-related deaths in this study. Taken together,
therapy-related SAEs tended to be more common in the patients who received no-MT and in
patients with a Matching Score ≤50%. (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 8</xref>–<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P34">Matching single agents (other than immunotherapies for select individuals) to
tumors with multiple genomic alterations is unlikely to result in prolonged or complete
remissions. In fact, only two patients (2.7%) in our cohort with ≥1 MT had only
one genomic alteration identified. Yet, precision medicine trials performed to date
concentrate on finding commonalities between patients and then matching them to
monotherapy, a design consistent with traditional treatment models, but inconsistent
with the reality unveiled by genomics (i.e., the vast majority of patients with
metastatic tumors have numerous genomic alterations that differ from patient to
patient).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P35">We achieved a matching rate of 49% (73 of 149 patients), a number considerably
higher than in any other precision medicine trials of which we are aware. This high
matching rate was based on several key factors: (i) molecular interrogation by NGS for a
large panel of cancer-related genes, and including assessment, when possible, of TMB,
MSI status, PD-L1 IHC and ctDNA; (ii) timely Molecular Tumor Board discussions (that
occurred immediately upon receipt of molecular results including by <italic>ad
hoc</italic> e-meetings) to inform treatment recommendations without delay; and
(iii) use of a medication acquisition specialist and clinical trials coordinator to
ensure rapid access to drugs. It is important to note that we did not treat canonical
tumor types for success. For example, no melanomas were treated and only three lung
cancers (3.6%) were included, demonstrating that this approach may be feasible and
effective in diseases that are classically not thought of in the setting of molecularly
targeted approaches.</p>
            <p id="P36">The study had several limitations, including the lack of a control group. In
addition, the number of alterations detected may depend upon the number of genes
interrogated in a given panel test. Therefore, the specific Matching Scores and cut offs
could differ between panels. However, the more comprehensive the panel with regard to
cancer-related genes, the more accurate the Matching Score should be. Further, the
important finding herein is that higher degrees of matching are associated with better
outcomes than lower degrees of matching, and that higher Matching Scores often require
customized combinations, rather than single agents, as is often given in traditional
precision oncology trials. Further validation and assay harmonization studies will be
needed to determine a universal cut off for matching, although it remains conceivable
that degrees of matching and outcome are related in a continuum. Another limitation
relates to the fact that some of the matches, especially in the high Matching Score
group, were to immunotherapy and this was often based upon high TMB status. Hence, these
results may confound our ability to calculate matching of strictly gene-targeted agents.
But, our findings demonstrate that genomics and other biomarkers are more broadly useful
for matching a variety of drugs beyond gene-targeted agents. However, our findings may
have potential self-selection bias for patients that sought out enrollment on the trial
or bias based upon physician referral. Even so, this study represents real-world
practice patterns, and the molecular matching of targets with cognate agents is
generally independent of these issues and therefore likely to have low impact on the
results. Finally, a limitation of the paper is the small number of patients in
individual subgroups, such as those with <italic>TP53</italic> alterations matched with
VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors or <italic>RAS</italic> mutations matched with MEK inhibitors
alone, which precluded determining the efficacy of these matches when not part of a
combination regimen. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed.</p>
            <p id="P37">In conclusion, the administration of N-of-1 customized, multi-drug combinations
targeting multiple identified molecular alterations (discerned by NGS) based upon
recommendations from a just-in-time Molecular Tumor Board was feasible and safe.
Characteristics of this intervention (e.g., the Matching Score) were associated with
significant improvements in the disease control rate and all survival parameters. Though
we were able to administer ≥1 matched drug to 49% of our patients, substantial
numbers of patients still dropped off, mostly due to disease deterioration with hospice
placement or demise. Therefore, personalized, precision medicine approaches should be
instituted earlier in the course of the disease. At present, there is another study
group in the I-PREDICT trial investigating the administration of customized combination
therapies in treatment-naïve patients with unresectable and metastatic
disease.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Enrollment is
ongoing. Taken together, our findings underscore the safety, feasibility and the
importance of designing precision oncology trials that emphasize personalized,
individually tailored combination therapies, rather than scripted monotherapies, for
patients with lethal cancers. Follow up studies with greater numbers of patients are
needed to confirm our findings.</p>

evaluate the feasibility of using molecular profile-based evidence to determine
individualized cancer therapy for patients with incurable malignancies. This was
a non-randomized, histology-agnostic trial. Although there would be a case mix
of histologies, we know that individual histologies are composed of a
heterogeneous mix of genomic alterations. It is not clear that one case mix is
better or worse than another. Thus, we designed the study to test a strategy of
molecular matching that may apply across cancers.</p>
                <sec id="S7">
                  <title>Sample size:</title>
                  <p id="P42">This feasibility study has descriptive primary analyses to
characterize the study findings. There were three groups and only results
from Group 3 (previously treated unresectable/metastatic patients) are
described herein; groups 1 and 2 (treatment-naïve unresectable and
treatment-naïve metastatic with lethal diseases) are not described
and are accruing. A Molecular Tumor Board recommended therapy, but treatment
decisions were the choice of the physician. The primary study objective was
to determine the feasibility of using molecular testing to determine therapy
for patients with previously treated cancers with incurable biology
(≥50% 2- year cancer-associated mortality). Primary and secondary
endpoints included: the proportion of patients who receive molecularly
targeted matched treatment after recommendations based on genomic analysis
(primary endpoint); proportion of patients with actionable genomic
alterations and overall response rate, regression rate, progression-free and
overall survival and incidence of high-grade adverse events (secondary and
exploratory endpoints). Relevant hypotheses included: patients who receive
targeted therapy based upon recommendations from actionable genomic
alteration(s) will yield anti-tumor activity; the PFS on matched therapy
will be greater than on their last unmatched therapy. For evaluation of
treatment decisions, the Study Committee assessed the degree of matching
that occurred using the best information available at the time of the data
evaluation. The original plan was to enroll 75 evaluable patients. Since
this was a hypothesis-generating, descriptive trial, this number was later
expanded to permit enrollment of up to 1,000 patients. Based on the fact
that a minority of patients is usually matched to therapy on precision
medicine trials, it was expected that we would show feasibility with 40% of
the 75 evaluable patients (N=30) being matched and 60% treated with no
matched therapy (N=45). With the sample size of 30 matched versus 45
unmatched, we would have 79% power to detect a response rate of 0.25 versus
0.05 in the two arms with one-sided 10% type I error rate using the
continuity corrected chi-square test. We calculated we would have more than
80% power to detect the difference between the two groups using the log-rank
test when the median PFS is 4 months and 2 months for the two arms,
respectively. We analyzed group 3 after enrollment of 149 patients;
feasibility to administer matched therapy was confirmed because, of the 83
evaluable treated patients, 73 (88% of evaluable treated patients and 49% of
enrolled patients) were matched. The ability to compare matched and
unmatched patient was limited by the small number of evaluable unmatched
patients (N=10). As part of the descriptive analysis, we evaluated the
effect of degree of matching in patients with low versus high matching
scores (N=55 versus 28 patients).</p>

therapy given was the choice of the treating oncologist. Treatment was
considered “matched” if at least one agent in the treatment
regimen targeted at least one aberration, or pathway component, altered in a
patient’s molecular profile or a protein preferentially expressed in the
tumor [e.g., estrogen receptor (ER) or androgen receptor (AR) or Her2 status] as
assessed by standard of care testing other than NGS, or PD-L1 expression
assessed by immunohistochemistry as above). For small molecule inhibitors,
matching was based on low inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of the drug for
the target (generally, less than 100 nM) or for effectors immediately downstream
of the gene product altered. Antibodies were considered matched if their primary
target was the product of the molecular alteration. Matching designation was
confirmed by the senior investigators (RK and JS), who were blinded to patient
outcomes at the time of designation. Patients were stratified into those having
received at least one matched treatment (1 MT) versus no matched treatment
(no-MT) administered, with a later further stratification into those who
received treatment with Matching Scores &gt;50% versus ≤50%. For
patients navigated to a secondary clinical trial, to which they consented, the
doses used were as per the clinical trial for that cohort. Otherwise, dosing
combinations of drugs was done according to safety rules gleaned from the

for <italic>de novo</italic> combinations, we started patients at about 50% of
the usual dose of each drug for two drug combinations, and at about one-third of
the dose of each drug for three-drug combinations. Patients then received

                <title>Alternative Approach to Matching Score for Immune Checkpoint Blockade</title>
                <p id="P71">There may be alternative approaches to scoring matches, especially in
the case of immunotherapy, as one drug may be used in some circumstances to
theoretically target multiple genomic alterations. It is becoming increasingly
evident that immune checkpoint blockade and genomics are not separate silos, but
rather linked to each other. This is because abnormalities in DNA damage repair
and DNA replication can result in increased rates of somatic mutations in
tumors. In turn, the presentation of neo-antigens generated by the mutanome in
combination with immune system activation by checkpoint blockade can distinguish
normal from tumor tissue. Based on studies demonstrating a relationship between
TMB and immunotherapy response (i.e., the higher the TMB, the greater the
response rate) and between other gene alterations, such as PDL1 amplification
and response, genomics is directly relevant to selecting patients for immune
checkpoint blockade.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Furthermore, the FDA has
approved the immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, for any solid tumor
with alterations in DNA mismatch repair pathway genes
(e.g.,<italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MSH6</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic>,
<italic>PMS2</italic>) due to associated large increases in TMB.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Moreover, TMB increases
correlate with a higher neoantigen load based upon somatic mutation data from
the TCGA.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In turn, these
would be expected to be more immunogenic and therefore responsive to
immunotherapy.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P72">In a retrospective fashion that was unblinded to outcomes, we developed
an alternative approach for scoring immune checkpoint blockade matches. In a
histology agnostic fashion, we previously reported objective response rates
(ORR, %) for patients receiving immunotherapy in the setting of low,
intermediate, and high TMB.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>
Therefore, we adopted these ORRs as the matching scores for intermediate TMB
(15/48 = 31%) and high TMB (22/38 = 58%) tumors. As noted above, four patients
(47, 121, 155, A011) had high TMB and received immunotherapy, while four more
patients (102, 115, A035, A037) had intermediate TMB and received immunotherapy.
Following evaluation with this alternative Matching Score approach, all eight
patients remained in their same assigned group with Matching Scores &gt;50%.
Thus, none of the results changed. Furthermore, if we assessed CD274
amplification targeted with immunotherapy as one alterations targeted by one
drug, the two patients (141, A016) with CD274 amplifications and 11 or 12 other
alterations who received immunotherapy remained in the Matching Score
≤50% group. Again, the two patients’ group assignments did not
change with the amended scoring. See <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Text</xref> for selected

survival endpoints. The importance of a prognostic factor was assessed by the
odds ratio (OR) using log-rank test and logistic regression/Cox regression
models). Statistical analysis was performed by MS and RO, as well as verified by
JJL using SPSS version 24.0.</p>
