                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Allergic reactions to Hymenoptera insect stings remain a major global clinical problem. Although effective, parenteral desensitization regimens require use of costly venom extracts and require frequent visits over extended periods of time.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Adjuvants are commonly used to enhance the efficacy of infectious disease vaccines, and this study asked whether Advax (Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia), a novel noninflammatory polysaccharide adjuvant, might provide similar benefits for allergy desensitization.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A randomized, controlled phase 1/2 trial was undertaken in 27 adults with a history of rapid-onset systemic allergic reactions to honeybee stings and positive specific IgE levels to evaluate the safety and efficacy of honeybee venom immunotherapy (HBVIT) combined with Advax adjuvant. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) was administered monthly for 30 months after achievement of maintenance doses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Advax-adjuvanted HBVIT was well tolerated. Around week 14 of VIT, specific IgG<sub>4</sub> responses peaked in both groups but increased earlier, peaked higher, and were better maintained through the end of the study in the Advax-adjuvanted arm. Several different patterns of serologic response to VIT were seen; some subjects had a dominant IgG<sub>4</sub> response, some had a combined IgG<sub>4</sub> and IgG<sub>1</sub> response, and some had an exclusively IgG<sub>1</sub> response. In some subjects specific IgE levels increased during the induction phase and then decreased, whereas in others specific IgE levels progressively decreased from the start of VIT.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Advax adjuvant favorably enhanced the immunogenicity of HBVIT, with an early and prolonged switch to specific IgG<sub>4</sub> production. The ability of Advax adjuvant to enhance VIT efficacy warrants further study.</p>

            <p id="p0010">Anaphylactic reactions to Hymenoptera insect stings are a major clinical problem in many parts of the world. Although venom immunotherapy (VIT) can be effective at preventing life-threatening reactions to future stings,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> it can itself cause severe and even (although rare) life-threatening reactions. It is also less effective for honeybee than <italic>Vespula</italic> species wasp stings<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> or <italic>Myrmecia pilosula</italic> (jack jumper ant) stings, the second most common cause of sting anaphylaxis in South Australia.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Furthermore, during the course of honeybee venom immunotherapy (HBVIT), immediate systemic reactions, including mild anaphylactic reactions, are common. In large US<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and European<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> studies, the rate of systemic reactions was ~40% for subjects undergoing HBVIT. This is similar to the systemic reactions we saw to VIT with jumper ant venom, where the rate was 34%<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> by comparison to the lower rate of systemic reaction rates to VIT with vespid venoms in Northern Hemisphere studies.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
            <p id="p0015">The median time taken to achieve a maintenance dose of HBVIT was 14 weeks in a US study of outpatient VIT,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> which is comparable with our experience of about 10 weeks with cluster regimens. Attempts to accelerate the achievement of maintenance doses using “ultrarush” inpatient regimens have had variable effects on reaction rates, interpretation of which is confounded by comparisons being nonrandomized and generally noncontemporaneous, but with some studies suggesting that reaction rates to VIT are even greater on such regimens.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Reactions to HBVIT are generally more severe and frequent than for vespid VIT.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A minority of subjects receiving HBVIT do not achieve a maintenance dose of HBVIT, this proportion being quoted as 9% in the retrospective study of Lockey et al<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> but in our experience more typically in the range of 5%, leaving this subgroup more susceptible to recurrent sting-induced anaphylaxis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Even when subjects have been established on dose regimens for which there is literature evidence of high probability of protection from sting-induced anaphylaxis, questions remain regarding the optimal duration of VIT. There is a propensity, once VIT has been ceased, for the susceptibility to sting-induced anaphylaxis to recur with each further sting.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The 2016 update of the US Practice Parameters suggests that VIT can be discontinued after 5 years in “low-risk” patients (2/3 of patients on VIT) who will have a less than 3% chance of systemic reaction to subsequent stings, whereas extended or indefinite treatment is suggested for “high-risk” patients (about 1/3 of patients) who have a greater than 40% chance of relapse.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> There is limited evidence that abolition of detectable specific IgE responses to the venom is a marker for protection from sting-induced anaphylaxis. In the studies by Golden's group,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> only a minority of subjects lost skin test reactivity to venom after 5 to 8 years of VIT. After approximately 6 years of VIT, only 25% had negative skin test responses, whereas 70% of responses became negative after 9.6 years of follow-up.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Thus up to one third of subjects might either need to indefinitely continue VIT, to continue to carry automated adrenaline syringes, or both.</p>
            <p id="p0020">In Australia the commercially available honeybee venom in general use is Albey Bee Venom (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>; Hollister-Stier, Spokane, Wash), which is a soluble extract. Several European studies have administered Hymenoptera venoms with alum adjuvant.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although alum reduced local adverse reactions to VIT, presumably by binding and delaying allergen release, it has not been shown to accelerate desensitization or reduce the required venom dose. Alum also has potential disadvantages for allergy therapy given its propensity to enhance IgE production and eosinophilia, the opposite of what is desired from an ideal allergy immunotherapy adjuvant.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>
</p>
            <p id="p0025">Advax (Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) is a new adjuvant derived from the natural plant-based polysaccharide delta inulin, which was developed through the National Institutes of Health's Adjuvant Development Program.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Advax has been shown to provide enhanced vaccine immunogenicity and antigen sparing while having low reactogenicity.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> It drives a strong T<sub>H</sub>1 response that might help suppress any excess T<sub>H</sub>2 bias in allergic patients. Notably, when formulated with Advax, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were able to suppress eosinophilic lung pathology after SARS coronavirus infection, whereas this problem was aggravated by formulation of SARS vaccine with the TH2-biasing alum adjuvant.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Advax adjuvant has been shown to be safe and effective in human vaccine trials,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and we sought, therefore, to test the hypothesis that Advax adjuvant would enhance the effectiveness of HBVIT.</p>

Blood collection to assess specific IgE and IgG<sub>4</sub> levels was performed immediately before VIT commencement and then at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after starting VIT, on reaching maintenance, and thereafter every third month until the end of the 30-month study follow-up period.

Because the combination with Advax adjuvant was not a licensed product, after 30 months of maintenance therapy, subjects were exited from their blinded randomized therapy and offered conventional VIT immunotherapy at 100 μg/mo for 5 years or indefinitely, depending on the severity of past sting reactions. Patients who withdrew because of changed work circumstances and had reached maintenance doses were offered opportunities to complete conventional VIT treatment in community-based settings. Routine sting challenges at the end of the trial were not performed because of a lack of resources.</p>

Means and 95% CIs for specific IgE levels, specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels, and specific IgE/specific IgG<sub>4</sub> ratios across time are shown. Each outcome was analyzed by using a mixed-effects model that included a random intercept for each subject to account for the within-subject correlation across time. The models included fixed effects for intervention group, time (as a categorical variables from 0-15 for the 16 visits), age category (greater than or less than the median age), and sex. We also included an additional term for baseline values to increase precision and avoid regression to the mean effects.</p>
                <p id="p0155">To assess whether changes in means across time varied differently between groups, each model included a group × time interaction term, and we performed a global test for significance based on 15 <italic>df</italic> (for the 16 time points). In sensitivity analyses we also assessed whether the effect of sex varied across time by including a sex and time interaction term. Assumptions of the mixed effects models were confirmed by assessing both level 1 (error) and level 2 (individual level) residuals. Differences in means at each time point were considered significant if the global tests were significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), and the means at each individual time point were significant at a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 after adjustment for 16 comparisons (Bonferroni adjustment). Data for clinical and demographic characteristics were assessed for normality and are presented as means ± SDs for normally distributed variables and medians (ranges) for nonnormally distributed variables.</p>

The low enrollment rate was due to many eligible subjects instead opting for therapy using an ultrarush regimen offered at our center. None of the patients was receiving treatment with a β-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

. There was a slightly greater proportion of subjects with a history of hypotensive anaphylaxis to bee sting randomized to the SHBVIT group (5/10), compared to the AHBVIT group (5/16). Three subjects in the SHBVIT group had baseline serum MCT levels ranging from 13 to 19 μg/L, whereas only 1 subject in the AHBVIT group had a marginally increased baseline MCT level of 12 μg/L. None of these subjects had any clinical features of a mast cell disorder. All 4 subjects with increased MCT levels had a history before the trial of anaphylaxis with hypotension in response to a bee sting. One subject with increased MCT levels in the SHBVIT group was stung by 8 bees on separate occasions during the trial with only local reactions. Another subject with increased MCT levels in the SHBVIT group tolerated 2 wasp stings during the trial.

                  <p id="p0215">IgG blocking antibodies have been suggested to play a major role in preventing reactions early in VIT when specific IgE levels are still high whereas blocking antibodies may be progressively less important as specific IgE levels decrease over time.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Hence one measure of early efficacy of VIT might be the induction of specific IgG<sub>4</sub>, thought to be the dominant blocking subclass. At study entry, mean levels of specific IgG<sub>4</sub> were not significantly different between groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), and were low in all subjects bar 1 subject in the AHBVIT group (subject 16, see <xref rid="figE10" ref-type="fig">Fig E10</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the high baseline IgG<sub>4</sub> result in this subject was due to interfering anti-mouse antibodies, we tested whether their specific IgG<sub>4</sub> activity could be adsorbed out by adding mouse sera or bee venom to the soluble phase during the assay. The specific IgG<sub>4</sub> activity was adsorbed out by bee venom but not normal mouse sera (data not shown), confirming that this subject had a high specific IgG<sub>4</sub> level before starting VIT.</p>
                  <p id="p0225">After VIT commencement, specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels rapidly diverged between the SHBVIT and AHBVIT groups, increasing more rapidly and reaching a higher peak in the AHBVIT group, with higher specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels in the AHBVIT group already seen as early as week 5, and with the extent of the difference increasing as VIT progressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The greater specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels in the AHBVIT group continued through 33 months, 3 months after cessation of study intervention. By contrast, specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels returned back toward baseline levels in many subjects in the SHBVIT group after year 1, despite ongoing VIT.</p>
                  <p id="p0230">Overall, male subjects had significantly greater specific IgG<sub>4</sub> responses than female subjects (male subjects: 0.65 ± 0.06 vs female subjects: 0.26 ± 0.10, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .002), and in sensitivity analyses there was a significant difference in changes in mean specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels across time according to sex (<italic>P</italic> = .001; see <xref rid="figE11" ref-type="fig">Fig E11</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0060">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). No effect of age was seen on IgG4 responses (see <xref rid="figE12" ref-type="fig">Fig E12</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="interref0025">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). The Advax adjuvant worked well in both male and female subjects and more than compensated for the lower responses of female subjects to VIT. By the end of the study, specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels for female subjects in the AHBVIT group were greater than for male subjects in the SHBVIT group (see <xref rid="figE10" ref-type="fig">Fig E10</xref>).</p>

Many subjects showed an increase in specific IgG<sub>1</sub> levels that paralleled the specific IgG<sub>4</sub> response, peaking between weeks 9 and 14 of the induction phase, followed by a plateau throughout the maintenance phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>
). Specific IgG<sub>1</sub> responses, as for specific IgG<sub>4</sub> responses, were higher in the AHBVIT group. The majority of subjects in the SHBVIT group had only small increases in specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels, with the majority (5/9) having higher specific IgG<sub>1</sub> than IgG<sub>4</sub> responses and 1 subject (subject 9, see <xref rid="figE9" ref-type="fig">Fig E9</xref>) having an exclusively IgG<sub>1</sub> response to HBVIT. By contrast, the majority of subjects in the AHBVIT group (9/13) had higher specific IgG<sub>4</sub> than IgG<sub>1</sub> responses (see <xref rid="figE10" ref-type="fig">Fig E10</xref>). In 4 subjects in the AHBVIT group the specific IgG<sub>1</sub> response was initially greater than the specific IgG<sub>4</sub> response but by month 30, only 1 of 4 of these subjects still had a marginally higher specific IgG<sub>1</sub> than IgG<sub>4</sub> level.

The total specific IgG ELISA was noted to have a high background even at baseline relative to the specific IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> ELISAs. Nevertheless, specific total IgG levels increased in most subjects after commencement of VIT and then slowly waned over the 3 years of VIT administration. Interestingly, specific total IgG levels in some subjects remained increased over baseline values, even when specific IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> levels were relatively low or undetectable, suggesting that the specific total IgG ELISA might have been more sensitive than the IgG<sub>1</sub> or IgG<sub>4</sub> assays (see <xref rid="figE9" ref-type="fig">Figs E9</xref> and <xref rid="figE10" ref-type="fig">E10</xref>).</p>

Given the long duration since the end of the study, blood samples were only able to be obtained from 13 of the original participants, 5 from the SHBVIT group and 7 from the AHBVIT group. Both groups showed further reduction of their specific IgE levels from levels measured at the end of the study, with the increased specific IgG<sub>4</sub> seen during active VIT in the AHBVIT group having largely attenuated by this time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), suggesting that ongoing inclusion of Advax in maintenance VIT may be necessary to maintain high specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels longterm.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0265">Hymenoptera VIT is of proven efficacy for the stinging insects dominant in Europe and North America and for honeybee and jumper jack ant allergy in Australia. However, problems with HBVIT remain, including significant adverse reaction rates, need for frequent injection visits, failure of some subjects to achieve maintenance, and the possibility of recurrent sensitization after cessation of VIT. Given these shortcomings, an adjuvant able to accelerate desensitization, reduce VIT dose and frequency, and/or prolong duration of protection could have broad utility for allergen immunotherapy. Ideally, such an adjuvant would help drive the immune response to the allergen away from a T<sub>H</sub>2 bias, thereby helping to reduce eosinophilia and IgE production.</p>
              <p id="p0270">Inulin is a plant-based fructan polymer comprised of a linear chain of fructose units connected by β-(2-1)-glycosidic bonds and capped at the reducing end by an α-D-(1-2)-glucopyranoside ring. It can be crystallized into specific semicrystalline forms of delta inulin in which the inulin chains associate through hydrogen bonding to create ordered antiparallel helices in the form of lamellar sheets.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Only when in this semicrystalline state, referred to as delta inulin or Advax adjuvant, does inulin acquire unique immunologic properties, including the ability to act as a potent vaccine adjuvant.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>

              <p id="p0275">Advax adjuvant has been shown to boost both humoral and cellular immunity and enhance vaccine-mediated protection across a wide variety of viral,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> bacterial,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and protozoan<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> antigens in multiple species, including human subjects. This was the first study to assess the human safety and efficacy of Advax when combined with an allergen used for immunotherapy. The study confirmed that Advax adjuvant was safe and well tolerated, even after participants had received approximately 50 consecutive doses over 3 years. Local reactions were common in both groups throughout the study, as expected, with a nonsignificant trend toward more local reactions, predominantly concentrated in the mild category, in the adjuvant group. There was a significant reduction in venom skin test reactivity in both groups after VIT, although the proviso is that skin tests might be only a weak correlate of clinical protection.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Sting challenges are considered the gold standard outcome measure for VIT but were not performed in this study because of resource limitations. However, a study is currently underway of Advax adjuvant in ant sting allergy VIT in which ant sting challenges are being performed to assess efficacy that should help address this issue.</p>
              <p id="p0280">Immunotherapy for stinging insect anaphylaxis is thought to work through several mechanisms, including production of IgG blocking antibodies that bind the allergen and reduce effector cell function (mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils), leading to reduced T<sub>H</sub>2 activation and attenuation of IgE production.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> In keeping with this concept, tolerant beekeepers were shown to have increased levels of specific IgG<sub>4</sub> together with no specific IgE.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> Hence induction of specific IgG<sub>4</sub> is considered an important surrogate marker of effective allergen immunotherapy.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Notably, Advax adjuvant markedly increased specific IgG<sub>4</sub> responses when compared with the SHBVIT group, with specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels staying high through to the end of the treatment period. By contrast, in the SHBVIT group, peak specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels were lower and rapidly waned back toward baseline levels even with ongoing maintenance therapy. This is consistent with a study that showed only modest ~3-fold increases from baseline in specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels after 2 years of standard VIT with ~2-fold reductions in specific IgE levels.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> It remains unclear whether the increase in specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels or the decrease in specific IgE levels is more relevant to VIT clinical efficacy. This might reflect the previous difficulty in inducing sufficiently high blocking IgG<sub>4</sub>, a problem that our study suggests can be solved by incorporating Advax adjuvant into VIT. In the clinical response to grass pollen immunotherapy, functional assays of IgG<sub>4</sub>-associated inhibitory activity, such as inhibition of IgE-allergen interactions and inhibition of CD23-dependent IgE-facilitated allergen binding, correlated better with clinical outcome than immunoreactive IgG<sub>4</sub> levels.<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> Hence it will be interesting in future studies of Advax-adjuvanted VIT to also include functional assays of IgG<sub>4</sub>-associated inhibitory activity.</p>
              <p id="p0285">Interestingly, the high specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels had attenuated significantly in AHBVIT participants surveyed 3 to 7 years after completion of study treatment, suggesting that inclusion of Advax adjuvant in ongoing VIT might be necessary to sustain high specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels in the long term. All recalled AHBVIT participants had evidence of even further attenuation of their specific IgE levels from the time of study completion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). This continued long-term decrease in specific IgE levels might reflect natural death over time of IgE-producing plasmablasts together with failure to replace these because of depletion of the memory B-cell compartment required to replenish IgE<sup>+</sup> plasmablasts and/or the effect of regulatory T cells preventing the generation of IgE-producing B cells. In the future, it would be interesting to test whether functional assays of serum inhibitory activity are greater in subjects receiving Advax and also to directly measure the frequency of specific IgE- and IgG<sub>4</sub>-positive memory B cells throughout the course of VIT.</p>
              <p id="p0290">A difficulty in designing clinical VIT studies is in selecting which assays to use as potential AIT response biomarkers, a topic recently reviewed by a working party of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Allergen-specific regulatory T cells characterized by IL-10 secretion can play a role in VIT,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> driving production of IL-10– and IgG<sub>4</sub>-positive regulatory B cells. For example, a previous study in nonallergic beekeepers showed the presence of bee venom–specific, IgG<sub>4</sub>-positive, IL-10–expressing regulatory B cells, with these regulatory B cells also being found to be increased in allergic subjects after VIT.<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> Hence the higher specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels in the AHBVIT group might reflect an effect of Advax adjuvant on expansion of IL-10<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells making IL-10 and IgG<sub>4</sub>. This will be an important question to address in future studies.</p>
              <p id="p0295">Interestingly, male subjects had significantly greater specific IgG<sub>4</sub> responses and a nonsignificant trend toward lower specific IgE levels after VIT than female subjects. This is consistent with female subjects, postmenarche, having a more T<sub>H</sub>2-biased immune system, making them prone to allergy.<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> However, after 3 years of VIT, the female subjects in both groups had reduced specific IgE levels, indicating that VIT is effective irrespective of sex.</p>
              <p id="p0300">The role of non-IgG<sub>4</sub> subclasses as blocking antibodies in patients with venom allergy remains unclear. Antigen specificity rather than IgG subclass was shown to be the dominant factor determining the ability to block allergen-dependent IgE activity when different IgG subclasses of the same allergen specificity were produced and tested.<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> Specific IgG<sub>1</sub> levels were also greater in the AHBVIT group, with specific IgG<sub>1</sub> behaving similarly to specific IgG<sub>4</sub>, peaking during the induction phase and then plateauing during the maintenance phase in the AHBVIT group or slowly decreasing in the SHBVIT group. However, examination of the time trends of specific IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> in individual subjects revealed a more complex pattern, with some subjects making a dominant specific IgG<sub>4</sub> response, some making a combined specific IgG<sub>4</sub> and IgG<sub>1</sub> response, and a few making exclusively a specific IgG<sub>1</sub> response. Notably, 2 subjects who had a good specific IgG<sub>1</sub> response but no specific IgG<sub>4</sub> response (subjects 9 and 25) had a single bee sting at around months 15 and 32, respectively, with neither having a systemic reaction to this. Just how these IgG subclass differences might influence VIT clinical outcomes will be an important area for future research.</p>
              <p id="p0305">Although specific IgE levels did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, different patterns of IgE response were seen. In one pattern of IgE response, the specific IgE level started to decrease directly after commencement of VIT, with no initial increase in IgE level during the induction phase of VIT. In the other pattern of response, there was a relatively large increase in specific IgE levels between weeks 5 and 9 of VIT initiation, with the IgE levels not decreasing to pre-VIT levels until after at least 6 to 12 months of maintenance VIT but thereafter rapidly decreasing. Approximately half the subjects in the SHBVIT and AHBVIT groups fell into each of these patterns.</p>
              <p id="p0310">Interestingly, the majority of subjects experiencing systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions to VIT were in the group that did not have an initial increase in IgE, a surprising result because it might have been expected that systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions would have been exacerbated by the sharp increase in specific IgE levels in some VIT subjects. We speculate that the lack of reactions in this group despite the increase in IgE levels might have been because there was a parallel increase in these subjects of specific IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub>, that might have more than compensated for the increase in IgE.</p>
              <p id="p0315">Only a minority of subjects reported stings after entering the study, with no serious systemic reactions and none requiring adrenaline or other therapy, suggesting the VIT had been effective in these subjects. Interestingly, in 2 subjects, 1 in the SHBVIT group (subject 21) and 1 in the AHBVIT group (subject 14), there was a sharp increase in specific IgE levels in response to a series of bee stings, suggesting the possibility of bee stings restimulating IgE production, despite ongoing VIT. How fresh stings might induce different immune responses to the bee venom used for VIT is not clear but might reflect additional labile vasoactive substances and enzymes contained in fresh venom that are no longer present in preserved bee venom.</p>
              <p id="p0320">In summary, the results support potential benefits of Advax adjuvant in VIT, which is consistent with its benefits previously seen with Advax adjuvant for infectious disease vaccines. Although not directly assessed by this study, the increase in specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels in the Advax adjuvant group during the early induction phase, when only very low doses of allergen were being administered, suggests Advax adjuvant might have useful venom dose-sparing ability, particularly during the early stages of VIT. Importantly, for the first time in human subjects, this study confirmed the safety and tolerability of VIT combined with Advax adjuvant. Hence Advax adjuvant is a promising candidate for VIT, with an ongoing study assessing its ability to provide antigen-sparing effects for ant venom allergy therapy.</p>

                <title>Relationship between specific total IgG, IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>4</sub>, and IgE levels over time in subjects receiving standard and adjuvanted VIT</title>
                <p id="p0365">Specific total IgG, IgG<sub>1</sub>, and IgG<sub>4</sub> levels were measured by means of ELISA and specific IgE levels by using an ImmunoCAP assay. Based on the IgE response, 2 different patterns emerged between subject receiving VIT, with 1 group (pattern 1) showing almost immediate decreases in specific IgE levels after commencement of VIT with absence of an initial increase in IgE level (<xref rid="figE9" ref-type="fig">Figs E9</xref> and <xref rid="figE10" ref-type="fig">E10</xref>). The other group (pattern 2) showed a large (&gt;2-fold) increase in specific IgE levels between weeks 5 and 9 of the initiation of VIT, and IgE did not decrease to pre-VIT levels until after 6 to 12 months of maintenance VIT. Approximately half the subjects in the SHBVIT and AHBVIT groups fell into each category. In <xref rid="figE9" ref-type="fig">Figs E9</xref> and <xref rid="figE10" ref-type="fig">E10</xref>, pink arrows represent systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions to VIT, and black arrows indicate incidental bee stings, none of which resulted in systemic reactions. Surprisingly, the majority of subjects experiencing systemic immediate hypersensitivity reactions to VIT were concentrated in the pattern 1 groups. Although analysis of baseline data showed that mean specific IgG<sub>4</sub> levels at baseline were more than 4-fold greater in subjects in pattern 1 (mean specific IgG<sub>4</sub>, 4.13; SD, 6.13) versus pattern 2 (mean specific IgG<sub>4</sub>, 0.915; SD, 1.6), this difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .088, Mann-Whitney test). It was noticeable that subjects having multiple stings in a short space of time (eg, subjects 8, 14, and 21) had a major increase in their specific IgE levels immediately after this, suggesting repeat priming or boosting of IgE<sup>+</sup> B-cell memory responses. The specific total IgG ELISA assay was noted to have a high background relative to specific IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> ELISAs for reasons that were not clear. Nevertheless, specific total IgG levels increased in most subjects after commencement of VIT and then stayed high or slowly waned over the 3 years of VIT. Interestingly, specific total IgG levels in some subjects remained increased above baseline values, even when specific IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> levels were low or undetectable, suggesting that the specific total IgG assay might be much more sensitive than either the IgG<sub>1</sub> or IgG<sub>4</sub> assays alone.</p>
                <p id="p0370">Interestingly, those subjects with the greatest specific total IgG levels appeared to have the greatest suppression of IgE levels over time with, for example, waning of specific total IgG levels in subject 8 at their most recent follow-up being associated with an upward spike in specific IgE levels. Similarly, subjects 14, 18, 21, both of whom had minimal increases in specific total IgG levels after VIT, both exhibited major spikes in IgE levels.
