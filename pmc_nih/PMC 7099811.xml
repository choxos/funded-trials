                  <p>Two sequential double-blind placebo-controlled crossover prospective studies
were performed in client-owned cats with stable stage 2 or 3 CKD and a
history of decreased appetite. In the first study nine CKD cats were
randomized to receive 3.75 mg/0.1 ml CTM gel or placebo on the inner pinna
every other day for 3 weeks, then, after a 4 day washout period, the cats
were crossed over to the alternate 3 week treatment. In a second study, 10
CKD cats were randomized to receive 1.88 mg/0.1 ml CTM or placebo on the
same schedule. Physical examination and serum biochemistry were performed
before and after each treatment period, and owners kept daily logs of
appetite, activity and eating behaviors. Mirtazapine concentrations in CTM
gels and steady-state mirtazapine serum concentrations were measured using
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Administration of both 3.75 mg and 1.88 mg CTM resulted in a statistically
significant increase in weight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002 for both),
increase in appetite (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> =
0.005, respectively), and increase in rate of food consumption
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.03 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.008,
respectively). No significant difference in activity or vocalization was
seen at either dose; however, individual cats experienced excessive meowing.
Median weight increase for the 3.75 mg arm was 0.22 kg (range 0.04–0.44 kg),
while median weight increase for the 1.88 mg arm was 0.26 kg (range –0.25 to
0.5 kg). Improvement in body condition score was seen in 5/9 cats in the
3.75 mg arm (P = 0.04) and 6/10 cats in the 1.88 mg arm (P = 0.004).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dysrexia and weight loss are common in cats with chronic kidney disease
(CKD).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Weight loss is
associated with a poorer prognosis in CKD cats and is likely attributable to
abnormal appetite and subsequent inadequate caloric intake, as well as processes
such as cachexia and sarcopenia, which result in a loss of lean body mass.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Additionally, poor appetite is
perceived as a significant quality of life concern in cats with chronic disease and
can cause emotional distress to owners.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr6-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the management of
appetite is an important therapeutic goal in feline CKD patients.</p>
              <p>Mirtazapine has been demonstrated to be an effective appetite stimulant in cats, and
administration of mirtazapine at a dose of 1.88 mg PO q48h has been shown to
stimulate appetite, promote weight gain and reduce vomiting in cats with
CKD.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, many
feline patients are not amenable to oral administration of medications and this can
become a source of frustration to owners. During the management of CKD, multiple
medications may be necessary, resulting in a pill burden that may ultimately affect
quality of life and the human–animal bond. In one study, the average number of
medications administered to CKD cats was two (range 0–10) and 54% of owners used
methods other than direct oral administration to try and administer the medication.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Transdermal application of medications is of interest in feline patients owing to the
ease of administration compared with the oral route,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and can improve owner compliance.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although not all medications are amenable to transdermal application,
advantages of a transdermal formulation of mirtazapine for stimulating weight gain
in cats was demonstrated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a
commercial formulation (Mirataz; Kindred Bio).<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The purpose of this study,
which was performed before the FDA approval of transdermal mirtazapine ointment, was
to assess the appetite stimulation properties of compounded transdermal mirtazapine
(CTM) in cats with CKD in two sequential clinical trials.</p>

placebo-controlled crossover prospective study. Nine cats were enrolled in the
3.75 mg arm and 10 cats were enrolled in the 1.88 mg arm. One cat was enrolled
in both arms of the study; however, more than 2 years had elapsed between
enrollment episodes. Study arms were performed in a sequential manner.
Diagnostics required for enrollment included serum biochemistry profile,
complete blood count, urinalysis, urine culture, blood pressure and total
thyroxine measurement. Exclusion criteria included concurrent systemic illness,
pyelonephritis, ureteral obstruction or decompensation of CKD/recent
hospitalization.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the
Clinical Review Board at Colorado State University, and the Clinical Research
Committee at Ohio State University. Written informed consent was obtained from
the owner or legal guardian of all cats described in this study for the
procedures undertaken. No cats were individually identifiable within this
publication and therefore additional informed consent for publication was not

                <p>This study had a two-treatment two-period crossover design with a predetermined
sequence of AB or BA. As cats were enrolled, they were assigned consecutively to
a treatment regime. The randomly predetermined gel (A or B) was administered to
the inner ear pinna every other day for 3 weeks. After a 4 day washout, the
other gel (B or A) was administrated every day for another 3 weeks.</p>
                <p>Owners documented appetite, rate of food ingestion, begging behavior, activity
and vocalization in the home environment as increased, decreased or unchanged in
a daily log. Physical examination, body weight, World Small Animal Veterinary
Association (WSAVA) body condition score (BCS), WSAVA muscle condition score
(MCS) and serum biochemistry panel were performed at the end of each treatment
period. Cats were not fasted prior to study visits but were seen at a consistent
time of day throughout the study. Serum was collected on day 21 of CTM
administration for measurement of mirtazapine steady-state drug serum
concentration. Mirtazapine drug concentrations in CTM gels and steady-state
mirtazapine serum concentrations were measured using liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS).</p>

                <p>To determine sample size for the study, an a priori power calculation was
performed using a paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to represent the
crossover design. The response was defined as ‘weight change’ (post–pre) and the
two treatments were mirtazapine and placebo. For each cat in a previous study,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> the difference mirtazapine – placebo was calculated, and the average
difference (0.3 kg) and SD of the differences (0.2 kg) was used for the power
calculation. Using Lenth’s online power calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/">http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/</ext-link>), this resulted in
a power of &gt;95% with a total of 10 cats.</p>
                <p>Appetite, rate of food ingestion, begging behavior, activity and vocalization
data from owner daily logs were converted to clinical scores; a decrease in the
behavior was scored as −1, no change scored as 0 and an increase scored as 1.
Daily scores for each behavior were then summed for the 3 week treatment period.
Outcomes from physical examinations (change in weight and BCS),
clinicopathologic parameters (change in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen
[BUN], phosphorus and potassium) and summed scores on owner documented logs were
analyzed using the ANOVA model for a 2 × 2 crossover study estimating a
treatment effect (mirtazapine vs placebo), while adjusting for the period
effect. The inclusion of a period effect in the model is based on the assumption
that the characteristics of the cats are not the same between period 1 and 2
owing to the weight gain property of mirtazapine, and that owner observations,
although blinded, may be affected by placebo effect. Spearman’s rank test was
used to assess correlation between vocalization score and serum mirtazapine
concentration. Analyses were performed in Prism v7 (GraphPad) or Stata v 15.1
(StataCorp). For all analyses, a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The purpose of these two sequential clinical trials was to demonstrate that
application of CTM was effective in stimulating appetite in cats with CKD and
promoting weight gain. Results indicated that administration of 1.88 mg CTM every
other day for 3 weeks resulted in a significant increase in appetite and weight gain
in cats with IRIS stages 2 and 3 CKD. Furthermore, some cats experienced an increase
in BCS and MCS.</p>
              <p>The decision to perform a clinical trial at 3.75 mg was based on preliminary data
collected in a previous study in young, normal cats.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, after the conclusion of the current 3.75 mg study, it was noted that
some individual cats displayed excessive vocalization, and as these types of
behavioral side effects have been demonstrated to be dose related,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> a follow-up study at the 1.88
mg dose was initiated. Data indicate that CTM is effective at the lower 1.88 mg
dose, similar to a previous study in oral mirtazapine.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, it should be noted that these data cannot be compared with Mirataz,
the FDA-approved mirtazapine transdermal ointment for the management of unintended
weight loss in cats, as it is a formulation that is of better quality, which meets
United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards and for which a dose of 2 mg has been
approved by the FDA after extensive study in a large, pivotal trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In the second CTM clinical trial, at 1.88 mg q48h, two CKD cats still experienced
excessive vocalization, in one case termed ‘unbearable’ in the owner’s daily log.
The clinical trial included a provision for dose reduction in circumstances of
excessive vocalization or activity, but the owner did not contact the investigators
during the trial to report the concern during the study. Although there was no
correlation between serum mirtazapine concentration and vocalization score, this
observation implies that for individual cats receiving CTM further dose reduction
may be warranted. Additionally, these data imply that, similar to oral mirtazapine,
the lowest effective dose of CTM should be used, and the 3.75 mg dose is not
recommended. However, again these data cannot be compared with the FDA-approved
product, Mirataz, as it is a better-quality formulation that meets USP standards
and, as a result, clinical studies with Mirataz are more predictable and repeatable
than the current study. In contrast to the data presented for CTM in the current,
small study, no significant difference in incidence of behavioral adverse events
(vocalization and hyperactivity) was seen between cats with and without CKD in the
large pivotal clinical trial where 2 mg Mirataz was administered daily to cats.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although CTM was effective at stimulating appetite and promoting weight gain,
concerns regarding the consistency of the compounded product still remain and are a
major limitation of the current study. Although the compounded gel was formulated by
a pharmacy fol-lowing instructions provided by PCCA compounding guidelines, analysis
of the gels revealed that concentrations varied widely from target (&gt;10% at
times), an observation that is similar to that of a previous study.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A compounded version of an FDA-approved drug must meet the standards of the
USP with assurance that the strength is within 10% of the target dose. Therefore,
the compounded formulation used in this study did not reliably meet compendial
standards, despite concerted effort to do so, and probably should not be recommended
for future clinical use, serving as a caution for the use of compounded transdermal
medications.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the availability of the FDA-approved mirtazapine transdermal ointment
(Mirataz) for the management of unintended weight loss in cats now makes it
unnecessary (and illegal) to compound the medication in the US.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The efficacy
of Mirataz has been documented in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies,
confirming the viability of the transdermal route of administration for this
drug.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Specifically, a large multi-center, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, randomized pivotal clinical trial was performed in cats with
&gt;5% unintended weight loss.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Daily application of 2 mg Mirataz to the inner ear pinnae for 14 days
resulted in cats in the mirtazapine group gaining significantly more weight compared
with baseline (mean gain 3.94 ± 5.37%) than the cats in the placebo group (mean gain
0.41 ± 3.33%).<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Taken overall, the information provided in the current study may be of
benefit to patients in geographical areas where an approved product is not
available, and an inferior formulation is the only option.</p>
              <p>Significant increases in serum phosphorus and BUN were observed after administration
of CTM to cats with CKD. The median increase in serum phosphorus was 0.8 mg/dl and
was seen only in the 1.88 mg trial; therefore, this finding may not be of clinical
significance and could represent type I statistical error. The significant increase
in serum BUN was observed in both trials and was of a more clinically significant
magnitude. Both parameters have been observed to increase in malnourished human
renal disease patients when enteric nutrition was increased, so one possible
explanation is an increase in food consumption and a concomitant increase in
consumption of protein and phosphorus.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Serum BUN was the only parameter to display a significant period effect, and this was
likely because if it became elevated with CTM administration in the first treatment,
it then subsequently decreased in the second period when placebo was administered. A
significant increase in BUN was not seen subsequent to oral mirtazapine
administration in a previous clinical trial in CKD cats;<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1098612X19851303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> however, in this study, the statistical analysis of the data was performed
differently (ie, not based on change in BUN) so a direct comparison may not be
appropriate. Changes in hydration status and muscle mass could also play a role in
the observation regarding BUN, but as serum creatinine was not significantly
different, this explanation seems less supported by accompanying data.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Transdermal application of CTM was effective in stimulating appetite in cats with CKD
and promoting weight gain, and agreed with efficacy studies performed in a much
larger population of cats by the sponsor of the FDA-approved product. Individual
cats may require CTM dose reduction if side effects such as excessive vocalization
are noted. Inconsistencies in compounded formulations exist and the CTM formulation
as prepared for this study did not always meet USP standards for compounded
products, and thus should not be used when an approved product is available.</p>
