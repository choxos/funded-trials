                  <title>Background/Objectives</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Routine use of vitamin D supplements has increased substantially in the United States. However, the safety and tolerability of long-term use of high-dose vitamin D are not known. We assessed the safety and tolerability of high-dose, daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study.</p>

                  <title>Subjects/Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In total, 2423 overweight/obese persons with prediabetes were randomized in a double-blind manner to either 4000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (the tolerable upper intake level for adults by the National Academy of Medicine) taken daily or matching placebo. All participants were included in this analysis. Incident adverse events (AE) were ascertained 4 times a year at in-person visits (twice a year) and interim remote encounters (twice a year) and were defined as untoward or unfavorable medical occurrences. Serious adverse events (SAE) included death, life-threatening events, and hospitalizations.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">A total of 8304 AEs occurred during 3 years of follow-up and were less frequent in the vitamin D group compared to placebo (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] = 0.94; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.90, 0.98). The overall frequency of protocol-specified AEs of interest, which included nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or low estimated glomerular filtration rate, was low and did not differ by group. There were no significant between-group differences in total SAEs (IRR = 0.96 (0.81, 1.14)).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation at 4000 IU per day was safe and well tolerated among overweight/obese participants at high risk for diabetes who were appropriately monitored for safety. In this population, this dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> did not increase risk of AEs or SAEs, including those previously associated with vitamin D such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or nephrolithiasis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">There has been substantial interest in vitamin D and its potential role in prevention of a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recently, the focus of vitamin D research has turned to randomized controlled trials of vitamin D at doses higher than typically recommended compared to placebo in persons who were generally considered to be vitamin D sufficient by current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety and tolerability of vitamin D supplementation at these higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At the same time, routine use of vitamin D supplements, especially at doses higher than are typically recommended in guidelines, has increased substantially in the United States, despite insufficient data regarding potential safety issues or side effects with longer term use at these higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study was a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day compared to placebo among overweight/obese participants who were at high risk for type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this pre-specified analysis, we examined the safety and tolerability of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in the D2d study, which tested the vitamin D dose that is considered the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults by the National Academy of Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial design overview</title>
                <p id="Par8">The D2d study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for diabetes prevention in adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The study involved collaboration among 22 academic medical centers in the United States (d2dstudy.org/sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The trial protocol is available at D2dstudy.org. A sponsor-appointed data and safety monitoring board approved the protocol and provided independent study monitoring. The institutional review board at each clinical site also approved the protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The statistical team at the D2d coordinating center (Division of Endocrinology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA) performed the statistical analysis and vouches for its accuracy.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par9">Eligible participants met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes as defined by the 2010 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. Other inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 30 years (25 years for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, or other Pacific Islanders) and body mass index (BMI) of 24–42 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (22.5–42 kg/m2 for Asian Americans) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A low serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration was not an inclusion criterion. Key exclusion criteria included use of diabetes or weight-loss medications or a history of hyperparathyroidism, nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, chronic kidney disease (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;50 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), calcium-to-creatinine ratio greater than 0.275 at baseline, or bariatric surgery. Persons were also excluded for use of supplements containing total doses of vitamin D higher than 1000 IU/day or total calcium higher than 600 mg/day. A complete list of exclusion criteria has been published and the recruitment process described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

                <title>Intervention and Procedures</title>
                <p id="Par10">Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to take once-daily, a soft-gel containing either 4000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) or matching placebo, with stratification by site, BMI (&lt;30 or ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and race (White or non-White). Participants and all study staff were blinded to treatment assignment. Participants were asked to limit the use of outside-of-study vitamin D to 1000 IU per day from all supplements. To optimize safety, participants were also asked to limit calcium supplements to 600 mg per day.</p>
                <p id="Par11">In-person follow-up visits occurred at month 3, month 6, and twice per year thereafter. Midway between the in-person visits starting after month 6, an interim contact (phone or email) took place. All visits and contacts were designed to promote retention, encourage adherence, and assess for diabetes diagnosis outside of the study, tolerability of study pills, occurrence of adverse events, and personal use of vitamin D supplements higher than allowed by study protocol. Participants were monitored for adverse events (AE) including those previously associated with vitamin D supplementation, and incident AEs were ascertained at visits and interim encounters 4 times a year in a similar manner in both groups. The protocol outlined in detail the safety parameters for which the study trial pills should be discontinued (e.g., nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, low eGFR, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">Vitamin D content of study trial pills was analyzed for each production lot at bottling for the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> pills as well as for placebo pills to confirm they were free of vitamin D. Acceptable vitamin D<sub>3</sub> content for the active vitamin D pill was pre-defined as 80–120% of the 4000 IU planned dosage.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par13">The primary outcome of the D2d study was time to incident diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Participants who met the primary outcome of diabetes remained on the study pills and continued to be followed for safety and additional outcomes. The primary results have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">Adverse events were ascertained at each participant contact by study staff. At these encounters, each participant was asked if they had experienced any changes to their health or had sought medical care since last contact. If the participant responded affirmatively, study staff collected information on the health change or reason for and timing of medical care including diagnostic tests, diagnosis, and treatment. Study staff also reviewed with participants previously reported ongoing AEs to determine if the event had resolved.</p>
                <p id="Par15">An AE was defined as any untoward or unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence (including symptom, physical sign, laboratory finding, or disease) observed in or experienced by a participant, whether or not it was considered study related. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any AE that resulted in death, a life-threatening event, a new inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any other significant hazard that, based upon appropriate medical judgment by the investigators, may have jeopardized the participant’s health and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. For all SAEs reported by the sites, medical records were collected and reviewed by the study’s Safety and Outcomes Subcommittee, composed of D2d investigators who were blinded to the participant’s assignment.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Key protocol-specified AEs of interest included hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, low eGFR and nephrolithiasis. Follow-up serum calcium (assessed at each site’s local laboratory), the urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio (assessed at the central laboratory), and serum creatinine (assessed at each site’s local laboratory) to estimate GFR (calculated centrally) were measured at month 3, and annually thereafter. If serum calcium value (uncorrected for albumin concentration) was greater than the site’s clinical laboratory upper level of normal and less than or equal to the upper level of normal plus 1 mg/dL, participants were queried about calcium intake and supplements and medications (e.g., use of hydrochlorothiazide) and educated about the use of calcium supplements. Testing was repeated within 6 weeks. If the repeat serum calcium value was greater than the site’s clinical laboratory upper level of normal, the participant was confirmed to have met the outcome of hypercalcemia; study pills were stopped, and the participant was referred to their health care provider. If the first measurement of calcium was greater than the site’s clinical laboratory upper level of normal plus 1 mg/dL, no repeat testing was required and the participant was considered to have met the outcome of hypercalcemia; study pills were stopped, and the participant was referred to their health care provider. Regarding the adverse event of low eGFR, if eGFR value was greater than 30 and less than 40 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, testing was repeated within 4 weeks. If repeat eGFR was equal to or less than 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, the participant was confirmed to have met the outcome of low eGFR, study pills were stopped, and the participant was referred to their health care provider. If the first eGFR measurement was equal to or less than 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, then no repeat testing was required, and the participant was considered to have met the outcome of low eGFR; study pills were stopped, and the participant was referred to their health care provider. Regarding the adverse event of hypercalciuria, if urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio was greater than 0.375, participants were queried about calcium intake and supplements, and testing was repeated within 4 weeks. If repeat urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio remained greater than 0.375, then the participant was considered to have met the outcome of hypercalciuria; study pills were stopped, and the participant was referred to their health care provider. The 0.375 cutoff was chosen because it represents the calcium-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot urine specimen that corresponds to a 24-hour urine calcium of 400 mg/gram, which is the upper reference range for men.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Participants were asked to contact site staff to report the occurrence of a kidney stone and were additionally specifically queried about kidney stones at each contact (phone or in-person visit). All reports of kidney stone were included in the nephrolithiasis outcome and participants reporting a kidney stone were instructed to discontinue study pills. If available, medical records related to nephrolithiasis were collected and then adjudicated by the study’s safety and outcomes subcommittee. For all of the above key protocol-specified AEs of interest where study pills were stopped per protocol, the pills were discontinued without unmasking participants or study staff, and participants continued in the study and completed all subsequent planned visits and measurements including collection of the primary outcome and safety assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par18">The D2d study did not specifically query the participants regarding falls using a validated questionnaire, but injuries and musculoskeletal events were self-reported by participants and were included in the overall assessment of safety.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Additional protocol-specified AEs of interest reported in this analysis were potentially related to the study pills and included polyuria, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, metallic taste, hyperphosphatemia, anemia, weakness, fatigue, insomnia, and headache (all self-reported).</p>
                <p id="Par20">Participants could request to discontinue study pills at any point and for any reason. Participants who discontinued the study pills regardless of reason (AE or personal choice) were followed for the efficacy outcome per intent-to-treat principle.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par30">In this multi‐center, randomized, double-blind, placebo‐controlled trial among overweight/obese persons at high risk of type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency and who were screened and routinely monitored for safety, compared to placebo, oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day (considered the UL for adults by the National Academy of Medicine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was well-tolerated and did not result in an increased risk of AEs or SAEs, including side effects typically linked to vitamin D, such as hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, or hypercalciuria. This finding of no increased risk of AE or SAE in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group is reassuring given that the majority of D2d participants began the trial with concentrations of serum 25(OH)D considered sufficient for healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">These data from the D2d study suggest that in similar populations of people who are overweight/obese and with prediabetes, the UL for safety and tolerability of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may be higher than previously established. The dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> of 4000 IU per day used in the D2d study is the National Academy of Medicine recommended UL for persons over 8 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and D2d participants were allowed to take up to 1000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on their own, for a maximum total dose of vitamin D of 5000 IU daily from supplements. The UL was established by the National Academy of Medicine in 2011 based on a synthesis of data indicating that a dose of 4000 IU was unlikely to cause hypercalcemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The National Academy of Medicine also chose a UL dose that would maintain a serum 25(OH)D concentration lower than 50–75 ng/mL (125–150 nmol/L), a concentration that was previously thought to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, the benefit-risk ratio may be different in populations that vary by BMI, skin complexion, or when a trial attempts to achieve higher 25(OH)D concentrations. Future trials are warranted to test the efficacy-safety ratio of higher doses of vitamin D supplementation that aim to achieve higher 25(OH)D levels in specific populations at-risk for specific conditions, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer etc.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The dose of 4000 IU daily of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in D2d is a higher dose than administered in other recently completed clinical trials. For example, Lappe et al tested a 2000 IU daily dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and administered calcium supplements in addition to the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> as part of the intervention arms in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; and the VITAL trial of adult men aged 50 or older and women aged 55 or older tested a dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 2000 IU daily without calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other trials include the New Zealand ViDA trial which tested a dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 100,000 IU taken monthly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similar to the D2d study, these three trials have also reported few adverse events and no increased risk of hypercalcemia with vitamin D supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In contrast to the D2d study, only the Women’s Health Initiative Calcium / Vitamin D trial, with a much larger sample size and a longer follow-up period, reported an 17% increased risk of nephrolithiasis with combined daily 400 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and 1000 mg of calcium compared to placebo (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02–1.34) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">There are trials with vitamin D supplementation that have reported other adverse events that were not assessed in the D2d study. A Canadian study found that, among healthy older adults (ages 55 to 70 years), vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 3 years at 4000 IU or 10,000 IU per day compared with 400 IU per day, resulted in statistically significant lower radial bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, but there were no significant differences in bone strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The D2d study did not assess BMD and thus cannot contribute information about the effect of the 4000 IU per day on BMD and bone strength in overweight/obese people with prediabetes. A trial conducted in Switzerland tested vitamin D<sub>3</sub> at 60,000 IU per month vs. 24,000 IU per month and reported increased risk of falls with the higher dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The D2d study did not specifically query the participants regarding falls using a validated questionnaire; however the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> had fewer AEs and SAEs for injury or musculoskeletal events than the placebo group (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par34">D2d is the first trial to assess the safety of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> given at the tolerable upper intake level for adults by the National Academy of Medicine in a population of US adults with overweight/obesity and prediabetes. The D2d study has several additional strengths, including a large diverse group of participants who were at low risk for safety concerns related to vitamin D but at high risk for diabetes. The vitamin D<sub>3</sub> dose of 4000 IU per day was selected to balance safety and efficacy and resulted in, on average, large differences in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and placebo groups (54.3 ng/mL vs. 28.8 ng/mL, respectively, at month 24) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Use of a placebo to blind investigators, staff, and participants to treatment assignment minimized ascertainment bias of adverse events, and careful attention to protocol fidelity resulted in a rigorously conducted clinical trial. Adverse events were collected frequently and in a similar way in both groups to reduce ascertainment bias. All serious adverse events and cases of nephrolithiasis were adjudicated by study investigators blinded to treatment assignment.</p>
              <p id="Par35">There are several considerations to put interpretation of our findings in context. As in all vitamin D trials, participants were excluded if they had a condition (e.g., high baseline serum calcium, etc.) that would have increased their risk for vitamin D-associated adverse events, and this may have reduced the occurrence of AEs compared to the general population taking vitamin D. The median time of follow-up in the D2d study was three years, and our findings may not extrapolate to longer term use of 4000 IU per day of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Thus, the risk of vitamin D associated AEs and SAEs may be greater among persons who are at higher risk, who take the supplement for longer periods of time, or who have been less carefully screened and monitored. Finally, the D2d study did not assess whether participants had a CYP24A1 mutation or other mutations in the vitamin D pathway, so we are unable to provide pharmacogenomic information.</p>

              <p id="Par36">High-dose daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU daily (considered the tolerable upper intake level for adults by the National Academy of Medicine) was safe and well tolerated among overweight/obese participants with prediabetes who were screened for risk of AEs and monitored for safety; and use of this supplement did not increase risk of AEs or SAEs, including side effects that have been previously associated with vitamin D.</p>
