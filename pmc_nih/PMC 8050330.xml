                <p id="Par1">Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne virus with high fatality and an expanding endemic. Currently, effective anti-SFTSV intervention remains unavailable. Favipiravir (T-705) was recently reported to show in vitro and in animal model antiviral efficacy against SFTSV. Here, we conducted a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of T-705 in treating SFTS (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry website, number ChiCTR1900023350). From May to August 2018, laboratory-confirmed SFTS patients were recruited from a designated hospital and randomly assigned to receive oral T-705 in combination with supportive care or supportive care only. Fatal outcome occurred in 9.5% (7/74) of T-705 treated patients and 18.3% (13/71) of controls (odds ratio, 0.466, 95% CI, 0.174–1.247). Cox regression showed a significant reduction in case fatality rate (CFR) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.366 (95% CI, 0.142–0.944). Among the low-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold ≥26), T-705 treatment significantly reduced CFR from 11.5 to 1.6% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.029), while no between-arm difference was observed in the high-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold &lt;26). The T-705-treated group showed shorter viral clearance, lower incidence of hemorrhagic signs, and faster recovery of laboratory abnormities compared with the controls. The in vitro and animal experiments demonstrated that the antiviral efficacies of T-705 were proportionally induced by SFTSV mutation rates, particularly from two transition mutation types. The mutation analyses on T-705-treated serum samples disclosed a partially consistent mutagenesis pattern as those of the in vitro or animal experiments in reducing the SFTSV viral loads, further supporting the anti-SFTSV effect of T-705, especially for the low-viral loads.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an emerging and severe hemorrhagic fever disease caused by a bunyavirus (SFTS virus, SFTSV), was first discovered in China in 2009 and subsequently reported in South Korea and Japan in 2012, with a high case fatality rate (CFR) ranging from 12 to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Increasing number of SFTS cases was soon recorded in these countries, with cumulative numbers of cases by 2018 attaining 11995 in China (data from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China), 866 in South Korea (data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and 395 in Japan (data from the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases). Two new patients were recently reported in Vietnam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> indicating a further geographical expansion in Asia. Tick-to-human transmission is the primary infection route, with <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> tick as the predominant vector of SFTSV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> This tick species has very recently been reported spreading widely in several continents of the world, including Asia, Oceania, and North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Human-to-human transmission has also been seen in a few family and nosocomial clusters of cases, and the most common risk of the transmission is direct blood exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> The potential droplet transmission has been posed due to SFTSV RNA was continuously detected in the sputum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> The possible sexual transmission has recently been postulated as that SFTSV RNA was detected in semen after the virus had already disappeared from serum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> All these findings raised the possibility of pandemic transmission of SFTSV outside of Asia, and the high risk of human-to-human transmission other than through blood. On the other hand, novel SFTSV-like viruses continued to be detected or isolated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> The most prominent example is the Heartland virus, which was first isolated from patients in the USA in 2012 and caused severe febrile disease and even death that resembled the clinical picture of SFTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par3">Under the current situation of no vaccine available, identification of effective anti-SFTSV drug is critical for treating potential pandemic SFTS or SFTS-like disease transmission on a global level. Current treatment options for SFTS included antiviral therapy and supportive therapy. Ribavirin, which was suggested as a potential anti-SFTSV drug, was reported to be ineffective for improving the disease outcome in a retrospective study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> or with limited efficacy when used early among patients with very low viremia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Investigation on more effective antiviral therapies became urgent as the epidemics of SFTS continue.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Favipiravir (T-705) is a new anti-influenza drug approved for human use in Japan and is progressing through Phase 3 clinical trials in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> The compound demonstrated strong inhibition activity against a broad spectrum of RNA viruses in vitro or in animal models, including flaviviruses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> arenaviruses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> filoviruses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and some members in the family of Bunyaviridae (i.e., Rift Valley fever virus, Sandfly fever virus, and Punta Toro virus).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Differing from ribavirin that acts by GTP depletion via inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, T-705 functions as a GTP-competitive inhibitor of the viral polymerase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> The main mechanism of action for T-705 has been attributed to be an RNA chain terminator or a lethal mutagen for several RNA viruses in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Recently, T-705 was shown to attain a higher antiviral efficacy on inhibiting SFTSV replication in vitro and in animal models than ribavirin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> All these findings point to T-705 as a potential antiviral candidate against SFTSV, as well as the above-mentioned RNA viruses. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of T-705 for any of these RNA viruses has yet been lacking in the literature, mostly due to the limited availability of patients to conduct such trials. Moreover, no study has investigated the main mechanism of action for T-705 in treating SFTSV infection in vitro or in vivo.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Here, we assessed the inhibition effect of T-705 on SFTSV infection in vitro and in the animal model and performed deep sequencing to investigate the anti-SFTSV mechanism. Next, we conducted an investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, single-blind clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of T-705 for treating SFTS, and also investigated the mutagenesis pattern of action of T-705 against SFTSV on patient samples.</p>

                <title>Mechanism of T-705 against SFTSV in vitro</title>
                <p id="Par6">Previous studies have demonstrated that T-705 could inhibit the replication of several viruses of the Bunyavirales in cell culture;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> however, the antiviral mechanism has been investigated in only Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne bunyavirus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> We examined the association between virus extinction and SFTSV mutagenesis that was induced by T-705 in cell culture under different drug concentrations, various virus passages, and different inoculation doses. SFTSV was propagated in Vero cells in the absence or presence of different concentrations of T-705 for four serial passages (P1 to P4). The virus stock solution (designate as P0), and the supernatants and cells harvested from P1 to P4, were separately used for genomic RNA extraction and then subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS), to determine mutation rates of genomic RNA (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). For SFTSV genome RNAs extracted from the supernatants, the total mutation rates increased gradually as a result of T-705 treatment, compared to DMSO (vehicle)-treated group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Moreover, the total mutation rates increased from P0 to P4, which might be attributed to the accumulation of mutations. T-705 treatment with the concentration of 16 μM showed no apparent anti-SFTSV effect at P1 and P2, and only produced a slight reduction in viral infectivity capacity at P3 and P4, while with the concentration of 64 μM, T-705 treatment showed a remarkable reduction in viral infectivity capacity during the consecutive passages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A remarkable increase of the transitions/transversions ratio was observed after treatment with T-705, especially with higher values seen upon the concentration of 64 μM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), thus revealing that transition mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), instead of transversion mutations, were preferentially induced by T-705. Among four types of transition mutations, the increases of G → A and C → T transitions accounted for the majority (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). For SFTSV genome RNAs extracted from the cells, we found T-705 treatment produced an increase in viral mutation rates and a reduction of intracellular viral RNA levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Similar to the supernatants, the mutagenesis pattern featured by high transitions/transversions ratios was also observed in the cells after the T-705 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggested a correlation between the loss of viral infectivity and mutagenesis consequence, both of which were affected by the concentration and action time of T-705.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Infectivity and mutation analysis of SFTSV in four passages of cell culture supernatant from cells treated with different concentrations of T-705. SFTSV strain HNXY2017-66 was serial passaged in T-705 or vehicle-treated Vero cells for four passages (P1–P4). The cell culture supernatant was collected for the NGS and mutation analysis of the SFTSV genome. Total mutation rates (<bold>a</bold>), ratios of transitions/transversions (<bold>c</bold>), transition mutation rates (<bold>d</bold>), and percentages of different transition mutations (<bold>e</bold>) were calculated. Viral titer and viral genome copy number in the supernatant were also measured, and relative viral infectivity (viral titer/viral genome copy number) is shown (<bold>b</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41392_2021_541_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e698"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par7">By examining single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across viral genomes in cell cultures and supernatants, we found SNVs were widely distributed in L, M, and S segments, and enlarged as the concentration of T-705 increased (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Apparently higher frequencies of SNVs were observed in L and M segments other than S segment in the cell culture in P4; however, the different distribution of SNVs in the three segments was not seen in the supernatant in P4 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), suggesting that the virus with high SNVs in L and M segments could not be packaged or released into the supernatant. This finding revealed that T-705 had a more significant mutagenic effect on these two segments, which might mainly contribute to the viral lethal.</p>
                <p id="Par8">We further investigated whether the different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) of SFTSV affected the antiviral activity of T-705 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). T-705 treatment with the concentration of 64 μM resulted in a reduction of viral infectivity capacity and an increase of total mutation rates at MOIs of 1 and 10, which was not observed upon the concentration of 16 μM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). When cells were infected with SFTSV at an MOI of 30, T-705 treatment (64 μM) did not have a significant effect on the infective progeny production and virus mutations, implying that T-705 may be less efficient against SFTSV with high viral loads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Examination of mutation bias revealed that T-705 treatment preferentially induced G → A and C → T transition mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>), with the consistent increase of transitions/transversion ratios (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Moreover, similar results were also observed in intracellular viral RNA after the treatment of T-705 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). These findings indicated that the mutagenesis patterns induced by T-705 were not affected by viral loads.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Infectivity and mutation analysis of SFTSV in cell culture supernatant from cells infected with different MOIs of SFTSV. Vero cells were infected with SFTSV strain HNXY2017-66 at MOIs of 1, 10, and 30, and treated with vehicle or different concentrations of T-705. At 24 h post infection, the cell culture supernatant was collected. SFTSV genome in the supernatant was extracted and subjected to NGS analysis. Total mutation rates (<bold>a</bold>), ratios of transitions/transversions (<bold>c</bold>), transition mutation rates (<bold>d</bold>), and percentages of different transition mutations (<bold>e</bold>) were calculated.

                <title>Mechanism of T-705 against SFTSV in a mouse model</title>
                <p id="Par9">We also measured the effect of T-705 on SFTSV replication in IFNAR<sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> C57BL/6 mouse, a lethal animal model for SFTSV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> The IFNAR<sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> C57BL/6 mice were infected with SFTSV, and then treated with either DMSO (vehicle) or 100 mg/kg/day of ribavirin or 150 mg/kg/day of T-705 or 300 mg/kg/day of T-705 (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Materials and Methods</xref>). We found the survival rates of mice were significantly increased after being treated with T-705 compared with those treated with DMSO or ribavirin (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, log-rank test; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The mutagenesis mechanism of T-705 on RNA viruses has rarely been investigated in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> We then investigated the mechanism of T-705 against SFTSV in IFNAR<sup>−<italic>/−</italic></sup> C57BL/6 mouse model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Significantly reduced viral loads of SFTSV were observed in the serum samples of T-705-treated mice at days 2, 3, 4 post infection (p.i.) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, simultaneously enhanced virus mutation rates in serum samples were observed in T-705-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice, except for the treatment of 150 mg/kg/day at day 4 p.i. The total mutation rates increased with the duration of treatment. T-705 treatment of 300 mg/kg/day showed high accumulation of mutation rates than that of 150 mg/kg/day, although no statistical difference was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The analysis of mutagenesis patterns revealed that the T-705 treatment produced both transition and transversion mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>), and the ratio of transitions/transversions did not show a significant change (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). No predominant pattern was observed among transition mutations or transversion mutations (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). We also detected the effect of T-705 on SFTSV RNAs extracted from spleen samples and found significant decreases in viral loads and increases in mutation rates as a result of T-705 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). As seen in serum samples, transition and transversion mutations were both significantly induced by T-705 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Although the mutagenesis mechanism of T-705 in treating SFTSV infection in mouse model differed from that in vitro which mainly induced transition mutations, these results highlight the potential of T-705 as an effective agent for inhibition SFTSV replication in vivo through inducing viral lethal mutagenesis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The NGS and mutation analysis of SFTSV genome in serum samples collected from IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> C57BL/6 mouse treated with or without T-705. <bold>a</bold> Kaplan–Meier curves for the T-705 treatment effect on the probability of survival in IFNAR<sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> C57BL/6 mouse.

                <p id="Par10">To examine the efficacy and safety of T-705 in treating SFTS, we conducted an investigator-initiated randomized controlled trial in the designated hospital for SFTS treatment in the area of greatest endemicity in China. Patients with laboratory-confirmed SFTS who met the eligibility criteria were recruited into the study. A total of 150 patients (of 276 screened) were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups (75 patients in each group). Five patients were lost to the follow-up, and eventually, 145 (74 in the T-705-treated group and 71 in the control group) were included for final analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The mean (±SD) age (64.7 ± 12.1 vs. 62.4 ± 12.4 years), gender proportion (female, 70.3% vs. 64.8%), and mean (±SD) days from symptom onset to hospital admission (5.1 ± 1.6 vs. 4.9 ± 1.7) were comparable between the two groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The mean (±SD) RT-PCR cycle-threshold (CT) value examined at the patients’ admission between the T-705-treated group (30.0 ± 3.9) and the control group (30.6 ± 4.5) was similar (<italic>P</italic> = 0.455; Supplementary Fig <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>).

The survival curves showed no inter-group difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.113, log-rank test; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).

Stratified analysis was further performed to evaluate the treatment efficacy. We found that the treatment efficacy differed by the delay from symptom onset to hospital admission and by baseline viral load. Among the patients with a delay &lt;6 days, T-705 treatment decreased the CFR from 19.6 (10 of 51) to 4.2% (2 of 48) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.021, log-rank test; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>), whereas no treatment effect was found for the patients with a delay ≥6 days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.810; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).

              <p id="Par16">T-705 has been shown to be converted to T-705-4-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate (T-705RTP) by intracellular enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> T-705RTP is recognized as a purine nucleotide by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which inhibited the incorporation of CTP and UTP and disrupted the fidelity of the RdRp, leading to base mismatches and further loss of fitness without generation of truncated genomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> During RNA virus replication, error rates of RNA genome are finely balanced to generate ample diversity while maintaining sufficient accuracy in the transmission of genetic information, and slight increases in virus mutation frequencies might result in extinction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Recent studies indicated that T-705 treatment induces an increase in mutagenesis in various RNA viruses, including EBOV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> influenza virus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> norovirus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> resulting in a significant reduction in the viral-specific infectivity and hence in extinction. The current study, based on results from in vitro and in animal experiments, as well as clinical samples, demonstrated that T-705 treatment led to increases in mutation rates of the SFTSV genome that was related to the reduced viral loads, suggesting that the anti-SFTSV activity of T-705 was mediated by inducing mutagenesis. Unlike in vitro experiments, our findings from the animal experiments and clinical samples revealed that T-705 treatment could induce both transition and transversion mutations. Transversion substitutions that are more likely to induce nonsynonymous have been thought to be more detrimental to RNA viruses including influenza virus and HIV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> therefore, the increased transversion mutations may be associated with the suppression of SFTSV. Moreover, we also found that T-705 had a more significant mutagenic effect on L and M segments. Considering the important role of RdRp (encoded by L) and G proteins (encoded by M) in SFTSV replication, the mutagenesis in L and M segments may be more likely to result in the extinction of the virus.</p>
              <p id="Par17">In this study, we reported the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the potential therapeutic effect of T-705 against viral infection, SFTSV infection in this case. The CFR of SFTS patients was reduced among those assigned to T-705 plus the standard supportive care than those assigned to the standard supportive care (9.5% vs. 18.3%), which corresponded to a 46.6% lower relative risk of fatal with T-705 treatment, although showing no statistical significance. However, after adjusting the variables that might affect the disease fatal outcome by performing multivariate analysis, we revealed a significant reduction in CFR attained by T-705 therapy. The patients receiving T-705 treatment needed a shorter time to clear SFTSV, and presented less hemorrhagic signs and more rapid recovery of neutrophils and lymphocytes. In addition, we did not observe evidently severe adverse events during T-705 treatment. Higher uric acid levels were observed in the T-705-treated group than the control group, but the mean level did not exceed the upper limit in males or females. Since leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels are important clinical features of SFTS, we cannot infer their causal relationship to T-705 drug use. Nonetheless, there was no significant difference in these parameters between the two arms, when were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Still, it is logical to conclude that no such side effects with T-705 were observed in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Of importance, a remarkable reduction in CFR with T-705 (1.6% vs. 11.5%) was shown in the subgroup with low-baseline viral load (RT-PCR CT ≥ 26). Likewise, for this subgroup, a distinct effect of T-705 on reducing the occurrence of severe complications, accelerating SFTSV clearance, and restoring laboratory abnormalities was observed. This subgroup accounted for over 80% of all SFTS patients, suggesting a promising potential of T-705 in treating SFTS, especially when compared with ribavirin that was effective in about only 20% of all patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Our in vivo analysis on the mouse model here also found T-705 increased the survival rate of SFSTV-infected mice significantly while ribavirin did not have such an effect. These clinical findings corroborate a recent report that ribavirin was less effective for treating SFTSV infection than T-705 both in vitro and in animal model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Nonetheless, it needs to be mentioned that the statistical power of the subgroup analysis was 62% based on the current sample size (61 in each group) at a significance level of 0.05. If the T-705 treatment effect sustained and the sample size reached 100 per group, the statistical power would be 83%.</p>
              <p id="Par19">For the patients with high-baseline viral loads, the CFR was moderately reduced in the T-705-treated group (46.2% vs. 60.0%). The lack of statistical significance could be due to both the small sample size and the relatively low drug doses. Indeed, our in vivo study showed that T-705 treatment efficacy was affected not only by the concentration and action time of the drug but also by the viral loads. Previous pharmacokinetics analysis for the JIKI trial indicated that concentrations of T-705 in patients infected with Ebola virus were lower than targeted, which might have led to the underestimation of the antiviral efficacy of T-705.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Following a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> the dose here was set as 1800 mg twice on the first day and 1000 mg twice during the following days, which was estimated to attain a median <italic>C</italic><sub>ave</sub> not lower than 50 μg/ml, the effective dose in an anti-influenza randomized clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> This dose, however, is slightly lower than that used in the trial of treating the Ebola virus disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Further pharmacokinetics analysis is needed to evaluate the actual anti-SFTSV effect under various T-705 concentrations.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Our study proved in an explicit manner, the fatal outcome was seen in patients who presented less mutagenesis, despite receiving T-705 treatment. It is reasonable to hypothesize the mutagenesis evaluation of SFTSV might be more direct and effective in predicting the disease outcome. There was an obvious difference between fatal and survived patients for their sensitivity to T-705, suggesting T-705 induced mutagenesis was highly dependent on the initial viral loads. As had previously shown for the foot-and-mouth disease, successful viral clearance was often associated with lower initial viral loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> It needs to be disclosed whether SFTS patients with high viral load could get more treatment benefit if receiving the higher dose of T-705.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Besides, death occurred on T-705-treated patients, an unexpected outcome that might result from excessive inflammation response. As part of the immunological measurements in the current research, IL-10, IL-6, IFNA-γ, TNF-α, and GM-CSF were all remarkably elevated in fatal patients than survivors (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S16</xref>), playing a crucial role in determining the final disease outcome, irrespective of the viral loads. As such, the therapeutic regimens for SFTSV infection should also regulate the host inflammatory response, which may hold promise in preventing the death outcome.</p>
              <p id="Par22">There is an utmost need for potent antivirals to combat the infections of emerging and high pathogenic viruses. The clinical efficacy of T-705 has been reported in treating Ebola virus and Lassa virus infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> As to SFTS that has been prevalent in East Asia for almost 10 years, until very recently, there is only one case report describing the successful treatment of two SFTS patients with complete remission by using T-705.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> Taken this together, the current study represented the first randomized clinical trial showing T-705 is both safe and effective in treating SFTS, holding the promise of curing the patients, especially for those with a baseline CT value ≥26. It is well documented that T-705 has broad antiviral activity against RNA viruses in vitro or in animal models. Therefore, the use of T-705 would allow considering a large number of these RNA viruses as potential therapeutic targets. Beyond all the clinical significance, the elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of T-705 paved the way for future clinical trials evaluating T-705 on other RNA viruses, for example, the ongoing epidemic of heartland virus that inflict more and more cases in the USA. The current research also provided a dose regimen choice of T-705 in treating patients with other emerging infectious diseases, e.g., the still-expanding SARS-CoV-2 around the world in a context where trials are urgently needed.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In conclusion, our study showed that administration of T-705 can reduce case fatality in SFTS patients, possibly via inducing lethal mutagenesis, and such mutagenesis may be mediated by drug dose and viral load. Although designed as a randomized clinical trial, the single-blind design was applied due to the high mortality of the infection. This weakness might potentially elicit observational bias at the bedside, as opposed to a double-blind design. Still, our findings warrant verification by further clinical trials of larger scales. A T-705-ribavirin combine treatment, which has reached a higher efficacy through a potentially synergistic antiviral effect in treating Lassa fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> should also be advocated in future clinical trials.</p>
