                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>People who inject drugs (PWID) have low rates of COVID-19 testing yet are vulnerable to severe disease. In partnership with a mobile syringe service program (SSP) in San Diego County, CA, we developed the evidence-, community-, and Social Cognitive Theory-informed âLinkUPâ intervention (tailored education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving, and planning) to increase COVID-19 testing uptake among PWID.</p>

                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>To assess preliminary efficacy of LinkUP in increasing PWID COVID-19 testing in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We referred participants (PWID, â¥18 years old, San Diego County residents who had not recently undergone voluntary COVID-19 testing) to mobile SSP sites that had been randomized (by week) to offer the active LinkUP intervention or didactic attention-control conditions delivered by trained peer counselors. Following either condition, counselors offered on-site rapid COVID-19 antigen testing. Analyses estimated preliminary intervention efficacy and explored potential moderation.</p>

                <sec id="s4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Among 150 participants, median age was 40.5 years, 33.3% identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 64.7% were male, 73.3% were experiencing homelessness, and 44.7% had prior mandatory COVID-19 testing. The LinkUP intervention was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 testing uptake (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>â&lt;â.0001). Homelessness moderated intervention effects; LinkUP increased COVID-19 testing uptake more among participants experiencing homelessness (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.56â2.09; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .0001) than those not experiencing homelessness (aRR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01â1.43; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .04).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Findings from this pilot RCT support the preliminary efficacy of the âLinkUPâ intervention to increase COVID-19 testing among PWID and underscore the importance of academic-community partnerships and prevention service delivery through SSPs and other community-based organizations serving vulnerable populations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Amidst the ongoing opioid and polysubstance use epidemics, people who inject drugs (PWID) represent a sizeable and growing proportion of the U.S. population [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A national U.S. study identified nearly nine times the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with substance use disorders (SUD) compared to those without SUD [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among people who inject drugs (PWID), multilevel factors elevate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death, including chronic and infectious disease comorbidities [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], stigma, and other structural factors (e.g., homelessness, poverty, limited transportation, and health insurance) that reduce utilization of preventive screening and healthcare services [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Related to these well-documented barriers to healthcare utilization, PWID has suboptimal rates of COVID-19 testing [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which may be compounded by limited COVID-19 knowledge and perceived risk [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and institutional distrust [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our research in the San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico border region found that SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was higher among PWID than the general population while levels of COVID-19 testing were lower [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As of September 2021, two-thirds had never been tested for COVID-19, despite over half having recently been in contact with at least one service setting in which COVID-19 testing could have been offered [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We also found that many COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of opioid withdrawal, possibly leading to PWID being less aware of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], underscoring the need for increased COVID-19 testing in this population.</p>
              <p>In addition to the multilevel barriers to healthcare utilization among PWID [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], emerging research has identified distrust of the public health pandemic response and mandatory nature of COVID-19 testing often encountered by people experiencing homelessness and incarceration (e.g., required testing in shelters and correctional facilities) as factors that limit COVID-19 testing and vaccination motivation and uptake [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6â9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on this literature and consultations with community-based organizations serving PWID in San Diego County, we developed the theory-, evidence-, and community-informed âLinkUPâ intervention to increase COVID-19 testing uptake (primary outcome) and vaccination uptake (secondary outcome) among PWID [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To test the preliminary efficacy of LinkUP, we received funding from the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Underserved Populations (RADxUP) initiative which aims to reduce COVID-19 transmission in disproportionately impacted populations [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>LinkUP was informed by Social Cognitive Theory [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which posits that health-promoting behaviors are determined by interconnected outcome expectations (i.e., beliefs about the consequences of oneâs behavioral choices), behavioral capability (i.e., ability to engage in desired behaviors), self-efficacy (i.e., belief in oneâs ability to engage in desired behaviors), observational learning (i.e., from seeing role models perform desired behaviors), and the environmental context surrounding individualsâ behaviors. Our manualized intervention involved tailored education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving, and planning strategies to increase COVID-19 knowledge, perceived risk, and testing motivation, self-efficacy, and behavioral skills [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, it was delivered by trained peer counselors at a mobile syringe service program (SSP) with strong ties to the local PWID community to facilitate observational learning (i.e., from trusted role models) and support individuals in overcoming environmental barriers to COVID-19 testing. Peer counselors were outreach workers of the SSP, identified by the SSP and compensated by our study, who had lived experience with substance use and were highly familiar withâand trusted byâthe local PWID community. SSPs have a long history of successfully engaging PWID in preventive screening and healthcare services [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] including SUD treatment and infectious disease screening, treatment, and vaccination [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18â26</xref>]. Furthermore, SSPs are routinely viewed by their clients as trustworthy sources of health information and referrals [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27â30</xref>], making them ideal settings for interventions addressing COVID-19 testing. In this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05181657), we hypothesized that the LinkUP intervention would significantly increase COVID-19 testing relative to a didactic attention-matched control condition. This manuscript focuses only on the primary outcome (COVID-19 testing uptake), as follow-up to ascertain vaccination uptake following referrals to community-based clinics is still ongoing.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Setting</title>
                <p>The LinkUP pilot RCT was conducted from March to June, 2022. As previously described [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the trial design was conceptualized and implemented in partnership with our Community Scientific Advisory Board and OnPoint, San Diego Countyâs only mobile, needs-based SSP. LinkUP leveraged the infrastructure of âLa Frontera,â an ongoing binational cohort study of HIV, HCV, and overdose risk among PWID in the San Diego-Tijuana border region to investigate SARS-CoV2 epidemiology [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and barriers to COVID-19 testing [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Participants in La Frontera were recruited via street outreach in locations where the OnPoint mobile SSP routinely operated, and other areas where PWID was known to live or congregate. Participants were eligible if they were â¥18 years old, reported past-month injection drug use, and resided in San Diego County or Tijuana, Mexico. As RADxUP funding was restricted to U.S. projects, we reviewed La Frontera data from San Diego residents who had agreed to be recontacted for future research to assess potential LinkUP eligibility, which included (1) reporting not having ever been voluntarily tested for COVID-19 outside of La Frontera or reporting having had mandatory COVID-19 testing (i.e., required testing in shelters and correctional facilities) over two months ago; and (2) either meeting the studyâs âsymptomaticâ or âunvaccinatedâ definitions (i.e., being fully vaccinated according to guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was an exclusion criterion) [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To assess LinkUP eligibility, trained, bilingual study staff then recontacted potentially eligible La Frontera participants, depending on their preferences and resources, via phone calls, texts, social media, and street outreach in areas where PWID was known to live or congregate. Study staff then explained the study in English or Spanish using a consent form, answered any questions, and obtained written informed consent for the LinkUP pilot RCT, which included consent to share de-identified data with the RADxUP Data Coordinating Center at Duke University. The University of California, San Diego IRB reviewed and approved all study procedures.</p>

                <title>Baseline Assessments</title>
                <p>Interviewer-administered, computer-assisted assessments collected data on socio-demographics, substance use behaviors, and health and COVID-19-related factors (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants also provided blood specimens for HIV and HCV testing at baseline. We conducted all data collection outdoors with physical distancing and facemasks for participants and research staff [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As previously described [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], to reduce participant burden, one-week following baseline, we used contact methods described above to locate participants and administer a supplemental COVID-19 survey assessing COVID-19 knowledge (including misinformation and disinformation), exposures, protective behaviors, and additional RADx-UP Tier 1 Common Data Elements [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We assessed COVID-19 misinformation through endorsement of six items that were dichotomized (i.e., âTrueâ and âUnsureâ vs. âFalseâ); however, due to poor psychometric properties, it was not possible to develop a scale and we thus examined misinformation items individually [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For disinformation, assessed through endorsement of six dichotomized conspiracy-theory items, Chronbachâs alpha was 0.72. However, due to the small number of items that we had available for the disinformation scale, we also calculated the average inter-item correlation as a measure of internal consistency which is invariant to the number of items. The mean inter-item correlation is 0.31, which indicates good internal consistency since the ideal range is considered to be between 0.15 and 0.50. [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] We summed disinformation items to calculate a total score (range: 0â6).</p>

                <p>To reduce contamination between conditions, we randomized weeks of study implementation to involve either the active LinkUP intervention or didactic attention-control condition (i.e., the OnPoint SSP and study team collaborated to administer whichever condition was allocated to that particular week). We co-located OnPoint and research operations so LinkUP participants could immediately connect with OnPoint peer counselors for provision of harm reduction supplies and referrals to other services. Peer counselors also confirmed participantsâ identity via study ID cards and briefly re-assessed COVID-19 testing, vaccination history, and health and harm reduction needs. Counselors then delivered the condition randomly allocated to that week. Counselors received formal training in human subjectsâ research ethics, motivational interviewing, and COVID-19 biology, testing, vaccination referrals, and common misinformation and disinformation from the PhD-level Project Director on our research team, who was experienced in motivational interviewing and knowledgeable about COVID-19 biology and public health recommendations. The Project Director also supervised intervention delivery and met one-on-one with counselors to provide refresher training and feedback to ensure fidelity to the intervention manuals [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>

The intervention began with a series of brief educational videos on COVID-19 epidemiology, testing, and vaccination (~5 minutes total; in English or Spanish). The rest of the session (~25 minutes on average) was interactive and flexible, involving tailored education focused on individualsâ unique beliefs and concerns, motivational interviewing to attempt to tip participantsâ decisional balance, and problem-solving and planning strategies for future vaccination (as a secondary outcome for which follow-up data collection is still ongoing) [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Counselors read and shared results with participants within 15 minutes. Participants testing positive were asked to provide an additional nasal swab for PCR confirmation and advised to practice physical distancing and wear facemasks. Participants testing positive or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms were also referred to nearby clinics and provided with information on other community services using a list of local resources.

                <p>To assess whether the active LinkUP intervention was more successful than the didactic condition at increasing COVID-19 testing uptake (primary outcome), we used a multivariable modified Poisson regression model [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35â37</xref>], via Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), with intervention group as the primary variable of interest and potential confounders included as covariates. We also accounted for potential clustering by specifying an exchangeable correlation structure for participants who were recruited during the same week. To determine the covariates to control for, we used the modified disjunctive cause criterion set forth by VanderWeele (2019) who suggests controlling for covariates that may cause the exposure, the outcome, or both and exclude any instrumental variable that predicts the exposure but conditional on the exposure does not predict the outcome [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We first selected a set of variables (e.g., age, gender, homelessness, income) based on previous research findings [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and regressed each individual variable on the outcome (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) as well as on the exposure (data not shown) using modified Poisson regressions with robust standard error estimations via GEE, accounting for clustering by recruitment week. Variables that yielded <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values â¤ .10 in univariate regressions were further considered as candidates for covariates in multivariable models and retained in the final multivariable model if the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value remained â¤ .10. Additionally, interactions between the intervention group and covariates were evaluated to determine if any covariates moderated the effect of the intervention on the outcome. For interactions, we used a conservative, accepted alpha level of 0.15 [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Only one interaction was found to be significant, and consequently, we calculated and tested simple main effects to determine the intervention effect at different levels of the factor involved in the interaction. Finally, we assessed the multivariable model for multi-collinearity by examining the largest condition index and variance inflation factors. We conducted all analyses using SAS (v9.4).</p>

The most prevalent drugs injected in the past 6 months were heroin or fentanyl (73.3%), methamphetamine (66.7%), and cocaine (8.0%). Most participants had health insurance (86.7%) and had attended a SSP in the past 6 months (78.0%). Over half had never had a flu vaccine (53.3%).</p>
                <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, the median level of concern about getting COVID-19 was 4.0 (IQR: 1.0â7.0). Overall, 44.7% reported having mandatory COVID-19 testing prior to joining the study, including 60% of those who were incarcerated and 71% of those who slept in shelter/welfare residence in the past 6 months (compared to 42% who were not incarcerated and 42% of those and did not sleep in shelter/welfare residence in the past 6 months). Overall, 22.1% had been partially vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to the study. Participantsâ âmost importantâ sources of COVID-19-related information included friends (53.7%), followed by social media (19.9%) and doctors/health professionals (5.9%).</p>

                <p>When comparing participant characteristics and behaviors by condition, we found that the groups were unbalanced with respect to age, past 6-months homelessness, food insecurity, and beliefs in curative treatments for COVID-19; however, none of these variables were significantly associated with the COVID-19 testing outcome (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), so we only investigated them as potential moderators of the intervention effect.</p>

              <p>This pilot RCT provides preliminary evidence that the theory-, evidence-, and community-informed LinkUP intervention increased COVID-19 testing uptake among PWID attending mobile SSP sites in San Diego County compared to an attention-control condition, particularly for participants experiencing homelessness. Although this pilot trial was not powered to fully investigate the mechanisms through which LinkUP promoted COVID-19 testing, based on our community consultations and formative research identifying multilevel barriers to COVID-19 testing in this vulnerable population, we believe that LinkUPâs theoretical grounding and multicomponent nature supported its success. In particular, we had learned that PWID in San Diego County had low levels of COVID-19 knowledge, perceived risk, and motivation for prevention behaviors and service engagement, which could have made structural barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccination access seem unsurmountable [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We drew from Social Cognitive Theory to identify tailored education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving and planning [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as key intervention strategies for helping participants overcome these key barriers to cognitive and behavioral change [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the implementation of LinkUP within a mobile SSP staffed by trusted peer counselors may have additionally promoted preliminary intervention efficacy, along with the direct provision of services and referrals onsite that increased the accessibility of COVID-19 testing far beyond what it would have been within other clinical and community venues. Further research, including prospective assessments of COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation among those who do and do not access SSPs, could help assess hypothesized mechanisms through which LinkUP operates and explore potential moderators of intervention effects.</p>
              <p>For example, we found that homelessness moderated LinkUP effects, with the intervention appearing to have a greater impact on COVID-19 testing uptake among participants experiencing homelessness than those who were not. While we previously found homelessness to be associated with prior COVID-19 testing in the overall binational La Frontera cohort study [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it is possible that testing within that earlier time period was mandatory in many settings frequently encountered by this population (e.g., emergency departments, shelters, jails, and prisons that required COVID-19 testing). As our qualitative research revealed, such mandatory testing may have bolstered individualsâ distrust of the pandemic response, reducing their motivation to seek out future testing services on their own [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the prevalence of COVID-19 testing in the general population declined between the end of data collection for our previous study (in September, 2021) and the start of this pilot RCT (in March, 2022), it is possible that experiences of mandatory COVID-19 testing also declined for our participants as well. We thus posit that LinkUP may have restored trust and increased motivation to undergo <italic toggle="yes">voluntary</italic> COVID-19 testing. Indeed, the association between prior <italic toggle="yes">mandatory</italic> COVID-19 testing and voluntary testing uptake following LinkUP observed here suggests that peer counselorsâ motivational interviewing, possibly combined with onsite testing access at the SSP, also addressed similar mechanisms of action.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, we also believe that the preliminary success of LinkUP hinged on our strong communityâacademic partnership with a mobile SSP, OnPoint, that had cultivated trust within the local PWID community. While the accessibility of mobile SSPs within vulnerable PWID communities may be greater than âbrick and mortarâ (i.e., fixed) locations [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], more research is needed to understand specific advantages and disadvantages of leveraging these essential public health services within the broader context of this prolonged public health emergency [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Research has shown that, at the individual level, the COVID-19 pandemic may have altered PWID access to harm reduction services in diverse ways [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. At the organizational level, as the pandemic response pressured some organizations to shift away from the provision of harm reduction services (and into the provision of COVID-19 testing, for example), some staff may have felt over-exertion and burnout [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Efforts to scale-up LinkUP or similar SSP-based interventions should thus consider the various implementation needs of these organizations, which require adequate funding and occupational support for the harm reduction workforce.</p>
              <p>It is also important to consider our findings in light of other promising intervention strategies that could be complimentary to or synergistic with those used in LinkUP. For example, a growing body of research supports the role of financial incentives in promoting COVID-19 testing and vaccination [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In particular, contingency management, or the provision of financial incentives to reinforce recommended behaviors, can support adherence to infectious disease testing and vaccination recommendations among individuals with SUD including PWID [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45â50</xref>]. Another RADxUP-funded project using a pre-post evaluation design recently suggested that contingency management involving $10 incentives could also improve COVID-19 testing uptake among SSP participants [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, additional research is needed to understand the short- and longer-term impacts of contingency management efforts within such programs, including how resulting behavior changes can be sustained over time for vulnerable populations. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic limited SSP access in many settings [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], it may be worthwhile to explore alternative approaches such as the distribution of COVID-19 self-test kits through vending machines or peer networks. However, while self-testing for other infectious diseases (e.g., HIV) holds promise for PWID [<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], concerns regarding poor adherence to quarantine guidelines following COVID-19 self-testing in the U.S. general population [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] underscore the need for more research on these models [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our pilot RCT had several limitations. First, our non-random sampling of PWID who were largely recruited via street outreach in an era characterized by increasing âstreet sweepsâ of homeless encampments means that our findings may not be generalizable to the entire population of PWID in San Diego County, or PWID in other parts of the country. At the same time, similar initiatives to dismantle homeless encampments and forcibly displace persons experiencing homelessness are increasingly common across the U.S. [<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], despite growing evidence that they disconnect vulnerable individuals from essential prevention, healthcare, and substance use treatment services [<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Second, we relied on recall and self-report of sensitive and socially stigmatized behaviors, and some of our COVID-19-specific measures, while demonstrating high internal consistency [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], have not been formally validated. Third, our control condition provided brief educational videos on COVID-19; thus, differences between the two study arms may have been attenuated, and additional research (e.g., in the context of a fully powered RCT) is needed to confirm intervention efficacy and further explore the mechanisms of potential mediators and moderators of intervention effects. Finally, additional longitudinal research is needed to determine if LinkUPâs referrals to community vaccination services resulted in actual vaccination uptake, our secondary outcome, which may be supported by similar theory-derived strategies (e.g., planning strategies for following through on SSP-delivered referrals to offsite vaccination services) [<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, our pilot RCT supports the preliminary efficacy of the LinkUP intervention in increasing COVID-19 testing among PWID, particularly those experiencing homelessness. While further research is needed to confirm hypothesized mechanisms of action and identify key moderators of intervention effects, our findings suggest that uptake of COVID-19 testing among PWID may remain modest unless testing is paired with education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving to address knowledge and attitude-related barriers. Implementation research is also needed to understand how LinkUP could be optimized for and sustained within other SSPs across the United States, as SSPs are diverse in terms of their size, scope, geographic locations, service delivery models, and other organizational and external factors. Nevertheless, this pilot trial underscores the importance of partnering with trusted community-based organizations in efforts to deliver essential prevention services and supplies to vulnerable populations disproportionately impacted by substance use, COVID-19, and other infectious diseases.</p>
