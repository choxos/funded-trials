                <p id="Par1">MOTS-c is a mitochondrial derived peptide with exercise mimetic activity that elicits beneficial effects on metabolism and exercise capacity. Furthermore, MOTS-c effects in humans are affected by race, potentially via ethnic-specific mtDNA variations. Women treated for breast cancer are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, due to side effects of cancer-treatments. We conducted a secondary analysis of the effects of a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on MOTS-c in Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White breast cancer survivors (BCS). BCS (Stage I–III) were randomized to exercise or standard care. The intervention promoted aerobic and resistance exercise for 16 weeks. MOTS-c was analyzed in fasting plasma using an in-house ELISA. Within and between group differences were assessed by paired t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. Pearson’s correlation was computed to assess the association between MOTS-c and metabolic biomarkers at baseline and post-exercise. Twenty-five Hispanic-BCS and 24 non-Hispanic White BCS were included. Hispanic BCS were younger, of greater adiposity, had higher stage cancers, and had worse metabolic profiles at baseline compared to non-Hispanic White BCS (p &lt; 0.001). Post-exercise, MOTS-c levels significantly increased when compared to baseline and the usual care group among non-Hispanic White BCS (p &lt; 0.01) but not among Hispanic breast cancer survivors (p &gt; 0.01). Post-exercise levels of MOTS-c among non-Hispanic White BCS were significantly associated with reductions in fat mass, body weight, HOMA-IR, CRP, and an increase in lean mass (p &lt; 0.01). A 16-week aerobic and resistance intervention increased MOTS-c levels among non-Hispanic White BCS.

              <p id="Par3">Mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) are peptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA, have similar energetic functions to mitochondria, and play a cytoprotective role in the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. MOTS-c is a MDP with exercise mimetic activity that elicits beneficial effects on metabolism and exercise capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. MOTS-c stimulates glucose utilization, fat-oxidization, reduces inflammation, and protects against experimental models of metabolic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, MOTS-c effects in humans are affected by race, potentially via ethnic-specific mtDNA variations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Women treated for breast cancer are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and obesity, due to side effects of cancer-treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Exercise mitigates many of these side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but the role of MOTS-c regulation by exercise among breast cancer survivors (BCS) of varying ethnicities is unknown. Hispanics, in particular, suffer from more comorbid conditions including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Given that increased research on MDPs has shown their involvement in pathological changes of CVD through different mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, the impact of exercise on MOTS-c is of specific interest in this particular at-risk demographic encompassing cancer survivors and minority women.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The overall purpose of this trial was to compare a 16-week supervised moderate-vigorous intensity aerobic and resistance exercise intervention to usual care in physically inactive, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White BCS. We previously reported that the exercise intervention led to significant improvements in metabolic syndrome, sarcopenic obesity, and circulating biomarkers, muscle strength, psychosocial health that were maintained at 3-month follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Here, we report the secondary outcome of MOTS-c. We hypothesized that a combined exercise intervention performed within 6 months of cancer treatment completion would increase MOTS-c in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic White BCS, and explored the presence of ethnic differences in MOTS-c.</p>

Standards, controls or extracted samples and pre-titered detection antibody were added to the appropriate wells and incubated overnight after 2 washes with wash buffer and 2 washes with Superblock buffer (Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, IL). Wells were then added streptavidin-HRP conjugate after wash and further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After 4 washes with wash buffer, 200 μl/well of 1-step ultra TMB will be added and incubated for 10–20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and absorbance was measured on a plate spectrophotometer (Molecular Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) at 490 nm. The intra- and inter-assay coefficient variations were less than 10%.</p>

Participants received three supervised one-on-one exercise sessions/week. Days one and three consisted of aerobic and resistance exercise of ~ 80 min and Day two included ~ 50 min of aerobic exercise. All sessions were led by a certified ACS/ACSM Cancer Exercise Trainer. Participants wore a Polar® heart monitor (Lake Success, NY) during each exercise session. Each session began with a 5-min aerobic exercise warm-up at 40–50% estimated VO<sub>2max</sub>. Sequenced resistance exercise followed in circuit training fashion with no rest periods between exercises: Leg Press ⇔ Chest Press ⇒ Lunges ⇔ Seated Row ⇒ Leg Extensions ⇔ Triceps Extensions ⇒ Leg Flexion ⇔ Biceps Curl; where ⇔ indicates the two exercises that alternated until all sets were completed, then the following pair of exercises was performed. Initial resistance was set at 80% of the estimated 1-RM for lower body exercises and 60% estimated 1-RM for upper body exercises. When the participant was able to complete three sets of 10 repetitions at the set weight in two consecutive sessions then the weight is increased by 10%. Repetitions increased from 10 (week 4) to 12 (week 8) to 15 (week 12) every 4 weeks to safely build muscular endurance. Compression garments were required during the exercise sessions for all participants who held prescriptions.</p>

Heart rate (HR) was monitored throughout the aerobic sessions to maintain a HR at 65–80% of maximum HR. Target HR was increased every four weeks to safely build cardiorespiratory endurance and to maintain the prescribed intensity as participants improved their cardiorespiratory fitness. Duration of the aerobic sessions was increased from 30 min (week 1) to 50 min (week 16) as cardiorespiratory fitness increased to meet the exercise guidelines for cancer survivors.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par26">A supervised 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention designed to improve metabolic syndrome also led to significant improvements in MOTS-c in non-Hispanic White BCS. This is the first study to our knowledge to report improvements in MOTS-c with a structured combined exercise intervention in an ethnically-diverse sample of overweight or obese BCS soon after treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Here we confirm an exercise-induced increase in MOTS-c among non-Hispanic White BCS, as noted in adult populations. Few studies have been developed in the area of exercise and MOTS-c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, yet there is growing interest in the effects of exercise on MDPs in human subjects. Reynolds et al. (2019) reported significant increases in MOTS-c in response to exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. While these results are similar to what we reported in the non-Hispanic White BCS group, associations are hard to draw as Reynolds et al. (2019) involved a small sample size (n = 10) of healthy young males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The intervention was also of a much shorter duration, involving only one bout of high intensity cycling. Participants completed ten, 60-s intervals at peak power workloads (determined from visit one), followed by 75-s of rest/low intensity cycling. Blood and muscle samples were taken before, immediately after, and 4-h after recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Overall, there is a severe lack of conclusive evidence regarding the effects of exercise on MOTS-c among adults with a history of cancer. However, additional work has been done with another MDPs, Humanin. The largest exercise trial, to our knowledge, involving Humanin was done in prediabetic men (n = 55) with impaired glucose regulation (IGR). Gidlund et al. (2016) reported for the first time, that Humanin protein levels increase in human skeletal muscle following a 12-week resistance training intervention. This was a three-armed trial in that participants were either randomized to resistance training, Nordic walking, or a control group. Participants exercised three times per week (60 min/session), with the exercise intensity and load progressively increasing every 4 weeks. Blood and tissue samples were taken before and after the intervention. Gidlund et al. (2016) reported that skeletal muscle humanin protein levels increased after resistance training, however no change in humanin protein levels was seen in serum in any of the intervention groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">This evidence is compelling in regard to the breast cancer population as there has been associations between MDPs and cardiovascular risk factors, such as aging, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. MDPs play a cardioprotective role by intervening in these risk factors through reducing oxidative stress, influencing metabolism of glycolipids, increasing glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity, and protecting endothelial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. BCS are at elevated risk of multiple comorbid conditions. Part of this is natural as risk of comorbid conditions increase with age and most breast cancer patients are commonly diagnosed after 50 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, this group is also most susceptible to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and developing metabolic syndrome (MetS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This could be due to a multitude of effects, such as inadequate diet, sedentary behavior, and consequential weight gain, but also cancer treatments with secondary cardiotoxic and atheromatous effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Some breast cancer treatments, such as chemotherapies with anthracyclines and trastuzumab or radiation, can increase risk of cardiac dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In mouse models, Humanin seems to have a role in the prevention of age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and potentially cardiovascular diseases. However, any potential exercise-mediated protective and risk reducing effects need to be further validated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Yet, this evidence is still promising that there is a connection and potential for exercise to influence MDPs and thus, impact comorbid conditions, not only in mouse and human subjects, but specifically cancer survivors. While there is speculation that MOTS-c is involved in exercise adaptation, there might be similarities between Humanin and MOTS-c to indicate that they act in concert since their signaling pathways are similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Given the fact that MOTS-c has been shown to target skeletal muscle and enhance glucose metabolism, there is implications that MOTS-c could assist in regulating obesity, diabetes, exercise, and longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, making it a novel marker to study in the topic of exercise oncology.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In alignment with the positive impact of exercise on MOTS-c among non-Hispanic White BCS, MOTS-c was positively correlated with increases in lean mass and fat loss, implying that as lean mass increases and fat mass decreases, MOTS-c increases. These positive results support previous MOTS-c observational studies demonstrating associations with MOTS-c and biomarkers of skeletal muscle both in plasms and tissue samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, post-exercise MOTS-c levels were associated with improved cardiometabolic biomarkers contributing to the overall positive impact of exercise on a population of cancer survivors highly prone to cardiovascular-related co-morbidities.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Notably, our results highlight the identification of a possible ethnicity-dependent relationship whereby Hispanic BCS did not experience improvements in MOTS-c following the exercise intervention. However, at baseline, measures of physical fitness were positively associated with MOTS-c, as expected, for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic White BCS. As this is the first trial to examine MOTS-c in cancer survivors, it is difficult to ascertain potential mediators of ethnic differences in response to exercise, which may include socio-cultural influences, therefore future works elicits a focus on observational data surrounding ethnic profiles of MOTS-c among cancer survivors, and subsequent exercise interventions to improve MOTS-c. The question remains as to whether there is an underlying impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis associated with obesity and metabolic profiles, of which are worsened when compared to non-Hispanic Whites, among Hispanic BCS that may alter the responsiveness of MOTS-c to exercise.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Strengths of our study include the focus on high-risk BCS with high rates of inactivity and obesity, targeting the early survivorship period, the ethnically-diverse sample, the randomized controlled trial design, the high adherence rate, and the modest loss-to-follow up. Limitations include small sample size, lack of direct physical function and physical fitness measures (i.e., 1-RM and VO<sub>2max</sub>), and lack of an attention control group.</p>

Non-Hispanic White BCS who experience exercise-induced improvements in MOTS-c may also experience improved insulin sensitivity and body composition thereby reducing the risk for comorbid conditions. Despite poorer metabolic profiles, Hispanic BCS may not experience exercise-induced benefits on MOTS-c. Future trials should aim to explore potential ethnic differences in MOTS-c levels following exercise among cancer survivors.</p>
