                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers have a high efficacy in treating Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), yet up to 40% of AS patients show poor or even no response to this treatment. In this paper, we aim to build an approach to predict the response prior to clinical treatment.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">AS patients during the active progression were included and treated with TNF blocker for 3 months. Patients who do not fulfill ASASAS40 were considered as poor responders. The Immunoglobulin G galactosylation (IgG-Gal) ratio representing the quantity of IgG galactosylation was calculated and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients treated with etanercept was obtained. Machine-learning models and cross-validation were conducted to predict responsiveness.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Both IgG-Gal ratio at each time point and differential IgG-Gal ratios between week 0 and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 showed significant difference between responders and poor-responders. Area under curve (AUC) of the IgG-Gal ratio prediction model was 0.8 after cross-validation, significantly higher than current clinical indexes (C-reactive protein (CRP) = 0.65, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) = 0.59). The SNP <italic>MYOM2</italic>-rs2294066 was found to be significantly associated with responsiveness of etanercept treatment. A three-stage approach consisting of baseline IgG-Gal ratio, differential IgG-Gal ratio in 2 weeks, and rs2294066 genotype demonstrated the ability to precisely predict the response of anti-TNF therapy (100% for poor-responders, 98% for responders).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the spine and sacroiliac joints, which could lead to vertebral fusion (Taurog et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>). Although there is still no cure for AS, TNF-blockers are effective in alleviating inflammation and reducing pain (Sieper &amp; Poddubnyy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>). However, while the annual cost of TNF-blockers is large, up to 40% of AS patients have no or poor response to this treatment (Schabert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Sieper &amp; Poddubnyy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). It is therefore essential to find biomarkers to predict the responsiveness of TNF blockers in clinical practice, preferably before or at the start of TNF blocker treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Multiple studies have examined associations of genetic biomarkers, especially <italic>TNFA</italic> promoter polymorphisms, with responsiveness to TNF blocker treatment (Tong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Song et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>; Tong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>). However, none have shown any model powerful enough to precisely distinguish good responders from poor ones.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Immunoglobulin G (IgG) plays an important role in humoral immune response by binding to antigen and Fcγ receptors (FcγR). Immune cells activity can be regulated by the glycan attached to asparagine-297 in the Fc part of IgG (Arnold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). It was reported that the proportion of IgG lacking galactose is significantly increased in patients with autoimmune diseases (Vuckovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>). IgG galactosylation has been reported as a biomarker for immune activation and cancer type screening (de Jong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>; Ren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>). Therefore, IgG galactosylation change in different time points during TNF blocker treatment is a plausible breakpoint in the development of prediction biomarkers.</p>
              <p id="Par8">In this study, we aimed to develop an approach to precisely predict the response to TNF blocker treatment among AS patients by both assessing the quantitative changes in IgG galactosylation alone and in combination with AS associated SNPs.</p>

                <p id="Par10">IgG-Gal ratio was detected by the method reported in our previous study. In brief, IgG N-glycans of purified IgG from blood plasma sample was released by mixing denatured IgG and PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Inc., USA) with incubation for 12 h at 37 °C. The released oligosaccharides were subsequently purified using PGC (porous graphitic carbon) and analyzed by AXIMA Resonance MALDI MS (Shimadzu Corp. JP) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser in reflector positive ionization mode. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was utilized to validate the component of the detected glycans. The GlycoWorkbench software was used for the annotation of MS spectra. Progenesis MALDI was used for MS data process. The biantennary, core-fucosylated structures carrying two, one, and no galactose residues are the three most significant glycans identified from IgG, named G2, G1, and G0. The distribution of IgG galactosylation (IgG-Gal ratio) was calculated using the relative intensities of G0, G1 and G2 according to the formula G0/ (G1 + G2 × 2).</p>

                <p id="Par13">The response to Etanercept of each patient was used as a dependent variable and several candidate indexes including Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Di (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Fu (BASFI), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease (ASDAS) and IgG-Gal ratio were used as independent variables to build the regression model. Cross-validation was applied as follows. The data of 78 patients were used to build the model and determine the best cutoff value; the value was used to predict the response of the 79th patient. The process was duplicated by 79 times.</p>
                <p id="Par14">As for the combination model of IgG-Gal ratio and candidate SNP, the methods logistic regression (LG), randomforest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), naviebayes (NB), neural network (NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) and flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) were performed. Cross-validation was applied as follows: we randomly divided the responders and poor-responders into 10 groups; groups 1 to 8 were used to build model (training), and groups 9 and 10 were used to test the model (validation) and then rotate 10 times.

                <p id="Par17">Etanercept is the most widely used type of TNF blocker for AS patients in China.. Plasma from 79 patients were collected at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 during treatment for measuring IgG galactosylation level (IgG-Gal) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par18">IgG-Galactosylation ratio (IgG-Gal ratio) was measured by the method reported in our previous study (Ren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>). In particular, IgG N-glycans of purified IgG was released by mixing denatured IgG and PNGase F. The released oligosaccharides were detected by tandem mass spectrometry. The biantennary, core-fucosylated structures carrying two, one, and none galactose residues are the three most common glycans identified from IgG, named G2, G1, and G0. The distribution of IgG galactosylation (IgG-Gal ratio) was calculating using relative intensities of G0, G1 and G2 according to the formula of G0/ (G1 + G2 × 2). (See details in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par19">As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, at the beginning (week 0), the average IgG-Gal ratio of responders was almost twice as high as that of poor-responders (1.02 ± 0.49 vs 0.59 ± 0.17, <italic>p</italic>-value = 2 × 10<sup>− 4</sup>). After treatment, the average IgG–Gal ratio of responders decreased slowly from 1.1 to 0.8 (P<sub>trend</sub> = 2.9 × 10<sup>− 5</sup>), while that of poor-responders persisted (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.82) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Furthermore, difference of IgG-Gal ratio between responders and poor-responders at each time-point showed at least marginal significance. We further calculated the difference of IgG-Gal ratios between week 0 and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (ΔIgG-Gal ratio). The ΔIgG-Gal ratios displayed significant difference at each time point between responders (<italic>n</italic> = 42) and poor-responders (<italic>n</italic> = 10) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). On the contrary, the indices such as BASDAI, BASFI, ESR, CRP and ASDAS had little or no significant difference between responders and poor-responders before treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The BASDAI and BASFI (as well as the ASDAS in part) are considered subjective indexes largely influenced by human factors. The ESR and CRP were observed to decline sharply to a certain low level after two weeks of treatment, indicating sensitivity towards anti-inflammatory drugs. The five indexes mentioned above are therefore considered less reliable for the prediction of responsiveness towards etanercept treatment in AS patients.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">Genetics and environment are two important factors to the pathogenesis of AS (Sieper &amp; Poddubnyy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). TNF blockers target to TNFα, which participates in complex inflammatory pathways. Therefore, in order to predict the response of TNF blocker precisely, we should take both genetic and environmental factors into consideration. In this article, we combined the data of IgG-Gal ratio, a typical intracellular environmental factor, and <italic>MYOM2</italic> (rs2294066) to predict the response of TNF blocker.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Glycan modification plays an important role in autoimmune diseases (Mesko et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>; Theodoratou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). In our previous studies, we have exploited a method to assess the alteration of serum IgG galactosylation, which has great stability and can detect the galactosylation level of each individual quantitatively (Ren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>), and thus we applied it here to explore the potential IgG glycan predictors for responsiveness to the TNF blocker in AS patients for the first time. In addition, ESR and CRP declined sharply to a certain low level after two-week treatment indicating that these two clinical indexes are largely influenced by anti-inflammatory drug, and thus they are not reliable biomarkers. However, The IgG-Gal ratio showed significant difference between responders and non-responders at any time point during the treatment which indicated that it was a stable biomarker.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Because patients with different genetic background should have different response to drugs and previous researches found pharmacogenomics was a good approach in predicting the response to the TNF blocker in immune rheumatism (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>; Salgado et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>; Billiet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Cuchacovich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). Therefore, we performed whole-exome sequencing to find associated SNPs. We found that SNP in MYOM2 was associated with response of TNF blocker and patients with T allele had higher <italic>MYOM2</italic> gene expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). It is a missense variant in coding region (Thr776Met) and had relatively high sensitivity in screening responders from AS patients. Previous studies have reported that over expression of EH-myomesin (<italic>MYOM2</italic> isoform) served as a biomarker for dilated cardiomyopathy and TNF-α was up-regulated during brief myocardial ischemia, or coronary occlusion (Zingarelli et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; Kimura et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). It indicated that MYOM2 might associated with the pharmacology of TNF blockers.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Therefore, we proposed a novel three-stage approach to combine genetic markers and post-translational modifications to predict precisely the response of the TNF blocker etanercept in AS patients. Briefly, when an AS patient is considered to be treated with TNF blocker, first we detect IgG-Gal ratio and if it is over 0.8 we advise him to be treated with TNF blocker for long-term. If it is below 0.8, we suggest him to be treated with TNF blocker for one time and IgG-Gal ratio will be detected again after two weeks. If ΔIgG-Gal ratio is below − 0.1, he can be treated with TNF blocker for long-term, or he should further be detected the genotype of <italic>MYOM2</italic> (rs2294066). If he carries CT/TT genotype he will be advised to change to another treatment. If he carries CC genotype, we suggest him to continue the treatment with TNF blocker.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The limitation of this study was that it only included the result from single medical center and the sample number is not very large. Therefore, in the future the result will be further validated in another medical center.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par34">In this study, in order to predict the response of TNF blocker more precisely, we combined genetic data with protein modification data. This was a pilot study, but it largely increased the power of prediction. We propose that it is a potential biomarker to combine different omics data in the future.</p>
