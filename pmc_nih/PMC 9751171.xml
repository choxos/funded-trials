                <p>Treatment fidelity is the use of methodological strategies to monitor and enhance reliability and validity of behavioral intervention trials. Despite availability of guidelines and checklists, treatment fidelity remains underreported, hindering evaluation, interpretation, and cross-study comparisons. Treatment fidelity is particularly important for music interventions given the inherent complexity of musical stimuli and flexibility required for tailored delivery. The purpose of this paper is to define and describe treatment fidelity strategies for our trial of a music-based play intervention for young children with cancer and parents grounded in the NIH Behavior Change Consortium Treatment Fidelity Recommendations. We report strategies for all 5 areas: study design, training providers, delivery of treatment, receipt of treatment, and enactment of treatment skills. We also discuss 4 challenges our team encountered, including: (1) standardizing live music delivery, (2) defining boundaries for tailored intervention delivery, (3) managing extended time between participants, and (4) minimizing risk for bias. This paper expands on current fidelity literature and may provide a working model for other investigators examining dyadic and/or active music interventions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Treatment fidelity is important to the design and conduct of rigorous clinical research. In 2004, the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) defined treatment fidelity as “. . .methodological strategies used to monitor and enhance the reliability and validity of behavioral interventions. [Treatment fidelity] also refers to the methodological practices used to ensure that a research study reliably and validly tests a clinical intervention.”<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These practices help to ensure that changes seen post-treatment can be attributed to the intervention under investigation rather than external factors and reduce the chances of Type I and II errors.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> To encourage uptake and use of these recommendations, consortium authors published a validated treatment fidelity checklist for use in trial design and evaluation,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> with an updated checklist<sup><xref rid="bibr2-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> published in 2011.</p>
              <p>Despite NIH BCC guidelines and checklist availability, treatment fidelity continues to be under-reported in published research.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr3-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Prior reviews indicate that publishing authors often report details about treatment delivery, while other areas such as treatment receipt and enactment are rarely reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition, there is inconsistent use of standardized NIH BCC treatment fidelity definitions and reporting categories, which contributes to these observed inconsistencies in reporting.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The resulting absence and inconsistency of reporting make evaluation, interpretation, and cross-study comparisons difficult.</p>
              <p>Treatment fidelity is especially important for music interventions given the inherent complexity of musical stimuli<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and flexibility required for delivery of tailored interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A scoping review of music intervention reporting quality revealed that only 20% of identified studies described strategies to ensure consistent treatment delivery across participants and providers—emphasizing the need for publications that detail selection and use of treatment fidelity strategies for music intervention trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> To date, there have been 3 publications detailing NIH BCC guideline implementation in music intervention trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-15347354221140491" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Implementation of the NIH BCC recommendations requires that investigative teams interpret, define, and select strategies that consider the unique context, attributes, and design features of their trial. As such, published manuscripts describing selection and implementation of specific fidelity strategies help other investigators increase rigor in their own trials.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this paper is to define and describe treatment fidelity strategies being used in our multisite randomized controlled trial of a music-based play intervention for young children with cancer and their parents (R01NR019190).

              <title>Overview of the BIO-MUSE Trial</title>
              <p>The Biologic Mechanisms and Dosing of Active Music Engagement (BIO-MUSE) trial is a 2-group single-blind randomized controlled trial examining the use of music play to manage distress and improve health outcomes in young children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and their parents (R01NR019190). Children and one parent (enrolled as dyads) are stratified and randomized in blocks of 4 to the Active Music Engagement (AME) intervention or Audio-Storybooks (ASB) attention control condition. Child/parent dyads are stratified by child age (preschoolers 3-5 years.; school-agers 6-8 years.), site (Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana; Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital, Chicago, Illinois; Children’s Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri), and ALL risk level (standard risk; high risk). Both the intervention and attention control conditions are standardized, and each group receives one 30-minute AME or ASB session during weekly outpatient clinic visits for the duration of the consolidation phase of ALL treatment (4 sessions for standard risk participants; 8 sessions for high-risk participants). The purpose of the BIO-MUSE trial is to examine biological mechanisms of effect and explore dose-response relationships of AME on child/parent stress during the consolidation phase of ALL treatment.</p>

                <title>Goal 2: Ensure Same Treatment Dose Within and Across Conditions</title>
                <p>Our BIO-MUSE protocol specifies condition frequency, duration, and schedule for participants in both conditions. Regardless of condition, children with standard risk ALL receive 4 weekly sessions during the consolidation phase of treatment, whereas children with high risk ALL receive 8 weekly sessions. The number of sessions is based on Children’s Oncology Group (COG) approved treatment protocols, which vary based on ALL risk level. The decision to see participants for the full duration of their treatment is grounded in ethical and practical considerations, including justice and non-maleficence. Providing support for the full treatment course for standard risk participants and for only half of the treatment course for high-risk participants would be inadequate and potentially harmful.</p>
                <p>The NIH BCC guidelines recommend equivalent dosage between study conditions. In previous AME trials, the AME and ASB conditions were delivered in an in-patient setting and had an equal duration (45 minutes, with 30 minutes of music or stories). The current trial takes place in the outpatient clinic setting. To accommodate clinic flow and patient needs we needed to limit session duration to 30 minutes or less. As such, total session duration for AME sessions is 30 minutes total (5 minutes collaborative goal setting; 20 minutes of music-play; 5 minutes educational content). Total session duration for ASB is 20 minutes (5 minutes set-up; 15 minutes audio-storybooks—the length of one storybook). Although total session length is not equivalent, the amount of audio-visual stimulation is similar across groups, with the additional 10 minutes in AME attributed to assessment and educational activities that are unique to that condition. In addition to in-person sessions, participants take home a music-play or audio-storybooks kit to encourage between-session use of the condition-related activities.</p>
                <p>We monitor dose (frequency, duration) through provider-completed field notes that include the session date, session begin/end times, and parent-reported kit use between sessions. Providers also audio- or video-record sessions which provides an external validity check for data reported in the provider field note. We also perform self and external quality assurance monitoring which are explained in greater detail below (see Area 2—Goal 2: Ensure Provider Skill Acquisition).</p>

Examples include training multiple music therapists and data collectors at each site to minimize the impact of absence/illness or staff turnover and providing paper copies of measures to data collectors in the event of technology failure. Our team also meets weekly to discuss ongoing participants and any issues with protocol implementation, which are then addressed with input from the principal investigator (PI), site PIs, and core project manager.</p>

                <p>Our providers and data collectors are trained on condition-specific protocols and SOPs during training sessions led by the PI and core project manager. Training session agendas, content, and protocols are standardized to ensure consistent training over the course of the trial. We have training manuals specific to each role including providers, site PIs, and data collectors. All team members receive the same 1 hour of core content including the study overview, theoretical framework, clinical overview of ALL treatment, responsibilities and communication, identification and reporting of adverse events, online database file management procedures, and strategies to minimize bias when discussing the study. Provider and data collector manuals also include standardized protocols for delivering study conditions or conducting data collection. Site PIs have additional SOP requirements for providing study oversight including Single IRB requirements, recruitment, informed consent, billing, and coordination of study activities. Total initial training time varies based on role (4 hours for data collectors; 6 hours for site PIs; 10 hours for providers). At the conclusion of training, we ask team members to complete evaluations to improve future training sessions.</p>

                <title>Goal 2: Ensure Provider Skill Acquisition</title>
                <p>Our providers are board-certified music therapists who have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in music therapy and experience working in pediatric medical settings. Our data collectors are hospital employees or research assistants in a variety of roles including clinical research assistants, nurse practitioners, and undergraduate students. We have position descriptions for all study-related roles, specifying minimum requirements for education, training, and experience, as well as competencies, responsibilities, and skills needed to fulfill the role. The position description establishes the minimum skills required and communicates expectations. All team members receive a role-specific position description at the start of their training and sign the position statement agreement after initial training is complete.</p>
                <p>Role-play is an essential feature of our training which helps to ensure skill acquisition. We also use self and external QA monitoring to establish whether team members are delivering essential elements of the study protocol with predetermined thresholds for initial and sustained protocol adherence. During QA monitoring, providers (and data collectors) listen to their audio-recorded sessions and fill out session-specific checklists listing essential content that should be delivered for a specified session. An external monitor also listens to sessions and completes the same session-specific checklist. The threshold for initial protocol adherence is &gt;80% of all QA items during the last session of a provider’s second AME participant, during the last session of a provider’s first ASB participant, or during the last session of a data collector’s first participant. We monitor 2 AME participants to establish initial adherence due to the increased complexity of AME sessions. External QA monitors schedule individual meetings to discuss any missed items or challenges observed during monitoring. If a provider or data collector does not meet the initial adherence threshold by the indicated timeline, self and external QA monitoring continues until the threshold of 80% or more of QA items has been met.</p>

                <p>Once providers and data collectors achieve the initial adherence threshold, we continue to engage in self and external QA procedures using a priori monitoring schedules to minimize drift. The schedule for sustained monitoring specifies completion of self and external monitoring for every fifth participant (or 60 days, whichever comes first). All sessions are audio-recorded to allow for unscheduled monitoring as needed. In addition, all providers and data collectors attend monthly role-specific meetings to discuss study progress, protocol implementation, and ongoing participants. Meetings are essential to communicating study updates, building a collaborative team environment, addressing common challenges, sharing solutions, and promoting protocol adherence over time.</p>

                <title>Goal 1: Control for Provider Differences</title>
                <p>We use several strategies to monitor and control for nonspecific treatment effects that may result from provider differences in terms of their perceived warmth or credibility. As described earlier, all provider sessions are audio- or video-recorded to facilitate QA monitoring. In addition to protocol adherence, external monitors also look at variations in provider delivery. When hiring study personnel, we look for providers with experience working with young children and parents in a hospital setting, and who demonstrate a supportive interaction style that embodies inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. In addition, we use the same providers across study conditions to help control for therapist attributes and conduct qualitative interviews with parents that include questions about their experience with the provider.</p>

                <p>BIO-MUSE providers use manualized intervention protocols and session-specific checklists during condition delivery. The session checklists contain suggested language for information delivery, reminders about specific intervention content, and a step-by-step guide to session flow. Checklists help ensure consistent and complete delivery of content identified as essential to each study condition. Differences within treatment are also monitored during self and external QA monitoring.</p>

The external QA monitor reviews any omissions and/or protocol deviations with providers on an individual basis.

This was done to help control for provider differences across conditions, but this also creates opportunities for contamination (ie, essential elements of intervention appearing in attention control sessions) and risk of providers introducing bias that favors the intervention. In addition to sustained and rigorous QA monitoring, our providers receive training on the theories and scientific rationale that informed the content, structure, and delivery of the intervention and attention control conditions. Provider training also includes scenarios where unintended bias might occur and how to address participant questions about the study or their assigned condition. For example, when describing our study, we share that we are interested in learning how play activities like stories and music might be helpful during cancer treatment—positioning AME and ASB as equal experiences.</p>
