                <p id="P1">Food allergy is a major public health problem for which there is no effective treatment. We examined the immunological changes that occurred in a group of children with significant cow’s milk allergy undergoing a novel and rapid high dose oral desensitization protocol enabled by treatment with omalizumab (anti-IgE mAb). Within a week of treatment, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response to milk was nearly eliminated, suggesting anergy in, or deletion of, milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Over the following three months while the subjects remained on high doses of daily oral milk, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response returned, characterized by a shift from IL-4 to IFN-γ production. Desensitization was also associated with reduction in milk-specific IgE and a 15-fold increase in milk-specific IgG4. These studies suggest that high dose oral allergen desensitization may be associated with deletion of allergen-specific T cells, without the apparent development of allergen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P2">Although allergen desensitization in patients allergic to environmental agents such as pollens, dust mite, or cat dander has been performed for more than 100 years <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, the precise immunological mechanisms of allergen desensitization remain controversial. The development of blocking IgG antibody was initially thought to play an important role in mediating the allergen desensitization and tolerance processes <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, other mechanisms such as immune suppression, mediated by allergen-specific adaptive regulatory T (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells, have received intense investigation as the cell type that accounts for the success of immunotherapy <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The development of allergen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells during desensitization with inhalant allergen or bee venom is consistent with the idea that tolerance induced with <italic>low</italic> antigen doses (microgram amounts), such as those used in subcutaneous desensitization protocols, is associated with the development of allergen-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P3">Protocols for <italic>oral</italic> allergen desensitization in patients with immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy are currently being developed, but little is known about the mechanisms of oral desensitization, during which high doses (gram amounts) of oral antigen are generally administered. In mouse models of oral tolerance, administration of high doses of oral antigen in naïve animals is associated with the development of anergy and deletion of antigen-specific T cells, whereas administration of low doses of oral antigen is associated with T<sub>Reg</sub> cell development <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. On the other hand, much less is known about the mechanisms of oral desensitization in the setting of <italic>established</italic> allergy in humans.</p>
              <p id="P4">In humans, the examination of the immunological mechanisms of oral desensitization for food allergy has been hampered by several problems. First, unpredictable allergic reactions in patients have resulted in desensitization courses that vary from months to years. In addition, food-specific T cells, which constitute a very small fraction (&lt;1%) of peripheral T cells, are difficult to study, and have been examined primarily via bulk population activation, or by cloning (or establishing cell lines), which typically involves several cycles of antigen stimulation with exogenous cytokines <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, although in some studies, peanut specific T cells were examined more directly using a dye dilution method <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, studies of oral food desensitization consistently demonstrate a decrease in allergen-specific IgE and an increase in allergen-specific IgG4, suggesting that oral desensitization induces allergen-specific immune deviation <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P5">To better understand the immunological changes that occur during oral food desensitization, we examined a small cohort of children with IgE-mediated milk allergy in a clinical trial of oral cow’s milk desensitization performed in combination with a 16-week course of omalizumab (anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies, Xolair). The oral desensitization protocol, which was the first to use omalizumab to limit allergic reactions, allowed patients to be rapidly (over a 7–11 week period of time) desensitized to high doses of milk with a uniform dosing schedule. The clinical findings of this study, showing that 10 of the 11 patients with significant milk allergy were desensitized, have been briefly described elsewhere <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Herein, we describe the dynamic milk-specific immunological changes that occurred in these patients, analyzed in several subgroups of patients, over the course of the oral milk desensitization protocol.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="P6">All subjects in the clinical trial began treatment with omalizumab at week 0, and started oral desensitization with milk at week 9 <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. 12 doses of milk were given on the first day of desensitization, increasing from 0.1 mg to 1,000 mg every 30 minutes (cumulative dose on the first day, 2,000 mg milk protein). The patients then continued on a daily dose of milk (1,000 mg/day), which increased every 7 days until a dose of 2,000 mg milk/day was achieved. At week 16, the omalizumab was discontinued, but patients remained on a daily dose (2,000 mg/day) of milk. At week 24, nine of the 10 patients remaining in the study passed a double blind food challenge and began taking &gt;8,000 mg of milk per day.</p>

                <title>Milk-induced CD4 T cell proliferation is reduced during rush desensitization</title>
                <p id="P7">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a subset of 5 patients were isolated at multiple time points during the desensitization protocol (weeks 0, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 30, 36 and 52), and frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen for later examination. To characterize the response to milk, PBMC from multiple time points for each patient were thawed, labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and cultured in the presence of milk proteins (MP) (or tetanus toxoid (TT)) for 7 days. In all patients examined, there was a vigorous proliferative response to milk proteins (and TT) at week 0, as demonstrated by flow cytometry, which showed a significant number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with low levels of CFSE, representing cells that underwent multiple cell divisions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) (mean milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells=7.75%; mean tetanus-specific cells=24.6%; mean, no antigen=0.62%). However, a striking decrease in milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was observed 1 week after initiation of desensitization in all 5 patients examined, which persisted as the daily dose of milk increased (during weeks 8 to 16) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1b and c</xref>). This effect was specific for the milk-induced response, and was not observed with the TT response. Importantly, the response to milk returned over the ensuing 3–4 months, while the subjects remained on daily oral milk. Although omalizumab treatment was stopped at week 16 and coincided with the increase in milk specific proliferation, there was no appreciable change in the tetanus toxoid response.</p>

                <title>Absence of functional milk specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells during the desensitization</title>
                <p id="P8">We examined possible mechanisms for the initial transient reduction in the milk-specific proliferative response. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for an increase in the number of milk-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells (CFSE<sup>low</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) in the cultures stimulated with milk proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Since T<sub>Reg</sub> cells may not proliferate, we also examined CFSE<sup>high</sup> (non-proliferating cells) and found no increase in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b and c</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that IL-10 secreting suppressive/regulatory T cells were not responsible for the reduced proliferation, since no increase in milk-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was observed in the presence of anti-IL-10 mAb (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Moreover, addition of anti-10 and anti-TGF-β (5 μg/ml) mAb together did not increase the milk-induced proliferative response at any time point, indicating that IL-10/TGF-β producing regulatory T cells were not responsible for the reduction in the response to milk (data for week 12, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Finally, we performed mixing experiments, in which purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells from PBMC collected at weeks 12 and 14, when the proliferative response was low, were cultured with PBMC from week 0. In these experiments, milk-induced proliferation was assessed by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation during the last 16 hours of a 6-day culture. Neither CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells nor CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> cells were able to reduce the week 0 PBMC response to milk (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Together, these results suggest that T<sub>reg</sub> cells were not involved in the reduction of the milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation observed during desensitization at weeks 10–14.</p>

                <title>Evidence for milk specific T cell anergy</title>
                <p id="P9">We next examined whether anergy, defined by lack of responsiveness to antigen that can be restored with IL-2 and associated with the absence of suppressive activity <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, could explain the reduced milk-specific T cell proliferative response. First, treatment of milk-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated at week 12 with IL-2 partially restored the proliferation of milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, although this increase only trended towards statistical significance (p=0.07) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, we found that during the initial desensitization period (weeks 10 and 16), the limited number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to milk expressed lower levels of CD25 (an activation antigen) compared to that at week 0 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>), suggesting that the milk-specific cells at these time points could not be fully activated. In contrast, milk-specific T cells from patient #3, who was only partially desensitized (reacted at the 1,000 mg dose during the double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at week 24), and who had less of a reduction in milk-induced proliferation at week 10 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>), had no reduction in CD25 expression at weeks 10 and 16 compared to week 0 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c and d</xref>). Moreover, in the one patient in whom PD-1, an antigen expressed by anergic or exhausted T cells <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, was examined (patient #5, who was successfully desensitized), we found that milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed a significant increase in PD-1 at weeks 10 and 16 (as well as reduced levels of CD25) compared to week 0 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). These results together suggest that anergy could, at least in part, explain the reduction of milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation observed after the rush desensitization phase.</p>

                <p id="P10">While the cytokine profile of the milk-specific CFSE<sup>low</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not change appreciably during the first 30 weeks, the ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 production of the milk-specific T cells increased substantially between weeks 36 and 52 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). This increase in the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio was observed in patients who passed the DBPCFC and were fully desensitized (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5b and c</xref>), but was delayed for patient #3 who was only partially desensitized (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). IL-13 production in the milk specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was examined in one patient (#5), and found to follow IL-4 production, in that the IFN-γ/IL-13 ratio increased after week 30 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). The increase in the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio in the milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells suggests that <italic>immune deviation</italic> developed late during the desensitization, consistent with the significant reduction in milk-specific IgE at weeks 36 and 52 observed in all 10 patients examined (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>), and by a 15 fold increase in milk-specific IgG4 seen after week 24 in all 10 patients (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>).</p>

                <title>Milk specific basophil activation is reduced by milk desensitization</title>
                <p id="P11">On enrollment, all 10 patients who completed the study had significant immediate skin reactivity to milk (week 0). However, by week 52 of the study, immediate skin prick test responses to cow’s milk were reduced compared week 0 in 9 of the 10 patients (p&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). In contrast, there was no statistically significant change in immediate skin testing to other allergens (cashew or egg) at week 52 compared to week 0, in the four patients who were skin tested to these other allergens (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P12">Similarly, in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we found that cow’s milk antigen, but not vehicle, activated peripheral blood basophils taken on enrollment (week 0), as demonstrated by an increase in basophil expression of CD203c and CD63 (basophil activation markers); in histamine release (p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>); and in phospho-Syk expression, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). However, treatment of the patients with omalizumab, beginning on week 0 and continuing through week16, greatly reduced milk-induced basophil activation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, weeks 8–16). Importantly, the reduction in milk-induced basophil activation persisted after omalizumab was discontinued (weeks 24–52), presumably reflecting a milk-desensitized state, and consistent with the reduction of milk-specific skin test reactivity at week 52 and reduced milk-specific IgE at weeks 36 and 52. The reduction in milk-induced basophil activation at weeks 24–52 was antigen specific, since egg and cashew antigens activated the basophils obtained at weeks 24–52, after discontinuation of omalizumab treatment, as demonstrated by increased antigen-induced expression of CD203c, CD63, increase in histamine release (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>); and increase in phospho-Syk expression (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The basophil response to egg and cashew at weeks 24–52 were not quite as robust as at week 0, but were clearly much greater than the very limited basophil responses observed at weeks 8–16, when the patients were being treated with omalizumab. These results together indicated that the mast cell compartment (i.e., mast cells in the skin and basophils in the peripheral blood) was greatly inhibited in an <underline>allergen-non-specific</underline> fashion during omalizumab treatment, and in an <underline>antigen-specific fashion</underline> after completion of the oral milk desensitization protocol.</p>

              <p id="P13">Food allergy is a major public health problem that has increased dramatically in prevalence in industrialized countries over the past 10 to 15 years <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Unfortunately for patients with food allergy, there is no effective treatment except to avoid the offending foods, and to have ready access to self-injectable epinephrine <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Recently however, several reports indicate that oral desensitization may be effective in patients with allergy to several different foods, including milk, egg, peanut and hazelnut <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The protocols for desensitization are diverse, and even with a given protocol, the pace at which the dose of allergen increases varies considerably between patients, due to unpredictable allergic reactions, which confounds the analysis of mechanisms that mediate oral desensitization. As a result, the mechanisms of oral desensitization in patients with food allergy are poorly understood.</p>
              <p id="P14">In this study, we examined the mechanisms of oral desensitization in a small group of children, who tolerated a novel, relatively rapid and uniform, presumably high dose oral desensitization protocol, enabled with omalizumab, which was used in this setting for the first time <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. After stopping omalizumab, 9 of the children added normal amounts of milk (&gt;8–12 g/day, equivalent to &gt;240–360 ml/day) to their diets 15 to 19 weeks after starting the oral desensitization, and the 10<sup>th</sup> child was able to consume 1–2 g of milk daily by week 52. Because enrollment in this study was restricted to children with high levels of serum milk-specific IgE (median milk-specific IgE 50 kU<sub>A</sub>/L, mean 98 kU<sub>A</sub>/L)), which are associated with milk allergy that is less likely to resolve <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, we believe that the immunological changes observed in these patients are highly significant.</p>
              <p id="P15">Using CFSE labeling of PBMC in our analysis, we focused on milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and found that prior to desensitization, the milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were T helper (Th)2-skewed, as expected <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, but that rapid high dose allergen administration greatly but temporarily decreased milk-induced, but not tetanus-induced, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation. Surprisingly, the acute reduction in milk-specific T cell proliferation in the patients examined was not associated with the development of allergen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells, nor was there evidence of suppression, as shown by coculture experiments. Moreover, the reduction in milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation that occurred during the rapid desensitization period could be partially reversed with the addition of IL-2 to the cultures. This suggested that high dose milk administration resulted initially in the development of milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell anergy and possibly deletion <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, although additional studies must be performed to fully understand the mechanisms of high dose oral desensitization, particularly because of the limited number of patients analyzed.</p>
              <p id="P16">Rapid reductions in allergen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses have been previously observed in beekeepers exposed to multiple bee stings due to the development of venom specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In these subjects, venom-specific IL-10-producing T<sub>Reg</sub> cells developed with repeated bee stings (average cumulative antigen dose over 7 months was &lt;1–4 mg). Similarly, subcutaneous immunotherapy with grass pollen and bee venom, in which the allergen doses are low, ranging from 4–100 μg/dose, as well as with cat allergen peptides, induced allergen-specific tolerance associated with the development of allergen-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells producing IL-10<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. There results are consistent with the idea that administration of low doses of antigen during immunotherapy induces allergen-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P17">In contrast, in our study of oral desensitization, we used much higher doses of antigen (gram amounts daily), and surprisingly, desensitization was not associated with IL-10 producing milk-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells. Furthermore, we failed to observe an increase in the number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, <italic>natural</italic> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells, which are thought to primarily prevent the development of autoimmunity <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that the frequency of <italic>natural</italic> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells increased after peanut oral immunotherapy <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, although this was not observed in other studies <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. It is possible that in our patients, milk-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells and/or <italic>natural</italic> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells were present only in the gastrointestinal tract, or could develop later, e.g., after 12–18 months of daily oral milk maintenance. Alternatively, it is possible that milk-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells develop only with low antigen exposure, e.g., induced by exposure to small amounts of milk, and prior to ingestion of full dietary quantities of milk <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P18">In our patients, after 4–6 months of daily high doses of oral milk, we found that a vigorous milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response returned, but still without evidence of milk-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells. This robust milk-specific T cell response, associated with increased production of IFN-γ, a 15 fold increase in milk-specific IgG4, as well as reduced milk-specific IgE, suggested that high dose oral desensitization evolved into a form of immune deviation. A similar Th1-like allergen-specific response was reported in peanut allergic individuals who had naturally outgrown their sensitivity <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and in milk-specific Peyer’s patch T cells from non-allergic individuals <sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. In those studies, like in our desensitized subjects, the presence of food-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells was also not observed, suggesting that high dose allergen-specific tolerance may not always be associated with allergen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cells. However, is possible that the milk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ that we observed may exert inhibitory activity on IgE-mediated milk-induced symptoms through unclear mechanisms <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, particularly since milk-specific IgE was still present after the desensitization in most of our patients. Alternatively, it is possible that milk-specific IgG4 ay play a very dominant role in inhibiting IgE-mediated symptoms and inflammation <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P19">Currently, all of our subjects have fully completed the 52 week study, and remain on daily oral milk to maintain their desensitized state. The patients continue to be followed, and over time it is possible that a more permanent tolerant state may develop, such that the capacity to tolerate milk may persist even after oral milk dosing is discontinued <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, perhaps indicating a clinical “cure” of the allergy. However, based on the experience with subcutaneous immunotherapy with inhalant allergens and bee venom, in which long-lived symptom control and allergen “tolerance” is achieved only after completing 3–5 years of “maintenance” therapy <sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, complete milk specific immunological “tolerance” may require several years of frequent milk exposure. On the other hand, because the antigen doses with oral desensitization are much greater than that of subcutaneous immunotherapy, it is possible that immunological tolerance might develop sooner with oral immunotherapy, as has been suggested <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P20">In summary, we examined milk-specific immune responses in a small number of patients who completed a novel, rapid and uniform high dose oral milk immunotherapy protocol enabled with omalizumab. Within a week of the initial rapid oral desensitization, we observed an acute and significant reduction of milk-specific T cell responses, without evidence of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>Reg</sub> cell development, suggesting the induction of anergy in, or deletion of, effector T cells. The reduced or anergic response was later replaced by a vigorous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response, characterized by a shift from IL-4 to greater IFN-γ production, and associated with reduced milk-specific IgE production, reduced milk-specific basophil degranulation, and increased milk-specific IgG4 production. Although our study included a very small number of patients, and requires replication and confirmation in a much larger patient population, the immunological changes observed in the desensitized patients were surprisingly uniform and statistically significant. These results suggest that rapid high dose oral desensitization induces allergen-specific immune deviation not associated with Foxp3<sup>+</sup> allergen-specific T<sub>Reg</sub> cells, reminiscent of allergen-specific immunity associated with the natural resolution of food allergy <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In addition, these results provide an improved understanding of high dose oral desensitization in humans, and could lead to better therapies and diagnostic methods for patients with food allergies.</p>

                <p id="P22">Patients were pre-treated with omalizumab for 9 weeks, allowing IgE to detach from FcεR1 on the surface of mast cells and bind to omalizumab, before starting the oral desensitization to cow’s milk <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. At week 9, the oral desensitization began with 0.1 mg of cow’s milk protein (dried nonfat powdered milk, Carnation Instant Milk, Nestle) mixed in water. There were 12 doses on the first day of desensitization (0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 1,000 mg) given every 30 minutes (cumulative dose 1,992 mg). One subject voluntarily discontinued the study after the 5<sup>th</sup> oral dose due to vomiting, later diagnosed as abdominal migraines. The day after the rush desensitization, patients returned to start the slower dose escalation, build-up phase, and received the highest dose of milk achieved on the previous day, up to 1,000 mg. Subjects received the same daily dose at home for the next 6 days. The subjects returned weekly for an increase in the oral dose (increase of 12.5%) until a daily oral dose of 2,000 mg was attained (over a period of 7–11 weeks). At week 16, omalizumab treatment was discontinued, while daily oral milk continued. Treatment with omalizumab was extended by 2–4 weeks in 2 of 10 remaining subjects, to allow the milk dose to increase to 2,000 mg. At week 24 (8 weeks after discontinuing the omalizumab), a DBPCFC to milk was conducted. The challenge consisted of 5 doses administered orally every 15 minutes: 500 mg, 750 mg, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg and 3,000 mg (cumulative dose 7,250 mg). 9 of the 10 remaining subjects passed the DBPCFC, and an open challenge of 4,000–8,000 mg (120 – 240 ml) of milk was given 2–16 h later.</p>

Data represent PD-1 expression (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) by milk-specific (CSFE<sup>low</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>) T cells. There was no difference in the expression of MHC class II (HLA-DR) or CTLA-4 at these time points compared to day 0.</p>

                <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Frozen PBMC, isolated from 5 milk allergic patients undergoing rush milk desensitization, were thawed and labeled with CFSE, and cultured in the presence of tetanus toxoid (TT) or milk proteins (MP) for 7 days. Cells were then collected, stained with anti-CD4 mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The number in each panel represents the fraction of total CD4<sup>+</sup> cells that are within the CFSE<sup>low</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> gate (antigen-specific proliferating cells) on day 0. Mean CD4<sup>+</sup> milk-specific proliferating cells=7.75%; mean CD4<sup>+</sup> tetanus specific cells=24.6%. Mean CD4<sup>+</sup> proliferating cells without antigen=0.62%.</p>

                <p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) CFSE-labeled PBMC isolated from 5 patients undergoing milk desensitization were cultured in the presence of milk (MP) for 7 days. Cells were then collected, stained with anti-CD4 mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>
                <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Frozen samples from multiple time points were thawed and cultured with or without anti-IL-10 mAb and milk proteins.

Results with and without anti-IL-10 mAb overlap, indicating an absence of IL-10 mediated suppression.</p>
                <p>(<bold>b</bold>) PBMC from week 12 were cultured with or without anti-IL-10, anti-TGF-β mAb or both and compared to baseline PBMC. Figures represent percentages of the milk-specific cell populations (CFSE<sup>low</sup>) within the CD4<sup>+</sup> gate. No increase in proliferation was observed with the mAbs, indicating an absence of IL-10 or TGF-β mediated suppression.</p>
