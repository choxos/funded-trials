                  <p>Is the effectiveness of mailed human papillomavirus self-sampling kits vs usual care (in-clinic screening reminders) on cervical cancer screening uptake modified by patient characteristics?</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this secondary analysis of randomized clinical trial data, mailed kits were associated with significantly increased screening vs usual care within all subgroups of age, race and ethnicity, screening history, and other sociodemographic and health characteristics. Relative effects were greater with longer vs shorter duration of underscreening.</p>

                  <p>Of 19 734 individuals (mean [SD] age, 50.1 [9.5] years; 14 129 [71.6%] White), 9843 were randomized to the intervention group, and 9891 were randomized to the control group. Screening uptake was 26.3% (2592 of 9843 individuals) in the intervention group vs 17.4% (1719 of 9891 individuals) in the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.43-1.60). Although absolute differences in uptake by group varied little by screening history, relative effects were greater with longer vs shorter time since last Papanicolaou test (no prior Papanicolaou test: RRs, 1.85-3.25; ≥10 years: RR, 2.78; 5-10 years: RRs, 1.69-1.86; &lt;5 years: RRs 1.29-1.37). Relative effects were greater in participants overdue (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.73-2.38) vs up-to-date with mammography (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.41-1.67), although absolute difference was greater in the up-to-date group. Differences by age were not significant, with RRs of 1.33 to 1.48 across 5-year age groups in participants 30 to 54, vs 1.60 (95% CI, 1.40-1.82) in participants 55 to 59 and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.56-2.01) in participants 60 to 64 years. Among those mailed kits, there were differences in kit use vs in-clinic screening by age, race, plan enrollment duration, underscreening duration, and colorectal cancer screening adherence.</p>

              <p>The 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force cervical cancer screening guidelines added primary human papillomavirus (HPV)–only screening as a recommended option for individuals aged 30 to 65 years.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> HPV testing is more sensitive than Papanicolaou testing for detecting cervical precancer,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and can be performed on self-collected or clinician-collected samples with comparable sensitivity.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> To increase screening adherence, US health care systems may consider outreach strategies that incorporate self-sampling. International population-based trials in Europe and Australia have consistently demonstrated that mailing self-sampling kits increases screening participation compared with clinic-based screening invitations.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple countries have incorporated HPV self-sampling options into their cervical cancer screening programs.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Home-Based Options to Make Cervical Cancer Screening Easy (HOME)<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> was the first trial to evaluate pragmatic effectiveness of a programmatic mailed HPV self-sampling kit outreach strategy in a US health care system. Mailing kits to underscreened individuals increased screening compared with usual care reminders and outreach.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, nearly three-quarters of individuals in the intervention group did not screen, and the increase in screening associated with the intervention was in the lower range of estimates from international trials,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> highlighting improvement opportunities. Limited data from international trials suggest potential differences in population subgroups that are best reached through HPV self-sampling.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> To inform US health care system implementation, the objective of this secondary data analysis was to identify patient characteristics that modify the mailed kit intervention’s effectiveness at increasing screening uptake.</p>

              <p>Briefly, HOME evaluated whether mailing kits to individuals overdue for cervical cancer screening increased screening uptake, detection, and treatment of cervical neoplasia compared with usual care. From February 25, 2014, to August 29, 2016, we used electronic medical record (EMR) data to identify individuals with female sex, aged 30 to 64 years, with an intact uterus, continuously enrolled at KPWA for 3 years and 5 months or more, and with no Papanicoloau test within 3 years and 5 months. Individuals were excluded if they were on a do-not-contact list for research, were pregnant, or had an “interpreter needed” flag. All eligible individuals were enrolled under a full waiver of consent 5 months after receiving an annual preventive services reminder letter indicating they were due or overdue for screening. Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to the intervention or control group. To meet sample size targets, control group participants were reassessed for eligibility and rerandomization 1 year after randomization. Control group participants received usual care outreach to attend Papanicoloau screening (described previously)<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and were not contacted by the study team. Intervention group participants received usual care plus a mailed HPV self-sampling kit with prepaid return mailer. Kit mailings included a research information sheet with a telephone number to opt out of having individual-level medical record data used for research. Letters recommended routine in-clinic Papanicolaou screening, regardless of kit use, because HPV testing on self-collected samples is not standard care in the US. HPV results were documented in the EMR, and participants’ primary care teams were responsible for communicating abnormal results and scheduling follow-up.</p>
              <p>Screening uptake was a prespecified secondary outcome in the original randomized clinical trial captured 6 or fewer months after randomization from EMR data and defined as follows: (1) in-clinic screening; (2) self-sampling HPV 16/18-positive; (3) self-sampling HPV-negative; or (4) self-sampling HPV-positive for non-HPV 16/18 types only or unsatisfactory, followed by in-clinic screening. Patient characteristics at randomization were also derived from EMR data: age, race and ethnicity (self-reported; categories were American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, other [those selecting other were further able to enter a free text description; institutional review board approval did not allow individual-level data for all participants, so to maintain consistency across all participants in categorization of race, no free text entries were reviewed or coded], and unknown), health plan enrollment duration, time since last Papanicolaou test stratified by health plan enrollment duration, US Census block median household income, travel time to primary care clinic,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> BMI, tobacco use, Charlson Comorbidity Index,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set–defined adherence to guideline-recommended mammography<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> (restricted to those aged 52-64 years) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> (restricted to those aged 51-64 years). Given documented racial and ethnic disparities in cervical cancer screening in the US,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> race and ethnicity were analyzed to identify potential differences in intervention effectiveness across groups.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>As prespecified in our analysis plan,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> we used intention-to-treat (ITT) log-binomial regression to estimate risk differences and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for associations between randomization group and screening, and evaluate patient-characteristic-by-randomization group interactions. CONSORT guidelines recommend reporting both absolute and relative effect sizes as complementary measures.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Relative and absolute intervention effect sizes may differ across patient subgroups with varying baseline outcome rates, and absolute differences may be particularly relevant for informing health care system decision-making. Each observation was treated separately in analysis according to group assignment, as per the ITT, with robust variance estimates used to account for within-participant correlation due to rerandomized participants contributing more than 1 observation period. Denominators for each group included all participants randomized, minus the small number who opted out of medical record review or were identified after randomization as ineligible. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
                <p>In posthoc analysis, we estimated screening uptake within the intervention group by modality (initiating screening by kit return vs in-clinic), and tested for patient-characteristic-by-modality interactions using χ<sup>2</sup> tests. We also tested for patient-characteristic-by-randomization group interactions for in-clinic screening (screening in-clinic in the intervention group vs screening in-clinic in the control group) using log-binomial regression and robust variance estimates. Analyses were conducted after the trial ended between March 2018 to May 2022 using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute).</p>

Across patient characteristics, nearly all stratum-specific RR and absolute risk differences showed clinically relevant and statistically significant increases in screening between groups (<xref rid="zoi221249t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The relative effect was modified by screening history, with greater RRs for longer vs shorter time since last Papanicolaou test (no prior Papanicolaou test, RRs, 1.85-3.25; ≥10 years prior, RR, 2.78; 5-10 years, RRs, 1.69-1.86; &lt;5 years, RRs, 1.29-1.37) (<italic>P</italic> for interaction ≤ .005 for all comparisons). Relative differences in intervention effect size are impacted by screening uptake in the control group, which ranged from 2.7% to 10.3% in participants with no prior screening to 27.0% to 29.0% in those with less than 5 years since last screen. Conversely, absolute differences varied little by screening history (no prior Papanicolaou test, absolute differences, 6.1%-8.7%; ≥10 years prior, 8.1%; 5-10 years, 9.0%-11.0%; &lt;5 years, 7.8%-10.6%).

                <p>Within the intervention group, 12.2% of participants (1201 of 9843 participants) initiated screening by kit and 14.4% (1419 of 9843 participants) did so in-clinic, corresponding to 45.8% (1201 of 2620 screenings) of intervention group screenings initiated by kit and 54.2% (1419 of 2620 screenings) initiated in-clinic. Screening modality differed by age, race, plan enrollment duration, time since last Papanicolaou test, and CRC screening adherence; all characteristic-by-modality interactions were significant, as shown in <xref rid="zoi221249t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Among screened participants, the proportion using kits was higher in older vs younger age groups. More than half of screened participants aged 50 to 64 years used a kit (ranging from 219 of 436-290 of 534 [50.2%-54.3%] across 5-year age groups), compared with slightly more than one-third of screened participants aged 30 to 44 years (70 of 210-99 of 263 [33.3%-37.6%]). Additionally, differences across racial groups were seen in proportion of screened participants who used kits (12 of 28 [42.9%] in American Indian/Alaska Native, 99 of 247 [40.1%] in Asian, 47 of 120 [39.2%] in Black/African American, 8 of 33 [24.2%] in Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, and 950 of 1996 [47.6%] in White participants). The proportion using kits was similar among Hispanic (59 of 132 [44.7%]) and non-Hispanic (1116 of 2425 [46.0%]) participants. Screening by kit was also more common among participants enrolled in KPWA for 10 or more years (622 of 1267 [49.1%] of screened participants) vs 3.4 to less than 5 years (254 of 562 [45.2%]) or 5 to less than 10 (325 of 791 [41.1%]) years. There were also differences by time since last Papanicolaou test. The proportion screened by kit was greatest for individuals with longer time since last screen (≥10 years; 42 of 62 [67.7%]) and with no prior screening documented (150 of 293 to 49 of 62 [51.2%-79.0%]), intermediate among those with 5 to less than 10 years since last screen (55 of 123 to 157 of 276 [44.7%-56.9%]), and lowest among those with last screen less than 5 years prior (195 of 534 to 374 of 867 [36.5%-43.1%]). The proportion of screened participants using kits was higher among participants up-to-date vs not up-to-date with CRC screening (452 of 824 [54.9%] vs 262 of 532 [49.2%]), whereas the reverse was observed among participants up-to-date vs not up-to-date with mammography (452 of 874 [51.7%] vs 230 of 403 [57.1%]).</p>

              <p>In this secondary analysis of randomized clinical trial data, mailing unsolicited HPV kits to underscreened individuals increased screening compared with usual care within all subgroups evaluated. Cervical cancer screening history and mammography adherence were the only patient characteristics that modified the intervention effect. Overall, the majority of intervention group participants remained unscreened. Within the intervention group, the proportion of screened participants choosing kits vs in-clinic screening differed by several patient characteristics, highlighting opportunities to optimize self-sampling for priority groups.</p>
              <p>Although screening uptake in the mailed kit group (26.3%) was similar to screening uptake in underscreened individuals in a meta-analysis of international trials (25%),<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> the proportion of HOME intervention group participants who screened by kit vs in-clinic was smaller, and differences in screening between groups was in the lower range of estimates from international trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Thus, we sought to identify patient characteristics that modified the intervention effect or were differentially associated with kit uptake. The intervention effect was modified by cervical cancer screening history. Relative increases in screening were greater with longer vs shorter time since last screen, and greatest in individuals with no prior screening. In the intervention group, choice of screening modality varied by screening history. Individuals without prior screening were most likely to screen by kit vs in-clinic, followed by those with longer vs shorter time since last screening. International trials (with population-based registries to document screening history) demonstrated that mailing kits to long-term nonattenders increases screening participation,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and some<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> but not all<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> showed larger relative effects with longer vs shorter nonattendance duration. However, relative differences in intervention effect size are impacted by screening uptake in the control group, which in HOME ranged from 3% to 10% in participants with no prior screening to 27% to 29% in those overdue by less than 2 years. Of note, absolute differences in screening by randomization group varied little by screening history. It is unsurprising that we observed differences in underlying screening uptake and modality in the US vs other international settings, because (1) the US lacks centralized national cancer screening programs, and (2) there are different implementation challenges and opportunities for HPV self-sampling.</p>
              <p>Cervical, breast, and CRC underscreening are associated and share common correlates.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We found that mailed kits were effective at increasing cervical screening uptake in difficult-to-reach individuals who were also overdue for other recommended cancer screening. Relative intervention effect was greater in those overdue vs up-to-date with mammography, and there was a similar but nonsignificant difference by CRC screening adherence. Importantly, however, absolute differences in cervical screening uptake between groups were smaller for participants overdue for these other cancer screenings vs up-to-date. Results highlight the need for multipronged interventions to reduce cervical cancer underscreening in difficult-to-reach individuals, and potential opportunities for interventions targeting multiple care gaps (eg, with guideline-approved CRC self-screening options,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> interventions promoting home-based screening for both cervical and CRC cancer could be beneficial). We previously evaluated whether the HOME intervention impacted subsequent receipt of other recommended screening. Although the intervention had no impact on mammography or CRC screening compared with usual care, intervention group participants who completed a kit were more likely to receive mammography or CRC screening than those who remained unscreened for cervical cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We also saw a difference in intervention effect by age, with the largest relative and absolute increases in screening in the oldest groups, although the differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, compared with younger participants, older participants who were mailed kits were also significantly more likely to screen by kit vs in-clinic. US population-level<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and KPWA<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> data show that among individuals aged 30 to 65 years, cervical cancer screening adherence declines with increasing age.

Within the intervention group, however, differences were seen. Kit uptake was highest in White participants and lowest in Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native participants. Additionally, the proportion of screened participants who returned kits ranged from a low of 24.2% in Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander participants to a high of 47.6% in White participants. Results suggest opportunities to increase self-sampling uptake in racial and ethnic subgroups by tailoring outreach strategies and/or kit components. Other studies reported differences in acceptance or uptake of self-sampling by race or ethnicity.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> There is also heterogeneity within racial and ethnic groups that we were unable to evaluate, but that may contribute to differences in screening rates and intervention effectiveness. Additionally, lower cervical cancer screening rates have been associated with limited English proficiency (in majority English-speaking countries) and recent immigrant status.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> HOME excluded individuals who require a language interpreter (kit materials were in English only), precluding comparisons between those with and without limited English proficiency. In addition, we did not have data on country of birth (and the language restriction likely would have excluded most recent immigrants).</p>
              <p>Intervention effectiveness did not differ by BMI, tobacco use, or comorbidities, and among those mailed kits, no significant differences in kit vs in-clinic screening uptake were observed by these patient characteristics. Higher BMI,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> tobacco use,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and comorbidities<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> are associated with underscreening, yet our results suggest HPV self-sampling can effectively increase screening participation in patients with these characteristics. Additionally, results did not vary by clinic travel time (with the caveat that most participants lived in urban settings).</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>A strength of this study is the pragmatic trial design,<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221249r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> including integration of the intervention into existing clinical protocols. Furthermore, to reduce participation bias and enhance generalizability, we enrolled all individuals identified as eligible through EMR data under a waiver of consent. Only 1.2% of intervention group participants opted out of medical record review and were excluded from this analysis of patient characteristic modifiers.</p>
                <p>Mailing HPV kits through a research study rather than as standard care may have positively or negatively impacted screening uptake, and impacts may have been differential by patient characteristics. Additionally, the recommendation to attend in-clinic screening even after a negative self-sampling result may have negatively impacted screening uptake, with potential for differential impacts by patient characteristics. In addition to English language proficiency and country of birth, we were also unable to evaluate household income and education level due to limitations of EMR data. We used geocoded US Census tract household income, which has limitations as a proxy for individual-level household income.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> Additionally, there is potential for misclassification of patient characteristics derived from EMR data, especially race and ethnicity.<sup><xref rid="zoi221249r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Within a US health care system, a mailed HPV kit intervention was associated with an 8.9% increase in screening compared with usual care, with clinically important increases observed across all sociodemographic and health characteristics evaluated. Although we identified some patient characteristics that modified intervention effectiveness, there were notable differences when comparing relative vs absolute effects. Absolute effects may be particularly relevant for health care system decision making around how to allocate resources for maximal impact on screening rates and cervical cancer prevention in high-risk groups. We also noticed differences in kit use by several patient characteristics, highlighting opportunities to optimize HPV self-sampling for priority subgroups. Most individuals in the intervention group remained underscreened, and uptake was particularly low (≤10%) in patient subgroups defined by long duration of cervical cancer underscreening, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander or American Indian/Alaska Native race, and nonadherence to breast or CRC screening. Tailored interventions to reduce cervical cancer underscreening in these priority populations are needed.</p>
