                  <p id="P2">This study examined changes in appetite in a subsample of 113 adults with obesity (76.1% female, 55.8% white, BMI = 38.8±4.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who participated in a 52-week trial. Participants were randomized to intensive behavioral therapy alone (IBT-alone), IBT with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day (IBT-liraglutide), or IBT-liraglutide combined with a 12-week meal replacement diet (Multi-component). Participants rated their hunger, fullness after meals, liking of meals, and food preoccupation (all as experienced over the past week) using visual analogue scales (0-100 mm).

                  <p id="P3">At week 52, participants treated by IBT-alone lost 6.2±1.6% of baseline weight, compared with 11.8±1.6% and 12.1±1.5% in the IBT-liraglutide and Multi-component groups, respectively. Compared to IBT-alone, IBT-liraglutide participants reported larger reductions at week 6 in hunger (−0.3±4.2 vs −16.8±4.0 mm, p=.005) and food preoccupation (+0.2±3.7 vs −16.3±3.6 mm, p=.002) and larger increases in fullness (−5.1±3.2 vs +9.8±3.0 mm, p=.001). These significant differences persisted at all assessments through week 24. There were no differences between IBT-alone and IBT-liraglutide in meal liking. IBT-alone and Multi-component participants differed in hunger at week 6, and in food preoccupation at all assessments through week 24. Multi-component participants reported reduced liking of meals relative to the IBT-alone and IBT-liraglutide groups through weeks 40 and 52, respectively.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Patients with obesity achieve larger mean weight losses when behavioral treatment and medication for chronic weight management are combined, relative to the weight loss achieved with either treatment alone (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In a representative 1-year randomized trial (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), patients treated with sibutramine (15mg/d) alone lost 5.0±7.4 kg, those who received behavioral treatment alone lost 6.7±7.9 kg, and those who received the two interventions combined lost 12.1±9.8 kg. The additive benefits of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for obesity have been attributed to their complementary mechanisms of action (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Behavioral weight loss treatment helps patients modify or control the external food environment through techniques such as avoiding cues to eat, reducing portion sizes, and recording food and calorie intake. Centrally-acting pharmacologic agents for obesity, by contrast, are thought to modify patients’ internal environment by decreasing hunger, increasing satiation and satiety, and improving other aspects of appetite. These internal changes likely facilitate adherence to dietary goals, including by reducing patients’ responsiveness or vulnerability to the food environment (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P6">Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is one of five medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. In a meta-analysis, liraglutide 3.0 mg produced an average placebo-subtracted weight loss of 5.3 kg at 1 year (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Liraglutide appears to induce weight loss through its activation of GLP-1 receptors in brain areas associated with appetite and food reward (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Several short-term laboratory studies have shown that, compared to placebo, liraglutide increased fullness (3 studies) and decreased hunger (2 of 3 studies) after an energy-fixed preload (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These changes were associated with a 12 to 27% relative reduction in energy intake during a subsequent test meal, but not with differences in perceived palatability of the meal (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In two short-term treatment studies (4 and 5 weeks), post-treatment hunger was lower with liraglutide than with placebo (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). One of these studies also found relative improvements in post-prandial fullness (i.e., “how full do you feel”) and satiety (i.e., “how satisfied do you feel”) and lower energy intake during a test meal (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), but the other did not (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). An additional short-term study measured appetite sensations and ad libitum food intake during an inpatient stay following 12 weeks of treatment with a related GLP-1 agonist, semaglutide 1.0 mg, or with placebo. Participants reported improved hunger, fullness, and satiety and consumed 24% fewer calories over 12 hours with semaglutide, as compared to placebo (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Palatability ratings did not differ during laboratory test meals, but past week ratings of liking of food were lower with semaglutide than placebo (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P7">These laboratory-based and short-term treatment studies support the theory that adding liraglutide 3.0 mg to behavioral treatment would enhance weight loss by improving aspects of appetite control. However, little is known about whether these changes persist beyond the first few weeks or months. On average, patients treated with weight loss medications regain some of their lost weight after approximately 1 year, despite their remaining on medication and despite maintaining substantially larger weight losses than participants assigned to placebo (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Studying the duration of the effects of obesity medications on appetite may improve our understanding of the long-term benefits of these drugs.</p>
              <p id="P8">The present study evaluated the short- and long-term effects of liraglutide 3.0 mg on changes in hunger, fullness after meals, food preoccupation, the frequency of food cravings, and liking of meals during a 52-week, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the efficacy of three treatment conditions: intensive behavioral therapy (IBT) as developed for delivery in primary care settings (IBT-alone); the same IBT program combined with liraglutide 3.0 mg/d (IBT-liraglutide); and IBT-liraglutide combined (for 12 weeks) with a portion-controlled diet that provided 1000-1200 kcal/d (Multi-component). We hypothesized that the IBT-liraglutide group would report greater improvements, beginning at week 6, in hunger, fullness after meals, food preoccupation, and craving frequency, than would the IBT-alone group, and that these differences would be maintained through weeks 24 and 52. We hypothesized that the two groups would not differ in liking of meals at any time point. We did not propose pre-specified hypotheses regarding the Multi-component group due to the unknown effect of the portion-controlled diet on liraglutide’s appetite-control properties; comparisons with this group were considered exploratory.</p>

                <p id="P9">The study’s methods and primary results have been reported previously (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Briefly, participants were aged 21-70 years, had a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 and ≤ 55 kg/m², and had no serious medical or psychological conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, recent cardiovascular disease, current major depressive disorder) or contraindications to the use of liraglutide (e.g., personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome). All participants provided written informed consent, and study procedures were approved by the university’s institutional review board. After completing an initial phone screen and a behavioral and medical assessment to determine eligibility, participants were assigned in equal numbers to the three intervention groups.</p>
                <p id="P10">Collection of appetite measures was initiated after the first cohort of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 37) had been enrolled in the study. Thus, findings reported here are limited to a subsample of 113 of the total sample of 150 participants who enrolled in the 52-week RCT.</p>

                <p id="P11">During the 52-week treatment program, participants in all three groups received 21 brief (15 minute), individual sessions of IBT adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program protocol (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Participants were prescribed a calorie goal of 1200-1499 kcal/d for those &lt;113.6 kg (250 lb) or 1500-1800 kcal/d for those ≥113.6 kg. They were instructed to gradually increase their physical activity to ≥225 minutes per week and were provided behavior change strategies to facilitate their adherence to these goals. Sessions followed the treatment schedule recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (i.e., weekly for 4 sessions, every-other-week for 10 sessions, every 4 weeks for 7 sessions) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and were delivered by a physician, nurse practitioner, or registered dietitian in an academic medical setting. Patients were offered all 21 sessions, regardless of whether they met the CMS eligibility criterion of losing ≥3 kg at month 6, needed to receive 6 additional monthly sessions. All participants also had seven brief medical visits to measure vital signs and review any health concerns.</p>

                <p id="P15">At nine of the treatment visits (i.e., weeks 1, 4, 6, 10, 16, 20, 24, 40, and 52), participants completed visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of appetite in reference to how they had felt in the past week. The greater frequency of ratings during the first 24 weeks was intended to capture the timing of early changes in appetite. Hunger, fullness after meals, food preoccupation, craving frequency, and liking of meals were measured using 100-mm VAS line ratings (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which were administered electronically via a tablet. Sample items included “how hungry did you feel over the past week?” and “how much did you think about wanting to eat over the past week?” VAS ratings of appetite have been shown to change in the expected directions following food consumption (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), to correlate with energy intake and weight change (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and to have good convergent validity with full-scale measures of appetite (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A previous study instructed participants to complete daily VAS appetite ratings prospectively, at home, for several days (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Then, at a clinic visit, they completed the same VAS items in reference to how their appetite had been in the past week. The retrospective past-week rating of each appetite construct correlated strongly with its average prospective daily rating during the same period (<italic>r</italic>s .63-.80), and the mean weekly and daily ratings were within 3.3 to 7.2 mm of each other. Further, the past-week VAS ratings were more strongly correlated with the mean of the daily ratings than they were with either the ratings from the most recent day or with the highest daily rating. This finding suggested that past-week appetite ratings most strongly reflect participants’ appetite across the week as a whole, rather than their most recent or most salient appetite sensations. Short-term test-retest reliability for the weekly ratings was generally very high (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P23">We conducted an additional exploratory analysis to examine whether the lack of statistical differences between groups in changes in appetite at week 52 could be attributed to some participants having discontinued the medication prior to that time. In the two medication conditions, liraglutide was dispensed to participants on an average of 11.6 of 13 occasions (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.2, median = 13.0); 79.2% of liraglutide-treated participants received medication at the last distribution at week 48.

In this subset of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 97), the overall patterns of change in the appetite measures in the medication groups were similar to the results described above. There were no significant differences between IBT-alone and either liraglutide-treated group in changes in appetite ratings at week 52.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P24">This study’s principal finding was that the addition of liraglutide 3.0 mg to IBT produced larger initial improvements in hunger, fullness after meals, and food preoccupation than IBT alone. These findings are consistent with the results of previous short-term studies (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and suggest that improved appetite control is one of the mechanisms by which liraglutide increases initial weight loss. Differences between IBT-liraglutide and IBT-alone on these three dimensions of appetite persisted through week 24. As expected, IBT-liraglutide and IBT-alone participants did not differ significantly in their reported liking of their meals, which increased slightly in both groups over the course of the 52-week trial. Previous studies have not found differences in palatability ratings of a laboratory test meal between participants who received liraglutide or placebo, despite lower intake in liraglutide-treated participants (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P25">Changes in craving frequency did not differ between IBT-liraglutide and IBT-alone at any time. Previous studies of the effect of liraglutide on appetite did not measure craving frequency. However, one short-term study of semaglutide 1.0 mg did find a greater reduction in cravings relative to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P26">Across all appetite measures, the relative benefit of liraglutide declined over time, and changes in appetite with IBT-liraglutide were not statistically different from IBT-alone for any measure at week 40 or 52. This pattern does not appear to be attributable to liraglutide-treated participants discontinuing the medication, because excluding participants who did not receive medication at the end of the study did not alter the results. Hunger and desire to eat have been shown to increase following initial weight loss, possibly due to changes in circulating levels of hormones involved in appetite regulation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P27">Studies in rodents (e.g., 25) and two human trials (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) have shown that the effects of long-acting GLP-1 agonists on gastric emptying, which influences perceived hunger and fullness, diminish over time. In a 16-week treatment study, Halawi and colleagues (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) found that there was a large delay in gastric emptying at week 5 with liraglutide 3.0 mg relative to placebo. At week 16, the rate of gastric emptying in liraglutide-treated participants had increased significantly relative to week 5, although these participants still had a slower gastric emptying at week 16 than the placebo group. Tachyphylaxis of the gastric emptying response has been hypothesized to reflect the continual activation of GLP-1 receptors by these agonists, leading to tolerance (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This same mechanism may reduce the effect of GLP-1 agonists, like liraglutide, on perceived hunger and satiation, such that participants no longer experience notable appetite control after approximately 24 weeks of treatment, the time at which weight loss also typically starts to slow or plateau. However, we are not able to determine from the present data whether potential decreases in the gastric effects of liraglutide contributed to the apparent erosion of appetite control over time. Other potential mechanisms, including changes in the medication’s central effects or alterations in circulating levels of appetitive hormones with sustained weight loss also could have influenced perceived appetite.</p>
              <p id="P28">We note, however, that IBT-liraglutide did significantly increase weight loss relative to IBT-alone at week 52 by 5.6 percentage points (losses of 11.8% and 6.2%, respectively). In addition, at week 52, participants in both liraglutide-treated groups continued to report small reductions in hunger and food preoccupation and small increases in fullness relative to their baseline ratings. Even though some participants may report after the first 6 months that the medication is “no longer working,” based on perceptions of diminished appetite control, the rapid weight regain that occurs following termination of liraglutide (and other medications) provides eloquent testimony that the drug continues to have an effect on weight control (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Long-term studies suggest that the majority of the initial weight lost with liraglutide is maintained for up to 3 years when patients remain on medication (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The favorable effects of liraglutide on body weight thus are likely attributable to multiple mechanisms, in addition to its effects on gastric emptying and perceived appetite control.</p>
              <p id="P29">In the Multi-component group, improvements relative to IBT-alone in hunger and fullness after meals were more modest in size than with IBT-liraglutide. Multi-component participants only differed from IBT-alone in changes in hunger at weeks 4 and 6. The smaller relative improvements in hunger and fullness in the Multicomponent participants may be attributable to the lower calorie prescription in this group during the 12-week meal replacement diet. Multi-component participants were prescribed 1000 to 1200 kcal/d, compared with 1200 to 1800 kcal/d (based on body weight) in the other two treatment groups.</p>
              <p id="P30">Similar to IBT-liraglutide, however, the Multi-component group differed from IBT-alone in food preoccupation through week 24. Lower food preoccupation could be attributed to the effect of the medication in both groups. However, meal replacement diets also have been shown to reduce food preoccupation, likely by providing a structure that lessens participants’ need to make eating-related decisions (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P31">The most notable difference between the Multi-component group and the other groups was in liking of meals. There was a clear drop in liking during the meal replacement diet that was not reported by the treatment groups that were instructed to consume a low-calorie diet of conventional foods of their choosing.</p>
              <p id="P32">This study had several strengths, including the measurement of multiple aspects of appetite at regular intervals over the 52-week study. No previous studies, to our knowledge, have reported the effects of liraglutide on appetite beyond the initial weeks of treatment. A major limitation, however, of our study concerns the absence of a placebo-control (i.e., IBT combined with placebo or liraglutide in a double-blind fashion). Although our results are consistent with short-term placebo-controlled studies, we cannot rule out the possibility that participants’ attributions about the study medication contributed to their reports of perceived changes in appetite. (We note, however, that improvements were not reported for all appetite variables, i.e., cravings, and the improvements were not sustained at 1 year.)</p>
              <p id="P33">Recall bias also could have influenced the accuracy of participants’ appetite ratings in the present study. The study could be repeated using prospective appetite ratings, as well as ecological momentary assessment to capture participants’ appetite in real time. The study findings also would be strengthened by the inclusion of physiological and behavioral measures of appetite, in addition to the subjective ratings used, and by including measures of other potential mechanisms of action such as the rewarding value of food. The inclusion of measures of gastric emptying or circulating neuropeptides could help to elucidate the mechanisms by which the subjective appetitive benefits of liraglutide decline after 24 weeks.</p>
              <p id="P34">In conclusion, the addition of liraglutide to IBT improved hunger, fullness after meals, and food preoccupation for approximately 24 weeks, but did not affect perceived liking of meals relative to participants treated with IBT alone. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms by which liraglutide helps participants maintain lost weight at 52 weeks and beyond, despite the apparent attenuation of its subjective effect on appetite.</p>
