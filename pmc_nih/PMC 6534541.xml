Schistosomiasis treatment induces a profound reduction of HIV entry into cervical and blood CD4+ T cells that is sustained for up to two months, despite transient systemic and mucosal immune activation and elevated genital IL-1α levels. Genital IFN-α2a levels are also elevated post-treatment, and IFN-α2a blocks HIV entry into primary CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Transcriptomic analysis of blood mononuclear cells post-<italic>Sm</italic> treatment shows IFN-I pathway up-regulation and partial reversal of <italic>Sm-</italic>dysregulated interferon signaling. These findings indicate that <italic>Sm</italic> therapy may reduce HIV susceptibility for women with <italic>Sm</italic> infection, potentially through de-repression of IFN-I pathways.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The helminth <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (<italic>Sm</italic>) causes intestinal schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects an estimated 54 million people in sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, despite the recent expansion of mass treatment programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>Sm</italic> inhabits the gastrointestinal vasculature of the human host and has a complex life cycle that consists of infection after contact with fresh water containing infectious cercariae, worm migration to the mesenteric microvasculature, and subsequent passage of parasite eggs into the gut lumen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although adult schistosomes themselves suppress immunity by modulating immune system components, including T helper (Th)1 and interferon signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, their eggs induce inflammation that damages the gut mucosa and surrounding tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, egg deposition induces a strong Th2 response that can cross-regulate Th1 responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These divergent effects of <italic>Sm</italic> infection are thought to impair host immune defenses against other pathogens, and may enhance susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The strongest epidemiological signal for the latter is seen in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, although not in all cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, large cohort studies in <italic>Sm</italic>-endemic Uganda demonstrated lower HIV infection risk in people with a history of schistosomiasis treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. While one potential mechanism for enhanced HIV susceptibility is the impairment of systemic antiviral defenses by helminthic immunomodulation, it is also plausible that <italic>Sm</italic> egg-induced inflammation of the gut mucosa activates common mucosal homing pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> with enhanced CD4+ T cell trafficking to genital sites of HIV exposure through expression of the mucosa-homing integrin α4β7. Indeed, higher levels of this integrin on blood CD4+ T cells have recently been associated with increased HIV acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and may directly enhance cellular HIV susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Therefore, to test the hypothesis that <italic>Sm</italic> treatment of infected women would reduce genital HIV susceptibility we performed a prospective clinical study in a region of Uganda with a very high prevalence of schistosomiasis. We demonstrate that <italic>Sm</italic> clearance substantially reduces cervical CD4+ T cell susceptibility, and boosts both mucosal and systemic IFN-I antiviral responses. These findings help to elucidate the impact of <italic>Sm</italic> infection and its treatment on antiviral immunity and HIV acquisition, and may point the way to novel strategies to reduce HIV transmission in the region.</p>

Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>Sm</italic> treatment might have reduced cellular HIV entry through down-regulation of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 and/or reduced immune activation. Predefined secondary endpoints therefore included the expression on cervical and blood CD4+ T cells of the HIV co-receptor CCR5, the immune activation markers HLA-DR/CD38, and CD69. Unexpectedly, CCR5 expression on cervix-derived CD4+ T cells tended to increase after <italic>Sm</italic> treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.054), and CD38/HLA-DR expression increased significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).

The Kato-Katz+ subset demonstrated a higher level of post-treatment CD4+ T cell activation (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and treatment-mediated increases in CD69 expression correlated with both baseline egg shedding (<italic>R</italic> = 0.675, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016) and CCA intensity (<italic>p</italic> = 0.034) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">To further explore the effects of <italic>Sm</italic> treatment on inflammation and immune activation, we quantified a pre-defined panel of mucosal and blood cytokines (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Genital inflammatory cytokine levels tended to increase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>), consistent with the treatment-induced cervical CD4+ T cell activation, and genital interleukin (IL)−1α levels were significantly elevated one month post-therapy in <italic>Sm</italic> PCR/serology+ (fold change = 1.71, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and Kato-Katz+ (fold change = 1.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028) individuals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>).

Overall, the impact of <italic>Sm</italic> therapy on cytokine levels was quite distinct in the blood and genital tract, likely reflecting compartmentalized differences in the timing and nature of treatment-induced immunological responses. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the clear reduction in cervical CD4+ T cell HIV entry that had been induced by praziquantel treatment was accompanied by a transient increase in mucosal immune activation, both at the cellular and tissue level, that directly correlated with the pre-treatment helminth burden.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Genital and systemic cytokines before and after <italic>Sm</italic> treatment and IFN-α effects on cellular HIV entry. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>f</bold> Genital (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) and blood (<bold>d</bold>–<bold>f</bold>) cytokine level changes represented as the geometric mean of fold change of each cytokine at post-treatment visit (V2 or V3) over pre-treatment level in: (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>d</bold>) CCA + , (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>e</bold>) <italic>S. mansoni</italic> PCR/serology+ and (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) Kato-Katz+ participants.

                <p id="Par14">To further explore the hypothesis that <italic>Sm</italic> therapy resulted in a global IFN-I induction, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from three participants before and after <italic>Sm</italic> treatment, who were randomly selected from the subset of Kato-Katz+ participants who had cleared their <italic>Sm</italic> infection at both one- and two-months post-therapy. The timing of sample collection for these participants was 27–33 days and 54–55 days at V2 and V3, respectively. One of these individuals tested positive for HSV-2 and BV; no other co-infections were detected in these participants (see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). To reduce the potential impact of inter-individual variation, we employed a novel computational approach, and performed a paired intra-individual analysis, which enhanced our statistical power despite a relatively small sample size of nine samples. RNA-seq analysis revealed that, compared to baseline, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) one month after treatment was approximately double that seen after two months, with 18.7% DEG overlap (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>), in keeping with the more substantial early post-treatment cellular and cytokine changes. IFN-I signaling was identified among the top 10 enriched pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) and there was post-treatment up-regulation of genes involved in antiviral immunity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), including signal transducer and activator of transcription (<italic>STAT</italic>)-<italic>1</italic>, <italic>IL-22</italic>, <italic>IL-24</italic> and interferon-induced transmembrane protein (<italic>IFITM</italic>)<italic>−1</italic>, a cell membrane-associated inhibitor of CCR5-tropic HIV entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Using the interferome database we then assessed whether the DEGs associated with <italic>Sm</italic> treatment were enriched for IFN and IFN-I regulated genes (IRG and IRG-I, respectively). One-month post-treatment DEGs were enriched for both IRG (28%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and IRG-I (17%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013), while the two-month visit was not enriched for either IRG (24%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.579) or IRG-I (13%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.747) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), consistent with early elevation of IFN-α2a after schistosomiasis therapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Additionally, in silico cell type enrichment analysis indicated that T cells were the primary cell type influenced by treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>).

                <p id="Par15">Having identified IFN-I signaling as a major pathway induced early after <italic>Sm</italic> treatment, we next assessed the impact of <italic>Sm</italic> infection itself on this pathway in a cross-sectional analysis, by performing RNA-seq on PBMC from three additional Ugandan participants who had tested <italic>Sm</italic>- negative by all diagnostic tests and resembled the <italic>Sm</italic> + women chosen for the prospective RNA-seq analysis based on age and socio-behavioral factors (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Approximately a third (33.7%) of DEGs associated with untreated <italic>Sm</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13a</xref>) overlapped with treatment-associated genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Notably, the enrichment analysis identified IFN-I signaling among the top 10 pathways associated with prevalent infection (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13b</xref>) and there was a trend to IRG-I enrichment of <italic>Sm</italic> infection-associated DEGs (16%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Sm</italic> infection down-regulated several IFN-stimulated genes, including <italic>IFITM1</italic>, <italic>IFITM2</italic>, tripartite motif-containing protein (<italic>TRIM)5</italic>, IFN-α-inducible protein (<italic>IFI)6</italic>, <italic>REL</italic> and <italic>IL-24</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13a</xref>), in line with CD4+ T cell IFN signaling suppression in murine schistosomiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par16">The present study demonstrated that standard praziquantel treatment of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected HIV-negative women resulted in over two- fold reduction of ex vivo HIV entry into cervical- and blood-derived CD4+ T cells. This reduction in HIV susceptibility was accompanied by transient immune activation and induction of antiviral IFN-I signaling, known for its ability to incapacitate multiple stages of HIV infection, from cellular entry to production of virus progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Remarkably, untreated <italic>Sm</italic> infection was associated with antiviral gene down-regulation, which was partially reversed by praziquantel therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Our results extend findings from earlier studies suggesting that abundant egg destruction after schistosomiasis treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> could lead to a surge of IFN-I activity, resulting in acute induction of antiviral defense mechanisms. Induction by <italic>Sm</italic> egg antigens of antiviral and proinflammatory responses was first demonstrated in murine <italic>Sm</italic> granuloma supernatants, which suppressed vesicular stomatitis virus infection via IFN-I and IL-1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. It was later confirmed that <italic>Sm</italic> egg antigens such as RNase omega-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and double stranded RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> activate toll-like receptor 3 and induce an IFN-I signature in conventional dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, an event shown to be necessary for Th2 signaling initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Future studies will need to better delineate the dynamics of IFN-I induction by <italic>Sm</italic> eggs in the context of <italic>Sm</italic> treatment and its effects on antiviral immunity.</p>
              <p id="Par18"><italic>Sm</italic> egg-positive study participants had elevated levels of mucosa-homing α4β7 + CD4+ T cells in blood, in keeping with our hypothesis that the inflammation caused by eggs in the gut activates α4β7-mediated common mucosal homing pathways. Sivro and colleagues recently demonstrated that α4β7 expression is linked to elevated HIV susceptibility, and that in HIV-infected people α4β7 is a predictor of higher viral load and faster disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, our finding of high α4β7 expression in <italic>Sm</italic> + adults suggests a mechanism by which <italic>Sm</italic> could cause not only increased HIV susceptibility, but also lead to faster CD4+ T cell depletion and higher viral loads in HIV co-infected individuals, in keeping with the recent observation of elevated blood HIV RNA levels in <italic>Sm</italic>-infected HIV seroconverters compared to their schistosoma-free peers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although a one-time praziquantel treatment in our study did not alter the elevated levels of α4β7, the transcriptome analysis indicated that <italic>Sm</italic> treatment was associated with changes in expression of multiple other integrins by blood mononuclear cells, including α2, αE and αM (see Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), suggesting treatment-induced reprogramming of cell homing in agreement with studies in murine models of schistosomiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Given that schistosomiasis-associated pathological changes are not reversed up to six months post-treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and eggs retained in tissues continue to exert negative immune effects after chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, it is perhaps unsurprising that we saw only partial restoration of immune function in our study. Future research will need to assess these parameters at later time points to understand the longer-term effects of schistosomiasis therapy on HIV susceptibility and antiviral defenses.</p>
              <p id="Par19">This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to document large-scale transcriptomic changes occurring in human PBMC as a result of <italic>Sm</italic> treatment. In keeping with our findings, recent studies identified distinct transcriptional profiles associated with <italic>Sh</italic> infection in cross-sectional comparisons of whole blood- and cervical cytobrush-derived transcriptomes of individuals with and without schistosomiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, although the same authors found cervical gene expression to be unaltered by <italic>Sm</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Taken together with our results, these data suggest that schistosome infections and their treatment can exert substantial impact on both systemic and mucosal immunity, although the effect size may vary depending on the parasite species and study design.</p>
              <p id="Par20">We found that the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) pathway was one of the top 10 pathways induced at one month after <italic>Sm</italic> treatment, although this pathway has previously been characterized in reproductive tissues rather than blood-derived lymphocyte populations. This is unlikely related to differences in the menstrual cycle stage between baseline and follow up visits, since we carefully scheduled all study visits to occur at the same stage of the menstrual cycle. While we cannot definitively rule out a direct effect of <italic>Sm</italic> treatment on FSH levels, this pathway shares several of its signaling components with other pathways, and in particular with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In the current study, <italic>Sm</italic> treatment was also associated with down-regulation of the mTOR pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), in line with the role of TOR in the maintenance of T regulatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and the demonstrated reduction of these cells post-schistosomiasis therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is more plausible that the FSH signature is a result of the overlap of this pathway with other pathways induced by <italic>Sm</italic> treatment, rather than directly reflecting systemic FSH fluctuation, although we were unable to directly measure FSH levels to assess this possibility. Interestingly, our transcriptome analysis also found that untreated <italic>Sm</italic> infection was associated with changes in the sphingosine-1P receptor-mediated signal transduction and down-regulation of CD69 (see Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), potentially linking the dramatic treatment-induced increase in CD69+ CD4+ T cell frequency to a lift of suppression of immune cell retention and/or tissue residency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">While an important limitation of our study is its relatively small sample size, this limitation was overcome by the longitudinal design of the clinical trial, which increased our power to detect differences in immunological readouts by reducing the impact of inter-individual variability. Of all CCA + women in our study, only 35% were Kato-Katz+ at baseline. Although this frequency of <italic>Sm</italic> egg+ individuals may seem low for a <italic>Sm</italic>-endemic region, the low sensitivity of microscopy testing has been documented in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and so was not unexpected. Due to ethical considerations we were unable to perform a larger study of direct praziquantel effects on ex vivo HIV susceptibility in schistosomiasis-uninfected individuals, but the viral entry, CD69 expression and cytokine data obtained from four schistosomiasis-free volunteers suggest it is very unlikely that praziquantel directly mediated the changes we observed in HIV susceptibility and host immunology. While the cost of RNA-seq analysis limited the sample size of our transcriptome analysis, our paired intra-individual analysis approach provided sufficient power to test the hypothesis regarding IFN-I pathway induction using a meta-analysis approach for DEG selection in combination with gene set enrichment and IRG permutation analyses.</p>
              <p id="Par22">In summary, we found that praziquantel treatment of <italic>Sm</italic>-infected Ugandan adult women substantially reduced ex vivo HIV entry into both endocervical and blood CD4+ T cells for at least two months, despite transient mucosal and systemic immune activation. This reduced HIV entry was associated with elevated mucosal IFN-I levels, and transcriptomic analysis confirmed that <italic>Sm</italic> treatment induced IFN-I pathways and partly reversed expression of <italic>Sm</italic>-dysregulated IRGs, potentially enhancing antiviral immunity. <italic>Sm</italic> egg shedding was associated with increased expression of a mucosal homing integrin on blood CD4+ T cells, suggesting a mechanism for enhanced genital HIV susceptibility, although α4β7 expression was not substantially reduced within two months of treatment. Identifying mechanisms by which treatment of a neglected parasitic infection could reduce female HIV acquisition is an important step toward designing effective HIV prevention programs. Our findings suggest that mass schistosomiasis treatment may merit investigation as a potential strategy to reduce HIV transmission in co-endemic regions.</p>

Briefly, cervical and blood mononuclear cells were incubated with the virus overnight to allow viral fusion with target cells and subsequent intracellular release of β-lactamase, which cleaves the FRET acceptor (fluorescein) from the CCF2 dye (commercially available from Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher), producing an emission shift analyzed by flow cytometry on antibody-stained and fixed cells. Pseudovirus stocks were generated at UofT by co-transfecting HEK-293T cells with an HIV backbone lacking envelope (Q23Δenv gfp nef, 20 μg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, early-transmitted CCR5-tropic Clade A envelope (Q259d2.17env, 10 μg), cloned from an HIV isolate obtained from a Kenyan woman, 1 week after HIV sero-conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, a plasmid expressing vpr fused to β-lactamase (pCMV-BlaM-Vpr, 10 μg; Addgene, USA), pAdvantage (5 μg; Promega, USA) and 135 μl of the transfection reagent polyethyl-imine (Polysciences, USA). Cell culture supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45μm filter and concentrated 100x using PEG6000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Viral stocks were titrated on reference PBMC obtained from HIV-negative donors and quantified by p24 ELISA (Zeptometryx, USA). The quantity of virus used in the study was equivalent to approximately 60% of maximum viral entry in the reference PBMC or 175 ng of p24. The virus stocks were shipped to the UVRI-IAVI laboratory and kept at −80C throughout the duration of the study. The quality control of virus infectivity was performed by including reference PBMC in infection assays. Processed cervical cell suspensions from each participant were divided in two and spinoculated with either virus (infection well) or media (control well) at 1200 g for 2 h at 17 °C in 48 well flat-bottom plates, followed by a 2-hour incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For PBMC infections, 1 million cells (counted via trypan blue exclusion) were used per well and infected on the same plate. Samples were washed twice in CO2-independent media (CID, Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) and loaded with 1 μM CCF2-AM (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) for 1.5 h. After wash, samples were incubated for 12 h at room temperature in CID supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotic cocktail (clindamycin, streptomycin, polymyxin, amphotericin, gentamycin) and 250 mM probenecid (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher). Samples were then stained with fluorescently-labeled antibodies and a live-dead dye (see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> for details) and analyzed using flow cytometry. HIV entry into CD4+ T cells was analyzed by assessing cleaved/uncleaved CCF2 ratio and using the corresponding uninfected well to guide the gating (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par29">Flow cytometry was performed on either BD LSR-II or BD LSR Fortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) cytometers at the UVRI-IAVI laboratory or UofT, respectively. Compensation was performed regularly using single stained compensation beads (BD Biosciences). The fluorescence output of the cytometer channels across the runs was standardized using Ultra rainbow calibration particles (Spherotech, USA). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software v.10.4.1 (TreeStar) with blinded participant/study visit identifications. Gating was guided by fluorescence minus 0 (FMO) controls. Cervical samples were excluded from analysis if the CD4+ T cell count per FCS file was less than 15 cells and/or if the control well appeared contaminated by pseudovirus.</p>

                <p id="Par30">Plasma was collected after PBMC separation and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min prior to freezing. Soft cup secretions were spun down at 500 g for 5 min, re-suspended in 10x original mass in 1X Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (Gibco/Thermo Fisher) and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 g. All cytokine assays were performed at UofT. Thawed plasma and genital secretions were tested by Meso Scale Discovery V-PLEX ELISA using pre-made (Cat. # K15049D) and customized panels on Sector Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Diagnostics, USA) for most cytokines. Human panIFN-alpha ELISA kit (Stemcell technologies, Canada) was used to assess the levels of pan IFN-α (specific for but unable to distinguish IFN-α sub-types 1/13, 2, 4–8, 10, 14, 16 and 17). To avoid the bias of intra-assay and inter-plate variation, paired samples were examined in duplicate on the same plate. Re-testing in a paired fashion was performed if one or more samples exhibited a coefficient of variation &gt;30%. Standard curves were produced according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantitative characteristics for the assays are listed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>. Cytokine heatmaps were constructed by first calculating “follow-up/baseline” ratios of cytokine levels for each participant, then a geometric mean of individual ratios was calculated for each cytokine and graphed using Morpheus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/</ext-link>).</p>

PBMC were isolated as described above. Cells were plated into 48-well plates and rested for 24 h at 37 C. IFN-α2a (StemCell Technologies, Canada) reconstituted in RPMI was used to stimulate cells for 24 h at 37 C at a final concentration of 10, 50 or 100 ng/ml- the range of IFN-α2a concentrations chosen based on the quantities of IFN-α2a commonly used to induce interferon pathway signaling in a laboratory setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.

A starting amount of 100 ng of RNA for each sample was depleted of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA using Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA beads (Illumina Technologies), followed by RNA fragmentation. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using RNase H and DNA Polymerase I. A single “A” base was added prior to adapter ligation and then following purification cDNA library enrichment was performed using PCR. The final cDNA libraries were validated for size and concentration using Agilent Bioanalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems/Roche), respectively. All libraries were normalized to 10 nM and pooled together, denatured with 0.2 N NaOH and diluted to a final concentration of 1.4 pM. The pooled libraries (1.3 ml of 1.4 pM) were loaded onto an Illumina NextSeq cartridge for subsequent cluster generation and sequencing on an Illumina Nextseq 500 instrument (Illumina Technologies) at Princess Margaret Genomics Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pmgenomics.ca">www.pmgenomics.ca</ext-link>) using the paired-end 75 bp protocol to achieve ~ 30 million reads per sample.</p>

The analysis had two goals: (i) to perform gene set enrichment analysis on the treatment- and schistosomiasis- associated DEGs and (ii) to assess IRG enrichment of the identified DEGs. HTSeq counts were uploaded into RNA-seq 2 G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://52.90.192.24:3838/rnaseq2g/">http://52.90.192.24:3838/rnaseq2g/</ext-link>) for analysis. For the paired prospective study analysis, the “paired” test was specified, while the unpaired test was specified for the cross-sectional comparison of “schisto+ ” vs. “healthy controls”. Normalization was performed using default settings (“normalize count by DESeq”/”normalize logged by Loess”). Minimal read count threshold was set to “one”. To increase the power and reduce the uncertainty of our DE comparison, we performed meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> using five DE pipelines: DESeq2, edgeR, limma, PoissonSeq and Ballgown (all implemented using metaseqR in RNA-seq 2 G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>). These pipelines were chosen based on 1) their overall recognition/prior use in the field (DESeq2, edgeR, limma, Ballgown), 2) capacity to perform paired analysis (all) and 3) bias to identify genes based on length (PoissonSeq being the least biased of all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>). Meta-analysis was performed for each comparison (V1 vs. V2, V1 vs. V3, schisto+ vs. schisto-,) using the RNA-seq 2 G default settings (combined <italic>p</italic> value estimated by the Simes method, p values normalized). The distribution of meta-analysis p values and fold changes were plotted using Plot.ly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plot.ly/">https://plot.ly/</ext-link>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13a</xref>). Since the goal of our analysis was to test a specific hypothesis about the IFN-I pathway induction (but not to characterize individual DEGs), we considered a liberal sample of genes that had <italic>p</italic> values of 0.1 or lower, regardless of the fold change, derived from the meta-analyses for querying against the Enrichr and Interferome databases.</p>

To this end, we took all the genes (n = 8459) expressed in our RNAseq dataset and queried these genes against the Interferome database to obtain the proportions of IRG and IRG-I subsets (2082/8459 and 1102/8459, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>) in the complete dataset.
