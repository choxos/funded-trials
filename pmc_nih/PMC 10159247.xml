                  <title>Objectives:</title>
                  <p>This study examines the relationship between social engagement and loneliness
in female and male autistic children and adolescents in school-based social
settings. Secondary aims sought to explore the emergence of loneliness
across different age groups and differences in social engagement and
loneliness between genders.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>This study conducted an analysis of previously collected data from two
multi-site randomized control trials. This study included 58 autistic
students (29 females, 29 males) between the ages 6 through 18 years. Female
and male participants were matched on age and intelligence quotient.
Concurrent mixed methods were used to examine participants’ social
engagement and loneliness.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Findings revealed a significant relationship between joint engagement and
loneliness, such that autistic students reported more loneliness when they
were mutually engaged with social groups than when they were isolated or
alone. Positive correlations between joint engage and loneliness were
identified in elementary-age girls and secondary-age boys, suggesting that
being mutually engaged with peers leads to increased loneliness. Negative
correlations between parallel and loneliness identified in secondary-age
boys suggested that boys in close proximity to peers felt less lonely than
boys who were mutually engaged with peers. Qualitative analysis of social
behaviors indicated that elementary girls and secondary boys were more
likely to be mutually engaged or in close proximity to activities, but they
had difficulty sustaining this engagement throughout the entire social
period. Secondary girls and elementary boys, on the other hand, were more
likely to be solitary and less likely to engage with peer groups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Study findings highlight the relationship between social engagement and
loneliness in school-based autistic populations, and that more engagement
itself can lead to more loneliness for younger girls and older boys. The
influence of age and gender on engagement and loneliness highlights a need
to tailor social interventions to leverage existing social strengths.</p>

social periods, and on the playground through participation in conversations, games,
and activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Successful engagement in these social activities requires children and
adolescents to react to quick and nuanced social behaviors, and not all children
respond in the same ways. Indeed, most individuals gravitate toward people who are
more similar to them in terms of interests or activities. Autistic students may be
at particular disadvantage in these contexts as they may have fewer individuals who
match their interests. Observations of autistic students in school unstructured
activities often note that they can be found at the periphery of social groups or
isolated relative to their peers,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and they report fewer friendships and greater peer rejection.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr6-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These social differences begin
in early childhood and persist into adolescence and adulthood.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr9-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, many autistic children
are able to connect to peers, and report to having at least one friend.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr12-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Having a mutual friendship
has been associated with greater school satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Social relationships become increasingly salient and complex throughout development,
and in adolescence, self-identity is realized through peer group affiliation.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Despite wanting to fit in, autistic adolescents may have less opportunity to
form a peer group. They are noted to spend less time socializing with peers,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> have smaller peer groups, and are less likely to have reciprocal friendships
compared to non-autistic counterparts.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Adolescent socialization can be daunting—reading and responding appropriately
to often rapid and nuanced social cues across varying situations may be particularly
challenging as autistic adolescents navigate the social landscape at school. The
cumulative impact of ongoing social difficulties can lead to increased internalizing
behaviors, such as anxiety and loneliness.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Indeed, autistic adolescents report higher levels of loneliness compared to
adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and neurotypical
peers.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Research supports the efficacy of social skills interventions on the social outcomes
of autistic children and adolescents.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> While a considerable body of evidence supports social skills interventions in
clinic-based settings,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr23-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> autistic participants have
demonstrated difficulty with generalizing skills to authentic social environments,
like schools.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="bibr25-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr26-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> To address
this issue, a growing body of research has adapted clinic-based interventions for
school settings, which allows researchers to support the development and maintenance
of social skills within authentic social environments in part by improving the
social environment at school, for example, expanding the types of social activities
at school that meet the interests of autistic students, or educating the general
school population on respecting differences in social behaviors. Moreover,
researchers are better able to measure authentic social outcomes, including
improvements in social engagement in real-life settings.</p>
              <p>Observation protocols using timed interval recording systems to record the occurrence
of participants’ social behaviors are commonly used to measure participant outcomes.
For example, the Playground Observation of Peer Engagement (POPE)<sup><xref rid="bibr27-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr30-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr31-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> was specifically designed to
record the engagement states of the autistic participants and their non-autistic
peers during unstructured social periods at school. The POPE has been used to
evaluate levels of social engagement in autistic and non-autistic children and
adolescents at school,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and to capture more qualitative descriptions of participant
behaviors and activities within each engagement state.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Multiple research studies have used the POPE, or adaptations of the POPE, to
measure the social behaviors of autistic and non-autistic participants
quantitatively and qualitatively within authentic social settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="bibr27-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr28-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr29-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr33-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Social comparison</title>
                <p>Systematic observation of social engagement within the naturalistic social
environment is important because a growing body of research indicates that many
autistic individuals use camouflaging to gain peer acceptance.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Given
that the very nature of camouflage is to blend in, it can be difficult for an
observer to detect social camouflaging or the social challenges of autistic
youth without a systematic observation protocol. During social interactions,
individuals mask autistic behaviors through social imitation and suppressing
autistic characteristics.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Camouflaging to fit in requires (a) an awareness of the extent to which
one’s own behaviors deviate from the behaviors endorsed by the desired peer
group and (b) the ability to observe and imitate the behaviors of others. A
benefit of camouflaging for some individuals is access to social opportunities
and friendships—individuals who act like their desired peer group are more
likely to be accepted. Reported more frequently, though, is that camouflaging is
exhausting and can lead to increased anxiety, depression, and a feeling of a
lost identity.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Similar to camouflaging, self-reports of loneliness also involve social
comparison between oneself and a desired peer group. Feeling lonely likely
requires an individual to have knowledge of their desired versus actual
friendships and an understanding of their own standing within their social
milieu. Some reports indicate that autistic students are at increased risk of
peer victimization and bullying and feel the need to camouflage to fit in,
creating a great deal of stress on the individual.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> After a time, a pattern
of repeated rejection and victimization may contribute to the development of loneliness.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Alternatively, loneliness may occur later for autistic students due to an
accumulation of many negative social interactions.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> For example, child age
affects whether children report loneliness at school. In separate studies, 7- to
9-year-old autistic students did not endorse loneliness at school,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> whereas autistic adolescents reported more loneliness than classmates of
the same age.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> These findings suggest there may be developmental
changes in the way autistic students understand or feel loneliness.</p>

elementary children with and without autism socialized at school, autistic girls
tended to move in and out of groups, vacillating between being mutually engaged
in a group and being alone, while autistic boys tended to wander alone. Autistic
girls used compensatory behaviors, such as close proximity and fluid movements,
to hide their challenges and to look like non-autistic girls. In contrast, the
social behaviors of elementary boys tended to be activity-focused (i.e.
structured games with rules), which made it more difficult for autistic boys to
mask their social challenges.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> While autistic boys and girls both experience social difficulties at
school, there are quantitative (i.e. time spent in joint engage versus solitary)
and qualitative (i.e. social activity) differences in their experiences.</p>
                <p>Gender differences in social behaviors persist through adolescence. In general,
girls evince greater social motivation and desire for friendships than boys,<sup><xref rid="bibr51-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and female friendships have greater closeness and companionship.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> In 2013, Kuo et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> found that when adolescent autistic boys socialized, they tended to
engage in passive activities like watching television or playing computer games.
Autistic adolescent girls were more likely to engage in active social
activities, like talking with friends. As female friendships become more
intimate in adolescence,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> autistic girls may be particularly impacted relative to autistic boys
because the central tenets of female friendship map onto the core challenges of
autism. Autistic adolescent girls have reported difficulty fitting into female
groups due to subtle non-verbal communication styles and relational aggression
among non-autistic peers. This may be partially explained by difficulty
interpreting implicit social rules in neurotypical female groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="bibr54-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> The
complexity of female adolescent relationships may lead to camouflage fatigue,
making it difficult to sustain effective camouflaging behaviors and leading
autistic girls to avoid social interactions altogether.</p>

of the POPE, to observe middle and high school students. Both observation
protocols use interval coding to code the presence or absence of predominant
engagement states during authentic social settings. Quantitative engagement
state codes were established during the live POPE and TOPI observation
intervals. In addition, brief field notes record student social activities,
peers or peer groups, and affect. An example of qualitative field notes
would read “JE” (joint engage), “Playing handball with three boys,” “Happy,”
or “S” (solitary), “wandering the yard alone,” “neutral affect.” Trained
observers, who were research assistants or doctoral students in special
education, human development and psychology, or education programs, rated
the social engagement of autistic students for two 10- to 15-min observation
periods. For the POPE, each interval was 1 min, and coders were trained to
observe for 40 s and code for 20 s. TOPI intervals were longer. Coders
observed for 1 min and 30 s and coded for 30 s. All coders were trained to
reliability criteria of greater than .85 (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic> ⩾ .85) on
playground and classroom observations. We measured reliability between

                <p>Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using concomitant mixed methods
(QUAN + QUAL) to examine the relationship between social engagement (solitary,
parallel, joint engage) and loneliness in autistic males and females in
elementary and secondary grades. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression
analysis, and correlation analyses were used to examine quantitative
relationships and to identify between-group differences (male and female;
elementary and secondary; higher and lower social engagement), and model fit was
evaluated for all models. Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing was
employed, and tests that survived the Bonferroni adjustment were denoted with an
asterisk in the results section.</p>
                <p>A comparative case study analysis of qualitative field notes was used to examine
salient social activities within elementary and secondary male and female
groups. The first two authors read through all qualitative field notes and
established preliminary codes. After establishing and reaching a consensus on
preliminary codes, each person coded independently. Twenty-five percent of the
data were double coded. Interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC), and coders maintained a strong coding consistency
(ICC = .96). Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. The coding procedure
occurred as follows. First, we used line-by-line coding of field notes at the
individual level to identify participant activities during each 1-min interval.
Coders were blind to the age and gender of the participant. Next, we
disaggregated field notes by engagement state (solitary, parallel, and joint
engage), age, and gender. Then, to determine primary activities, we calculated
the frequency that each primary activity occurred within each group (male and
female) and engagement state (joint engage, parallel, and solitary). The number
of participants exhibiting behaviors and the total number of intervals in each
engagement state were also calculated. Finally, we compared primary activities
across cases.</p>
                <p>Qualitative and quantitative data analyses were integrated to provide a more
detailed description of what joint engage, parallel, and solitary behaviors
looked like during authentic social periods and to identify behavioral
characteristics that may provide insight into the relationships between
engagement and loneliness. This methodology has been used in prior studies,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and the acknowledgment of behavioral characteristics enabled the observer

                <p>We then separated the data by age category (elementary and secondary) and
conducted follow-up two-way interaction analyses to test the effect of gender
and engagement state (parallel, joint engage, or solitary) on loneliness. Main
effects of solitary on loneliness were not significant in elementary age
(<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1,24) = 0.167, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .686,
<italic toggle="yes">ω</italic><sup>2</sup> = .007) or secondary age
(<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1,15) = 0.706, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .414,
<italic toggle="yes">ω</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.05). Main effects of parallel in the
elementary-age category were not significant, (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1,24) = 3.95,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .120, <italic toggle="yes">ω</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.098), but were
significant in the secondary-age category (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1,15) = 5.23,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .259, <italic toggle="yes">ω</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.12). There is
a significant interaction effect of gender and joint engagement on loneliness in
secondary students (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1,14) = 5.36, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .036,
<italic toggle="yes">ω</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.28), suggesting a difference in the
association between joint engage and loneliness in boys and girls. Secondary
boys with higher joint engagement have increased loneliness, whereas the effect
is more diminished among girls.</p>
                <p>We used correlation analysis to further explore the relationship between
engagement (solitary, parallel, joint engage) and loneliness within each
subgroup (elementary female and male; secondary female and male). Because of the
small sample size in the secondary-age group, we conducted a visual analysis of
scatter plot data to confirm outcomes were not driven by outliers. Bivariate
correlation analysis findings revealed there were no significant correlations
between loneliness and solitary among both elementary and secondary students.
There was a significant negative correlation between loneliness and parallel for
all participants and the male sample. Finally, there was a positive correlation
between loneliness and joint engage for the total sample, secondary males and
elementary females (see <xref rid="table3-17455057231170973" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>Qualitative analysis was used to increase our understanding of the quantitative
findings, particularly with regard to actual observations at school, and to
further explore qualitative group differences that may influence engagement and
loneliness. Qualitative results revealed similarities and differences in social
behaviors across groups and engagement states. The top three salient activities
within each group and in each engagement state are presented in <xref rid="table4-17455057231170973" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Salient
activities were determined by the proportion of participants endorsing the
activity and the overall time that participants engaged in the activity during
the observation interval. It is possible for participants to have engaged in
more than one salient activity, and this overlap will result in percentage
scores above 100. Results indicate the number of participants within each group
who were observed in each engagement state. A representative example of the
social engagement of participants for each case is presented.</p>

              <p>This study used mixed methods to examine the relationship between social engagement
(solitary, joint engage, parallel) and loneliness in autistic children and
adolescents, and the emergence of loneliness across different age groups. Secondary
aims sought to explore possible gender differences in the relationship between
social engagement and loneliness. Results indicated a greater time in joint engage,
and not solitary, was significantly associated with loneliness. Age was associated
with parallel, such that secondary students hanging out near groups had lower
loneliness scores. The effects of age and gender were evident, such that
elementary-age girls and secondary-age boys with greater joint engage also reported
greater loneliness than their opposite-gender counterparts. Differences in the
qualitative features of joint engagement, parallel, and solitary among girls and
boys highlight differing gender-related engagement profiles.</p>
              <p>The relationship between joint engage and loneliness was significant for
elementary-age girls and secondary-age boys. Compared to elementary boys,
elementary-age girls had higher joint engage and lower solitary scores. Yet a closer
inspection of field notes suggests that joint engage was not sustained throughout
the observation period. Elementary girls vacillated between joint engage and
solitary, without sustaining mutual engagement with peers. These findings
corroborate the work of Dean et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> in which autistic girls were able to blend into the female social landscape
at school by emulating the social behaviors of non-autistic girls.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr49-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bibr54-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Non-autistic
girls tend to fluidly move from activity to activity and from peer to peer
throughout the duration of recess or other social periods while maintaining joint
engagement throughout the observation period.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Autistic elementary-age girls emulate the fluidity of non-autistic female
groups but appear to have difficulty sustaining joint engagement. The relative
strength of elementary autistic girls is that they seem to intuitively understand
the mechanics of entering social situations. However, missing or misunderstanding
nuanced behaviors within social interactions may have led to unsuccessful
conversation maintenance. Through a camouflage lens, elementary girls endorsed

behaviors to look like their non-autistic female peers. Within social interactions,
however, elementary girls did not appear to endorse camouflage

to evince the social interactions styles of their non-autistic peers.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> This may also provide a partial explanation for the lack of benefit of
parallel on loneliness for elementary girls. Close proximity to non-autistic peer
groups is representative of elementary girls’ ongoing efforts to join groups and
maintain joint engagement. For elementary autistic girls, being on the outside of a
group denotes their social difficulties with staying jointly engaged throughout the
social period. Alternatively, they may not have sustained joint engage because of
the cognitive load required to socialize at that level. Instead, it may be easier
and possibly more satisfying for them to flit between engagement states. It should
be noted in this sample, however, adolescent girls spent more time in solitary than
in joint engage or parallel. Girls’ tendency toward solitary may reflect an
increased pressure to fit in and make friends during a developmental stage when
social interaction demands become increasingly nuanced and intimate.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr61-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> This finding
suggests that, even though camouflaging has been shown to help autistic girls make friends,<sup><xref rid="bibr38-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> after years of camouflaging to maintain joint engage in female peer groups,
autistic adolescent girls may find being alone without camouflaging is less lonely
than hiding aspects of their identity to fit in Ryan et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and Halsall et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Future intervention studies should include strengths-based approaches to
leverage girls’ innate ability to enter social group dynamics and include peer (e.g.
peer-mediated interventions<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and school personnel training<sup><xref rid="bibr27-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>) to help to build a social
environment that is supportive and accepting of autistic girls.</p>
              <p>The significant effect of parallel on loneliness suggests a benefit of being in close
proximity to peers for autistic individuals. Being near peers but not mutually
engaged may help reduce cognitive demand and subsequent social stressors indicative
of trying to follow rapidly paced social conversations while trying to fit in. Thus,
being near peers may be satisfying because it allows autistic individuals to feel
socially connected.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Qualitative results show a salient parallel activity was eating
lunch—participants ate near peers without being actively involved in the
conversation. Given that social eating is a universal social bonding activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr62-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> autistic students may benefit from targeted interventions that support social
engagement during mealtime. For example, the Remaking Recess intervention<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr63-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> uses
lunchtime to support social engagement in elementary children. Interventionists
facilitate social opportunities between students with and without autism in the
school cafeteria by helping autistic students enter peer groups and providing
conversation starters to scaffold social conversations. In secondary settings,
mealtime social interventions outside of the cafeteria can provide a safe space for
autistic students to connect with school personnel and peers. For example, Miles et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> interviewed nine adolescent autistic females about their social experiences
in mainstream settings. Participants benefited from adult-facilitated lunchtime
clubs, in which girls socialized with a small group of peers in a classroom or in
other quiet space on campus.</p>
              <p>Significant correlations between joint engage and loneliness and parallel and
loneliness were evident in the secondary male sample. Secondary males placed
themselves in proximity to peers or peer groups but had difficulties sustaining
mutual engagement in shared activities and conversations. This may be due in part to
widely accepted gender differences in play among boys and girls. Elementary boys
tend to engage in rough and tumble play and games with rules throughout the duration
of recess, and elementary autistic boys have an increased likelihood of being in
solitary and not playing the game.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr64-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> As a result, autistic
adolescent boys enter secondary school with a smaller social repertoire than
typically developing boys, and therefore, being in parallel may feel less
overwhelming than joint engage. These findings corroborate qualitative studies in
which adolescent autistic boys have expressed difficulty with navigating group
dynamics.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bibr65-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="bibr66-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> Increased proximity suggests an increased social motivation
relative to elementary boys and secondary girls. Yet, significant loneliness scores
suggest an awareness of one’s actual versus desired relationships, which can
increase social stress.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr67-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Thus, the comparison of one’s sense of social competency in the
context of desired peer relationships can lead to negative
self-evaluations<sup><xref rid="bibr13-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr65-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> and increased emotional symptoms and reputational concerns.<sup><xref rid="bibr65-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> In contrast, if the adolescent boys in our study exhibited high rates of
solitary behavior in elementary school, then the hesitancy to enter and sustain
social interactions may be due to a lack of experience with reciprocal joint
engagement with peers. Thus, limited joint engagement and subsequent loneliness may
be the result of limited opportunities to practice the salient joint engage
behavior—conversations.</p>
              <p>Contrary to our hypothesis, the effect of solitary on loneliness was not significant.
Some autistic students may be content to spend unstructured social periods alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr68-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> Other autistic individuals may avoid taking social risks and join peer groups
that are convenient instead of deliberately seeking out opportunities (e.g. joining
clubs or going to school functions) to meet friends with shared interests. Some
individuals may want friends, but after experiencing social challenges in elementary
school,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> they may avoid social interactions in secondary school—feeling
socially incompetent may feel more lonely than being alone. Interestingly, secondary
girls had the highest mean of solitary scores. Qualitative analysis revealed that
these girls spent more than twice as many observation intervals in solitary compared
to parallel and joint engage. These findings may be due to the association between
adolescent identity and peer group affiliation;<sup><xref rid="bibr69-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> if autistic adolescents feel self-conscious about their social challenges,
they may hang out on the periphery of social groups without developing intimate
connections. Adolescent autistic girls have an increased risk of late diagnosis or,
due to camouflaging behaviors, missed access to support services,<sup><xref rid="bibr69-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> and the lack of social support at school may perpetuate social difficulties.
The male-to-female ratio of autism<sup><xref rid="bibr70-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="bibr71-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> may also inadvertently
exacerbate social difficulties. When autistic girls gain access to social support,
groups are likely to be male dominated, which may interfere with girls developing
social skills needed to successfully navigate the female social landscape.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> These findings highlight the historic lack of attention of school personnel
to the female autism phenotype and the unique social support needed by autistic
females. Successful camouflaging of social difficulties in elementary school can
leave adolescent autistic girls with unmet social needs. Practitioners need to be
aware of autistic camouflaging and to be able to identify social strengths and
challenges and design social interventions for girls accordingly. Future research
needs to examine the impact of group gender dynamics on social and loneliness
outcomes.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>While these data provide important information regarding the relationship between
engagement and loneliness, as well as gender and age differences in social
engagement and loneliness for autistic students, there are also limitations.
First, the study’s small sample size may have reduced statistical power to
detect effects. Second, cross-sectional data were used to examine the
differences between elementary- and secondary-age students. Future studies
should include larger sample sizes and longitudinal data to examine the impact
of social engagement on camouflaging, loneliness, and mental health outcomes
over the course of developmental stages. Finally, the observational data were
based on interval coding of engagement states and brief qualitative notes. More
detailed observation data of the social interactions (e.g. discourse analysis)
should be collected to identify more targeted and granular skills needed in
these children and adolescents’ social repertoire, specifically addressing the
individual needs of different ages and gender groups.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The significant relationship between joint engage and loneliness suggests that
autistic students may find that the effort they put forth into fitting in does not
yield sustained social engagement, or acceptance into their desired peer
groups,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> because the effort to keep up with social dynamics can be
overwhelming. Identified age and gender differences highlight differing intervention
needs between girls and boys. The relative strength of elementary-aged girls (their
ability to enter peer groups and to maintain some joint engagement) coupled with the
increased solitary in adolescent girls highlights a specific need for female
oriented social skills support. Girls’ joint engagement in elementary school may
mask their social challenges and therefore limit their access to social support.
Practitioners need to be aware of autistic students’ potential to camouflage so that
they can provide intervention support accordingly.</p>
              <p>The most common joint engage activity among all autistic students, regardless of
gender, is conversations. This suggests that autistic students may benefit from in
vivo support to help them enter social groups and maintain conversations with their
peers.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Some social skills interventions have broken down steps of
social interactions to help autistic students practice recognizing and appropriately
inserting themselves into social situations. For example, the Children’s Friendship
Training teaches children how to “slip in” to activities and conversations.<sup><xref rid="bibr72-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> Specifically, it teaches children to decide which groups of peers to join and
what they should observe and listen to in these group interactions.</p>
              <p>To truly facilitate inclusive practices, school-based social interventions should
acknowledge the social skill development needs of neurotypical peers. Peer
interventions should build autism awareness by teaching peers to recognize
differences in social communication styles and to identify their role in creating
social environments in which autistic traits are understood and accepted.<sup><xref rid="bibr73-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">73</xref><xref rid="bibr74-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr75-17455057231170973" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Neurotypical peers will
benefit from interventions to learn and practice strategies to initiate and maintain
social interactions and conversation with autistic peers, as well as strategies to
support the inclusion of autistic peers into peer groups and social activities.</p>
