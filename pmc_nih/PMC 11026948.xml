                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>An ongoing important need exists to rapidly develop novel therapeutics for COVID-19 that will retain antiviral efficacy in the setting of rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and potential future development of resistance of SARS-COV-2 to remdesivir and protease inhibitors. To date, there is no FDA-approved treatment for post-exposure prophylaxis against SAR-CoV-2. We have shown that the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate (Mito-MES), a dietary supplement, has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this exploratory, pragmatic open label clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT05381454" id="intref0015">NCT05381454</ext-link>), we studied whether Mito-MES is an effective post-exposure prophylaxis treatment in people who had high-grade unmasked exposures to SARS-CoV-2 within 5 days prior to study entry. Participants were enrolled in real-world setting in Los Angeles, United States between May 1 and December 1, 2022 and were assigned to either mito-MES 20 mg daily for 14 days (n = 40) or no mito-MES (controls) (n = 40). The primary endpoint was development of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on 4 COVID-19 diagnostic tests [rapid antigen tests (RATs) or PCR] performed during the study period (14 days post exposure).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Out of 40 (23 females; 57.5%) study participants who took Mito-MES, 12 (30%) developed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to 30 of the 40 controls (75%) (difference −45.0%, 95% confidence intervals (CI): −64.5%, −25.5%). Out of 40 (19 females; 47.5%) study participants in the control group, 30 (75.0%) had at least one positive COVID-19 diagnostic test and 23 (57.5%) were symptomatic. With regards to key secondary outcomes, among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, the median duration of viral symptoms was lower in the Mito-MES group (median 3.0, 95% CI 2.75, 3.25) compared to the control group (median 5.0, 95% CI 4.0, 7.0). None of the study participants was hospitalized or required oxygen therapy. Mito-MES was well tolerated and no serious side effect was reported in any study participant.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>This work describes antiviral activity of mito-MES in humans. Mito-MES was well tolerated in our study population and attenuated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given established safety of Mito-MES in humans, our results suggest that randomized control clinical trials of Mito-MES as post-exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection are warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0030">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes the urgent need to determine cellular pathways that can be targeted by novel oral antivirals that ideally would target rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. Current oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (paxlovid) and molnupiravir have limitations. Current antivirals in development against SARS-CoV-2 such as nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors have host effects that may compromise long term safety and there may be safety concerns for long-term use in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC or Long COVID). For example, PF-07321332 may involve host proteases in virus entry<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> while β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, a metabolite of molnupiravir, may interfere with host RNA polymerases<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and have mutagenic effects in mammalian cells.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The ritonavir component of paxlovid has drug interactions with widely used medications.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Emerging resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to nucleoside analogues such as remdesivir has been described.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> To date, there is no FDA-approved treatment for post-exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, there is a continued need for the development of safe oral antivirals for COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="p0035">We demonstrated that the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoquinone and/or mitoquinol mesylate (Mito-MES) has <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection which are mediated through the Nrf2 pathway.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Mito-MES had nanomolar antiviral potency against independent SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as murine coronavirus. Finally, we showed that Mito-MES treatment can drastically reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Mito-MES is a molecule that consists of a ubiquinol group found in coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) conjugated to a lipophilic cation (TPP).<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> CoQ<sub>10</sub> is the endogenous coenzyme that transfers electrons between mitochondrial complexes and protects from lipid peroxidation.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Mito-MES is well tolerated and has been used as diet supplement in hundreds of thousands of humans and in 5 phase II clinical trials of 222 participants<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with up to one year follow up.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0040">Thus, to obtain further proof-of-concept evidence that Mito-MES has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in humans, we performed an exploratory, pragmatic non-randomized open label clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0020">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT05381454" id="intref0025">NCT05381454</ext-link>) of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of Mito-MES, compared to no Mito-MES, to prevent development of SARS-CoV-2 infection after high-risk unmasked prolonged exposure to person with <italic>confirmed</italic> SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

Mito-MES has also been shown to have <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activity against other respiratory viruses such as RSV.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Thus, the registered clinical trial is an open label exploratory clinical trial of adults that will determine the safety and efficacy of Mito-MES to prevent the development and progression of severe viral infections like COVID-19 after high-risk exposure to a person with possible respiratory viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons who will receive Mito-MES compared to persons who will not receive Mito-MES (controls). This is a sub-study focusing on SARS-Co-V-2 infection. We included only study participants who had exposure to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (index case). Sex equity was considered in our study and we enrolled similar number of men and women among compared groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The study included 2 groups: Group A (Mito-MES group) included study participants who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to take Mito-MES 20 mg daily for 14 days (n = 40) for post exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. Group B (no Mito-MES) included study participants who met the inclusion criteria, matched the demographics of the Mito-MES group (age, sex), agreed to participate in the research study and complete questionnaires but declined to receive the intervention (mito-MES). Only one study participant per unique SARS-CoV-2 exposure was included in the study. If the same study participant had another SARS-CoV-2 exposure the same person was not enrolled twice. This study also included independent household members who had similar exposure to the same index case (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) and family level clustering was considered in the study analysis. This is an exploratory open label pilot study susceptible to selection bias (see limitations in the discussion). The primary endpoint was development of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on COVID-19 diagnostic tests [rapid antigen tests (RATs) or PCR] performed during the study period (14 days post exposure).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of study participants in compared groups (Mito-MES versus control).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Covariates</th><th>Mito-MES (N = 40)</th><th>Control (N = 40)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sex, <italic>% (N)</italic></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Female</td><td align="char">57.5% (23)</td><td align="char">47.5% (19)</td></tr><tr><td> Male</td><td align="char">42.5% (17)</td><td align="char">52.5% (21)</td></tr><tr><td>Age, <italic>Median (IQR)</italic></td><td align="char">39.5 (34.8, 42.0)</td><td align="char">44.0 (42.0, 46.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Race, <italic>% (N)</italic></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> White</td><td align="char">65.0% (26)</td><td align="char">75.0% (30)</td></tr><tr><td> Hispanic</td><td align="char">27.5% (11)</td><td align="char">20.0% (8)</td></tr><tr><td> Other (e.g., Asian)</td><td align="char">7.5% (3)</td><td align="char">5.0% (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Smoking, <italic>% (N)</italic></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Yes</td><td align="char">15% (6)</td><td align="char">22.5% (9)</td></tr><tr><td> No</td><td align="char">85% (34)</td><td align="char">77.5% (31)</td></tr><tr><td>Household size, <italic>Median (IQR)</italic></td><td align="char">4.0 (2.8, 4.0)</td><td align="char">4.0 (3.0, 4.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of people within household exposed to index case, <italic>Median (IQR)</italic></td><td align="char">3.0 (1.8, 3.0)</td><td align="char">2.0 (2.0, 3.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Immunization status, <italic>% (N)</italic></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 6 months prior to exposure</td><td align="char">32.5% (13)</td><td align="char">45.0% (18)</td></tr><tr><td> Vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine &gt;6 months prior to exposure and with no booster</td><td align="char">47.5% (19)</td><td align="char">55.0% (22)</td></tr><tr><td> Unvaccinated</td><td align="char">20.0% (8)</td><td align="char">0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td>Comorbidities, <italic>% (N)</italic></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> None</td><td align="char">65.0% (26)</td><td align="char">65.0% (26)</td></tr><tr><td> Hypertension</td><td align="char">15.0% (6)</td><td align="char">20.0% (8)</td></tr><tr><td> Diabetes</td><td align="char">10.0% (4)</td><td align="char">10.0% (4)</td></tr><tr><td> Obesity</td><td align="char">17.5% (7)</td><td align="char">20.0% (8)</td></tr><tr><td> Cancer</td><td align="char">5.0% (2)</td><td align="char">0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td> Major immunosuppression</td><td align="char">10.0% (4)</td><td align="char">0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td> Metabolic syndrome</td><td align="char">7.5% (3)</td><td align="char">2.5% (1)</td></tr><tr><td> Other</td><td align="char">5.0% (2)</td><td align="char">10.0% (4)</td></tr><tr><td>High risk, <italic>% (N)</italic></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Yes</td><td align="char">20.0% (8)</td><td align="char">20.0% (8)</td></tr><tr><td> No</td><td align="char">80.0% (32)</td><td align="char">80.0% (32)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>IQR = Interquartile range showing 25th and 75th percentile values.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

                <p id="p0070">The primary endpoints were 1) to evaluate if treatment with Mito-MES can prevent the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as a positive FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test) over the study period of 14 days; 2) to evaluate if treatment with Mito-MES can prevent the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection over the study period of 14 days. Severity of viral illness was determined based on a quantitative score system of 14 symptoms of viral illness: Symptom 1: fever, Symptom 2: cough, Symptom 3: coryza, Symptom 4: sore throat, Symptom 5: shortness of breath, Symptom 6: chills, Symptom 7: fatigue, Symptom 8: loss of smell or taste, Symptom 9: myalgias, Symptom 10: arthralgias, Symptom 11: headache, Symptom 12: nausea, Symptom 13: vomiting, Symptom 14: diarrhea. Each of 14 symptoms was given a score based on severity: 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for severe. Then a total severity score was estimated (range of score is 0–42). Presence of new onset hypoxia added an additional score of 6. Patient reported outcomes are subjective, include symptoms like fatigue that can be non-specific and definition of mild symptomatic viral illness can be variable between different persons. Thus, a stringent definition of mild viral illness was utilized to assess severity of viral illness. Mild infection was defined as a severity score ≦ 6 with presence of 4 or less symptoms (including fever, chills, myalgias, fatigue, cough, coryza, sore throat) <italic>without</italic> new onset shortness of breath and <italic>without</italic> new onset hypoxia. Moderate infection was defined as presence of 5 or more symptoms <italic>with or without</italic> shortness of breath <italic>and/or</italic> a severity score ≧ 7 (2 or more symptoms of <italic>moderate</italic> severity and a score of 2 per symptom) <italic>and/or</italic> presence of new onset hypoxia (&lt;97% pulse oximetry).

                <p id="p0105">The study was an exploratory open label clinical trial and no formal sample size analysis was performed prior to initiation of the study. The sample size was 40 participants per group based on the number of participants that were allowed to enrol in the setting of institutional approvals and the IND. The goal of this exploratory pilot study was to collect data for sample size calculations of a future randomized control clinical trial (RCT). Key epidemiologic parameters among exposed contacts including exposure histories, cluster size, time to first positive test were analysed using descriptive statistics. In the figures, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals are presented for comparisons between treatment groups and controls. Categorical variables were recorded as the proportion of study participants with an outcome of interest (such as development of moderate viral disease yes or no) and were compared between groups using the Two sample proportion test. Continuous variables were described using medians and interquartile ranges for skewed continuous outcome of interest (such as duration of viral symptoms and severity scores). Bivariate differences were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum test and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrap method (N = 10,000 repetitions) with bias correction. Sensitivity analysis examines positive SARS-CoV-2 infection using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) with family level clustering for binomial family with logit linkage. For continuous outcomes (e.g., severity scores) we utilized a GEE with for a Gaussian family. Models were fitted using exchangeable variance covariance matrix. Models were initially fitted unadjusted. Then multivariable models adjusted for key characteristics of both contacts (age, sex, co-morbidity, exposure characteristics). Covariates were included independent of each other (i.e., only one covariate in the model at a time) in order to prevent overfitting due to the small sample sizes. Similar models were used to compare the secondary outcomes between study arms. Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

              <p id="p0175">This work describes antiviral activity of mito-MES against SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Mito-MES has not previously been tested in humans as an antiviral against acute viral infections. Mito-MES was safe and highly effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection when given within 72 h post high-grade unmasked exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Compared to the control group of study participants who did not take Mito-MES, Mito-MES reduced severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection when given 3–5 days post exposure in study participants after high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Mito-MES is the only mitochondrial antioxidant approved for oral human use with proven safety in clinical trials for redox stress-related diseases such as Hepatitis C and Parkinson disease.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Given that Mito-MES is an over-the-counter safe diet supplement that can be immediately available in humans in the setting of high-grade exposure to SARS-CoV-2, our real-world proof-of-concept open label exploratory clinical trial, suggests that Mito-MES may represent a rapidly applicable post exposure prophylaxis treatment against development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
              <p id="p0180">We considered the open label design (that has known limitations) as <italic>feasible</italic> and an important <italic>first</italic> step to obtain <italic>proof-of-concept</italic> data that Mito-MES can inhibit development of SARS-CoV-2 infection when given <italic>as soon as possible</italic>. MES was provided to all study participants immediately after informed consent so that it would be available for <italic>immediate</italic> use after <italic>anticipated</italic> exposure to confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2. This study design cannot be <italic>easily</italic> performed in the setting of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT). For example, in the Phase 2/3 EPIC-PEP (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) RCT with <italic>unvaccinated</italic> study participants, paxlovid was given within <italic>5 days</italic> post exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (when SARS-CoV-2 is often established) and <italic>failed</italic> to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy (unpublished data).

              <p id="p0195">Our study has limitations. Our clinical trial was not placebo controlled, was open label and was susceptible to selection bias. Since data were self-reported by phone there is inherent reporting bias. Our clinical trial was a small proof of concept <italic>exploratory</italic> study. Although, sample size calculations were not performed in the setting of an <italic>exploratory</italic> study, our study was able to show therapeutic efficacy with regards to the primary endpoint. Since the performance of the EPIC-PEP RCT, rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections within the same person and variable immunizations among people, would necessitate a much larger PEP study in thousands of <italic>vaccinated and/or previously infected people</italic> to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy (prevention of severe disease). This study would not be feasible at this time. Alternatively, our <italic>feasible</italic> small open label study with initiation of intervention <italic>as soon as possible</italic>, showed therapeutic efficacy (prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>per se</italic>).</p>
              <p id="p0200">People in the control group in our study did not receive Mito-MES and tended to be symptomatic (57.5%, a higher rate of symptomatic disease than control groups in other COVID-19 studies). This is because asymptomatic people do not often test repeatedly to meet our stringent inclusion criteria with 4 mandatory SARS-CoV-2 negative diagnostic tests (to reliable rule out false negative results). The therapeutic efficacy of Mito-MES outside of the 72-h window for PEP remains unclear since our small study only included 6 participants who received Mito-MES after 72 h and who had reduced symptom severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compliance was only assessed by questionnaires and not by blood levels of Mito-MES. As outlined in the study design, our study was a real-world pragmatic study of outpatients who by definition were not hospitalized and had mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The focus of the study was on the exposed household study participants and not the index cases. Thus, the severity score of symptoms in the index cases was not recorded. The exact time of infection in which the index case was positive for SARS-CoV-2 could not be determined in the setting of real-world setting. Our study also has confounding and data from our study populations may not be generalizable to other populations who take post exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we did not perform quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR and determination of SARS-CoV-2 variants since this was a real-world study outside of the setting of standardized collection of NP swabs and use of identical PCR method to measure SARS-CoV-2. However, the dominant circulating strain in the US at the time of the study was the Omicron (BA.1) SARS-CoV-2 variant.</p>
              <p id="p0205">Our study was pragmatic and may have under-reported harm. Although no major adverse effects were reported by patients using established questionnaires of patient reported outcomes, the collection of safety data was not performed in the setting of a RCT to accurately report side effects. Thus, the incidence of side effects associated with the intervention (Mito-MES) may be higher than reported herein. This limitation of the current study will be addressed by our ongoing RCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0040">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT05886816" id="intref0045">NCT05886816</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="p0210">Generalizability of trial findings is limited to SARS-CoV-2 variants that were studied at the time of this study. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants may have higher transmissibility and Mito-MES may not fully inhibit SARS-CoV-2 transmission within 72 h after exposure to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings may not be generalizable in high-risk immunocompromised patients who are at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
              <p id="p0215">Thus, despite these limitations, our study succeeded to show highly potent antiviral efficacy with regards to the primary endpoint (development of SARS-CoV-2 infection) <italic>even in unvaccinated cancer patients</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).
