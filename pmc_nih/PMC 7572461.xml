                <p id="Par1">Pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH<sup>−</sup>, high-dose, intravenous vitamin C) is cytotoxic to tumor cells in doses achievable in humans. Phase I studies in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) utilizing P-AscH<sup>−</sup> have demonstrated increases in progression free survival, suggesting a reduction in metastatic disease burden. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> on metastatic PDAC. Several in vitro and in vivo mechanisms involved in PDAC metastases were investigated following treatment with P-AscH<sup>−</sup>. Serum from PDAC patients in clinical trials with P-AscH<sup>−</sup> were tested for the presence and quantity of circulating tumor cell-derived nucleases. P-AscH<sup>−</sup> inhibited invasion, basement membrane degradation, decreased matrix metalloproteinase expression, as well as clonogenic survival and viability during exposure to fluid shear stress. In vivo<italic>,</italic> P-AscH<sup>−</sup> significantly decreased formation of ascites, tumor burden over time, circulating tumor cells, and hepatic metastases. Both in vitro and in vivo findings were reversed with the addition of catalase suggesting that the effect of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> on metastatic disease is mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Finally, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreased CTC-derived nucleases in subjects with stage IV PDAC in a phase I clinical trial. We conclude that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> attenuates the metastatic potential of PDAC and may prove to be effective for treating advanced disease.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death with over 45,750 fatal cases reported annually in the U.S. alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The incidence of PDAC continues to rise and 5-year survival rates for patients with metastatic disease is still currently below 3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Systemic chemotherapy provides only temporary benefits in advanced metastatic disease whereas it prolongs survival in the adjuvant setting presumably by targeting microscopic foci of local and distant disease. Clearly, a major research effort is required to better understand the mechanisms regulating metastatic disease in this malignancy.
</p>
              <p id="Par3">Previous studies suggest that the primary tumor in PDAC may grow for several years before producing metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, Rhim and colleagues demonstrated that PDAC has the ability to invade and enter the bloodstream very early, even prior to the detection of a primary tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Consistent with these latter findings, nearly 75% of patients present with metastatic disease, demonstrating that the tendency for PDAC to progress early and aggressively contributes to the lethal nature of this disease.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Our group and others have demonstrated that high-dose, intravenous, pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH<sup>−</sup>) is cytotoxic and induces oxidative stress selectively in PDAC cells but not in normal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. P-AscH<sup>−</sup> cytotoxicity occurs when P-AscH<sup>−</sup> undergoes auto-oxidation resulting in the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, phase I clinical trials have demonstrated P-AscH<sup>−</sup> to be safe and well tolerated in combination with standard of care chemotherapeutics (gemcitabine + erlotinib, gemcitabine alone, and gemcitabine + radiation) for the treatment of PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We hypothesized that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> has the potential to inhibit PDAC metastases which is based on three distinct observations. First, previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress inhibits distant tumor metastases in an in vivo model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. P-AscH<sup>−</sup>, which causes oxidative stress in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, would lead to an inhibition in PDAC metastases. Second, combining epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibition with chemotherapy reduces chemoresistance in PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, again strongly supporting the role of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> in reducing metastatic disease by inhibiting the EMT process and tumor cell invasion via a potential peroxide-mediated mechanism. Finally, two phase I studies (NCT 01049880 &amp; NCT 01852890)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> at The University of Iowa demonstrated that patients receiving P-AscH<sup>−</sup> had increased progression free survival compared to historical controls in both studies, suggesting that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> can reduce metastatic disease burden in PDAC.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Our current study demonstrates that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> inhibits invasion and degradation of the basement membrane as well as matrix metalloproteinases associated with metastatic disease progression in metabolically active PDAC cells in vitro<italic>.</italic> In a model relevant to the survival of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, PDAC cells treated with P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases clonogenic survival along with viability during exposure to fluid shear stress of cells in suspension. Also, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases CTCs, hepatic metastases, and development of ascites in vivo, which appears to be mediated by peroxide generation. Finally, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases circulating tumor cell derived nucleases in patients with stage IV PDAC. P-AscH<sup>−</sup> represents an entirely novel adjuvant to treat PDAC. Recent advances in treatment success have only led to modest improvements, so relatively non-toxic adjuvants (i.e., P-AscH<sup>−</sup>) that could improve outcome and be easily implemented in multi-center trials would be highly significant.</p>

                <p id="Par7">To determine the ability for cells to invade through the extracellular matrix (ECM) an invasion assay was performed. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A–D and Supplemental Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> demonstrate that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases invasion in the PDAC cells BXPC-3 and PANC-1 as well as the patient derived cell line 339.

Several phase I clinical trials of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> in patients with advanced cancers have been performed. The focus of these initial trails was on pharmacokinetics, dosing, resulting ascorbate plasma concentrations, and safety. They demonstrate that intravenous administration of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> can achieve plasma concentrations as high as 1–30 mM and show that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> is safe, well tolerated and with potential efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Our current study demonstrates that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> inhibits the mechanisms involved in metastatic disease in PDAC. Additionally, our animal models show that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> reduces the capacity for PDAC cells to exist in the circulation.</p>
              <p id="Par15">A hallmark component of cancer cell metastasis is the ability for cells to migrate and invade through the extracellular matrix. In PANC-1 PDAC cells, Polireddy et al. demonstrated a decrease in migration and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, this result was seen in gastric cancer, and the effects were reversed with the addition of catalase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our current study corroborates their findings and extends these observations by demonstrating that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediates this decrease in invasion. One of the first steps of tumor cell invasion is the release of surface proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. MMPS are secreted by invadopodia, which are actin-rich structures present a the basal surface of cancer cells (typically with high metastatic potential) that can cross extracellular barriers and degrade the ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Our current study expands these findings by again demonstrating P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases in MMP-2 expression and invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation via a hydrogen peroxide mediated mechanism.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The systemic response of PDAC to treatment is difficult to objectively assess. Currently, clinicians rely on changes in tumor size and location on conventional imaging to determine the extent of disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), however, do offer insight into systemic disease behavior and have been used in PDAC and other malignancies to predict tumor progression and measure response to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. CTCs represent an intermediate in metastatic colonization because they first need to survive detachment induced cell death (anoikis). Although P-AscH<sup>−</sup> significantly impairs clonogenic survival in several PDAC cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, these assays have been previously done by treating cells under adherent conditions. Since PDAC cells have been shown to form metastases by entering the blood stream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> might be effective at decreasing the survival of PDAC cells treated in suspension, which would more closely mimic the biology of circulating tumor cells. Our current study shows that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> had a more potent effect on PDAC cells when they were treated in suspension rather than under adherent conditions. Although this treatment did not affect short-term viability, it did significantly reduce the clonogenic potential of these cells. This result is consistent with studies demonstrating that detachment-induced cell death results from increased oxidative burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">While in circulation, CTCs are exposed to a fluid microenvironment in the bloodstream that is quite different from the environment cancer cells typically encounter in solid tissues. One aspect of this microenvironment is exposure to hemodynamic forces including fluid shear stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that cells exposed to FSS are in a more oxidative state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and that oxidative stress can inhibit the formation of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In this study, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> sensitized PDAC cells in suspension to FSS-induced cell death. Moreover, the effect was shown to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide when the addition of catalase reversed the effect. Our previous work has demonstrated that transformed cells from many histologic origins, including PDAC cells, are resistant to FSS as compared to non-transformed controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. FSS resistance is, in part, driven by RhoA-actomyosin dependent mechano-adaptation of CTCs to FSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Exposure to FSS has been shown to induce oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, suggesting that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> treatment further advances PDAC to a more oxidative environment leading to toxicity.</p>
              <p id="Par18">The experimental studies that support PDAC progression in which the seeding of distant organs occurs before, and in parallel to, tumor formation at the primary site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> are consistent with the clinical nature of PDAC as the majority of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Greater than 75% of patients who undergo surgical resection for non-metastatic PDAC and have negative surgical margins, still die from metastatic disease within 5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Our current study shows that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> can decrease the metastatic potential of PDAC in vivo. In a primary tumor model, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> slows tumor growth, reduces visible hepatic metastases and ex-vivo liver bioluminescence, reduces ascites formation, and decreases levels of CTCs. However, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> prior to splenic injection of PDAC cells did not decrease bioluminescence, retroperitoneal tumor formation, or visible liver metastases compared to control mice, suggesting that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> does not alter the environment to impede metastatic colonization but instead exerts its effects directly on the metastatic PDAC cells.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress inhibits distant tumor metastases in an in vivo model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Successful melanoma metastases underwent reversible metabolic changes during metastasis that increased their capacity to withstand oxidative stress. Antioxidants promoted distant metastasis in tumor bearing mice without significantly affecting the growth of subcutaneous tumors. In addition, detachment-induced reactive oxygen species has been found to inhibit fatty acid oxidation during ATP deficiency that occurs following detachment of epithelial cells from the ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Antioxidants can reverse this inhibition and assist in survival and enhance colony formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Similarly, our in vivo findings utilizing H1299T-CAT cells expressing doxycycline inducible catalase, show that the downregulating effects of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> on MMP-2 expression can be reversed when the antioxidant catalase is present. Combined, these findings suggest that oxidative stress may limit distant metastasis, which supports our hypothesis of using P-AscH<sup>−</sup> to induce oxidative stress, leading to decreases in metastatic disease in PDAC.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has shown promise as a biomarker to improve early tumor detection, prognostic stratification, and monitoring of tumor dynamics. First, detection of mutant KRAS ctDNA prior to surgery or in the immediate postoperative period predicts a higher likelihood of tumor recurrence and poorer survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Second, rising mutant KRAS ctDNA during postoperative follow-up anticipates radiographic/clinical recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Current studies have demonstrated potential clinical applicability in longitudinal monitoring of PDAC subjects to provide predictive and prognostic information that was relevant to therapeutic decisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, while others have shown that CTC-derived nucleases can be exploited for signal amplification in detection methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases CTC-derived nucleases in subjects with stage 4 metastatic PDAC while P-AscH<sup>−</sup> treatment had little effect on CTC-derived nucleases in patients with loco-regional PDAC without distant metastases. Taken together, these data suggest that P-AscH<sup>−</sup> may be beneficial in decreasing metastatic disease.</p>
              <p id="Par21">In summary, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> inhibits invasion and degradation of the basement membrane as well as MMPs in PDAC. Through a peroxide mediated mechanism, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases clonogenic survival along with viability during fluid shear stress of PDAC cells in suspension, while decreasing CTCs, hepatic metastases, and development of ascites in different models of PDAC metastases. In human studies, P-AscH<sup>−</sup> decreases circulating tumor cell-derived nucleases in subjects with stage IV PDAC. Further studies have been initiated by our group to determine the clinical utility of P-AscH<sup>−</sup> in a current, ongoing randomized phase II trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, NCT 02905578).</p>
