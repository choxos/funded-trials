                <p id="Par1">Spinal cord stimulation enhanced restoration of motor function following spinal cord injury (SCI) in unblinded studies. To determine whether training combined with transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tSCS), with or without systemic serotonergic treatment with buspirone (busp), could improve hand function in individuals with severe hand paralysis following SCI, we assessed ten subjects in a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study. All treatments—busp, tSCS, and the busp plus tSCS—reduced muscle tone and spasm frequency. Buspirone did not have any discernible impact on grip force or manual dexterity when administered alone or in combination with tSCS. In contrast, grip force, sinusoidal force generation and grip-release rate improved significantly after 6 weeks of tSCS in 5 out of 10 subjects who had residual grip force within the range of 0.1–1.5 N at the baseline evaluation. Improved hand function was sustained in subjects with residual grip force 2–5 months after the tSCS and buspirone treatment. We conclude that tSCS combined with training improves hand strength and manual dexterity in subjects with SCI who have residual grip strength greater than 0.1 N. Buspirone did not significantly improve the hand function nor add to the effect of stimulation.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with a drastic reduction of upper extremity function, especially in the hands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Decreased hand strength and dexterity after cervical SCI significantly impairs quality of life and the capacity for independent living<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Patients with motor-complete injuries often maintain some functional supraspinal connections caudal to the injury. Although the brain may still be able to communicate with paralyzed muscles, these spared supraspinal connections are insufficient to activate paralyzed limbs in the absence of additional therapy. Non-invasive electrical stimulation on the cervical spine using transcutaneous electrodes or transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) has improved upper extremity strength and control. Prior investigations of transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation mainly evaluated the maximum gripping force, but other voluntary hand functions such as dexterity were not evaluated. Furthermore, in previous studies on subjects with motor-complete and motor-incomplete injuries, the sustained effects on upper extremity were not evaluated post-treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Several studies suggest that the co-administration of serotonergic agonists can enhance the effects of spinal cord stimulation and improve functional recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Buspirone, a direct serotonin 1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) receptor agonist with minimal side effects, augmented the effects of spinal cord stimulation in tetraplegic subjects who recovered control of the hands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, buspirone facilitated the neural plasticity in motor recovery after the spinal cord injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of tSCS and buspirone on both gripping force and hand dexterity as well as the lasting effect after the completion of treatments. We compared the separate and combined effects of tSCS and buspirone on voluntary hand function in an evaluator blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study in subjects with severe, motor complete cervical SCIs (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and baseline AIS score as well as the mean, SD and N of maximum grip force (in Newtons) across all baseline trials (6 weeks) for each subject.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">ID</th><th align="left">Group</th><th align="left">Sex</th><th align="left">Age</th><th align="left">Level</th><th align="left">Years post injury</th><th align="left">AIS</th><th align="left">Maximum grip force mean (N)</th><th align="left">SD ( ±)</th><th align="left">Number of baseline trials</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">S1</td><td align="left">NF</td><td align="left">M</td><td char="." align="char">62</td><td align="left">C3</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td align="left">A</td><td char="." align="char">0.0037</td><td char="." align="char">0.0032</td><td char="." align="char">36</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S2</td><td align="left">NF</td><td align="left">F</td><td char="." align="char">22</td><td align="left">C4</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td align="left">B</td><td char="." align="char">0.0095</td><td char="." align="char">0.0075</td><td char="." align="char">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S3</td><td align="left">NF</td><td align="left">M</td><td char="." align="char">63</td><td align="left">C5</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td align="left">A</td><td char="." align="char">0.0075</td><td char="." align="char">0.0016</td><td char="." align="char">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S4</td><td align="left">NF</td><td align="left">M</td><td char="." align="char">27</td><td align="left">C6</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td align="left">A</td><td char="." align="char">0.0215</td><td char="." align="char">0.0071</td><td char="." align="char">33</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S5</td><td align="left">NF</td><td align="left">F</td><td char="." align="char">24</td><td align="left">C5</td><td char="." align="char">8</td><td align="left">B</td><td char="." align="char">0.0126</td><td char="." align="char">0.0039</td><td char="." align="char">72</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S6</td><td align="left">F</td><td align="left">F</td><td char="." align="char">22</td><td align="left">C7</td><td char="." align="char">9</td><td align="left">A</td><td char="." align="char">0.2038</td><td char="." align="char">0.0707</td><td char="." align="char">72</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S7</td><td align="left">F</td><td align="left">F</td><td char="." align="char">26</td><td align="left">C4</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td align="left">B</td><td char="." align="char">0.3450</td><td char="." align="char">0.0721</td><td char="." align="char">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S8</td><td align="left">F</td><td align="left">M</td><td char="." align="char">28</td><td align="left">C5</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td align="left">B</td><td char="." align="char">1.0929</td><td char="." align="char">0.2235</td><td char="." align="char">36</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S9</td><td align="left">F</td><td align="left">M</td><td char="." align="char">40</td><td align="left">C6</td><td char="." align="char">14</td><td align="left">B</td><td char="." align="char">1.2636</td><td char="." align="char">0.2618</td><td char="." align="char">81</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S10</td><td align="left">F</td><td align="left">M</td><td char="." align="char">30</td><td align="left">C5</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td align="left">A</td><td char="." align="char">1.3434</td><td char="." align="char">0.2873</td><td char="." align="char">36</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

                <p id="Par4">Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded bilaterally from electrodes placed on eight muscles: deltoid (DEL), biceps brachii (BIC), triceps brachii (TRIC), brachioradialis (BRAD), extensor digitorum (ED), flexor digitorum superficialis (FD), hypothenar (HThen), and thenar muscles (Then) with a fixed 17 mm interelectrode distance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Ground electrodes were placed bilaterally on the acromion. EMG signals were amplified (Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, CA), band pass filtered 10 Hz to 5 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz with a 16 channel A/D board and analyzed with customized LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX).</p>

                <title>Hand dynamometer</title>
                <p id="Par5">Each subject’s hand strength and manual dexterity were measured using a hand dynamometer (Handgrip, MediSens Wireless, Santa Clara, CA). The device measured grip force by displaying visual targets and a tracker to represent forces exerted upon the device’s handle. Subjects were asked to squeeze the device in a stereotypical pattern to manipulate a visual tracker during the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), sine force generation and oscillation between grip and release (OSC) without engaging the arm or wrist for movement assistance. Each subject performed the MVC task by squeezing and holding the dynamometer handle three times for 5 s followed by a 10 s rest within a 45 s period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Sine force generation tested grip control and entailed alternatively squeezing and releasing the handle for 45 s while attempting to trace a sinusoidal pattern displayed on the computer screen. We quantified the average distance between the displayed MVC sinusoidal pattern and each subject’s trace to infer fine motor control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In the OSC task, the subject squeezed the handle to draw traces on a moving background as rapidly as possible for 10 s while attempting to exceed 75% of the subject’s MVC.

The next four phases of the study were: a placebo + sham tSCS (phase 2), buspirone or tSCS (phase 3), whichever treatment, buspirone or tSCS, that had not previously been used (phase 4), and tSCS + buspirone (phase 5). The order of phases 3 and 4 was randomized. Sham stimulation consisted of perceptible stimulation administered at one-tenth of the treatment stimulation intensity. Subjects took either buspirone (10 mg) twice a day or an identical placebo dispensed by the UCLA Clinical Trial Pharmacy during each study period. The last phase (phase 6) consisted of a 5-month washout period in which no treatment was given to the subjects.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of study design and tasks performed.

The number of training sessions varied between 12 and 18 sessions, which was dictated by the unavoidable intercurrent illnesses in the patients. Two subjects were unable to complete the study based on decisions unrelated to the study. Among the remaining 10 subjects, at the end of the Baseline phase after 20 weeks of physical therapy and training of the hand grip test procedures, five subjects generated a grip force between 0.1 and 1.5 N (Group F, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), whereas the remaining 5 subjects could not generate a grip force ≥ 0.1 N (Group NF, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">During Phase 1, subjects performed the MVC, sine, and oscillation tasks during two sessions per week to train the subjects to the tasks. Furthermore, the evoked potential stimulation with 1 Hz were performed after all the hand function training to select the optimal stimulation intensity for each individual subject. These assessment tasks were performed three times consecutively, and the entire series of tasks was repeated three times. Each task was conducted first in the absence of stimulation, followed by three repetitions with stimulation applied at 30 Hz starting 15 s prior to task initiation and maintained at a constant frequency and intensity until the task was completed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Initially, the tSCS was set at an intensity at which the subject’s hand contracted and generated 25% of the maximum MVC of the patient. In subjects in whom tSCS elicited no measurable displacement of the hand, the maximum tolerable intensity, as well as two lesser intensities (− 20 and − 10 mA) were tested. The stimulation intensity that most effectively increased hand strength and manual dexterity in each subject was selected for the application of genuine stimulation during the study. If a subject requested a reduced stimulation intensity during a study session, stimulation was reduced in increments of 10 percent until the subject was comfortable. A 1-month washout period was observed following these preliminary assessments in Phase 1.</p>

                <p id="Par15">The responses to tSCS, buspirone, or combined treatment varied as a function of the motor force group. In Group F, buspirone plus sham tSCS did not increase MVC nor improve the sine test compared to placebo and sham tSCS. However, buspirone plus sham tSCS was associated with improved OSC performance compared to the double placebo condition (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The combination of tSCS plus placebo drug significantly enhanced MVC force (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), the sine test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and the OSC rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) compared to sham treatment plus sham tSCS. Combining buspirone to tSCS did not further increase the MCV, the sine test force or the OSC rate beyond the effect of tSCS alone (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, respectively). There was no improvement in the NF group in any of the three motor tasks after any of the treatment conditions compared to sham treatment despite ongoing physical therapy. The level of injury of the subjects was between C3 and C7, where as the stimulation delivered was at the C4-5 level. The level of injury did not seem to modify the responses induced by tSCS. The primary determining factor of responsiveness to tSCS and training was the magnitude of the residual baseline hand grip force generated by the patient, which was greater than 0.1 N in those subjects who responded to the experimental interventions. These observations confirmed that tSCS and motor training improved hand function in subjects with some minimal residual grip force, but not in those without residual grip force.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The performance of MVC test in Group F and NF.

Though various neuromodulatory methods have been used for decades, the optimal use of electrical stimulation is still evolving. Epidural stimulation of the cervical cord in the setting of SCI increased grip strength and fine control of hand movement. Non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation (tSCS) of the cervical cord with or without physical training also facilitated recovery of upper limb functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par21">In the current study, all the enrolled patients had motor and sensory findings consistent with either ISNCSCI/AIS Grade A or B (nine ISNCSCI/AIS A and one ISNCSCI/AIS B), but half the patients had some residual muscle strength after receiving physical therapy alone (MCV &gt; 0.1 and &lt; 1.4 N) and the other half had no residual muscle strength despite months of physical therapy (MCV &lt; 0.1 N). Administration of buspirone alone did not consistently increase muscle strength or hand coordination in either the F or NF Group. Transcutaneous SCS improved hand grip strength and hand coordination/control in the F Group, but not in the NF Group. Adding buspirone to tSCS provided no additional benefit to the F Group over that benefit available from tSCS alone. The functional assessments of motor performance and spasticity tended to follow the tests of hand grip strength and coordination: the F Group showed improvements across a variety of functional assessments, though the changes were modest at best, and the NF Group showed no changes in functional assessments despite receiving months of physical therapy. Grip force assessments were performed twice a week throughout the entire physical therapy period. This allowed the patients to practice with the assessment protocol as well as to evaluate whether physical therapy could further improve grip performance. The patients were then grouped based on their grip force from the hand grip assessments in the last week of the physical therapy period (Phase I).</p>
              <p id="Par22">While tSCS improved hand strength and motor control in patients with some residual hand strength, the improvement was less substantial than the previously reported two-fold increase in maximal hand strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This could be explained by two factors. First, the subjects in the present study were more severely injured compared to the previous study. The average baseline hand strength for all 10 subjects after physical therapy was below 1.4 N, which was less than the average 5 N grip strength in the previous study. Thus, we believe that some minimal residual hand function is necessary for improvement after tSCS and ongoing physical therapy. Moreover, the extent of improvement after tSCS may be proportional to the residual hand strength and coordination present following physical therapy. Three of the subjects (S7, S8, and S9) with residual hand force (Group F) maintained the improvement in hand function for up to 5 months after treatment without additional training or tSCS treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), indicating that those subjects with greater residual hand grip strength were also the subjects who seemed to derive sustained benefit from the tSCS intervention. Therefore, if subjects being studied have more severe deficits and less residual function, neuromodulation is less likely to be effective as the degree of residual motor function is indicative of the extent to which the neural structures controlling hand grip and coordination are preserved and available for neurorehabilitation. The mechanism of neuromodulatory rehabilitation relies on enhancing residual neural function and recruiting additional neural elements to support the accomplishment of motor tasks. For these mechanisms to operate, there must be some minimum residual neural elements to work with after the injury. We wondered if the severity of initial injury is predictive of the capacity for neurorehabilitative effect from tSCS, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained early following acute spinal trauma did not strongly correlate with the chronic motor and sensory effects of SCI. Therefore, a grip force larger than 0.05–0.1 N may be a better indicator of patients’ capacity to gain motor function from tSCS following SCI.</p>
              <p id="Par23">We also investigated whether buspirone could facilitate functional benefits without or with stimulation in these patients with only minimal hand grip forces. Buspirone has been used previously in combination with SCS and training, but none of those studies investigated the relationship between the treatment effect and residual motor function. In the present evaluator blinded, cross-over study, buspirone was largely ineffective in modulating hand grip. However, buspirone significantly reduced the occurrence of spasms, especially in the F group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Penn-frequency test, Baseline vs Medication), within which the subjects had less severe motor paralysis. Although the results from the Modified Ashworth and Penn-severity tests showed no significant decreases in the severity of the spasms in the NF and F groups, tSCS and buspirone tended to decrease the overall spasticity (Modified Ashworth and VAS) and the occurrence of spasms (Penn-frequency) in the NF group. Given that spasms significantly reduce quality of life in patients with SCI, the reduced spasms may represent a real benefit of buspirone and/or tSCS, even though that was not the main focus of this study.</p>
              <p id="Par24">There was a trend in Group F for a greater response to buspirone-only and stimulation plus buspirone in ISNCSCI/ASIA-light touch and ISNCSCI /ASIA-pin prick tests, which may indicate that buspirone improves sensory feedback in patients with limited residue hand motor function.</p>
              <p>The limitations of this study are three-fold. First, the evaluators were blinded to treatment conditions and the order of the treatment, and subjects were blinded to the order of drug treatment. We tried to keep the subjects blind to the stimulation conditions by not informing subjects about the expected outcomes of the study and the onset or the intensity of the stimulation. However, as the stimulation intensity of sham versus treatment was detectably different, the subjects were not fully blinded to the treatment condition. Thus, the lack of sensory input from the sham session might be correlated with a low motivation level of the patients, which could lead to a relatively poor motor outcome. Second, this study offers a partial answer to the question whether buspirone may improve motor function in the setting of training and stimulation after SCI. Buspirone appeared to reduce spasms in the subjects in this study, but it did not improve grip function in these same subjects. Therefore, we may conclude that the dose of buspirone that we tested did not seem to ameliorate hand grip function either alone or in combination with tSCS, but a more effective buspirone dose may be found in subsequent studies. Last, although tSCS induced significant improvements in both the force and dexterity in hand grip, there was no statistically significant increase observed in the ISNCSCI /ASIA-motor and all four GRASSP measurements among different treatment groups. More research is required to further translate these tSCS-induced improvements to general hand functions for these subjects with severe SCI who have residual grip strength greater than 0.1 N.</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p id="Par25">We demonstrated that a sham-controlled trial that tSCS combined with training can improve hand function, both strength and movement control, in severely impaired subjects with some detectable grip strength. These findings are consistent with two previous reports of improved motor function in response to tSCS combined with physical training. Unlike the preceding investigations, this study included subjects who had no baseline hand function. While the transcutaneous stimulation showed more significant effects improving motor function and the force of hand grip in the patients with SCI and some residual hand strength, buspirone had a bigger role in improving the sensory function of the hand. The combination of tSCS and buspirone did not show a significant additive effect compared to the tSCS only group. Most importantly, our study demonstrated that the extent of residual hand grip function can effectively predict the extent of rehabilitation in response to neuromodulation and medication in the chronic stage of SCI. This suggests a novel method of predicting the treatment responses and selecting therapies for patient with SCI years after the original injury.</p>
