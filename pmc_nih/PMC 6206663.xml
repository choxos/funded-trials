                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Consumption of foods and beverages rich in sugar remains high across all races and ages in the United States. Interventions to address childhood obesity and decrease sugar intake are needed, particularly in low-income settings.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2"><italic>B’more Healthy Communities for Kids</italic> (BHCK) was a group-randomized, controlled trial implemented among 9–15-year olds in 30 low-income areas of Baltimore. We increased access to low-sugar foods and beverages at wholesalers and small food stores. Concurrently, we encouraged their purchase and consumption by children through youth-led nutrition education in recreation centers, in-store promotions, text messaging and a social media program directed at caregivers. Sugar consumption (sugar sweetened beverage (SSB), sweets) in youth was assessed pre- (<italic>n</italic> = 534) and post-intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 401) using the Block Kids Food Frequency Questionnaire. Purchasing of 38 healthier and 28 less healthier food/beverage varieties in the previous 7 days was assessed via self-report. Multilevel models at the community and individual levels were used. Analyses were stratified by age (younger: 9–12-year olds (<italic>n</italic> = 339) vs older: 13–15 (<italic>n</italic> = 170)). Models were controlled for child’s sex, race, total daily caloric intake, and caregiver’s age and sex.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Overall baseline mean healthier food purchasing was 2.5 (<underline>+</underline> 3.6; min. 0, max. 34 items per week), and unhealthier food purchasing 4.6 (<underline>+</underline> 3.7; 0–19 items per week). Mean intake at baseline for kcal from SSB was 176 (<underline>+</underline> 189.1) and 153 (<underline>+</underline> 142.5), and % of calories from sweets (i.e. cookies, cakes, pies, donuts, candy, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and chocolate beverages) was 15.9 (<underline>+</underline> 9.7) and 15.9 (+ 7.7) in comparison and intervention youth, respectively. Intervention youth increased healthier foods and beverages purchases by 1.4 more items per week than comparison youth (β = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.1; 2.8). After the intervention, there was a 3.5% decrease in kcal from sweets for older intervention youth, compared to the control group (β = − 3.5; 95% CI: -7.76; − 0.05). No impact was seen on SSB consumption.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">BHCK successfully increased healthier food purchasing variety in youth, and decreased % calories from sweet snacks in older youth. Multilevel, multicomponent environmental childhood obesity programs are a promising strategy to improve eating behaviors among low-income urban youth.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par19">The diet of youths today, especially in low-income, underserved urban populations, is high in refined carbohydrates, added sugar, fats, and salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sugar intake is an important risk factor for diet-related chronic diseases, such as overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], type-2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and poor dental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">A recent meta-analysis of cohort studies in children reported a significantly increased risk of being overweight or obese with consumption of one or more daily servings of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although SSB consumption has declined slightly over the past decade, intake remains high, especially in youth, representing 10–15% of total caloric intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Importantly, African-American and Hispanic youth had greater increases in calories from sugar per capita than their white counterparts over the past three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, a recent nationally-representative study reported no decline (at 14% of total daily energy (calorie) intake) in the percentage of the total daily caloric intake from added sugar in U.S. children in the past decade, when considering both foods and beverages intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These findings suggest that foods such as grain-based desserts, candy, and other sweet snacks are important contributors of added sugar in children’s diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Children with higher intake of sugary beverages tend to snack more often than those with lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, snacking patterns have changed in the past decade, as low-income children increased purchase and consumption of foods high in sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and increased consumption of foods away from home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Snacks may significantly contribute to daily caloric intake, surpassing 27% of total daily calories among U.S. children aged 2–18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Dietary patterns are strongly influenced by a person’s food environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Food marketing and advertisements of unhealthier foods disproportionally target low-income minority populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that living in low-income areas where access to healthy food is limited increases risk of poor diets and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Low-income individuals tend to live closer to small food stores with less availability of healthier foods and greater access to high-energy density food of low nutritional value, and increased portion sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In Baltimore, low-income African-American youth reported visiting small food stores on average twice a day and buying chips, candy, and soda 2.5, 1.8, and 1.4 times per week, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Philadelphia, 42% of low-income school-aged children shopped at corner stores twice a day, purchasing 350 calories each visit in candy, chips and SSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Given the patterns in access to and marketing of unhealthier foods in low-income urban areas and the negative health outcomes associated with their consumption, there is a need to improve the community food environment. Due to the complex nature of eating behavior, solutions at the different levels of the socio ecological model (i.e., multilevel) paired with multiple actions within the same level (i.e., multicomponent) provide a promising population-based approach to leverage the food systems to promote health. Community-based intervention trials aiming at changing the food environment in and around the individual by improving availability and affordability of healthier foods at the community-level and concurrently improving demand and health literacy at the individual-level may be effective in reducing intake of high-sugar, high-fat beverages and snacks<bold>.</bold> The Shape Up Somerville (SUS) is one example of community-based multilevel multicomponent obesity prevention program that partnered with schools, restaurants and farmers’ market to improve availability of healthy menu options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and successfully increased availability of healthy foods in schools’ food service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SUS found a statistically significant decrease in Body Mass Index (BMI) z-scores in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and reduction in SSB intake after 2 years of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">However, most community-based interventions have promoted healthier food alternatives at food stores targeting adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and most multilevel interventions have been primarily school-based, targeted elementary- and middle-school -aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and few have demonstrated an impact on sugar intake or measured purchasing behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for community-based intervention trials to test strategies that target older children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, previous longitudinal studies have reported important differences in food patterns across youth ages, with older youth (&gt; 12 years old) snacking and purchasing foods out of the home more frequently than younger youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to investigate impact of nutrition interventions at different ages due to different food behaviors and societal eating norms, increased caloric intake, and changes in body composition.</p>

A fourth phase (review) was implemented in wave 2 only. During the healthier beverages phase, the program promoted healthier alternatives to SSBs [i.e., lower-sugar fruit drinks (25–75% less sugar than the original version), sugar-free drink mixes, zero-calorie flavored water, diet or low-sugar soda, and water] as part of each component (social media, small food stores, recreation center, youth-leader, wholesaler, policy) across all levels (individual, household, environmental, and policy). During the healthier snacks phase, BHCK promoted low-fat and low-sugar alternatives to unhealthier snacks, including low-fat yogurt, low-fat popcorn, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, low-sugar granola bars, and mixed fruit in 100% fruit juice. In the healthier cooking phase, the intervention promoted cooking ingredients, such as low-sugar cereals, low-fat milk, 100% whole wheat bread, fresh/canned/frozen vegetables across all BHCK components.</p>

                  <title>Corner stores and carryout restaurants</title>
                  <p id="Par34">We recruited 3–4 corner stores and carryout restaurants in each BHCK zone. We worked with storeowners in intervention zones to improve supply and demand for healthier options of food and beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Small retailers were provided with gift cards from wholesalers, a stocking sheet with the promoted items, and were encouraged to stock at least one new promoted item every other week. Moreover, storeowners watched six training videos that provided information about the program, how to best improve customer relations, and use of healthier cooking methods (carryout owners only) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. After completing each training module, owners were offered store supplies as a reward, ranging from produce baskets to refrigerators. To increase demand for healthier alternatives, we used materials and incentives (point-of-purchasing promotion and giveaways), and in-store taste tests, for example, fruit flavored water, baby carrots, and low-sugar granola bars, during two-hour educational sessions (delivered every other week in each intervention store by BHCK-interventionists). Posters and handouts promoting the food items were placed in all intervention stores.</p>

                  <p id="Par35">Prior to the intervention, youth leaders (Baltimore City college students) were trained by BHCK-interventionists in leadership and nutrition to conduct educational sessions in 14-intervention recreation centers with children through a peer-intervention approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Youth leaders were involved in the delivery of the intervention based on the perspectives of social cognitive theory, as a way to enable mentees to model mentors’ health behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Fourteen sessions implemented every other week (total of 6 months) by youth leaders followed the themes of each BHCK phase. Nutrition sessions lasted 1 h, during which youth leaders implemented the BHCK nutrition curriculum with hands-on activities related to the different sugar and fat content in each drink and snack, and introduced a traffic light labeling method for beverages and snacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Giveaways and taste-tests were also conducted at the end of each session that aligned with the lesson. All children in the 9–15-year range attending the after-school program at the time of the intervention could participate in the nutrition education sessions. Although recruitment also occurred in recreation centers, study participant youth were not required to attend intervention sessions.</p>

Recipes, news, and BHCK-specific activities related to healthier beverages and snacks were featured daily. The text message platform targeted mainly the caregiver level with goal setting strategies and BHCK educational activities for the specific BHCK zone. During each phase, caregivers received a text message 3 to 5 times a week related to healthier eating behavior. A text message example was: “<italic>Water is much better than soda, but it doesn’t have 2 be boring.

                  <p id="Par37">We worked with key city stakeholders to support policies for a healthier food environment in Baltimore, and to sustain BHCK activities. In addition, BHCK provided evidence-based information to support the development of policies at the city level using Geographic Information System (GIS)/System Science simulation model to simulate impact to aid stakeholder decision-making (e.g. urban farm tax credit, mobile meals, SSB warning labels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

In-store and recreation center nutrition sessions were open to the public and delivered to anyone who was present at the time the intervention was delivered. In the comparison zones, neither recreation centers nor small food stores received the nutrition education sessions or communication materials, and caregiver-child dyads living in these areas were not enrolled in the BHCK text-messaging program. Hence, study participants were a potential sub-sample of the total population exposed to the BHCK intervention. By design, we believed that BHCK would reach its intended population by intervening in multiple settings that are key components of the community food environment.

                  <p id="Par50">The intervention effects on the mean change in diet and food-purchasing behaviors were assessed by the difference between the mean change of the outcome in the intervention compared to the control groups using a multilevel linear mixed-effect model. The multilevel model had mixed-effect components that accounted for both fixed and random effects. The single fixed independent variable included the time-by-group interaction. The random effect allowed recreation center zone’s coefficients and the random variation among repeated measures in the youth to vary randomly at the group level. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the outcome measures at the subject-within-zone level ranged from 0.34–0.13. If the estimate was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), the null hypothesis (that mean dietary and food purchasing outcomes are equal in the intervention and control groups after the BHCK intervention) was rejected.</p>
                  <p id="Par51">Caregiver’s age (continuous), and youth’s age (continuous, centered at the mean), caregiver and youth’s sex, and race were added as covariates in the food-purchasing models. In the dietary intake models, we included the following covariates: caregiver and youth’s age and sex, youth’s race, and total daily caloric intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We found statistically significant differences between youth who were retained in the intervention versus those lost to follow-up in terms of their caregiver’s age and sex. Missing data were imputed by modeling and estimating both the means and the random effect jointly using all non-missing data in the covariate matrix (maximum likelihood estimation) to address potential bias due to loss to follow-up and to maximize sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 509) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Therefore, to control for selection bias, all models were controlled for variables that were predictors of dropout. Impact analyses were also stratified by age category: 9–12 and 13–15 year olds.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par58">To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate youth dietary behavior changes that resulted from a randomized, multilevel community food environment-based (non-school) obesity prevention trial in a low-income urban food desert setting. After the BHCK intervention, youth in the intervention group purchased almost 1.5 additional types of healthier food/beverage items per week, compared to their counterparts. This finding is supported by our other results, as BHCK was successful in improving availability of healthier foods and beverages in small food stores in intervention zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], indicating that food availability and promotion at the point-of-purchase may shape people’s food choices. Few community-based interventions have assessed the impact of the program on food purchasing behaviors in youth. For instance, a previous trial implemented in Baltimore with a similar study population did not find an impact of the intervention on food purchasing behavior among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Researchers attributed the lack of intervention effect on their limited ability to make changes at the structural level. Conversely, the BHCK trial was one of the first studies to involve wholesalers to guarantee healthier food availability throughout the food supply chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Partnering with three wholesalers in the city was one of the innovative approaches used by BHCK to ensure that storeowners would be able to find and stock promoted foods and beverages, and may have led to greater, more sustained changes in the food environment.</p>
              <p id="Par59">The age-stratified analysis demonstrated that BHCK decreased kcal intake from sweet snacks among older youth in the intervention group by 3.5% compared to their counterparts. This is encouraging, given that sweet snacks are among the most frequently purchased items by youth in corner stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Youth have almost doubled sweet snack intake in the past three decades, and it is among the main sources of added sugar intake in U.S. children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par60">Another multilevel childhood obesity intervention trial that was implemented in low-income communities in Travis County, Texas (CATCH) found a 0.6 lower unhealthier food index consumption (i.e. fatty meats, fried meat with a crust, French fries/chips, white bread, fruit punch, sodas, frozen desserts, sweet rolls/cake, chocolate candy, and other candy) among middle-school aged children in the school-plus-community arm, compared to school-only intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. A four-year childhood obesity intervention with Swedish youth that restricted access to sweets and SSBs in the school food environment was also successful in decreasing sweets intake among youth and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Compared to younger youth, older youth have an overall lower dietary quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], experience greater autonomy, and may be more influenced by the community food environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Therefore, efforts to improve the community food environment may be effective in changing dietary patterns in older youth and adolescents.</p>
              <p id="Par61">There was no significant intervention effect on fruit and vegetable consumption and SSB intake among youth. A possible explanation is that, although BHCK promoted fruit and vegetable intake at the store, recreation center, and social media/texting levels, fruits and vegetables were not the only promoted food items in the snacks and cooking phases. Furthermore, fruits and vegetables comprise only 1.0% of items purchased by low-income African-American children and adolescents in corner stores, as reported in a previous study conducted in Philadelphia, PA, U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, other multilevel childhood obesity interventions have reported a positive impact on fruit and vegetable intake in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], demonstrating that this may be an effective approach to improve youth’s diet quality. Nevertheless, future interventions should test different approaches to improve fruit and vegetable intake among low-income African-American youth, perhaps by focusing on the promotion of frozen, canned, and fresh produce, while decreasing consumption barriers such as price, food quality, and convenience. Given that African-American youth have lower dietary quality than other groups in the U.S., it is imperative that future interventions and policies focus on improving healthier food intake in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par62">Even though both healthier and unhealthier purchasing increased over time, total daily caloric intake declined from baseline to post-intervention evaluation among both groups. Although BHCK promoted low-sugar beverages and water during the beverage phase, the intervention did not restrict availability of these items in participating retail food store and in after-school programming refreshment stand/vending machines. In addition, it is possible that youth may have substituted high-fat, high-sugar beverages and snacks with lower-fat, lower-sugar options that were not captured by the BKFFQ, such as low-fat string cheese, low-sugar beverages, fruit cups in 100% juice, etc., which may help explain the decline in calorie intake observed over time. Food and beverage substitutions may also explain the lack of effect of BHCK on total daily caloric intake. Moreover, although SSB still represents more than 10% of total caloric intake, the percentage of total daily energy from SSB seems to be decreasing since 2000, and has reached a plateau among all youth ages and races in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Although the Shape Up Somerville intervention successfully decreased unhealthier intake in children (− 2.0 oz of SSB/day), they also did not find an effect of the intervention on children’s daily fruit and vegetable intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par63">Interestingly, we found that the BHCK intervention increased the number of different items purchased per week of both healthier and unhealthier foods among children 9–12 years of age. Our finding suggests that although improving availability and promotion of healthier food was effective both overall and among younger youth, this age group did not decrease the number of different items of unhealthier food items purchased. Research with 10–12 year-old youth in New York found that substitution of healthier for unhealthier food is related to how much money a child has available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], suggesting that low-income youth are more likely to change food purchasing patterns if unhealthier food prices are increased. Therefore, pricing strategies could be effective in improving healthier food purchasing in this population.</p>
              <p id="Par64">We also noted that healthier food purchasing increased substantially in both groups. A possible explanation is that all BHCK corner stores improved their Healthy Food Availability Index (HFAI) score, although the largest change was seen among intervention corner stores (mean change HFAI among comparison corner store: 1.67 versus intervention: 5.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As BHCK worked with three wholesalers, important food suppliers to all Baltimore corner stores, it is possible that other store owners not receiving the intervention were driven to stock more foods in their stores from the healthier group when exposed to newer healthier food items at the time they visited wholesalers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Furthermore, the overall increase in number of healthier foods purchased among youth over time may reflect an overall gain in purchasing power as youth get older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par65">Another explanation for the positive effect on healthier food purchasing variety (overall and among younger youth) may be the nutrition education sessions conducted with youth in recreation centers and the in-store point-of-purchase promotions with repeated taste tests of the promoted healthier snacks. This hypothesis may be supported by the fact that younger youth were more likely to be exposed to the community nutrition education intervention than older youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Furthermore, it is possible that other social and household factors influenced youth to purchase fewer types of either healthier or unhealthier foods than the environmental factors accounted for in the BHCK intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par66">Limitations to this study should be noted. First, this study experienced a higher attrition rate than initially projected (24.9%), thus decreasing the final sample size, despite efforts to avoid drop-outs (e.g. eligibility criteria included intent to stay within the study areas over the next 2 years, multiple attempts to contact the families by phone, and using household visits to conduct follow-up surveys). However, when we compared baseline characteristics between individuals with completed follow-up evaluation and missing informants regarding covariates and outcomes, we identified that youth with a female and older caregiver were more likely to remain in the study. Thus, to address potential selection bias, we included caregiver’s age and sex as covariates in all multilevel regression models, and used maximum likelihood methods to produce unbiased estimates for data missing at random. Second, randomization at the individual-level was not possible. Nevertheless, selection bias was also ameliorated by having a comparison group of youth sampled from similar neighborhoods. Given that participating youth were low-income urban African Americans, results may not be generalizable to other populations. Third, due to the nature of the multilevel, multicomponent community-based trial, it was not possible to identify which specific components of the BHCK intervention led to changes in diet and food purchasing behaviors. In addition, although the program was implemented according to our initial process evaluation standards, achieving optimal intensity of the intervention (e.g. form of delivery, duration, and frequency) is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and may partially explain the modest impact on dietary intake. Fourth, BHCK was implemented in two waves at different times (1 year apart). Although the structure of the intervention remained the same across the waves, improvements in the design of intervention materials and lessons learned from wave 1 were implemented during wave 2 (e.g.: increased size of posters, implemented ‘review phase’ to increase duration of the intervention, increased frequency of social media posts from weekly to daily). However, a sensitivity analysis with an additional interaction term to explore potential differences in impact by wave did not show any statistically significant differences between waves. Fifth, although multiple testing is a concern, we explored differences between only two categories of ages based on a priori hypothesis and distinct food-related behaviors previously reported in the literature. Lastly, to minimize respondent burden, we did not gather information on the quality or quantity of food acquired by the youth when collecting data on food purchased. Furthermore, in our food acquisition survey, we asked youth to only report on food acquisition when they were purchasing food for themselves (without including food that others purchased for them). We did not examine test-retest reliability of the youth food purchasing survey; however, information bias was minimized by the randomized design and the statistical methods employed. Future studies investigating food purchasing patterns in youth should explore changes in frequency, quantity, and amount of money spent on food.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par67">We found that intervening in the community food environment concomitantly with nutrition education in after-school settings may be a promising strategy to drive healthier food purchasing and decrease intake of sweet snacks among low-income, urban, African-American youth. Our findings support the effectiveness of a multilevel, multicomponent nutrition intervention program in improving healthier food purchasing behavior and decreasing caloric intake from less healthier foods, adding to evidence from previous studies. This study provides evidence-based information suggesting that intervening in the environment and improving healthier food access in food deserts can impact food behaviors among youth, which may lead to decreased prevalence of obesity and improved health outcomes. However, it is crucial that changes in healthier food access be supplemented by promotional activities to increase demand.</p>
