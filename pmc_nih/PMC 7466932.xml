                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The WHO recommends 20 mg/day of supplemental zinc for children with acute diarrhea for
10-14 days; in previous trials this dosage improved diarrhea but increased vomiting.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We randomly assigned 4500 children ages 6 to 59 months in India and Tanzania with acute
diarrhea to one of three arms (5, 10 or 20 mg zinc sulfate for 14 days). The three
primary outcomes were diarrhea duration &gt;5 days and mean number of stools (tested
for non-inferiority), and vomiting within 30 minutes of zinc administration (tested for
superiority).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The proportion of children with diarrhea duration &gt;5 days was 6.5%, 7.7%, 7.2%
in the 20 mg, 10 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively. The difference between 20 mg and 10
mg dosages was 1.2% (upper bound of one-sided 98.75% CI 3.6%) and between 20 mg and 5 mg
was 0.7% (upper bound 3.0%), both below the 4% noninferiority margin (4%). The mean
number of loose stools was 10.7, 10.9, and 10.8 in the 20 mg, 10 mg and 5 mg groups,
respectively. The differences between 20 mg and 10 mg groups was 0.3 (upper bound 1.1),
and between 20 mg and 5 mg group, 0.1 (upper bound 0.9), both below the noninferiority
margin (2 stools). Vomiting within 30 minutes of zinc administration occurred in 19.3%,

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Although we have witnessed a 90% decline in diarrhea deaths over the past four decades,
diarrheal diseases remain a major public health problem. In 2018, approximately 500,000
children died from diarrhea. Most of these deaths could be avoided if children received
high-quality management using the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) recommended care, which includes oral rehydration solutions
and supplemental zinc.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> WHO and UNICEF
currently recommend 20 mg zinc daily supplementation for 10–14 days in addition to
oral rehydration solutions for the management of acute diarrhea in children.<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This recommendation is based on studies
demonstrating that supplemental zinc results in a shorter duration of diarrhea, reduces
number of stools and stool output, reduces the risk of persistent diarrhea, and may reduce
the risk of subsequent illness episodes and increase weight gain.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The currently recommended dose was based on assumptions of increased zinc losses during
diarrhea and the need for additional zinc above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for
mucosal regeneration.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Replication
studies generally used the 20 mg zinc dose without any further dose-ranging studies.This
dose substantially exceeds the RDA for zinc in infancy and early childhood (2-5
mg/day).<sup><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Zinc given orally can cause vomiting due to its strong metallic taste in saliva and gastric
irritability; both of which are dose-dependent.<sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a meta-analysis of 11 acute diarrhea trials (n=4438)<sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, subjects who received supplemental zinc
were significantly more likely to vomit with the initial dose than with placebo (12.7% vs.
7.6%; RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.30 to 1.84). In another review<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, the risk of vomiting was significantly higher with zinc
supplementation in children older than age 6 months (risk ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86;
2605 children, 6 trials).</p>
              <p>Lower doses of zinc, provided they are equally effective, might have the advantage of
reducing associated vomiting. We therefore performed a randomized, double-blind controlled
trial comparing two lower doses of zinc with the current recommended dose in low- and
middle-income country settings. We hypothesized that lower zinc doses (5 or 10 mg/day)
compared with standard zinc dose (20 mg/day) would be non-inferior with respect to diarrhea
treatment efficacy, but superior with respect to side effect profile (i.e., vomiting).</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The trial’s methodology has been published and the protocol is available with this
article at nejm.org.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In brief, the
Zinc Therapeutic Dose Trial (ZTDT) was an individually randomized, parallel group,
double-blind, controlled trial of three doses of supplemental zinc among children ages 6 to
59 months in India and Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03078842).</p>
              <p>Study personnel screened all children presenting with illness to outpatient health
facilities to detect diarrhea. Subjects were children with acute diarrhea for fewer than 72
hours (defined as three or more loose or watery stools per 24 hours) or dysentery (defined
as acute diarrhea with visible blood in the stool) whose families were likely to stay within
the study area for at least 2 months after enrollment and whose caretakers provided written
informed consent. Excluded were children with any one of the following: severe acute
malnutrition (weight for length/height Z score (WHZ) of &lt;-3 or presence of edema),
severe dehydration that could not be corrected within 4 to 6 hours, severe pneumonia
(characterized by presence of fast breathing or chest in-drawing and any of the following
danger signs: inability to breastfeed or drink, lethargy or unconsciousness, convulsions, or
vomiting everything), clinically-suspected bacterial sepsis, rapid diagnostic test-confirmed
malaria, or other severe illness. In addition, children who were previously enrolled in the
study, whose siblings were currently enrolled in the study, who were currently enrolled in
another trial, or who had used zinc supplements during the three days preceding study
enrollment were excluded.</p>
              <p>Subjects were enrolled from peri-urban outpatient health facilities in two countries (India
and Tanzania). In India, recruitment took place at Sangam Vihar, a resettlement colony near
South Delhi and in Harsh Vihar, a semi-urban locality in Northeast Delhi. In Tanzania,
recruitment took place in the outpatient clinics of Temeke District Hospital and Mbagala
Rangi Tatu hospital, and the Mbagala Round Table health center, all in Dar es Salaam.</p>
              <sec id="sec2.1">
                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Children were randomly allocated to receive one of three zinc sulfate regimens; 5 mg, 10
mg or 20 mg (each taken once daily for 14 days). Study staff instructed caretakers to
dissolve the dispersible tablet in 5-10 mL of water or breastmilk immediately before
administration. After an initial dose provided under direct supervision of study staff on
the day of enrollment, children received the zinc supplementation from their caretakers
for 14 days total. Study regimen was manufactured by Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques Rodael
S.A.S, France and shipped to WHO for randomization and labelling before shipment to
recruitment sites.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary efficacy outcomes were 1) the proportion of enrolled children who had
duration of diarrhea of &gt;5 days, and 2) the number of loose or watery stools during
the diarrhea episode after randomization. We defined diarrhea as the occurrence of 3 or
more loose or watery stools per day. The last day of diarrhea was defined as the day prior
to two diarrhea-free days. The duration of the diarrhea episode was defined as the number
of days between randomization and the first day without diarrhea. The primary side effect
outcome was the occurrence of vomiting within 30 minutes of administration of the zinc
supplement over the 14-day course of treatment. This dose-related vomiting was measured by
direct observation on day 1 and subsequently by caretaker report of vomiting recorded on a
daily diary. Caretakers also used the daily diary to record compliance with the
intervention, numbers of stools, and non-dose-related vomiting (&gt;30 minutes after
dose administration). This diary was reviewed in person by trained field workers at
periodic home or clinic visits on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15. (The day 5 and 10 visits were
made by phone in Tanzania.)</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes included the percentage of children who had diarrhea &gt;3 days,
adherence to zinc treatment (number of tablets consumed, reported favorable child
acceptability), plasma zinc levels on days 1, 3, 7, 15, 21 and 30, illness in the 60-day
period following initiation of treatment (diarrhea, fever or respiratory symptoms), and
growth in the 60-day period following initiation of treatment (changes in weight, length,
mid-upper arm circumference).</p>

technicians, transferred to zinc-free heparin tubes, spun down at 15 minutes after blood
collection and aliquots transferred into trace element-free storage tubes at

micronutrient research laboratory at Subharti Medical College, Meerut, India. Samples were
obtained from a randomly selected 1/3 of subjects at baseline.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>Considering a 1:1:1 random allocation, significance level of 0.05 (one-sided for diarrhea
duration and mean stool number output non-inferiority tests, and two-sided for vomiting
superiority tests), 90% power, and a 5% loss to follow-up rate, 4500 subjects were
needed.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> No interim analyses by
study personnel were planned.</p>
                <p>For the efficacy outcome duration of diarrhea &gt;5 days, we assumed a risk of 16% in
the standard dose arm<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and chose a 4% absolute risk difference
non-inferiority margin since it represented the difference between zinc supplementation
and placebo in a previous trial<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.
For the efficacy outcome number of loose/watery stools after enrollment, we assumed a mean
(SD) stool number of 10 (9) in the standard dose arm<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and chose a non-inferiority margin of 2 stools since it
roughly corresponded to the reduction in stool output noted in the literature<sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. For our primary side effect profile outcome, we hypothesized a 25%
relative risk reduction in the occurrence of vomiting (from 20% of children to 15%).</p>

                <title>Blinding and randomization</title>
                <p>The allocation ratio was 1:1:1 and was stratified by country (India and Tanzania) and age
(&lt; 24 months and ≥ 24 months). All three study tablets (5, 10 and 20 mg)
were identical in appearance, taste and smell and were packaged and distributed in
identical blister packs. Each pack was labelled with a unique subject identification
number from a computer-generated permuted block randomization list with variable block
size generated off-site by a non-study statistician in WHO, Geneva. Four lists were
created corresponding to the four strata. To maintain allocation concealment, prelabeled
blister packs were shipped to the study sites, and enrolled subjects were provided the
next sequentially numbered regimen in the stratum. Study staff screened and enrolled
subjects. Other clinical staff were responsible for distributing study regimen to the
caretaker of the subject and observing the first dose. The randomization code linking the
unique ID number with treatment arm was broken only after all primary outcomes were
analyzed in a blinded fashion. All enrolled children, their caretakers, research staff,
any treating providers, and the study statisticians were thus blinded to study arm.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>All primary analyses used the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, and sensitivity
analyses were also performed using a per-protocol (PP) approach for non-inferiority
outcomes.<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The ITT analysis
included all randomized patients with assessable data, and the PP analysis included
subjects documented to have taken all zinc supplements for the first 5 days after
randomization. Missing data for primary outcomes was negligible.</p>
                <p>The first efficacy outcome was the proportion of children with diarrhea duration
&gt;5 days. Children who did not have resolution of diarrhea and were lost to
follow-up, died, or who withdrew before day 5 were not included in this analysis. The risk
differences for children with diarrhea duration &gt;5 days between the lower doses and
the standard dose were estimated and a one-sided 95% confidence interval and comparing it
to a predefined non-inferiority margin of 4%. Binomial generalized estimating equations
(GEE) with identity link were used to estimate the risk difference, and log link were used
to estimate risk ratio.<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We constructed a Kaplan-Meir curve for
time to recovery of initial diarrhea episode by randomized group and used the log-rank
test to test the differences in the incidence rate of recovery in the lower zinc dose
groups compared to the 20 mg group. In addition, Cox proportional hazard models were used
to estimate hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for recovery from the initial
diarrhea for the lower dose zinc arms compared to the 20 mg group.</p>
                <p>The second primary efficacy outcome was the total number of loose or watery stools during
the presenting diarrhea episode. Mean differences in the total number of loose or watery
stools between the lower doses and the standard dose were estimated and a 95% one-sided
confidence interval was compared with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 2 loose or
watery stools. Analyses of covariance were used to estimate the mean differences and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals.</p>
                <p>The primary side effect outcome was vomiting within 30 minutes of administration of each
dose of the trial regimen. Log-binomial regressions were used to assess relative risks and
95% confidence intervals of ever vomiting during the 14-day study period comparing the
lower doses with the standard dose. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with the log
link, binomial distribution and exchangeable correlation matrix were also used to assess
the relative risk of vomiting comparing the lower doses with the standard dose. The
exchangeable working covariance matrix and robust estimators of the variances were used to
construct 95% confidence intervals.</p>
                <p>We performed post hoc Bonferroni correction for the primary outcome efficacy outcomes by
providing 98.75% confidence intervals instead of 95% confidence intervals to account for
multiple comparisons (duration of diarrhea and number of stools, 10 mg vs. 20 mg and 5 mg
vs. 20 mg). Similarly correction was applied to safety primary outcome (vomiting) by
providing 97.5% confidence intervals to account for multiple comparisons (10 mg vs. 20 mg
and 5 mg vs. 20 mg). In addition, statistical significance of primary efficacy outcome
were assessed with a P value &lt;0.0125. A similar correction was applied to the
primary safety outcome (vomiting within 30 minutes) by providing 97.5% confidence
intervals to account for multiple comparisons (10 mg vs. 20 mg and 5 mg vs. 20 mg) and
statistical significance of the safety outcome was assessed with a P value &lt;0.025

                <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                <p>We used a linear mixed-effects model to assess differences in plasma zinc response for
the 5 mg and 10 mg arms compared to the 20 mg arm. The model included treatment arm, time
of blood draw and an interaction term between treatment arm and time of blood draw. Time
of blood draw was binned in accordance with the sampling schedule: baseline, Day 3 (3-5),
Day 7 (6-11), Day 15 (12-18), Day 21 (19-25) and Day 30 (26-45). The model accounted for
within-subject correlation with an unstructured correlation matrix to allow for
flexibility due to the complex sampling design. The unstructured correlation matrix also
resulted in the lower Akaike information criterion values (AIC) as compared to other
correlation structures, which indicated better model fit. Mean differences and 95%
confidence intervals were estimated for the 5 mg group and 10 mg group compared to the 20
mg group for each time point.</p>
                <p>Relative risks or mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated

                <p>Intention to treat analyses (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) showed
that the proportion of children with diarrhea &gt;5 days was similar across all three
zinc arms (6.5% in the standard 20 mg group, 7.7% in the 10 mg group and 7.2% in the 5 mg
group). Compared with those assigned to 20 mg, children assigned to 10 mg of zinc had a
risk difference of 1.2% (upper bound of one-sided 98.75% CI 3.6%) while children assigned
to 5 mg of zinc had a risk difference of 0.7% (upper bound of one-sided 98.75% CI 3.0%).
In both cases, the upper bound of 98.75% CI was less than the pre-defined 4%
non-inferiority margin. Results from per protocol analyses were similar to those from the
ITT analyses. A Kaplan-Meir curve for time to recovery of the initial diarrhea episode by
randomized group is presented in Supplemental Figure C.</p>

                <p>For the second efficacy outcome, ITT analyses showed (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) that the mean (SD) number of loose or watery stools were similar across
all three zinc arms, 10.8 (8.9) in the 5 mg group, 10.9 (9.2) in the 10 mg group, and 10.7
(8.7) in the standard 20 mg group. Compared with those assigned to 20 mg, children
assigned to 10 mg of zinc had a mean difference of 0.3 (upper bound of one-sided 98.75% CI
1.1) stools while children assigned to 5 mg of zinc had a mean difference of 0.1 (upper
bound of one-sided 98.75% CI 0.9) stools. In both cases, the upper bound of 98.75% CI was
less than the pre-defined 2 stools non-inferiority margin. Results from per protocol
analyses were similar to those from the ITT analyses.</p>
                <p>The effect of lower doses of zinc on the risk of vomiting is presented in <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Compared to children in the 20 mg group,
children assigned 5 mg of zinc had a 29% lower risk of vomiting within 30 minutes of zinc
administration during the 14 days of therapy (RR 0.71, 97.5% CI 0.59 to 0.86). Children
assigned 10 mg of zinc had a 19% lower risk of vomiting within 30 minutes of zinc
administration during the 14 days of therapy (RR 0.81, 97.5% CI 0.67 to 0.96). Similar
effects were seen on vomiting &gt; 30 minutes after zinc administration.</p>
                <p>Results of subgroup analyses of primary outcomes are shown in Supplementary Tables C, D
and E. The effect of lower doses of zinc appear to have a larger beneficial effect on
vomiting in India than in Tanzania. Use of Rotavirus vaccine, which is co-linear with
site, shows the same results. All other subgroup analyses results are unremarkable.</p>

The three study groups appear to have similar proportion of children experiencing
diarrheas, fevers, or episodes of fast or difficult breathing at 30, 45 or 60 days follow
up. Growth during the 60-day follow up period and anthropometric status as the end of
follow up was also similar across study groups, except for a higher proportion of stunted
children in 5 mg group. However, the observed difference in stunting between groups was
the same as that at baseline. Adherence to the intervention was very high and similar
across the three groups. Of the expected 14 pills, 13.5 (SD 2.1), 13.7 (SD 1.7) and 13.6
(SD 1.8) were consumed by children in the 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg groups respectively. Over
80% of mothers in all three groups (82.9% in the 5 mg group, 80.8% in the 10 mg group, and
81.1 in the standard 20 mg group) reported favorable acceptance by their child.</p>

doses were superior to the standard 20 mg dose with respect to vomiting.</p>
              <p>Vomiting is often a part of the acute diarrhea syndrome. The additional contribution of
high dose zinc therapy is important, with meta-analyses of previous trials demonstrating a
50% higher risk of vomiting in zinc supplemented children<sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Efforts to
scale up wider use of zinc have highlighted the elevated risk of vomiting as a consideration
in programmatic roll-out.<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Reduced
vomiting may improve food intake and alleviate parents’ concerns about severity of
illness. Our data indicate that adherence to therapy was very high in all groups, with no
difference between the groups. It is noteworthy, however, that our study was an efficacy
trial in which substantial efforts were made to achieve high compliance. Thus, these
adherence findings might not be generalizable to program conditions and reduced vomiting
could potentially improve adherence under those conditions.</p>
              <p>An interesting finding of our trial was the potential effect modification noted by site;
Indian children appeared to benefit more from lower zinc doses with respect to vomiting than
did children in Tanzania. In addition to country of origin and likely numerous other
unmeasured factors, children in the two sites differed by age and rotavirus vaccine coverage
rates. Although we did not collect data on the etiology of diarrhea in our subjects, it is
possible that Indian children were more likely to have rotavirus as a cause of their
symptoms<sup><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In countries where
rotavirus vaccine has been implemented, norovirus and sapovirus are common etiologies of
childhood diarrhea <sup><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Only limited
data exist on the potential differential effect of supplemental zinc based on diarrhea
etiology <sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Stratified analyses also
suggested the possibility that children with stunting, who may be at higher risk of adverse
effects of diarrheal diseases <sup><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, experienced greater reduction in the risk
of vomiting with the lower zinc doses compared to the standard 20 mg zinc regimen.</p>
              <p>The physiologic basis for the effects of zinc supplementation for diarrheal diseases is not
completely clear <sup><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Possible
mechanisms include the correction of a nutrient deficiency, the improvement of immune
function <sup><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, and/or the inhibition of
cAMP-mediated chloride secretion<sup><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.
The dosages we studied in the trial (10 and 5 mg daily) still exceed the RDA for young
children, and therefore it is plausible that they will still be able to work through these
suggested mechanisms of action</p>
              <p>Strengths of our trial include its randomized double-blind multicenter design with a large
sample size and excellent rates of follow-up, its location in countries in south Asia and
sub-Saharan Africa, and its recruitment of patients in outpatient facilities, where the
majority of diarrhea is managed globally. Our study addresses an important knowledge gap
presented by the empiric use of the high dose of 20 mg, which was recommended for global use
without rigorous dose-finding trials.</p>
              <p>Limitations include the lack of a placebo arm (which was unethical given the volume of data
supporting the efficacy of zinc supplementation), and reliance on caretaker report for study
outcomes (although these were verified with frequent subject contact and daily recording of
outcome information in the diary card). In addition, the modest rate of participation of
children with severe diarrheal disease likely affected our lower than anticipated rate of
children whose episodes lasted &gt;5 days, since this outcome was less frequent than we
had hypothesized for sample size calculations. However, our trial demonstrated
non-inferiority of lower doses of zinc for this outcome. Our patients, however, are
representative of those who present with diarrhea to first level health facilities in low-
and middle-income countries and are given ORS and zinc treatment.</p>
              <p>Despite evidence supporting the efficacy of supplemental zinc in improving outcomes in
diarrhea, and strong recommendations from policy makers, programmatic uptake of this
component of diarrhea management has been slow to achieve high coverage levels <sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Evaluations of this limited coverage
highlight the supply side problems of insufficient financial and human capital and a weak
global supply chain<sup><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. A renewed
public health push is required to solve these problems and maximize the benefits of this
efficacious intervention to vulnerable children. Our findings may contribute to these
programmatic efforts.</p>
              <p>In summary, children with acute diarrhea receiving 5 or 10 mg per day of supplement zinc
had similar diarrhea outcomes but less vomiting, compared with children who received the
standard 20 mg dose.</p>
