                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Gaps in maternal and child health services can slow progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The Management and Optimization of Nutrition, Antenatal, Reproductive, Child Health &amp; HIV Care (MONARCH) study will evaluate a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) intervention targeted at improving antenatal and postnatal health service outcomes in rural South Africa where HIV prevalence among pregnant women is extremely high. Specifically, it will establish the effectiveness of CQI on viral load (VL) testing in pregnant women who are HIV-positive and repeat HIV testing in pregnant women who are HIV-negative.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 7 nurse-led primary healthcare clinics to establish the effect of CQI on selected routine antenatal and postnatal services. Each clinic was a cluster, with the exception of the two smallest clinics, which jointly formed one cluster. The intervention was applied at the cluster level, where staff received training on CQI methodology and additional mentoring as required. In the control exposure state, the clusters received the South African Department of Health standard of care. After a baseline data collection period of 2Â months, the first cluster crossed over from control to intervention exposure state; subsequently, one additional cluster crossed over every 2Â months. The six clusters were divided into 3 groups by patient volume (low, medium and high). We randomised the six clusters to the sequences of crossing over, such that both the first three and the last three sequences included one cluster with low, one with medium, and one with high patient volume.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary outcome measures were (i) viral load testing among pregnant women who were HIV-positive, and (ii) repeat HIV testing among pregnant women who were HIV-negative. Consenting women â¥18 years attending antenatal and postnatal care during the data collection period completed outcome measures at delivery, and postpartum at three to 6 days, and 6 weeks. Data collection started on 15 July 2015. The total study duration, including pre- and post-exposure phases, was 19Â months. Data will be analyzed by intention-to-treat based on first booked clinic of study participants.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The results of the MONARCH trial will establish the effectiveness of CQI in improving antenatal and postnatal clinic processes in primary care in sub-Saharan Africa. More generally, the results will contribute to our knowledge on quality improvement interventions in resource-poor settings.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par27">South Africa has made considerable gains in improving prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services coverage since being identified as a Global Plan Priority country in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2012, nearly 4 million women in the country lived with HIV and antenatal HIV prevalence was 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The PMTCT Cascade of Care (CoC) refers to key steps in the clinical pathway from early diagnosis of HIV in pregnancy/postpartum to achieving long-term maternal HIV virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART), retention-in-care, and early infant diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Leakages in the PMTCT care cascade hinder progress towards eliminating paediatric HIV and protecting maternal and child health.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Among pregnant women who are HIV-positive, HIV viral load (VL) testing is critical to judge the clinical performance of ART and to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Vertical transmission risk increases with maternal VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. VL testing can identify virologic failure early, leading to timely interventions such as adherence counselling, resistance testing and treatment switches, and enhanced antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, VL testing is important because large proportions of pregnant women on ART are failing virologically (by some estimates 20â40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). The South African National PMTCT guidelines recommend universal ART for pregnant women who are HIV-positive and regular VL testing to monitor the clinical performance of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in many communities in South Africa and other sub-Saharan AfricanÂ countries the majority of pregnant women on ART, and non-pregnant women and men, do not receive regular VL tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">Repeat HIV testing of pregnant women who are HIV-negative is important because HIV incidence in pregnancy is high in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In South Africa, HIV incidence in pregnancy and postpartum is estimated to be above 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since VL increases markedly shortly after infection, the risk of MTCT is particularly high among recently infected women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Early diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART are thus critical to ensure that MTCT is eliminated, but this requires pregnant women who are HIV-negative to be re-tested at regular intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The South African National PMTCT guidelines thus recommend pregnant women who are HIV-negative to be tested in three-monthly intervals after the initial HIV test during the first antenatal visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in South Africa and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa large proportions of pregnant women who are HIV-negative do not receive repeat HIV tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">In addition to the need for improvements in early diagnosis of HIV and regular VL monitoring of ART in antenatal care, adherence to clinical guidelines and quality of care continue to be major challenges following delivery in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], undermining the delivery of effective postnatal care to mothers and children including ART, safe infant feeding and postnatal contraception.</p>
              <p id="Par31">One important approach to improving quality of care in the health sector is Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several features of CQI make it an attractive choice to improve quality of care and adherence to clinical guidelines in pregnancy-related care in sub-Saharan Africa. First, CQI uses time-tested and robust management techniques to diagnose quality problems, develop solutions and monitor progress. These techniques can be adapted to improve many different processes and healthcare functions, depending on clinical contextual needs and opportunities for improvement identified with real-time data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Second, CQI empowers health workers to develop approaches and take actions to improve quality of care on an ongoing basis. CQI mentors work with local clinic staff to facilitate the development of solutions to quality of care shortcomings that the staff identify as best suited to their local contexts. Third, CQI works within existing resource constraints and does not require large long-term investments to ensure sustained improvements in quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that CQI initiatives can be successful in improving quality of hospital care in resource-rich countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, despite major CQI initiatives in primary care in several sub-Saharan African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], rigorous scientific evidence on CQI effectiveness in these settings is largely lacking.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The MONARCH stepped-wedge cluster RCT will for the first time establish the effectiveness of an intervention to improve VL testing in pregnant women who are HIV-positive and repeat HIV testing in pregnant women who are HIV-negative in primary care clinics in rural South Africa.</p>
              <p id="Par34">More broadly, the trial will contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of CQI in improving the quality of antenatal and postnatal care and add to the scarce but growing evidence on the effectiveness of CQI as an approach to improve quality of care in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This evidence is important because several governments in sub-Saharan Africa are using CQI to improve quality of care in public-sector healthcare provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study setting and CQI implementation</title>
                <p id="Par52">The study setting is rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in the community participating in the population health research carried out by the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) which was previously known as the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies. AHRI is located within a 438Â km<sup>2</sup> area in the mostly rural Hlabisa sub-district of northern KwaZulu-Natal (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As a Wellcome Trust-Howard Hughes Medical Institute major overseas programme, the AHRI Population Intervention Platform Surveillance Area (PIPSA) South has collected comprehensive longitudinal population and HIV surveillance data on consenting individuals â¥15Â years old (approximately 90,000 people in 11,000 households) since 2003. HIV prevalence amongst women of reproductive age is ~â37% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Overall fertility has been stabile since 2000, at about three children per woman, with an average of 2200 live births per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Africa Health Research Institute study site at Somkhele.

                <p id="Par53">There are 6 nurse-led Department of Health (DoH) primary healthcare clinics (PHCs) of varying size within the geographic bounds of PIPSA South. The clinic immediately outside the PIPSA South geographic bounds located in the market town of Mtubatuba, adjoins a major highway and is often visited by PIPSA residents regardless of proximity. It was thus added to the 6 clinics within PIPSA South for this study. Oversight of these 7 clinics is led by the local primary level sub-district hospital, Hlabisa Hospital. Medical officer support is provided weekly where possible.</p>
                <p id="Par54">The CQI intervention in this study was delivered by the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Centre for Rural Health (CRH) CQI specialist team who travelled from Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, to the study site. They worked collaboratively with PHC staff to implement changes in clinical practice through training and mentorship using real-time clinic data. The CRH team consisted of two isiZulu-speaking South African professional nurses (CRH CQI mentors) and a data capturer who carried out field activities, with close support from an Improvement Advisor (a consultant obstetrician with CQI experience), a Scientific Advisor and a data manager. CQI field activities for the entire project were scheduled in advance of the first intervention step and are described in detail below.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par55">The study, a stepped-wedge cluster RCT, was carried out from 15 July 2015 to 30 January 2017, at the 7 DoH PHCs described above: Mtubatuba, KwaMsane, Mpukunyoni, Somkhele, Machibini, Esiyembeni and Gunjaneni. All clusters crossed over from control to intervention exposure according to the stepped-wedge study design (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The six clusters were randomised to the calendar sequences of crossing over. The stepped-wedge study design was selected because (i) it was considered unethical to withhold the intervention from some clinics as CQI has known efficacy in resource-rich settings; (ii) the participation of all clinics both during the control and the intervention exposure state was thought to be better if it was known that during the course of the trial all clinics would receive the intervention; (iii) the field implementers of CQI were a small team of three people, making simultaneous rollout in all clusters impracticable; and (iv) it allows adjustment for secular trends in outcomes. Data collection occurred at all 7 DoH PHCs and Hlabisa Hospital maternity ward as the majority of deliveries from the sub-district occur at Hlabisa Hospital.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The MONARCH stepped wedge study design. Clinics provided baseline (pre-intervention) data until each rolled over to the intervention in random order. All clinics provided data continuously throughout the study period. Baseline data collection across all clinics occurred from 15 July 2015 to 28 September 2015 (Step 0). As data extraction on antenatal visits was retrospective from the point of delivery, the baseline observation period covered an additional ~â6Â months for the first recruited participants â thus Step 0 covered a duration of ~â8Â months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2018_3404_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                  <p id="Par56">The clusters were pre-defined and included the 6 PHCs within the PIPSA South area plus Mtubatuba clinic. Antenatal care providers within clusters participated in the CQI activities based on availability. Efforts were made to recruit providers in leadership roles (e.g. Operational Managers, Professional Nurses) to increase likelihood of sustainability of the intervention and dissemination of skills. Based on clinic size (and staffing) approximately five participants from each clinic constituted a facility-level CQI team, which ideally included at least one person in a leadership position.</p>

Recruitment occurred continuously at all clinics and Hlabisa Hospital over the entire study period regardless of the clinicâs randomisation status. Women who had just delivered a baby at Hlabisa Hospital or any of the 7 study clinics were recruited for outcome and exposure assessment if they had attended any of the 7 study clinics for antenatal care (ANC) or resided in PIPSA South during their pregnancy. Consenting women attending a 3â6Â day or 6-week postnatal visit at a study clinic with their infant (aged &lt;â8Â days or 5â8Â weeks respectively) were recruited regardless of ANC clinic attended or where they resided during pregnancy.</p>

                  <p id="Par58">We hypothesized that this CQI intervention would bring about the desired changes in clinical processes by providing a supportive and motivating environment alongside real-time data to PHC-level healthcare providers. The CRH team supported PHC staff to implement simple workable solutions to gaps identified through collaborative root-cause analyses. Furthermore, CQI may have increased job satisfaction and empowerment through reduced workload and better patient outcomes. Implicit in these assumptions were staff availability to participate in CQI activities and the ability to continue normal clinical duties in parallel to CQI activities.</p>

CQI tools and principles (TablesÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> &amp; <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) included Action Learning Sessions at the end of each transition phase to consolidate skills and share experiences.

                  <p id="Par61">Prior to transition-phase CQI activities, a 2-week lead-in period (approximately 4 visits) was planned, to introduce the newly randomised cluster to the CRH team and CQI concepts. A standardized âdoseâ of intensive CQI of ~â19 visits, was planned for each transition step. A schedule of monthly follow-up (CQI maintenance) visits was also planned thereafter and varied by cluster due to order of randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Efforts to prevent cross-contamination whilst enabling buy-in for sustainability of CQI were made: only randomised clinics were invited to attend Action Learning Sessions, and PHC supervisors were excluded from these events during the intervention period (unlike âreal-worldâ implementation of CQI) as they supervise multiple clinics. However after the final transition step was complete, a final joint Action Learning Session with staff from all 7 clinics, PHC supervisors, sub-district and district DoH staff was held. In order to reduce bias the AHRI study investigators (evaluators) refrained from intervening in CQI clinic processes, although some operational co-involvement was required (e.g. introducing the CRH team to clinic staff).</p>

The structured interview covered themes on demographics, satisfaction with services, obstetric history, pregnancy intention, healthcare expenditures, access to care, and knowledge (infant feeding and HIV). At the 3â6Â day and 6-week postnatal visits all consenting women were interviewed and their infantâs RtHB photographed. The structured interview at the 3â6Â day visit was identical to the delivery visit. The 6-week structured interview covered themes on demographics, satisfaction with services, knowledge and uptake of services (HIV, PMTCT services, adherence to ART, contraception, self-reported infant feeding practices), healthcare expenditures, and access to care. All questionnaires contained questions in English with isiZulu translations and were conducted in isiZulu.</p>

All data collected in clinics and Hlabisa Hospital, including cameras, were returned daily to the AHRI data centre for secure storage and capturing. A data capturing team of five trained in ICH GCP, including research nurses and quality controllers, captured clinical and laboratory data from digital photographs of MCRs and infant RtHB, and all information from structured questionnaires onto a REDCapâ¢ study database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par70">Each clinic was a cluster, with the exception of the two smallest clinics, which jointly formed one cluster. After a baseline data collection period of 2Â months, the first cluster crossed over from control to intervention exposure state on 29 September 2015; subsequently, one additional cluster crossed over every 2Â months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The six clusters were divided into 3 groups by patient volume (low, medium and high). To increase the likelihood that the sample sizes in intervention and control exposure states were similar, and to improve balance, we then randomised the clusters to the six calendar sequences of crossing over, such that both the first three and the last three sequences included one small, one medium, and one large cluster. A senior biostatistician performed randomisation for all clusters prior to the first intervention step. All study implementers, evaluators and clinic health workers were blinded to the initial randomisation status. Two weeks prior to each scheduled intervention step crossover date, the custodian of the randomisation list (AHRI Chief Information Officer) revealed the randomised cluster to the AHRI study team. The AHRI study team then introduced the CRH team to the randomised cluster for CQI training to commence.</p>

                  <title>Power calculation</title>
                  <p id="Par71">For our baseline power calculation, we assumed â based on local routine primary care data â that without the MONARCH intervention viral load testing would be carried out in 40% of all pregnant women who were HIV-positive and repeat HIV testing would be carried out in 65% of all pregnant women who were HIV-negative. Based on local routine primary care data, we further assumed that half of all pregnant women would be HIV-positive and that pregnant women would make three ANC visits. We assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.10. This coefficient is conservative compared to ICCs that we empirically measured in a similar setting (PHCs in sub-Saharan Africa providing ANC and HIV treatment and care), which ranged from 0.00 to 0.07 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Finally, we assumed that we could not use information from 15% of enrolled women because of missing data. Given these assumptions, we estimated that we would have 80% power to detect at least a 15 percentage point increase in our two primary endpoints at the 5% significance level if we enrolled a total of 1260 pregnant women (i.e., 630 women who were HIV-positive and 630 women who were HIV-negative).

                  <p id="Par72">The data will be analyzed by intention-to-treat (ITT). For ITT analyses, patient outcomes will be analyzed by the exposure status of the clinic attended at the first antenatal booking visit, independent of later clinic switches. We will analyse the CQI effect using mixed effects generalized linear regression models. In the main analysis, we will include a fixed effect for the time step and a random effect for clinic, following Hussey and Hughes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], as well as adjust for clustering of standard errors at the clinic level. For the analyses of our two primary endpoints, which are binary, we will use modified Poisson regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] within the generalized linear regression framework. Our main results will thus be expressed as risk ratios. In sensitivity analyses, we will adjust for patient pre-exposure characteristics, and we will assess effect modification by secular time and time since intervention start in a clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Stata (version 15.0, StataCorp, College Station, Texas) will be used for all analyses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par74">The MONARCH stepped-wedge RCT is the first trial to determine the effectiveness of an intervention to increase testing for health indicators among pregnant women that are critical for good health outcomes in HIV hyperendemic communities: VL testing among pregnant women who are HIV-positive and repeat HIV testing among pregnant women who are HIV-negative. The MONARCH study is also one of the first to measure the causal effect of CQI on ANC and PNC services in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
              <p id="Par75">The MONARCH trial was embedded within the public health system and implemented within routinely available resources including the physical infrastructure of primary care clinics, data systems, and human resources. The success of the CQI intervention depends not only on this context, including staff motivation and the other resources available to change clinical processes. One of the advantages of CQI is that it leads to a selection of actions that can lead to successful improvements given the local abilities and constraints. Through local data collection and clinic-specific analysis health workers are empowered to identify the root causes of existing shortcomings; through small-scale tests in PDSA cycles they can develop the locally best solutions to address these shortcomings. The iterative manner in which CQI unfolds ensures that candidate solutions are repeatedly tested and modified until robust and sustainable approaches have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Given significant resource constraints, it is particularly important to understand the mechanisms of the locally developed approaches and the determinants of their success. The Process Evaluation, which was nested in this trial, will therefore be highly informative in understanding the implementation of this complex intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par76">The MONARCH trial has several limitations. First, it took place in a real-life setting where normal service delivery and targets had to be met during CQI implementation â this may have limited the availability of healthcare providers to participate in the intervention. This test of the effectiveness of CQI was thus a test of CQI âin real lifeâ and we cannot conclude from a null finding that CQI cannot be highly effective in a context with fewer outside pressures and more resource commitments. Second, advertisement of the study to DoH sub-district and facility staff prior to MONARCH study start may have driven changes towards endpoint targets and biased impact evaluation towards the null. Finally, the health workers in the control clusters might have learned about CQI methods and approaches to improve endpoint attainment from the health workers in the intervention clusters, also resulting in bias towards the null. Conversely, our efforts to reduce such contamination â such as blinding health workers to the randomisation status of their clinic and instructing the CQI mentors not to suggest solutions developed by previous clinic teams in their interactions with new clinic teamsÂ until post-randomisationÂ â run counter to the philosophy of CQI, which includes sharing of solutions and approaches between CQI teams. These measures, which increase the validity of the trial, may have reduced the effectiveness of the CQI intervention that we have tested.</p>
              <p id="Par77">Overall, we expect that the results of the MONARCH trial and nested process evaluation will be useful for policy makers and practitioners seeking to increase the quality of care for pregnant women in HIV hyperendemic communities. It will also be useful for health systems managers striving to improve quality of primary care in severely resource-constrained clinics. Study results will be shared with local and regional policy makers during policy engagement workshops and presentations. We will also disseminate our results via peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences.</p>

              <p>MCRs were photographed at delivery from eligible women â¥18Â years old, excluding the intrapartum section, based on the UKZN BREC waiver of consent for accessing routine DoH data. Consent was obtained from eligible women â¥18Â years old for interviews and taking photographs of their infantâs RtHB at delivery, 3â6Â day and 6-week postnatal visits. Consent was also obtained from healthcare providers prior to their participation in structured and semi-structured interviews.</p>
              <p>Whilst this is deemed a low-risk study, an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) was formed and met twice yearly to review study progress, adherence to the protocol and safety of study participants. All DSMB members (including a biostatistician) are based in South Africa. As the study was not anticipated to cause significant adverse effects, a closed session with by-arm analyses was planned only if concerns were raised on aggregate data (focusing on the primary endpoints) presented at open sessions.</p>
