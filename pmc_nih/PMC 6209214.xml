                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We analyzed EEG recordings from 35 RSE patients between 21–84 years-old who received PIC that target burst suppression and quantified the amount of EEG suppression using the burst suppression probability (BSP). Then we measured the variability of BSPs with respect to a reference level of BSP 0.8 ± 0.15. Finally, we also measured the variability of BSPs with respect to the amount of intravenous anesthetic drugs (IVADs) received by the patients.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Patients remained in the reference BSP range for only 8% (median, interquartile range IQR [0, 29] %) of the total time under treatment. The median time with BSP below the reference range was 84% (IQR [37, 100] %). BSPs in some patients drifted significantly over time despite constant infusion rates of IVADs. Similar weight-normalized infusion rates of IVADs in different patients nearly always resulted in distinct BSPs (probability 0.93 (IQR [0.82, 1.0]).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This study quantitatively identified high variability in the amount of EEG suppression achieved in clinical practice when treating RSE patients. While some of this variability may arise from clinicians purposefully deviating from clinical practice guidelines, our results show that the high variability also arises in part from significant inter- and intra- individual pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variation. Our results indicate that the delicate balance between maintaining sufficient EEG suppression in RSE patients and minimizing IVAD exposure in clinical practice is challenging to achieve. This may affect patient outcomes and confound studies seeking to determine an optimal amount of EEG suppression for treatment of RSE. Therefore, our analysis points to the need for developing an alternative paradigm, such as vigilant anesthetic management as happens in operating rooms, or closed-loop anesthesia delivery, for investigating and providing induced-coma therapy to RSE patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a life threatening condition with a mortality rate of up to 40%. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205789.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It is defined by generalized or focal continuous seizures that fail to respond to first and second line pharmacological treatment. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] International guidelines advocate treating RSE with pharmacologically-induced coma achieved with a continuous infusion of intravenous anesthetic drugs (IVADs), such as midazolam, propofol, and/or barbiturates. This treatment aims to suppress brain activity in order for normal physiology to resume and abort seizures. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It requires a careful balance between maintaining sufficient brain inactivation and minimizing the risks of IVAD exposure. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] As brain inactivation cannot be measured easily, clinicians typically use a distinctive pattern on the electroencephalogram (EEG) called burst suppression as a surrogate to guide titration of IVADs. The burst suppression pattern consists of alternating periods of high (‘bursts’) and low (‘suppressions’) voltage. Although anesthetics may have differential effects on excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] the overall effect of burst suppression is a profound global reduction in overall neuronal activity, including seizure activity. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p>
              <p>Delivering PIC therapy for RSE patients is challenging because it requires frequent patient monitoring, subjective interpretation of the EEG, and manual titration of IVADs by busy intensive care staff for prolonged periods often lasting 24–48 hours. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Moreover, subspecialists who are trained to interpret EEG and administer anesthetic drugs are often unavailable, leaving the tasks to non-experts. As a result, many have questioned the quality of induced-coma provided to RSE patients and have searched for ways to improve the therapy. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p>
              <p>In this investigation, we examined the challenges associated with the delivery of PIC in RSE patients by providing a quantitative assessment of the amount of EEG suppression achieved under current practice.</p>

                <title>Clinical data collection</title>
                <p>We collected archived clinical data and EEGs from 35 consecutive patients who received PIC that targeted burst suppression for treatment of RSE in the neurological intensive care unit of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) between May 2012 and November 2014. This study was approved by the MGH Human Subjects Research Committee. All patient data were fully anonymized before analysis and patient consent was not required. We analyzed data from patients with anoxic etiologies of RSE (aRSE) separately from patients with non-anoxic etiologies of RSE (nRSE). All EEGs were recorded using nineteen silver/silver chloride electrodes affixed to the scalp according to the international 10–20 system. Data were recorded at 256 or 512 Hz, using XLTEK clinical EEG equipment (Natus Medical Inc., Oakville, Canada). Clinical information including time-stamped doses of all administered medications and vital signs were extracted from hand-written and electronic medical records.</p>

                <title>EEG analysis and quantification of burst suppression</title>
                <p>We preprocessed EEGs with an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact reduction algorithm (Persyst 12, San Diego, CA). Artifact-reduced EEGs were exported in European Data Format, then converted into MATLAB format (Natick, MA). Further artifact removal was done by rejecting epochs of data with high amplitude (&gt;500uV).<sup>17</sup> Validity of the artifact-reduction was confirmed by visual inspection. Then, artifact-reduced EEGs were band-pass filtered at 0.5–55 Hz and mapped to an average montage. Next, we used a previously validated algorithm to convert the preprocessed EEGs into binary signals with zeros presenting bursts and ones representing suppressions. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Applying this algorithm to each channel yielded nineteen single-channel binary signals for each patient. Then, we obtained a global binary signal that integrates information across all channels using a published voting algorithm. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The global binary signal is more noise resilient than the binary signal computed from individual channels. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Finally, we calculated burst suppression probabilities (BSPs) from the global binary signals. BSP represents the instantaneous probability that an EEG epoch is in the suppressed state. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] BSP is similar to the more traditional burst suppression ratio (BSR) at steady state, but is better for dynamical data, and has the advantage that it is a well-defined probability that allows for formal statistical comparison of the level of burst suppression across time. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Nevertheless, on the minutes-to-hours timescale that is relevant to this study, the difference between BSR and BSP is minimal.</p>

                <p>We summarized the amount of EEG suppression achieved as the extent to which the measured BSPs agreed with reference BSPs. The reference BSPs are inferred from the institutional (MGH) management guideline for RSE, which advises a goal of one burst per ten seconds, or 80% suppressions. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Because bursts typically last one to two seconds, this requirement was conservatively interpreted as equivalent to BSPs of 0.8 ± 0.15. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We compared measured BSPs with reference BSPs only for periods when there is documented intent in the medical record to maintain the studied patients in burst suppression. Specifically, we computed the percentage of time each patient spent above the reference range (PTa, BSP &gt;0.95), within the reference range (PTi, 0.65≤ BSP ≤0.95) and below the reference range (PTb, BSP &lt;0.65).</p>

                <p>We used probabilities that a patient group is accurately (and reliably) controlled, p<sub>a</sub> (and p<sub>r</sub>), to describe and compare the quality of burst suppression achieved in the nRSE and aRSE groups. To compute these probabilities, we first defined for each patient a binary status of either accurately (reliably) or inaccurately (unreliably) controlled. Control is <italic>accurate</italic> when the measured BSPs were statistically indistinguishable from BSP 0.8 with 95% confidence. Control is <italic>reliable</italic> when the absolute difference between the measured BSPs and BSP 0.8 was less than 0.15 with 95% confidence. The status of accurate (reliable) control for each patient is treated as a binary observation sampled from a binomial model for accurate (reliable) control parameterized by p<sub>a</sub> (p<sub>r</sub>). Given the observations and assumption of a uniform prior, we find a posterior probability distribution for different possible values of p<sub>a</sub> (p<sub>r</sub>), and draw 100,000 Monte Carlo samples of p<sub>a</sub> (p<sub>r</sub>) from the distribution [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. nRSE and aRSE groups have different parameters denoted as p<sub>a,nRSE</sub> (p<sub>r,nRSE</sub>) and p<sub>a,aRSE</sub> (p<sub>r,aRSE</sub>). The probability that the aRSE group was more accurately (reliably) controlled than the nRSE group is the fraction of draws for which the Monte Carlo samples of p<sub>a,aRSE</sub> (p<sub>r,aRSE</sub>) were larger than the Monte Carlo samples of p<sub>a,nRSE</sub> (p<sub>r,nRSE</sub>).</p>

              <p>Pharmacologically-induced coma is the current standard of care for patients with RSE. Its goal is to induce a state of profound brain inactivation to stop further seizures. Our study quantitatively analyzed the amount of EEG suppression achieved during PIC targeting EEG burst suppression under current management practices using BSP. To assess the variability in the BSP, we used a range of BSPs derived from the institutional clinical guideline as reference. Our results show that the amount of EEG suppression achieved in clinical practice is highly variable. Most commonly, BSPs fell well below the reference range of 0.8 ± 0.15 recommended by the local practice guidelines. In other patients, BSPs persistently remained for prolonged periods above the reference range.</p>
              <p>The above results are significant because insufficient attention is given to variability in the amount of EEG suppressions achieved in RSE patients in clinical research. For example, in a randomized single-blind trial, which found no apparent benefit to achieving burst suppression in RSE patients, none of the patients in the burst suppression group were consistently maintained in burst suppression for the full duration of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The study also did not quantify the amount of EEG suppression achieved. In two other retrospective observational studies which suggested that PIC used to treat RSE patients may cause longer hospital stay and higher relative risks for infection, new disability and mortality, patients were divided into groups for comparison depending on whether or not they had received IVADs [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but there was no confirmation of the amount of EEG suppression achieved or their variability.</p>
              <p>Our results strongly suggest that outcome studies of RSE patients are confounded by heterogeneity in the level of EEG suppression achieved. If we posit that there exists an optimal level of EEG suppression for RSE management (as the existence of the clinical guideline assumes), falling short of it means insufficient treatment, while exceeding it means that patients are subjected to added risks associated with IVAD exposure without additional therapeutic benefit. Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to evaluate this hypothesis. For example, a reasonable comparison would be to compare outcomes between patients with BSP within the target range, say, &gt;75% of the time, with those with BSP below the target range &gt;75% of the time. However, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205789.g002">Fig 2</xref>, all patients with aRSE died, regardless of time spent in burst suppression; and in patients with nRSE, no patients were within the target range 75% (or even 50%) of the time. Future studies that control for levels of brain inactivation are necessary to draw valid conclusions on risk-benefit profile of induced-coma.</p>
              <p>Many possible reasons may contribute to the observed variability. Despite having an institutional guideline intended to reduce practice variation, clinicians may target a higher or lower BSP depending on other clinical factors such as prior failed attempts to wean a patient off IVAD due to return of seizures or the presence of hypotension. Given a specified target BSP, intermittent patient monitoring with subjective interpretation of EEG and adjustment of infusion rate in a busy ICU setting is also inherently difficult. In addition, our results suggest that the difficulty may arise in part from significant PK/PD variability. We found that similar weight-normalized infusion rates of IVADs resulted in substantially different levels of burst suppression in different patients; the level of burst suppression in patients given constant infusion rates of IVADs can also change substantially over time. Significant PK/PD variability in response to anesthetic drugs is also evident in other studies. One study, for instance, found no significant difference in the mean daily propofol, morphine or fentanyl dose received by critically ill patients who experienced burst suppression vs. patients who did not. [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] These observations indicate that personalized titration of IVADs is crucial for achieving and maintaining a desired amount of brain inactivation.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we also found that the control of a prescribed level of burst suppression was more accurate in aRSE patients than in nRSE patients. aRSE patients often have more diffuse and more severe brain injury compared with nRSE patients [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Anesthetic drugs might more easily suppress brain activity in a more severely injured, making burst suppression levels “easier” to control. Global anoxic brain injury also damages the metabolic pathways of the brain and reduces the rate of ATP production [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This may also increase the propensity for profound brain inactivation by anesthetic drugs [<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The appropriate amount of IVADs administered to a patient is therefore also a function of disease-specific factors.</p>
              <p>The involvement of patient- and disease-specific factors suggest that in order to improve our ability to maintain a consistent level of brain inactivation, we need to tailor the infusion rates of IVADs according to the specific needs and responses of patients at specific times. Our results suggest that infusion rates of IVADs should probably be adjusted more frequently than is currently done. The maximum rate of change of BSP observed in our study was 6.77 per day, or approximately 0.15 every 30 minutes. This suggests a need to adjust the infusion rates of IVADs at least every 30 minutes to keep a patient who starts off on target at a BSP of 0.8 within the target range of 0.65–0.95. In comparison, the median time between adjustments off the infusion rates in our patient cohort is 2.0 hours (IQR [1.0, 4.5] hours).</p>
              <p>We did not attempt to determine the patient- and disease- specific factors that can be used to predict IVAD dosing requirements for individuals because this is a limited single center study and the patient population was quite heterogeneous. We did not attempt to determine the optimal amount of EEG suppression for treating RSE patients. As discussed earlier, the high level of intra- patient variability in the degree of EEG suppression achieved would likely confound the result. Therefore, we did not track incidences of adverse events, breakthrough seizures, or patient mortality. These issues are critical to address in future studies. Nevertheless, these limitations do not impact our ability to quantify variability in the levels of brain inactivation achieved in RSE patients.</p>
              <p>Finally, while we recommend personalizing dosing and increasing the frequency of IVAD infusion rate adjustment, these ideal practices can be challenging to implement in practice. The existing paradigm for delivering PIC is labor-intensive and skill-dependent. It relies on intermittent manual titration of IVAD infusion rate(s) by ICU staff based on frequent review of the EEG and patient physiological data. Given unpredictable responses to IVADs and the dynamics of the ICU environment, it is improbable that busy ICU staff are able to provide the recommended care event in the best of scenarios. Therefore, we need a new management paradigm to deliver IVAD infusions in a more personalized, precise, and efficient manner, to maintain consistent levels of brain inactivation during PIC.</p>
              <p>One promising alternative management paradigm is the use of closed-loop anesthetic delivery systems (CLAD). These systems can continuously monitor the response of patients to IVADs and automatically titrate the infusion rate of IVADs to achieve specific levels of brain inactivation set by physicians. Previous work has shown that CLADs can maintain various levels of burst suppression with substantially higher reliability and accuracy of control compared with the observations made in this study.

[<xref rid="pone.0205789.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Quantitative results of variability reported in this study can inform this process and help researchers develop safer systems. These systems may enable future outcome studies of RSE patients that are not confounded by variability in levels of brain inactivation during PIC, and enable us to optimize the treatment.</p>
