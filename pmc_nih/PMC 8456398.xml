                  <p id="Par3">Three hundred women enrolled and 262 maternal–infant dyads provided blood samples at delivery.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par11">Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n3) is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid found in all cell membranes. It is considered an essential nutrient for fetal neurodevelopment, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy due to rapid brain growth, myelination, and synaptogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> The amount of DHA available for transfer depends upon the DHA status of the mother; because diet is the primary source of DHA, this status depends largely on the mother’s DHA intake from foods (e.g., seafood, eggs) or DHA supplements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par12">Red blood cell DHA (RBC-DHA) is an indicator of DHA intake and tissue status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> During pregnancy, there is a decrease in maternal DHA and arachidonic acid (ARA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> as these and other essential fatty acids are preferentially transferred to the fetus via the placenta. Cord blood DHA (CB-DHA) is often higher than maternal RBC-DHA at delivery, a phenomenon termed <italic>biomagnification</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Conversely, infant CB-DHA that is equal or less than maternal RBC-DHA is termed <italic>bioattenuation</italic>, or simply <italic>equilibrium</italic>. Some have posited that maternal–infant DHA equilibrium represents a state where the amount of DHA transferred from maternal stores has reached a level sufficient to meet fetal neurodevelopmental requirements, indicating a more optimal DHA status for both mother and newborn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Further, higher maternal DHA status at parturition would support continued DHA transfer to the newborn during lactation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Evidence to support this concept comes from the work of Luxwolda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> who enrolled pregnant women with lifetime diets of low-, intermediate-, or high-fish, thereby consuming variable amounts of DHA. Using maternal and infant DHA samples collected at delivery, investigators found fetal DHA biomagnification occurred most often when maternal RBC-DHA was below 6% total fatty acids, that is, when maternal DHA status was decidedly low. The prevalence of maternal–infant DHA equilibrium increased in women with RBC-DHA levels &gt;6%, suggesting more optimal fetal DHA accumulation.</p>
              <p id="Par13">In a previous randomized controlled trial conducted at the University of Kansas between 2009 to 2011 (Hoglund Prenatal Evaluation (HOPE); NCT01007110), 67 pregnant women were assigned to a daily DHA supplement of either 0 or 600 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> At study enrollment, women randomized to the supplemented group had a median maternal RBC-DHA in phospholipids of 4.5% total fatty acids, increasing to 7.1% at delivery. Subsequent examination of these data revealed that 75% of the total maternal–infant dyads in the study failed to achieve DHA equilibrium, and equilibrium never occurred when maternal RBC-DHA at delivery was below 6.5%. This led us to question whether biomagnification, i.e., the failure to achieve maternal–infant DHA equilibrium could be an indicator of DHA insufficiency and thereby limit fetal neurodevelopment.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Heart rate variability (HRV) is an index of fetal autonomic neurodevelopment, and we have shown that it is influenced by maternal DHA status. In the HOPE trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> overall and short-term fetal HRV were higher in the DHA-supplemented compared to the placebo group, a positive finding for fetal autonomic neurodevelopment. We employed the universal system theory approach of evolution and development by Hoyer et al. to HRV analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and found the fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) was higher in the supplemented group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par15">The subsequent Prenatal Autonomic Neurodevelopmental Assessment (PANDA) trial (NCT02709239) was designed to increase the incidence of maternal–infant DHA equilibrium by randomizing pregnant women to either 200 or 800 mg DHA from 12 to 20 weeks gestation to delivery. We hypothesized that the incidence of equilibrium would be higher in the group randomized to 800 mg/day and that equilibrium would result in more optimal fetal neurodevelopment indicated by higher fetal HRV and fABAS at 32 and 36 weeks gestation. Under intent-to-treat principles, we tested for equilibrium status and treatment group differences in maternal and newborn RBC-DHA, fetal HRV, and fABAS.</p>

The HRV parameter calculations and interpretations are as follows: AMP20: The 20–95 inter-quantile distance of detrended normal-to-normal (NN) interval series, a measure of the fluctuation range of heartbeat intervals. Skewness: Skewness of NN interval series: Asymmetry between vagally and sympathetically mediated pattern, decline of dominating heart rate decelerations, and increase of dominating heart rate accelerations. MSE3: Generalized mutual information at coarse graining level 3 of NN intervals (related to multi scale entropy), complexity of sympathovagal modulations. pNN5: Percentage of differences between adjacent NN intervals exceeding 5 ms, short, mainly vagal modulations. VLF/LF: ratio between very low (0.02–0.08 Hz) and low (0.08–0.2 Hz) frequency band power, baseline fluctuation.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par42">Supplementing pregnant women with 200 or 800 mg of DHA during pregnancy significantly increased the incidence of maternal–infant DHA equilibrium in a dose-dependent manner, with a higher incidence of equilibrium in the 800 mg group. DHA equilibrium between women and their newborn infant never occurred below 6.96% maternal RBC-DHA at delivery. Above the threshold of 6.96%, there was a roughly equal chance of equilibrium or not (43.1% Yes, 46.9% No), with fetal biomagnification occurring at maternal RBC-DHA as high as 14.7%. Moreover, the achievement of maternal-infant DHA equilibrium was not related to fetal neurodevelopment as assessed by HRV and fABAS.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Other investigators have estimated a maternal–infant DHA equilibrium threshold of ~6% maternal DHA at delivery, concluding that fetal DHA biomagnification is a potential indicator of maternal DHA insufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> It is notable that in both the current (PANDA) and the previous (HOPE) trial, equilibrium never occurred below 6%, in line with the report of Luxwolda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> While maternal–infant equilibrium is not a meaningful biomarker for maternal DHA insufficiency when maternal RBC-DHA is above 6%, maternal RBC-DHA ≤ 6% is a reasonable threshold for low maternal DHA status, potentially increasing the risk of insufficient DHA for fetal uptake. This risk may be greater for women with obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> preeclampsia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Type 1, II,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and gestational diabetes mellitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> as these conditions have been shown to have a negative effect on placental transfer of polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
              <p id="Par44">The dosing strategy resulted in a significant increase in maternal DHA from enrollment to 32 weeks gestation in both treatment groups. From 32 weeks to delivery, there was no change in maternal RBC-DHA, evidence that maternal DHA status plateaued 12–20 weeks after women were randomized to capsules. At delivery, maternal RBC-DHA and CB-DHA were higher in the 800 mg group. At baseline, women entering the PANDA study had higher RBC-DHA (~7%) than their predecessors entering the HOPE trial (~4%). Since DHA intake from foods has not changed significantly and the dietary intake results reported here are consistent with mean usual dietary intake of DHA of 62.2 mg/day in United States women of childbearing-age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> we attribute higher baseline status to the increased use of prenatal DHA supplements. Sixty-nine percent of the women enrolling in PANDA reported taking a prenatal DHA supplement with a mean intake of 104 mg/day, while in previous trials 12% reported taking a prenatal DHA supplement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> with a mean intake of 25 mg/day. Another important difference between the current and past clinical trials was that neither we nor our sponsor considered it ethical to use a true placebo and instead used a low dose roughly equivalent to that included with prenatal vitamins or commercially available DHA supplements. We used a dose higher than the previous 600 mg with the intention of increasing the incidence of equilibrium. While we achieved this aim, the dosing strategy also had the side result of preventing DHA insufficiency, as only 26 participants (9.9%) fell below the 6% threshold we hereby define as a marker of DHA insufficiency. If this were a placebo-controlled trial or observational trial without DHA supplementation, it is likely that there would have been more cases of DHA insufficiency, since the mean maternal RBC-DHA at enrollment was 6.94%, and maternal dietary DHA intake was low and decreased significantly during pregnancy.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Because maternal–infant DHA equilibrium never occurred below 6% maternal RBC-DHA at delivery and this finding is consistent across studies, maternal RBC-DHA ≤ 6% may serve as an indicator of low maternal status. It stands to reason that women with low DHA status would benefit most from supplementation. This is evident in the results of two recent large-scale trials where women with low fatty acid status at enrollment (≤6% RBC-DHA) benefited more from DHA supplementation, resulting in lower rates of early preterm birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Specifically, the rate of early preterm birth was reduced by half if women with low DHA status (≤6% total fatty acids) were assigned to 1000 mg DHA/day versus 200 mg/day. In contrast, for women with high DHA status (&gt;6%) the incidence of early preterm birth was lower and there was no benefit of dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Higher DHA status may also provide a direct benefit to women as studies have shown an association between low status and maternal depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par46">Neither treatment group nor maternal–infant DHA equilibrium status influenced fetal neurodevelopment as indexed by HRV metrics or fABAS scores at 32 and 36 weeks gestational age. As expected, fetal maturation between the two time points was responsible for the significant effect of time on HRV metrics and fABAS scores. Previously, the fABAS was sensitive to group differences in the placebo-controlled HOPE trial where fABAS scores and fetal HRV were higher in the supplemented group, especially in metrics quantifying fluctuation amplitude and complexity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> However, maternal and infant DHA status were markedly lower at delivery in the HOPE trial than the current study (maternal: placebo 4.99%, supplemented 7.09%; infant: placebo 6.18%, supplemented 7.75%). The inability to detect a meaningful difference in fetal neurodevelopment related to treatment group or equilibrium status in the current trial are likely due to the higher maternal DHA status at enrollment (6.94%) and our decision to test the superiority of two doses (200 vs. 800 mg) instead of controlling with placebo.</p>
              <p id="Par47">There were limitations to the study. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shutdown caused the majority of and higher than predicted attrition, preventing us from reaching our power analysis target of 125 participants per group for the fABAS. However, given the lack of difference in fABAS means, it is highly unlikely that data lost from visits missed due to COVID-19 would have changed the results. Because the aims of this trial were based on maternal–infant DHA status and neurodevelopmental outcomes, the eligibility requirements were limited to English-speaking, healthy women carrying singleton pregnancies. Further, the diversity of women enrolling in PANDA did not reflect the racial and ethnic population of the greater metropolitan area, making the results of this trial less generalizable to the overall obstetric public.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par48">We were able to increase the incidence of maternal–infant DHA equilibrium using 800 mg DHA compared to 200 mg, but equilibrium status had no effect on fetal neurodevelopment. Maternal–infant DHA equilibrium is not a reliable biomarker of insufficient status when maternal DHA is &gt;6%. However, the failure to achieve equilibrium when maternal DHA is below 6% in this study is consistent with previous population studies and is a likely indicator of low maternal DHA status. It is possible that group differences may emerge later in life, as infants will continue to accumulate DHA from their postnatal diet. We will gain additional knowledge through planned secondary data analyses that will explore the effect of DHA and other dietary nutrients on fetal neurodevelopment and ongoing measures of brain physiology, cognitive development, and behavior during the first year of life.</p>
