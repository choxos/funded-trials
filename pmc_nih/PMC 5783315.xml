                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p id="P1">No previous clinical trial has been conducted for patients with neuroblastoma
associated opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome (OMA), and current treatment is based on
case reports. To evaluate the OMA response to prednisone and risk-adapted chemotherapy
and determine if the addition of intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) further improves
response, the Children’s Oncology Group designed a randomized therapeutic
trial.</p>

                  <title>Patient and Methods</title>
                  <p id="P2">Eligible subjects were randomized to receive twelve cycles of IVIG
(IVIG+) or no IVIG (NO-IVIG) in addition to prednisone and neuroblastoma
risk-adapted chemotherapy. All low-risk patients were treated with cyclophosphamide. The
severity of OMA symptoms was evaluated at 2, 6, and 12 months using a scale developed by
Mitchell and Pike and baseline versus best response scores were compared. A single
patient who did not undergo neurologic assessment was excluded from OMA response
analysis. This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov (identifier
NCT00033293).</p>

                <sec id="S3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="P3">Of the 53 patients enrolled in the study, 62% (33/53) were female.
There were 44 low-risk, 7 intermediate-risk, and 2 high-risk neuroblastoma patients.
Twenty-six subjects were randomized to receive IVIG+ and 27 were randomized to
NO-IVIG. The neuroblastoma 3-year event-free survival (95% confidence interval
(CI)) was 94.1% (87.3%, 100%) and overall survival was
98.0% (94.1%, 100%). Significantly higher rates of OMA response
were observed in patients randomized to IVIG+ compared to NO-IVIG
[21/26=80.8% for IVIG+; 11/27=40.7% for
NO-IVIG (odds ratio=6.1; 95% CI: (1.5, 25.9),
p=0.0029)]. For the majority of patients, the IVIG+ OMA regimen
combined with cytoxan or other risk-based chemotherapy was well tolerated, although
there was one toxic death in a high-risk subject.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="P4">This is the only randomized prospective therapeutic clinical trial in children
with neuroblastoma-associated OMA. The addition of IVIG to prednisone and risk-adapted
chemotherapy significantly improves OMA response rate. IVIG+ constitutes a
back-bone upon which to build additional therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome (OMA), also known as dancing eyes and dancing
feet syndrome or Kingsbourne syndrome,(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) is a rare
neurologic disorder that affects 2–3% of the &gt; 650 children diagnosed
with neuroblastoma every year in North America.(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)
Symptoms include conjugate rapid eye movements; spontaneous muscle jerking which can affect
the trunk, face and extremities; ataxia; personality changes including irritability and
behavior disorders; and developmental regression. OMA also occurs in children and adults
without the diagnosis of neuroblastoma and may be triggered by intercurrent infection, but
in many subjects the triggering event is never identified.(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) The proportion of children with neuroblastoma-associated OMA varies according
to the cohort analyzed.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) In a retrospective study of
patients treated at two large pediatric oncology programs and two large neurology centers in
France, 22 (64%) of 34 children with OMA had associated neuroblastoma.(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) The majority of children with neuroblastoma-associated
OMA have low-risk neuroblastoma and are cured of their neuroblastoma with surgery alone or
surgery with moderate-dose chemotherapy.(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) However, the neurological
sequelae of OMA are often severe and lifelong.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</p>
              <p id="P6">Although the cause of OMA remains unknown, there is significant evidence that the
disorder results from an autoimmune process. Serum autoantibodies against neuronal tissues
have been identified in some patients with neuroblastoma-associated OMA.(<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) Several groups have
documented the presence of B-cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, increased B-cell activating
factor in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and other B-cell related cytokines and increased
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, both B- and T-cells.(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) However, the most compelling
evidence for the autoimmune nature of this disorder is the clinical response to
corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globuilin, rituximab, and/or other immunosuppressive
therapy reported in single cases or small retrospective series. (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) Further, a retrospective analysis of 29 children with
neuroblastoma and OMA from the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) indicated that the immune
suppression associated with chemotherapy may also be beneficial to patients with
neuroblastoma-associated OMA.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) All ten children in
this series who received chemotherapy as part of their neuroblastoma treatment had
resolution of their acute OMA symptoms and six had no long-term neurologic sequelae.</p>
              <p id="P7">Because of the rarity of this condition, no previous prospective clnical trials
have been conducted, and published retrospective series include only small numbers of
patients. Thus, the expected OMA response rate to corticosteroids alone or combination
immunosuppressive regimens is not known. Based on the promising responses to chemotherapy
reported in the retrospective analysis of POG patients,(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) we hypothesized that immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone plus
risk-adpated chemotherapy (with cyclophosphamide for low-risk patients) would alleviate the
acute neurologic symptoms of OMA and also improve the long-term neurologic outcome. We
further hypothesized that the addition of IVIG, an immune modulatory agent, would augment
the neurologic recovery in these patients.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) To test
these hypotheses, the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) conducted a prospective
randomized phase III clinical trial (ANBL00P3) for children with neuroblastoma-associated
OMA, with a primary endpoint of OMA response.</p>

                <p id="P8">This trial was approved by the COG and made available to the more than 200 COG
institutions. Ninety-two of these institutions opened the trial for enrolment. The study
design is a randomized open label clinical trial. This is a standard approach for children
with malignancies when the treatment is intravenous and it is impractical across a large
cooperative group like COG and unethical to blind the investigators and expose children to
an intravenous placebo arm.</p>

                <p id="P9">Subjects ≤8 years of age with biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed
neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma associated with OMA were eligible for the study. Any
one of the neurologic components of OMA was sufficient for eligibility (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Patients with neuroblastoma diagnosed within 6 months
of the development of OMA and patients with OMA diagnosed within six months of the
diagnosis of neuroblastoma were eligible. Patients could not have received prior
chemotherapy. Patients who received treatment with prednisone or adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) for ≤14 days were eligible. Patients had to be registered on study
no later than 4 weeks after they were deemed to be eligible for the study. Other
requirements were that patients had to be free of any organ dysfunction or disorder that
would preclude the use of corticosteroid therapy, cyclophosphamide or risk-adapted
chemotherapy, and IVIG. Staging of disease was according to the International
Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS).(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) Tumor
histopathology, <italic>MYCN</italic> status, and DNA index were determined in central COG
laboratories. The COG Tracking Center assigned neuroblastoma risk-group classification, as
described previously.(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) Before the start of
therapy, institutional review board approval at participating sites was obtained. Written
informed consent was obtained before enrollment onto ANBL00P3 and the neuroblastoma
biology study, ANBL00B1.</p>

                  <p id="P11">All patients with low-risk neuroblastoma received prednisone and
cyclophosphamide and were randomly assigned to also receive: i) IVIG (IVIG+); or
ii) no IVIG (NO-IVIG). Patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease were treated
with prednisone and corresponding risk-adapted therapy regimens,(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) although three
intermediate-risk patients received prednisone and cyclophosphamide. The intermediate
and high-risk patients were also randomized to receive IVIG or no additional therapy
(<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). For low-risk patients, treatment
cycles were repeated every 28 days. Prednisone was given at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day
divided twice a day for a minimum of two cycles if a complete response was achieved at
the two month evaluation. A slow taper of the steroid dose could then be started and
titrated to the clinical response. Prednisone could be continued until achieving a
response for as long as 18 months, with a slow taper to maintain maximal clinical
response. Subjects on NO-IVIG regimen that failed to respond or progressed any time
after completing the two month evaluation were allowed to cross-over to the
IVIG+ regimen but considered treatment non-responders upon crossing over (see
statistical section). Subjects on the IVIG+ who failed to respond or progressed
any time after the two month evaluation were allowed to switch to ACTH therapy instead
of prednisone but were considered treatment non-responders upon switching (see
statistical section). Patients received IV cyclophosphamide at a dose of 25 mg/kg for
children ≤20 kg or 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for children &gt;20 kg on day 0 of each
cycle for 6 cycles. Patients randomized to receive IVIG received 1 gm/kg on day 0 and 1
of cycle one; day 0 of cycles 2 to 6; and then on day 0 of cycles 8, 10 and 12. Based on
the review of the literature available at the time of study design, which consisted of
case reports and small series, one year of therapy was frequently reported. We, thus,
empirically chose one year of therapy for this trial. The protocol did not specify an
immunization administration policy because it is a well-accepted practice in the
pediatric oncology community to withhold immunization in this patient population.</p>

stance, gait, arm and hand function, opsoclonus, and mood/behavior at enrollment. Each
symptom was scored as 0 (no symptoms); 1 (mild symptoms); 2 (moderate symptoms); or 3
(severe symptoms). The patient’s neurologic symptoms were evaluated and scored
at two months, six months, and one year after enrollment for assessment of the primary
endpoint of OMA response (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental

evaluations points. For the secondary endpoint of OMA progression-free survival
(OMA-PFS), subjects were followed at their local institutions and the status of OMA
neurologic symptoms listed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> were
reported annually for up to ten years. For each symptom, the OMA response was classified
as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no response (NR), or
progressive/worsening of OMA (PD). CR was defined as improvement from baseline OMA to
normal at two-months, six-months, or one-year without progression of neurologic
symptoms; a PR was defined as improvement from baseline OMA at two-months, six-months,
or one-year without progression; NR was defined as no change in neurologic symptoms from
baseline at two-months, six-months, and one-year; and PD was defined as sustained
worsening of neurologic symptoms from baseline at two-months, six months, or one-year in
any symptom. For the purposes of the statistical efficacy rule, a patient was classified
as an overall OMA “responder” if the combination of the symptom-specific
responses were either a CR or a PR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Subjects were otherwise classified as an overall OMA
“non-responder”. All patients who crossed over from NO-IVIG to

both arms met the minimum response rate, a test of proportions was used to identify the

significant. Due to the rarity of this disease, and because it was deemed unlikely that
the addition of IVIG would result in a lower reponse rate, the risk of a higher than usual
type 1 error was considered acceptable. With a planned sample size of 26 evaluable

were enrolled after the study was activated on May 15, 2004. The study closed to accrual
on February 4, 2013. All 53 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis.
However, one patient was not evaluable for the OMA response analysis because the patient
was not seen in the required follow-up visit for neurologic assessment. This patient
refused therapy post-randomization but prior to start of therapy; therefore, 52 patients
were evaluable for toxicity [graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0] and for the secondary analysis of OMA response. The
median age at diagnosis was 18.9 (IQR: 16.6, 24.0) months (range 2.9–49.2 months).
Thirty-three patients were female and 20 were male with a female:male ratio of 1.7:1.0

symptoms did not improve and prednisone was discontinued in three patients randomized to
IVIG+ and three patients randomized to NO-IVIG. All six patients were treated with

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P24">The acute neurologic symptoms associated with OMA are often severe, and long-term
neurological deficits are common.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) To date, treatment regimens have been based on case reports and
small retrospective studies. In an effort to improve neurologic recovery in this patient
cohort, we designed and conducted the first prospective, randomized clinical trial for
children with neuroblastoma-associated OMA. This neurologic disorder appears to be caused by
an autoimmune process, and corticosteroids have been widely used to treat OMA.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) Prednisone was, therefore, included in both treatment
arms in this clinical trial. Based on promising results of a retrospective analysis of
neuroblastoma patients with OMA that suggested chemotherapy may enhance the resolution of
both acute and long-term neurology sequelae (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) all
patients in this study received chemotherapy. Low-risk patients received cyclophosphamide at
doses frequently used for immunosuppression. Three intermediate-risk patients were also
treated with cyclophosphamide, while the other 4 intermediate-risk patients and the 2
high-risk patients received risk-adpated treatment regimens.(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) Because chemotherapy was included in both treatment arms, it is not possible
to assess the clinical impact of chemotherapy on OMA response.</p>
              <p id="P25">IVIG is also known to modulate the immune response in other autoimmune diseases,
and case reports have indicated clinical response to this agent in patients with
neuroblastoma-associated OMA.(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) To test if the addition of IVIG to prednisone and chemotherapy
improved neurologic recovery, this study randomized patients to receive IVIG (IVIG+)
or no IVIG (NO-IVIG). We found that patients randomized to IVIG+ had a statistically
significantly higher rate of resolution of OMA symptoms compared to those who were
randomized to NO-IVIG (p=0.0029). This study was not conducted in a blinded fashion
due to ethical and practical concerns regarding intravenous infusion of placebo in pediatric
patients. However, because pediatric oncologists routinely enroll patients on unblinded
randomized cooperative group trials and remain in equipoise regarding the treatment arms,
the vast majority of patients are treated as randomized.</p>
              <p id="P26">In contrast to the slight predominance of males observed in most neuroblastoma
cohorts,(<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) 62% (33/53) of the
neuroblastoma patients with OMA in our study were female. Although female preponderance is a
finding that is common in autoimmune disorders, this particular characteristic of
neuroblastoma associated OMA patients has not been recognized previously. Our review of the
published literature confirmed a preponderance of female cases in other OMA reports (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P27">The majority of children with OMA and neuroblastoma have been reported to have
low-risk disease,(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and our study confirms the
association between OMA and favorable biologic features. Forty-four (83%) of the 53
patients enrolled on the study had low-risk disease and seven had intermediate-risk. Only
two patients were classified as high-risk. Reflecting the high proportion of low-risk
tumors, survival of this cohort was excellent, with 3-year EFS and OS rates of 94.1%
(87.3%, 100%) and 98.0% (94.1%, 100%), respectively.
The single patient enrolled on this study who died had high-risk neuroblastoma and suffered
an infectious complication following myeloablative therapy. Interestingly, the
immunoglobulin fraction of serum from OMA patients has been shown to suppress growth of
neuroblastoma cell lines,(<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) suggesting there may be
a biologic rationale for the low numbers of high-risk patients with OMA. However, it is well
recognized that the majority of patients with OMA and neuroblastoma have significant
neurologic morbidities, and many experience life-long neurologic deficits.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) Additional follow-up is
needed to assess the incidence of long-term neurologic sequelae in our cohort, which may
include developmental delay and learning disabilities.</p>
              <p id="P28">OMA symptoms may be exacerbated by concurrent infection. We did not detect any
difference in the incidence of infections rising to Grade 3 toxicity or greater infections
in either treatment group. Because we did not collect data on lower toxicity grade
infections, we are not able to determine if viral infections impacted OMA response rate.</p>
              <p id="P29">Mitchell and co-workers, in their recent long-term follow-up report of OMA, showed
a correlation of outcome and intensity of therapy consistent with the hypothesis that more
intensive immunosuppression may be associated with improved long-term neurologic
outcome.(<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) Other studies have also indicated that
a more aggressive treatment approach may lead to improved neurologic outcome for patients
with OMA.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)
Our study demonstrates the addition of IVIG to prednisone and risk-adapted chemotherapy
improves OMA response, indicating that IVIG+ will serve as an effective treatment
back-bone to test future strategies. We conducted the trial within the COG which consists of
over 200 institutions of varying sizes in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Most, if
not all, children diagnosed with neuroblastoma are referred to a COG institution in North
America. Although only 92 COG institutions elected to open the trial, and only a subset of
these 92 institutions enrolled at least one eligible subject, this study was successfully
conducted in small institutions as well as medium-sized hospitals and tertiary centers.
These results suggest that the care and complex clinical evaluations required to treat this
population of patients can be successfully applied in different hospital settings and are
generalizable. At the Advances in Neuroblastoma Research meeting in Genoa, Italy 2004, a
task force recommended that three of four of the following criteria be present to diagnose
neuroblastoma with OMA: 1) opsoclonus, 2) myoclonus/ataxia, 3) behavioral changes and/or
sleep disturbances, and 4) neuroblastoma. Although we did not apply the Genoa criteria in
our study, only one of our patients (randomized to NO-IVIG) had less than 3 of the 4 Genoa
criteria.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</p>
              <p id="P30">Further follow-up is needed to determine if this more intensive treatment approach
improves the long-term neurologic outcome of patients with neuroblastoma-associated OMA.
Long-term follow up to assess neuro-developmental and learning problems of this study
population is important, and there is broad agreement that the establishment of a registry
would be extremely valuable. Unfortunately, the funding required to build this resource has
not yet been identified. Long-term follow-up of this cohort and studies to better define the
epidemiology and pathogenesis of OMA, including analysis of antineuronal antibodies in serum
and cerebrospinal fluid and evaluation of magnetic resonance images of the cerebellum are
secondary objectives of this study and data collection is still in progress. The results of
these objectives will be the subject of separate reports.</p>

                  <p>Stage: The patients enrolled on this study were all staged using the International
Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS), which is a surgical pathological staging system.
All patients with INSS stage 1 disease have undergone complete resection of their
primary unilateral localized tumor by definition. Patients with stage 2 disease have
some residual tumor tissue (up to 10%) following surgical resection, while those
with stages 3 and 4 disease generally undergo a biopsy only at diagnosis and have
residual disease. Thus, the extent of surgical resection is captured by INSS
staging.</p>

                <title>Evidence before this study</title>
                <p id="P34">We searched the Pubmed database using the terms opsoclonus, myoclonus, ataxia,
and neuroblastoma to review prior treatment of patients with neuroblastoma and OMA. There
was no date restriction used to search the database, and we did not restrict the language.
Our search revealed case reports, small series, and retropsecitve studes that described
neurologic response with immunosuppressive therapy in patients with neuroblastoma and OMA.
These publications provide compelling evidence that OMA associated with neuroblastoma is
an immune-mediated paraneoplastic syndrome. No previous prospective randomized clinical
trial for this population has been reported.</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p id="P35">This is the first and, to date, only randomized clinical trial for patients with
OMA and neuroblastoma ever conducted. The results of this study demonstrate treatment
effect for both arms of therapy, although significantly superior OMA response was seen
with the IVIG+ regimen. As the only randomized trial with the largest number of
OMA patients ever reported, the results define, for the first time, OMA response to two
treatment regimens.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="P36">Because of the rarity of OMA, our trial has limited number of subjects and we
had to accept an 80% power in our analysis. The results of our study need to be
interpreted with caution in light of the small numbers of subjects but also taking into
account the rarity of the disorder. In our trial, we could not evaluate the role of
chemotherapy since both arms of the study contain chemotherapy with the majority of the
subjects receiving cyclophosphamide.</p>

                <title>Implications of all available evidence</title>
                <p id="P37">The OMS response observed with the IVIG+ regimen can be used as a
historical control to investigate if treatment strategies that include new
immunosuppressant agents will lead to improved outcome. Currently there is a single arm
European study that is evaluating the use of rituximab in combination with dexamethasone
and cyclophosphamide in the therapy of OMA.</p>
