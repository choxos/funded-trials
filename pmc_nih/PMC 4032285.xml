                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>In a diverse group of early adolescents, this study explores the co-occurrence of a broad range of health risk behaviors: alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use; physical inactivity; sedentary computing/gaming; and the consumption of low-nutrient energy-dense food. We tested differences in the associations of unhealthy behaviors over time, and by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were 8360 students from 16 middle schools in California (50% female; 52% Hispanic, 17% Asian, 16% White, and 15% Black/multiethnic/other). Behaviors were measured with surveys in Spring 2010 and Spring 2011. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess if an underlying factor accounted for the covariance of multiple behaviors, and composite reliability methods were used to determine the degree to which behaviors were related.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The measured behaviors were explained by two moderately correlated factors: a ‘substance use risk factor’ and an ‘unhealthy eating and sedentary factor’. Physical inactivity did not reflect the latent factors as expected. There were few differences in the associations among these behaviors over time or by demographic characteristics.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Two distinct, yet related groups of health compromising behaviors were identified that could be jointly targeted in multiple health behavior change interventions among early adolescents of diverse backgrounds.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified six priority categories of health risk behaviors in youth that contribute to the main causes of morbidity and mortality in this population. These include alcohol and drug use, tobacco use, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and physical inactivity <xref rid="pone.0098141-Eaton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many of these behaviors are common among youth and tend to increase with age <xref rid="pone.0098141-Eaton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and continue into adulthood <xref rid="pone.0098141-DAmico1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Hallal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These risk behaviors do not occur in isolation: there is growing evidence that adolescents tend to adopt sets of ‘healthy’ or ‘unhealthy’ behavior patterns <xref rid="pone.0098141-BasenEngquist1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0098141-Sanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which is likely to result in a cumulative and detrimental effect on disease risk for segments of the population. Understanding patterns of associations among multiple health behaviors and the extent to which risk behaviors co-occur is essential for informing multiple health behavior screening and interventions <xref rid="pone.0098141-Prochaska1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Studies examining multiple health risk behaviors in youth tend to find evidence that risk behaviors co-occur <xref rid="pone.0098141-Lytle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Sallis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0098141-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In particular, there is evidence that different types of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use tend to cluster <xref rid="pone.0098141-BasenEngquist1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Carson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This clustering is often explained in reference to problem-behavior theory, which posits that an underlying behavioral syndrome drives certain youth to adopt multiple problem behaviors and arises from an imbalance of risk factors relative to protective factors across personality and socio-environmental domains <xref rid="pone.0098141-Donovan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Jessor1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Risk factors that cumulate across individual, social, and environmental domains – that could be conceptualized as an “overall health risk factor” - might also lead subsets of youth to adopt broader sets of unhealthy behaviors. For example, among youth in grades 6 through 12, smoking has been associated with low physical activity and poor diet <xref rid="pone.0098141-Lytle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Few studies have explored associations among a broad range of youths' health risk behaviors that include substance use, diet, and inactivity, or examined changes in these patterns in early and middle adolescence, a time when these behaviors are being initiated and typically increase. Moreover, although youth with particular individual, social and environmental risk factors are more likely to engage in specific unhealthy behaviors, there is little research that explicitly tests if the clustering of a broad range these behaviors in younger adolescents differs based on demographics such as gender or race/ethnicity.</p>
              <p>This study addresses these research gaps by testing for an “overall health risk factor” that results in a broad range of health risk behaviors being positively related and grouping among certain youth. We focus our attention on associations between six behaviors: alcohol use, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, physical inactivity, sedentary computing/gaming time, and the consumption of low-nutrient energy-dense food (fast food, soda). We also add to the extant literature by examining associations among these behaviors in a younger age group that is racially and ethnically diverse. A further aim of the study is to test for differences in the associations among these behaviors as adolescents get older, using longitudinal data, and to examine potential differences based on gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). This will allow us to determine if multiple health risk behaviors are more strongly associated over time, and among adolescents with particular socio-demographic attributes. Findings have the potential to provide important information on early trajectories of multiple risk behaviors at a crucial time in the initiation and establishment of lifestyle habits.</p>

                <title>Participants and procedure</title>
                <p>Data for the current analyses came from two waves of CHOICE, a longitudinal study that started in 2008 as a large cluster randomized trial of a voluntary alcohol and drug intervention for middle school students <xref rid="pone.0098141-DAmico2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Primary intervention outcomes were measured in 2009, with additional survey waves added to better understand how substance use changes over time in this large and diverse sample. The project evaluated the effects of the intervention on adolescent AOD use <xref rid="pone.0098141-DAmico2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and questionnaire items on diet, physical activity, and screen time were collected in two later waves (Spring 2010 and Spring 2011).</p>
                <p>Participants were recruited from 16 public middle schools across three metropolitan school districts in Southern California. Schools were chosen for their geographic and racial/ethnic diversity. The current analyses focus on participants who completed surveys in Spring 2010 and/or Spring 2011 (which we refer to as Wave 1 and Wave 2 in this paper), resulting in a sample of 8360, of whom 50% were female, 36% were in grade 6, 33% in grade 7, and 31% in grade 8 (at Wave 1). The sample is also unique in its racial/ethnic diversity: 52% Hispanic, 17% Asian, 16% White, and 15% Black/multiethnic/other, which is broadly representative of the ethnic composition of the relevant school populations based on published demographic information for these middle schools in the three school districts at that time. Rates of lifetime and past month substance use in this sample of middle school students are also comparable to national samples <xref rid="pone.0098141-Substance1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Paper and pencil surveys using a Scantron form were administered during physical education class by trained staff who described the surveys and reviewed confidentiality. Survey booklets were available in English, Spanish, and Korean (just 3–5% of students used the Spanish survey and less than 1% of students used the Korean survey version), and took approximately 45 minutes to complete.</p>

A total of 14,979 students across the 16 schools received parent consent forms: these were returned by 92% of parents and 71% gave permission for their child to participate in the study (<italic>n</italic> = 9,828), which is higher or comparable to other school-based survey completion rates with this population <xref rid="pone.0098141-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0098141-Kandel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A Certificate of Confidentiality was obtained from the National Institutes of Health, and study materials and procedures were approved by the institution's Internal Review Board, the school districts, and the individual schools. Because this is an ongoing study, and as per the IRB requirements and certificate of confidentiality, this dataset cannot be made public.</p>

                <p>Associations among the health behaviors were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis <xref rid="pone.0098141-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, to determine if an underlying health risk latent variable could account for the covariance of multiple health risk behaviors (substance use, intake of LNED foods, physical inactivity, and sedentary screen time). In order to determine the degree to which the behaviors were related, we used composite reliability methods <xref rid="pone.0098141-Raykov1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Raykov2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Composite reliability (CR) is calculated based on the factor loadings (λ) and error variance (ε) for each measured variable in a factor model. For continuous variables CR is given by: <disp-formula id="pone.0098141.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0098141.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>(CR is equivalent to Cronbach's alpha when the assumptions of alpha are satisfied.) For categorical variables, the formula is more complex and we refer the reader to (23). We were interested in evaluating the extent to which CR differed – either between groups of individuals, or within the same group of individuals over time. For each homogenous set of variables identified, at each wave, we calculated CR for each group and time. We therefore calculated separate CRs for males and females (at each wave), separate CRs for those for whom at least one parent attended college and those for whom neither parent attended college, and separate CR for Hispanic, and non-Hispanic respondents. We calculated the difference between the CRs, then used bootstrapping methods (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0098141-Efron1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) to obtain the difference in CR for each group, along with the confidence intervals and significance value. Each estimate used 1000 bootstrap samples. All models were estimated using Mplus 6.11 <xref rid="pone.0098141-Muthn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> using WLSMV estimation.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study tested the hypothesis that a broad range of risky health behaviors – specifically alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use; physical inactivity; fast food intake; soda intake; and computing/video gaming time – would be positively associated among particular middle school youth, reflecting one underlying health risk factor. The hypothesis was not supported by the confirmatory factor analysis model as these behaviors were better explained by two distinct, although correlated factors: a ‘substance use risk factor’ and an ‘unhealthy eating and sedentary factor’. Nonetheless, the positive association between these two latent risk factors indicates that youth who report substance use are also somewhat more likely to report eating more fast food, drinking soda, and spending more time on computing/gaming activities, supporting previous research showing that middle school youth are prone to adopting sets of multiple health risk behaviors <xref rid="pone.0098141-Lytle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, prevention programs that target multiple substances, or that target unhealthy eating and excessive screen time, are important for this younger adolescent population. There is likely to be some benefit to addressing substance use, diet, and sedentary activity simultaneously, possibly reducing the risk for multiple health compromising behaviors.</p>
              <p>Physical inactivity was the one measured behavior that did not reflect the hypothesized latent variable(s) as expected. Interestingly, the unhealthy eating and sedentary factor was associated with higher levels of physical activity. Other research on associations between diet, physical activity, and sedentary activities among adolescents have been mixed: one review concluded that sedentary screen time is negatively associated with physical activity <xref rid="pone.0098141-Sallis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, however other studies have failed to find evidence of a significant association between computer/video game time and physical activity <xref rid="pone.0098141-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. There is also little evidence of an association between diet (healthy dietary patterns or energy-dense food consumption) and physical inactivity in youth (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0098141-Sallis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). Measuring physical activity and inactivity in youth is challenging because these are complex and often competing behaviors, and there are clear limitations when relying on self-report. It is possible that the items used in this survey, which asked about activities that “make them breathe hard some of the time”, also captured physically unfit youths' experience of relatively mild physical activities. Additional research, preferably using objective measures of movement (e.g., accelerometers) is needed to better understand the association between these behaviors.</p>
              <p>We found some evidence that the alcohol, smoking, and drug use behaviors were more highly associated with the substance use risk factor over time, and had a stronger association for males, non-Hispanic whites, and youth whose parents had less education. However, the magnitude of these differences was small and is therefore unlikely to have substantive clinical relevance. Additionally, there was no evidence that the association of these behaviors differed over time or by demographics. As such, interventions seeking to reduce multiple co-occurring risk behaviors should be equally effective for a broad range of youth, across early adolescence.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the Study</title>
                <p>It is important to note some limitations of the study. First, we relied on self-report from adolescents for this study, the limitations of which are well-known, although possibly exaggerated for some types of behavior <xref rid="pone.0098141-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Much research has shown that self-report among youth is valid when procedures, such as those used in the current study, are implemented (e.g., discussing confidentiality, using Scantron forms for survey answers, having study staff not affiliated with the school collect information) <xref rid="pone.0098141-DAmico3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0098141-Shillington1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In addition, we dichotomized the AOD variables because of the low prevalence of substance use among this younger age group and so we were unable to explore more nuanced associations in AOD use; however, this is an important age to begin to investigate these associations. Finally, because the main focus of the survey was to assess AOD use, there were a limited number of items assessing food intake, physical activity, and sedentary activities. More detailed or objective measures of these behaviors, gathered using daily diaries and accelerometers are preferable, but were not possible to collect in this study.</p>

                <p>Health compromising behaviors are known to co-occur among adolescents; in particular different types of substance use <xref rid="pone.0098141-Lytle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. There is also some evidence that substance use is positively related to unhealthy eating and physical inactivity, although these findings have been mixed and are typically not tested among a diverse sample of youth <xref rid="pone.0098141-Sallis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-MacArthur1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098141-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Studies show some evidence that these patterns differ by gender <xref rid="pone.0098141-MacArthur1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, although differences based on other demographics are not known.</p>
                <p>This study adds to this literature by exploring longitudinal associations among a broader range of health risk behaviors than has been investigated previously, among a large and racially and ethnically diverse sample of early-middle adolescents. We identified two distinct, yet related groups of associated behaviors that could be jointly targeted in multiple health behavior change interventions among early adolescents. This was also one of the first studies to test if the associations among these behaviors varied over time, or based on gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. We found little evidence of any differences.</p>
                <p>Given that substance use, unhealthy eating, and computer/video game screen time were found to co-occur, programs could seek to address all three of these behaviors and potentially reduce risk for broader health consequences among this population. Specifically, programs that already target multiple substance use behaviors among at-risk youth are in a position to potentially have an impact on energy-dense food consumption and screen time, with important cost-saving potential. For example, motivational interviewing interventions have an agenda setting component where patients identify a behavior they are ready to change <xref rid="pone.0098141-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; programs could leverage this opportunity to target co-occurring health risk behaviors.</p>
                <p>Early adolescence is a critical time for initiation and escalation of many risk behaviors and can provide an important opportunity for health promotion. Study findings suggest that people that interact with this younger age group, such as teachers, primary care providers, counselors etc. should take the opportunity to address multiple behaviors in both their screening protocols and prevention programming.</p>
