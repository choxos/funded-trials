                <p id="Par1">Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused significant disease, with widespread cases of neurological pathology and congenital neurologic defects. Rapid vaccine development has led to a number of candidates capable of eliciting potent ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>). Despite advances in vaccine development, it remains unclear how ZIKV vaccination affects immune responses in humans with prior flavivirus immunity. Here we show that a single-dose immunization of ZIKV purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> in a dengue virus (DENV)-experienced human elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies to both ZIKV and DENV. Using a unique ZIKV virion-based sorting strategy, we isolated and characterized multiple antibodies, including one termed MZ4, which targets a novel site of vulnerability centered on the Envelope (E) domain I/III linker region and protects mice from viremia and viral dissemination following ZIKV or DENV-2 challenge. These data demonstrate that Zika vaccination in a DENV-experienced individual can boost pre-existing flavivirus immunity and elicit protective responses against both ZIKV and DENV. ZPIV vaccination in Puerto Rican individuals with prior flavivirus experience yielded similar cross-neutralizing potency after a single vaccination, highlighting the potential benefit of ZIKV vaccination in flavivirus-endemic areas.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The induction of high titer neutralizing antibodies is a major goal of vaccination. We recently reported that two vaccinations of Zika virus (ZIKV) purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV) in humans elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT02937233">NCT02937233</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT02963909">NCT02963909</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Passively transferred IgG from these participants was capable of protecting mice from ZIKV viremia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Participant A from this trial showed remarkably high ZIKV neutralization titers, initially observed at two weeks following the first vaccination and at increased levels following the second vaccination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Serologic assays at baseline (week 0) found that this individual had previous flavivirus exposure, as high neutralizing antibody titers to dengue virus seroptypes 1–4 (DENV1–4) and West Nile virus (WNV) were detected prior to ZPIV vaccination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Following the first ZPIV vaccination, neutralization titers significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> = 0.036) against several flaviviruses, including DENV1–4, WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not yellow fever virus (YFV) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Following the second vaccination at week 4, neutralization titers increased against WNV and JEV, and were maintained against DENV1–4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>ZPIV vaccination boosts pre-existing immunity and elicits cross-neutralizing antibodies in a flavivirus-experienced individual.</title><p><bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>, Vaccination schedule and plasma neutralizing antibody titers against ZIKV (<bold>a</bold>) and other flaviviruses (<bold>b</bold>) following ZPIV vaccination in participant A.

              <p id="Par4">To characterize the neutralizing antibodies elicited by ZPIV vaccination within this participant, we performed a unique B cell sorting strategy with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at week 8 (four weeks following the second vaccination) using a combination of fluorescently labeled whole ZIKV virions and ZIKV E and DENV-2 E glycoproteins (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Antibody heavy and light chain V (D) J gene segments were amplified from single B cells using nested polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT–PCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and sequenced. A total of 116 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were recovered and expressed as human IgG1, screened for binding to whole ZIKV and DENV-2 virions due to high neutralization titers against these viruses, and tested for neutralization in a microneutralization assay (MN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Eighty-three of the 116 mAbs bound to ZIKV or DENV-2 whole virions, and 66% of those were found to neutralize at least one DENV serotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To examine the cross-neutralizing antibodies resulting from ZPIV vaccination, we focused on the six mAbs that were able to neutralize ZIKV and DENV1–4 with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) below 1 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c–e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Sequence analysis revealed that those antibodies belonged to four different clonal families, with the VH4-59/VL1-44 family consisting of three members (MZ1, MZ4, MZ24) sharing similar complementarity-determining regions (CDR) H3 and L3 sequences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). One of these mAbs, termed MHRP ZIKV-1004 (MZ4) demonstrated high neutralization potency against both ZIKV and DENV-2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.3 and 20.9 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e,f</xref>), on par with some of the most potent specific or cross-neutralizing ZIKV and DENV-2 mAbs identified so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3b−d</xref>). Potent activity against DENV-3 was also observed, as well as modest neutralization against DENV-1 and -4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Although no neutralization activity was detected to WNV, YFV or JEV (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), MZ4 had broad neutralization against ZIKV strains from American, Asian and African lineages (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Antibody-dependent enhancement of ZIKV, DENV-2 and DENV-3 infection was found using MZ4 in vitro using a concentration of less than 2 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>, and was eliminated by introduction of the L<sub>234</sub>A and L<sub>235</sub>A (LALA) Fc mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par5">Epitope-mapping experiments were next performed to delineate the epitope specificities of these antibodies. First, we measured binding activities against recombinant ZIKV and DENV-2 E proteins, as well as purified virions, to determine whether neutralizing epitopes were contained within quaternary or monomeric E protein conformations (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5a−d</xref>). Antibodies from the MZ4 family bound better to ZIKV and DENV-2 virions than to their respective E proteins, suggesting that their epitopes contain quaternary characteristics (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5b,d</xref>). Second, binding competition experiments showed that antibodies within the MZ4 family were only competed by the domain III (DIII)-directed antibody <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/Z004">Z004</ext-link> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), indicating that the epitope was within or overlapped with DIII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). However, none of the MZ4 family members were able to bind to the recombinant ZIKV DIII (residues 303–404), suggesting that the epitope lies near but not within DIII (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Third, screening a comprehensive ZIKV prM/E alanine scan mutation library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> identified the fusion loop as the target of antibodies MZ54 and MZ56, while MZ20 targeted DII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). The binding site of MZ4 family mAbs was identified as the ZIKV E DI/DIII linker region, revealing a novel cross-reactive epitope targeted through a conserved mode of recognition, with residues G302 and Y305 as critical components of the epitope (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par6">To understand the broad recognition of the MZ4 family antibodies, we determined the crystal structures of both MZ1 and MZ4 in complex with ZIKV E at a resolution of 4.2 and 4.3 Å, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). MZ1 and MZ4 bound to ZIKV DI and DIII centered on the DI/DIII linker region (residues 299–306) with buried surface areas (BSAs) of &gt;350 Å<sup>2</sup> for both the antibody heavy and light chains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary</xref> Tables 1−3). MZ1 and MZ4 recognize ZIKV E in a highly similar manner with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.82 Å. Comparisons between the unbound Fab structures of MZ1, MZ4 and MZ24 showed a r.m.s.d. of 0.45 Å for the Fv regions, with the exception of three amino acids in the unbound structure of the MZ24 CDR H3 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6c,d</xref>). MZ4/MZ1 recognition of E is based on four structural elements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). First, the CDR H1 and CDR H2 interacts with DI and the DI/DIII linker via a set of Tyr residues engaging the main chain atoms of ZIKV E G182 and the side chains of K297 and R299 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, inset 1). Second, the CDR H3 binds to the full DI/DIII linker with ~300 Å<sup>2</sup> of BSA (296 Å<sup>2</sup> MZ1; 364 Å<sup>2</sup> MZ4), forming hydrogen bonds with R299, S304 and Y305, while also interacting with G182 of DI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, inset 2). Third, the CDR L1 buries &gt;125 Å<sup>2</sup> (141 Å<sup>2</sup> MZ1; 130 Å<sup>2</sup> MZ4) of DIII surface area, while the FR L3 interacts with the DIII BC- and DE-loops (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, inset 3). Fourth, the CDR L2 (residues 50–52) binds to the DI/DIII linker and DIII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, inset 4). In agreement with the ZIKV alanine scan screening, the DI/DIII linker is critical for MZ4 family antibody interactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). MZ1 (7H bonds) and MZ4 (6H bonds) antibody heavy and light chains form extensive interactions with this region (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Modeling the MZ4-ZIKV E structure on the mature ZIKV virion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> revealed potential quaternary contact sites at the pentamer vertex, and at the inter-raft interface, as indicated by the ZIKV virion/E binding assays (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5b,d</xref>) without antibody clashes with adjacent E protomers (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of human antibody MZ1 and MZ4 in complex with ZIKV E glycoprotein.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Superimposition of the structures of MZ1-ZIKV E and MZ4-ZIKV E complexes.

              <p id="Par7">Despite the significant overall sequence variation seen in the E glycoprotein between ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes, residues within the MZ1/MZ4 epitope have high overall sequence similarity. However, a subset of residues within the epitope show meaningful differences between ZIKV/DENV serotypes, including residues 182, 299 and 306 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Viral escape analysis of ZIKV in the presence of MZ4 identified two separate escape mutations G182D and S368N, which led to significant reduction in MZ4 neutralization potency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Remarkably, G182D matched the natural viral sequence of DENV-1 and DENV-4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and reduced susceptibility of these viruses to MZ4 neutralization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). When tested against participant A week 8 plasma, the ZIKV G182D variant showed a 4.8-fold reduction in inhibitory dilution at 50% (ID<sub>50</sub>) neutralization titer over ZIKV, suggesting that MZ4-like antibodies significantly contributed to the plasma neutralization after two ZPIV vaccinations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par8">To further understand MZ4 recognition, we compared the MZ4 epitope to epitopes within the same region of previously described ZIKV- or DENV-targeting antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Although the cross-neutralizing epitope recognized by the MZ4 family members is unique, the highest degree of epitope overlap was identified with mAb 5H2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, a chimpanzee DENV-4-specific mAb (68% BSA). The 5H2 epitope, like MZ4, included several residues of the DI/DIII linker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), but is limited in breadth due to lower sequence homology within the DI region of its epitope. The MZ4 epitope also partially overlapped with epitopes from DIII mAbs that target residues near the DI/DIII linker C terminus (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7a–c</xref>). In agreement with this structural analysis, binding of MZ4 to ZIKV E was blocked by pre-incubation with DIII mAbs <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=Z004">Z004</ext-link> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), ZV-67<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and ZKA190<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and 5H2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> to DENV-4 E.

              <p id="Par9">Passive protection studies were next performed to investigate whether antibodies targeting the DI/DIII linker would protect against ZIKV and DENV-2 replication in vivo. A single dose of 200 µg (10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) of MZ4 or MZ1 fully protected mice from ZIKV viremia, in a previously described wild-type mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, where mice were challenged with 10<sup>5</sup> viral particles. The viral load peaked three to four days post-challenge within the sham control group, whereas viral replication was undetectable over the course of the experiment when MZ4 or MZ1 was provided prophylactically (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, top). MZ4 also protected against viral dissemination into the brain, spleen and lymph nodes, while detectable RNA was found in the spleen and lymph nodes of the control mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, bottom left). To probe the minimal dose of MZ4 required for sterile protection, we titrated the MZ4 dose until protection was lost in 30 mice (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Protection decreased gradually with the antibody dose yielding an effective dose at 50% (ED<sub>50</sub>) of 2.55 µg (0.012 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> bottom right and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

              <p id="Par10">Because high binding and neutralizing titers were detected at week 2 following the first ZPIV vaccination, we sought to determine if these early neutralization responses were associated with the induction of MZ4-like antibodies. Therefore, we utilized the same B cell sorting strategy to isolate antigen-positive B cells two weeks following the first vaccination (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using this approach, we isolated a mAb with high sequence similarity to MZ4, identical CDR3 lengths, and heavy and light chain inferred precursor genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which we called ‘MZ2’, for two weeks following the first vaccination. MZ2 yielded nearly identical binding, affinity and neutralization potency as MZ4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">9a–c</xref>), and targeted a similar epitope within the DI/DIII linker on ZIKV and DENV-2 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">9d</xref>). In addition, MZ2 was able to protect against ZIKV and DENV-2 viremia and viral dissemination in mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e–h</xref>).

              <p id="Par11">To determine how prior flavivirus exposure shaped the ZPIV-elicited responses, longitudinal plasma samples from participant A were analyzed for flavivirus binding and neutralization and compared to responses from ZPIV-vaccinated individuals without prior flavivirus exposure (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">10a,b</xref>). Although participant A elicited high-magnitude ZIKV and DENV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies two weeks following a single vaccination (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>), flavivirus-naive donors who received the same ZPIV vaccine regimen demonstrated modest ZIKV binding and neutralization titers after the first vaccination, with no cross-reactivity to DENV-2 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>). To determine if the ZPIV-elicited vaccine responses in flavivirus-experienced individuals were unique to participant A, we examined the immune responses from a set of flavivirus-experienced individuals from Puerto Rico who received the same ZPIV vaccination regimen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT03008122">NCT03008122</ext-link>). Similar kinetics of ZIKV neutralization following vaccination were also observed in the flavivirus-experienced Puerto Rican individuals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i,j</xref>), where a single dose of ZPIV elicited high ZIKV neutralization titers. In addition to ZIKV neutralization, cross-neutralizing antibody responses against DENV-2, DENV-3, JEV and WNV were boosted following the first ZPIV dose (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>) and maintained after the second ZPIV vaccination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>), similar to participant A. These results are in marked contrast to the flavivirus-naive individuals where cross-neutralizing antibody responses were absent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par12">In this study, we isolated potent ZIKV-DENV cross-neutralizing antibodies from three different B cell lineages, indicating that ZPIV vaccination was able to induce neutralizing responses through multiple genetic pathways. Biophysical mapping and structural characterization revealed that the most potent mAb, MZ4, targeted a novel epitope centered at the DI/DIII linker in both ZIKV and DENV-2. MZ4 belongs to a new class of ZIKV/DENV cross-neutralizing antibodies, adding to previously characterized cross-neutralizing epitopes such as the fusion loop epitope targeted by 2A10G6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the E dimer epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and the DIII lateral ridge epitope recognized by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=Z004">Z004</ext-link> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). The MZ4 epitope is unique but overlaps with a previously identified chimpanzee DENV-4 specific mAb, 5H2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Given the epitope overlap, it is likely that MZ4 binding to the DI/DIII linker prevents the structural rearrangements required for the formation of the fusogenic E trimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, thereby blocking membrane fusion in the endosome as demonstrated for 5H2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. MZ4 was exceptionally potent against ZIKV and DENV-2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> on par with the most potent ZIKV and DENV-2 specific mAbs described so far. In vivo, animal challenge studies demonstrated that MZ4 protected mice from viremia and viral dissemination following ZIKV and DENV-2 challenge. The therapeutic potential of MZ4 can be further enhanced by introduction of the LALA mutation, to minimize antibody-dependent enhancement, and possible combination with mAbs of different specificities to prevent viral escape.</p>
              <p id="Par13">MZ2, an antibody with similar potency and characteristics as MZ4, was isolated following the first vaccination, suggesting that a single immunization was sufficient to elicit these potent cross-reactive antibodies. Such a rapid appearance suggests that MZ4 originated from a DENV-primed memory B cell recalled upon ZIKV vaccination. We were, however, not able to recover any MZ4-like antibodies prior to ZPIV vaccination by performing the same B cell sorting on week 0 PBMCs from participant A. If MZ4-like encoding memory B cells were present in the periphery prior to vaccination, their low frequency prevented isolation using our current methods. Further studies are needed to determine the ontogeny of this antibody lineage.</p>
              <p id="Par14">ZPIV vaccination also elicited neutralization responses of similar magnitude after a single ZPIV vaccination in flavivirus-experienced individuals from Puerto Rico, indicating that the kinetics of this type of response characterized in participant A could be reproducibly elicited in other flavivirus-primed individuals. These results indicate that a single ZPIV vaccination in individuals with prior exposure to DENV may induce an antibody response that mediates protection against both ZIKV and DENV-2 infection. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of prior DENV exposure described here in the context of vaccination could offer mechanistic insights into the recent finding that pre-existing, high antibody titers to DENV were associated with reduced risk of ZIKV infection and symptoms in a large Brazilian prospective cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The implications of this study are that ZIKV vaccination can boost existing DENV responses while generating potent ZIKV-neutralizing responses and may have unique potential as a preventative strategy in settings where both viruses are prevalent.</p>

                <p id="Par15">Monoclonal antibodies were isolated from a flavivirus-experienced participant (participant A) enrolled in the Z001 Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV) phase 1 vaccine clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT02937233">NCT02937233</ext-link>) conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Participant A is a US resident originally born in a flavivirus-endemic area that did not report any clinical history of flavivirus infection or receipt of a flavivirus vaccination. Participant A did report traveling back to their origin of birth every few years, but not in the five years preceding enrollment of the trial. Flavivirus-naive plasmas were obtained from participants enrolled in the WRAIR 2350 (RV478) ZPIV phase 1 vaccine clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT02963909">NCT02963909</ext-link>) conducted at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).

For the Puerto Rican flavivirus-experienced individuals, five individuals were randomly selected with confirmed flavivirus exposure prior to ZPIV vaccination as determined by microneutralization. Similarly, for the flavivirus-naive WRAIR individuals, individuals were selected who tested negative to other flaviviruses via neutralization at baseline prior to ZPIV vaccination. All authors have complied with the ethical regulations regarding these studies. The studies were approved by the BIDMC, WRAIR, St Louis University and Quorum Central (now Advarra Central) Institutional Review Boards, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

PBMCs were also obtained from known ZIKV-naive participants at week 0 enrolled in the WRAIR ZPIV phase 1 vaccine clinical trial described above where individuals were tested for prior ZIKV exposure by ZIKV neutralization assays at baseline. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in warm medium containing benzonase, then washed with PBS and stained for viability using Invitrogen Aqua Live/Dead stain. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with a cocktail of antibodies including CD3 BV510 (BD Biosciences), CD4 BV510 (BD Biosciences), CD8 BV510 (BioLegend), CD14 BV510 (BioLegend), CD16 BV510 (BD Biosciences) and CD56 BV510 (BioLegend) as dump channel markers, and CD19 ECD (Beckman Coulter), IgG BV785 (BioLegend), IgD APC-Cy7 (BioLegend) and IgM PE-Cy5 (BD Biosciences). ZIKV E and DENV-2 E were tetramerized and conjugated to BV421 (BioLegend) and BV650 (BioLegend), respectively. To obtain monoclonal antibodies that target quaternary epitopes, primary staining also included live whole ZIKV virions (Paraiba_01) followed by secondary staining using 4G2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (Biovest) conjugated to APC (Thermofisher).

CD19<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sup>+</sup>/IgD<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sup>−</sup> B cells reactive to ZIKV-E, DENV-E or whole ZIKV virions were sorted directly into lysis buffer (murine RNAse inhibitor (New England Biolabs), dithiothreitol (DTT) and SuperScript III First Strand Buffer (ThermoFisher), Igepal (Sigma) and carrier RNA (Qiagen) at one cell per well into PCR plates using a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) and stored at −80 °C until subsequent reverse transcription. We focused on sequencing and cloning B cell receptors (BCRs) from DENV-2 E positive B cells with and without cross-reactivity with ZIKV E or whole ZIKV virions. The same sorting strategy was performed from PBMCs obtained from participant A at week 0, prior to ZPIV vaccination, to determine if MZ4 family members were present prior to vaccination, and at week 2, two weeks following first ZPIV vaccination, where high neutralization titers against ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes were observed. Sorting at week 8 with a comparable numbers of B cells was performed on a different day compared to PBMCs from participant A at week 0 and week 2, and the ZIKV-naive donor. Increased frequencies of antigen-specific and cross-reactive B cells were detected against all antigens (whole ZIKV virions, ZIKV E and DENV-2 E) between week 0 and week 2 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p>

The coding sequence for prM/E was synthesized (Genscript) and cloned into the pcDNA3.4 vector (ThermoFisher) downstream from a murine Ig leader sequence. Following transient co-transfection with a furin (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BC012181">BC012181</ext-link>) expression vector, mature E proteins were purified from cell culture supernatants using a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) affinity column. An isolated E domain III (303–404) was expressed by deleting the prM and domains I–II from the full-length prM/sE pcDNA3.4 construct. A cleavable twin-strep-tagged ZIKV E version as well as a DENV-4 soluble E protein were also expressed from stably transfected S2 cells using the Drosophila expression system from ThermoFisher according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, DNA fragments encoding the first 405 residues of E from strain PRVABC59 and the first 396 residues of DENV-4 E (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AER00190">AER00190</ext-link>) were synthesized (Genscript) with either a C-terminal human rhinovirus 3c protease (HRV-3c) cleavage site followed by a twin-strep tag (IBA) or a C-terminal AviTag and poly-histidine tags, respectively, and cloned into the pMT-BiP vector (ThermoFisher). S2 cells were co-transfected with the respective pMT-BiP expression vector and the pCoBlast selection vector at a 19:1 (wt/wt) ratio. Stably transfected cells were selected with Blasticidin and adapted to suspension and serum-free medium (Lonza Insect Xpress). Expression was induced with 0.5 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> and culture supernatants were harvested after seven days. The insect-produced ZIKV E was purified on a StrepTactin XT column (IBA) following the manufacturer’s instructions and by gel filtration on an ENrich SEC 650 column (Bio-Rad) or GE Sephadex S200 column to obtain pure monomeric ZIKV E proteins.

Avi-tagged recombinant ZIKV or DENV-2 E proteins, biotinylated with the BirA biotinylation kit (Avidity), diluted in kinetics buffer (0.1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.02% (vol/vol) Tween-20 in PBS; FortéBio) and immobilized on streptavidin (SA) biosensors (FortéBio) at ~50% of the sensor maximum binding capacity. Baseline was established in kinetics buffer. To measure Fab affinities, loaded biosensors were dipped into wells containing serial dilutions of the antibody Fab fragments for 450 s. ZIKV E:Fab complexes were then allowed to dissociate in buffer. After reference subtraction, apparent binding kinetic constants were determined from at least four concentrations of Fab by fitting the curves to a 1:1 binding model using the Data Analysis software 9.0 (FortéBio). For measurement of plasma binding responses, loaded biosensors were dipped into wells containing plasma diluted at 1/40 in kinetic buffer for 900 s. The affinity of plasma polyclonal responses was estimated by measuring binding off-rates, as follows. Purified E proteins were loaded on SA biosensors at very low density (~5% of the sensor maximum binding capacity), followed by an association step of 1,800 s and a 3,600 s dissociation step in buffer. Off rates were calculated by fitting at least four dissociation curves obtained with a twofold dilution series of plasma to a 1:1 binding model.</p>

                <p id="Par23">The epitopes of the ZIKV-neutralizing mAbs were initially mapped by binding competition with a set of characterized control antibodies using biolayer interferometry (BLI). Sensors loaded with ZIKV E, DENV-2 E or DENV-4 E, as described above, were immersed into wells containing the first competing antibody at a concentration (ranging from 100 to 800 nM) necessary to reach binding saturation after 900 s. Next, biosensors were dipped into wells containing the second antibody, in the presence of the first competing antibody, and binding was measured after 900 s of association. The residual binding signal of the second antibody was expressed as a percentage of the maximum binding signal obtained in the presence of a non-binding control antibody (VRC01), run in parallel. As some competing antibodies did not reach saturation after the first 900 s association and continued to contribute to the binding signal together with the second antibody, a set of controls were run independently with all first competing antibodies alone for a 1,800 s association. The difference in signals obtained at <italic>t</italic> = 1,800 s and <italic>t</italic> = 900 s was subtracted from the signal obtained in the presence of the second antibody to generate a corrected residual binding signal. Antibodies were defined as competing when the binding signal of the second antibody was reduced to less than 30% of its maximum binding capacity, and non-competing when binding was greater than 70%. Intermediate competition was defined by binding levels of 30–70%. The HIV-1 specific VRC01 monoclonal antibody served as a negative control.</p>

MAb reactivities against each mutant prM/E clone were calculated relative to wild-type prM/E reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type prM/E-transfected controls. Mutations within clones were identified as critical to the mAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test mAb, but supported reactivity of other ZIKV mAbs. This counter-screen strategy facilitated the exclusion of prM/E mutants that are locally misfolded or have an expression defect.

                <p id="Par34">Phenix xtriage was used to analyze all the scaled diffraction data output from HKL2000, suite37 and XDS (version 26 January 2018 BUILT=20180126). Primarily, data were analyzed for measurement value significance, completeness, asymmetric unit volume and possible twinning and/or pseudotranslational pathologies. All crystal structures described in this study were solved by molecular replacement using the program Phaser, version 2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. All Fab datasets (MZ1, MZ4 and MZ24), diffracted to a resolution ranging from 2.05 Å to 2.95 Å, and phenix xtriage (version 1.11.1-2575-0000) did not identify any data quality issue. The Fv and Fc domains of EDE1-C8 Fab (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4UTA">4UTA</ext-link>), were used to solve the crystal structure of MZ1 Fab. The MZ1 Fab structure was used to solve the crystal structures of MZ4 and MZ24 Fabs. Diffraction data for the MZ1-ZIKV E and MZ4-ZIKV E complexes were significantly anisotropic, and were corrected using the UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> prior to structure solution. Phenix xtriage did not identify any data quality issues for the MZ1-ZIKV E diffraction data except anisotropic diffraction. However, diffraction data for the MZ4-ZIKV E complex crystal was significantly anisotropic and also showed twinning pathology. Phenix xtriage suggested seven possible twin laws for this dataset. Data for the MZ4-ZIKV E complex were analyzed conservatively in space group <italic>P</italic>1 without using the suggested twin laws to avoid an artificial drop in the <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> value. To determine the structure of the Fab-ZIKV E structures, we divided ZIKV E (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5IRE">5IRE</ext-link>) into smaller domains (DI, DII and DIII), and the MZ1/MZ4 Fab into Fv and Fc domains, and used a sequential search procedure. This approach was critical in finding a solution for both complexes. Refinement for all structure models was carried out using Phenix refine with positional, global isotropic B-factor refinement and defined translation/libration/screw (TLS) groups. Manual model building was performed in Coot. The final stages of refinement were performed with release of all non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. Structure quality was assessed with MolProbity (Phenix version 1.11.1-2575-0000)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The final refinement statistics for all structures are presented in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The Ramachandran statistics for the atoms in favored, allowed and disallowed regions are as follows: MZ1 Fab, 96.0, 4.0, 0.0; MZ4 Fab, 95.0, 5.0, 0.0; MZ24 Fab, 97.0, 3.0, 0.0; MZ1-ZIKV E, 95.0, 5.0, 0.0; MZ4-ZIKV E, 96.0, 4.0, 0.0.

The MZ4-ZIKV E complex structure, was at the ninth percentile, likely due to the significant anisotropy and twinning pathology of the crystal, and the inability to locate and model the Fc1 regions of the MZ4 Fab molecules. The percentile values for each structure are reported in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

Mice received 100 µl (200 µg) of a 2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> solution of purified monoclonal antibody. To get an idea of the in vivo potency, 40 mice were used in a passive protection experiment with decreasing doses of MZ4 using a threefold dilution from 100 µg (5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) to 0.14 µg (0.07 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>). Two hours after infusion, mice were challenged with 10<sup>5</sup> viral particles (10<sup>2</sup> p.f.u.) of ZIKV BR/2015 intravenously. RT–PCR assays were utilized to monitor viral loads, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, in plasma and tissues. To examine protection from viral dissemination into tissues, mice were euthanized at peak viremia (day 3) and the indicated tissues were harvested. RNA was extracted with a QIAcube HT (Qiagen). Serum samples were extracted using the Qiacube 96 Cador pathogen HT, and tissue samples were lysed in Qiazol using a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen), chloroform treated and extracted with the Qiacube 96 RNeasy HT kit. The wild-type ZIKV BeH815744 Cap gene was utilized as a standard. RNA standards were generated using the AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message Maker Kit (Cell Script) and purified with an RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research). RNA quality and concentration were assessed by the BIDMC Molecular Core Facility. Log dilutions of the RNA standard were reverse-transcribed and included with each RT–PCR assay. RT–PCR was run on the Quantstudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems). Viral loads were calculated as virus particles (VP) per milliliter or VP per microgram of total RNA as measured on the NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific).
