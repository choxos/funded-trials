                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Scleroderma patients with digital ulcers were enrolled in this dual-center, open-label, phase I pharmacokinetic study. Drug concentrations and perfusion, quantified by laser Doppler imaging, were measured over 12 hours at the 2 mg and 4 mg (or maximally tolerated) doses. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from individual plasma concentration versus time profiles using non-compartmental analysis methods. Digital perfusion and skin temperature were modeled as a function of log-transformed drug concentration and other covariates by performing repeated measures analyses using random effects models.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Nineteen scleroderma patients (84% female, 53% limited scleroderma) received treprostinil diethanolamine SR with dose titration up to 4 mg twice daily as tolerated. Peak concentrations (mean maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) = 1,176 and 2,107 pg/mL) occurred approximately 3.6 hours after dose administration, and overall exposure (under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 hours post dose (AUC<sub>0-12)</sub> = 7,187 and 12,992 hr*pg/mL) was linear between the 2 mg and 4 mg doses. Perfusion and digital skin temperature were positively associated with log-transformed plasma concentration at the 4 mg dose (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.013, respectively). The most frequent adverse events were similar to those seen with prostacyclin analogues.</p>

                  <p>Oral treprostinil diethanolamine was effectively absorbed in patients with scleroderma. Drug administration was temporally associated with improved cutaneous perfusion and temperature. Treprostinil diethanolamine may provide a new therapeutic option for Raynaud's phenomenon and the peripheral vascular disease of scleroderma.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Treprostinil is a chemically stable analog of prostacyclin. The major pharmacological actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treprostinil, as the sodium salt, has shown clinical effectiveness in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) when administered by the continuous subcutaneous and intravenous (via infusion pump) and inhaled (via nebulizer device) routes of administration as the approved products Remodulin Injection and Tyvaso<sup>®</sup> Inhalation Solution, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Treprostinil diethanolamine is an innovative salt form developed for oral delivery as a sustained release (SR) osmotic tablet. Both treprostinil sodium and treprostinil diethanolamine disassociate in blood and exist as the ionized, bioactive form of treprostinil.</p>
              <p>Patients with diseases, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc), which involve perturbation of the peripheral vasculature, experience abnormalities in the blood vessels and mal-distribution of blood flow away from the nutritive capillaries that supply the skin. Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasoconstriction of small arteries in response to cold or stress that occurs in more than 90% of patients with SSc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An associated small vessel obliterative vasculopathy frequently leads to the development of ischemic digital ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a complication occurring in more than 40% of SSc patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As a chemically stable tricyclic benzindine analog of prostacyclin, treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation, induces vasodilation, and suppresses smooth muscle proliferation. Improvement in microvascular arterial blood flow and velocity in lower limbs and reduction in ischemic pain and healing of digital ulcers and other ischemic wounds has been observed with infused prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As an orally available formulation, treprostinil diethanolamine SR avoids the need for infusion devices and the associated demands and risks associated with the intravenous or subcutaneous route of delivery and may provide a treatment option for the peripheral vascular disease seen in SSc.</p>
              <p>The aim of the present study was to determine the pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profiles following escalating twice-daily doses of treprostinil diethanolamine SR in patients with SSc. During this pharmacokinetic trial, we also quantified changes in digital perfusion by laser Doppler imaging and correlated levels of perfusion with plasma drug concentration.</p>

                <p>Treprostinil diethanolamine SR was provided as 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg strengths for administration in the study. Oral dosing of treprostinil diethanolamine SR was initiated at 0.25 mg twice daily (BID) and the dose escalated in 0.25 mg increments every 48 hours at the evening dose, based on tolerability, up to a target dose of 4 mg BID (or maximum dose tolerated by each subject at the end of the eight-week escalation period). Subjects were instructed on the appropriate combination of tablets to administer for each dose and to take doses approximately every 12 hours within 10 to 15 minutes following a morning and evening meal containing approximately 500 calories.</p>

                <p>Within one hour of blood collection, plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 to 15 minutes at 3,000 g, harvested and immediately stored frozen at -20 to -25°C until shipment on dry ice for analysis. Plasma samples were analyzed by Enthalpy Analytical, Inc. (Durham, NC, USA). Treprostinil concentrations were determined by a validated method using solid-phase extraction followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC/MS/MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The lower limit of quantitation was 10 pg/mL using a 150 µL aliquot of human plasma, and the linear concentration range for the calibration curve was 10 to 5,000 pg/mL. The accuracy and precision were determined during validation by analyzing the quality control (QC) sample concentrations to ensure that the calibration standards that were analyzed were suitable for generating calibration curves. The acceptance criteria required the average accuracy be within ±15% and the precision should be ≤15% for low, mid, high, and dilution QC levels. For the lower limit of quantification QC level, the average accuracy needed to be within ±20% and the precision had to be ≤20%. Greater than or equal to half of the QC samples at any given concentration had to meet accuracy acceptance criteria. In addition, greater than or equal to two-thirds of all QC samples had to meet accuracy acceptance criteria.</p>

                <p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from individual plasma concentration versus time profiles using non-compartmental analysis methods and WinNonlin version 5.2.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Pharmacokinetic analysis included determination of the observed maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to maximum concentration (t<sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last time point with measurable drug concentration as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 12 hours post dose (AUC<sub>0-12</sub>), and apparent terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>). Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized by calculating the mean, median and coefficient of variation (CV%) by dose regimen. Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from subjects' treprostinil concentration profiles at doses other than 2 mg BID or 4 mg BID were excluded from the statistical summary and comparisons. Actual sampling times were used in the calculations of pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma concentrations that were below the lower limit of quantitation were set to zero when calculating summary statistics for plasma concentration at a given nominal time point, except when a single value fell between two measurable concentrations, then this value was set to be missing.</p>
                <p>Dose proportionality in treprostinil AUC<sub>0-12</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> following repeat doses of 2 mg and 4 mg BID was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

The least squares mean (LSM) difference in the parameter estimates between the two dose regimens and the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference were calculated. The difference and CI were then transformed back to the original scale to provide an estimate of the geometric LSM (GLSM) and 90% CI as the parameter ratio, 4 mg BID versus 2 mg BID.</p>

                <p>Subjects enrolled at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center also had serial measurements of digital perfusion performed at each pharmacokinetic visit pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-dose. Laser Doppler imaging was performed using the Moor Instruments LDI2-IR imaging system (Axminster, Devon UK). Perfusion was expressed as arbitrary perfusion units (PU). Laser Doppler imaging was performed in a quiet, temperature controlled room (20 to 23°C) following an acclimation period of 15 minutes prior to initiation of testing. Digital skin temperature was measured immediately prior to each laser Doppler imaging scan by affixing a thermistor (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) to the pad of the third distal phalanx of the hand under study.</p>
                <p>Mean perfusion of the middle three fingers of both hands and mean digital skin temperatures at pre-dose trough (time 0) were compared to 12 hours post-dose for each pharmacokinetic visit using the paired t-test after the normality of these variables' distributions was confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Repeated measures analyses using random effects models were performed using perfusion and skin temperature as dependent variables of interest and perfusion obtained at drug trough, log-transformed drug concentration, visit number, hour of Doppler assessment, and left versus right hand as potential explanatory variables. Covariates with <italic>P</italic>-values &lt;0.15 were retained in the statistical model. All data were used across time points, visits, and hands.

                <p>A total of 20 patients with SSc (ten at each center) were enrolled between March and December 2009. Nineteen subjects received at least one dose of study drug, and 16 subjects completed the eight week study in its entirety. Four subjects discontinued the study prematurely. Two subjects discontinued due to adverse events, one subject was withdrawn due to protocol violation, and another subject was lost to follow-up after undergoing the baseline visit. Two of these subjects withdrew after the first pharmacokinetic visit, and two subjects withdrew prior to undergoing any pharmacokinetic assessments.</p>
                <p>The population was predominately female (84.2%) and Caucasian (89.5%), with the limited cutaneous subset of SSc (52.6%). The subjects had ages ranging from 34 to 73 (mean: 48) years, body weights ranging from 46.4 to 95.1 (mean 69.3) kg, and body mass indices (BMI) ranging from 18.4 to 34.1 (mean 24.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The primary objective of this study was to characterize treprostinil pharmacokinetics in patients with SSc following repeat doses of treprostinil diethanolamine SR up to a maximum dose of 4 mg BID. Our data show that the oral SR formulation of treprostinil diethanolamine was effectively absorbed and that improvements in skin perfusion and temperature were temporally associated with drug levels during short-term (eight-week) treatment. This study demonstrated that oral administration of treprostinil diethanolamine resulted in systemic treprostinil exposure similar to that achieved with parenteral treprostinil doses of 10 to 20 ng/kg/minute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is the first study to demonstrate that cutaneous perfusion may improve with an oral prostacyclin formulation. Improvements in skin perfusion and temperature were detected at the second PK visit (4 mg dose), but not the first PK visit (2 mg dose). This difference may suggest a dose-response relationship, the effect of vascular remodeling with a longer duration of treprostinil therapy, or a statistical anomaly.</p>
              <p>Parenteral treprostinil therapy has been utilized in previous studies in SSc patients with digital ulcer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to the delivery complexities associated with this therapy an alternative was sought to enhance patient acceptance and to improve treatment options for this population. Treprostinil diethanolamine is an innovative salt form of treprostinil that has been developed and formulated into a SR osmotic tablet oral dosage formulation to provide near zero-order release of treprostinil over the majority of a 12-hour period. In the plasma at physiological pH, treprostinil exists in the ionized state. Once ionized, treprostinil will freely associate with the predominant counter-ion in the plasma, predominantly sodium. The bioactive species derived from either salt (treprostinil sodium or treprostinil diethanolamine) exists in the same biologically active form in the plasma as treprostinil; thus, treprostinil diethanolamine is expected to retain the bioactivity and safety profile of the approved infused treprostinil sodium.</p>
              <p>Consistent with established clinical use of prostacyclins, treprostinil diethanolamine SR requires dose titration based on signs and symptoms of disease and occurrence of adverse events. Pharmacokinetic sampling was selected at the 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID doses in this study, since they represented doses that could reasonably be achieved within an eight week escalation period. Consistent with studies in PAH patient populations, treprostinil diethanolamine SR provided plasma concentrations over the 12 hour dosing period supporting twice daily dosing in SSc patients. A linear relationship between dose and plasma concentration was observed at the 2 mg BID and 4 BID doses in SSc patients and there was no unexpected accumulation of treprostinil.</p>
              <p>In our study following dose escalation to 2 mg BID and 4 mg BID with oral treprostinil diethanolamine SR, an increase in digital perfusion was observed with increased treprostinil blood concentrations, suggesting a dose-response relationship. After controlling for baseline perfusion, hour of assessment, and hand under study, plasma treprostinil concentration was a significant predictor of perfusion and digital skin temperature at the end of study visit. While these data show effective systemic drug absorption following oral delivery and temporally improved blood flow, further investigation with a larger sample size and a control population is needed to confirm this association, to investigate the contribution of other potentially relevant covariates to perfusion, to correct for individual subjects' natural perfusion variations, and to evaluate for dose effects.</p>
              <p>During this study, treprostinil diethanolamine SR tablets were administered with a standardized 500 calorie meal. A recent study demonstrated that administration of treprostinil diethanolamine SR tablets following a 250 calorie meal or a 250 calorie liquid meal replacement supplement (Ensure<sup>®</sup>) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the extent of treprostinil diethanolamine SR bioavailability or plasma exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Smaller meal sizes may be required in some scleroderma patients as a result of esophago-gastric involvement of their disease, and this would not be anticipated to impact dosing in those patients. Bosentan and sildenafil are therapeutic agents used for the treatment of PAH and in Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcer disease in SSc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when these agents were co-administered with treprostinil diethanolamine SR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>The results of this study demonstrated that oral therapy with treprostinil diethanolamine SR initiated at 0.25 mg BID and gradually increased in stepwise 0.25 mg BID increments was reasonably well tolerated in subjects with SSc, and the overall adverse event profile was similar to that known to be associated with prostacyclin and its analogues in other patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The frequency of adverse event reporting was not unexpected as investigators were instructed to continue to dose titrate in the absence of adverse events up to the target dose or a subject's maximally tolerated dose. Dose escalation was initiated in 0.25 mg BID increments every 48 hours. The titration rate was slowed at the investigator's discretion based upon individual subject tolerability. Modulation of the dose escalation rate and increasing the interval between dose increases was an effective strategy for managing adverse events. The most common adverse events reported with too fast of a titration rate or too large of a dose increase are headache, nausea, flushing, diarrhea and vomiting. Although an oral dosage form, management of treprostinil diethanolamine SR dosing closely follows experience with infused prostacyclins. Consistent with established clinical use of prostacyclins, treprostinil diethanolamine SR requires dose titration based on signs and symptoms of disease and occurrence of adverse events. Due to the large inter-patient variability in peak plasma concentration and exposure, selection of an individual dosing regimen may be required in SSc patients to titrate treprostinil diethanolamine SR to achieve clinical benefit and balance adverse effects of prostacyclins, much the same as with parenteral forms.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Currently prostacyclin analogues are administered via intravenous or subcutaneous routes in scleroderma patients with vascular complications. Our data show that the oral SR formulation of treprostinil diethanolamine was effectively absorbed in patients with SSc, was associated with improved cutaneous perfusion and temperature with short-term treatment, and may provide a new therapeutic option for Raynaud's phenomenon and the peripheral vascular disease of SSc.</p>
