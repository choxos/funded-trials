                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Digital network–based methods may enhance peer distribution of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits, but interventions that can optimize this approach are needed. We aimed to assess whether monetary incentives and peer referral could improve a secondary distribution program for HIVST among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>Between October 21, 2019 and September 14, 2020, a 3-arm randomized controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted online among 309 individuals (defined as index participants) who were assigned male at birth, aged 18 years or older, ever had male-to-male sex, willing to order HIVST kits online, and consented to take surveys online. We randomly assigned index participants into one of the 3 arms: (1) standard secondary distribution (control) group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 102); (2) secondary distribution with monetary incentives (SD-M) group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 103); and (3) secondary distribution with monetary incentives plus peer referral (SD-M-PR) group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 104). Index participants in 3 groups were encouraged to order HIVST kits online and distribute to members within their social networks. Members who received kits directly from index participants or through peer referral links from index MSM were defined as alters. Index participants in the 2 intervention groups could receive a fixed incentive ($3 USD) online for the verified test result uploaded to the digital platform by each unique alter. Index participants in the SD-M-PR group could additionally have a personalized peer referral link for alters to order kits online. Both index participants and alters needed to pay a refundable deposit ($15 USD) for ordering a kit. All index participants were assigned an online 3-month follow-up survey after ordering kits. The primary outcomes were the mean number of alters motivated by index participants in each arm and the mean number of newly tested alters motivated by index participants in each arm. These were assessed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression to determine the group differences in the mean number of alters and the mean number of newly tested alters motivated by index participants. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. We also conducted an economic evaluation using microcosting from a health provider perspective with a 3-month time horizon. The mean number of unique tested alters motivated by index participants was 0.57 ± 0.96 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) in the control group, compared with 0.98 ± 1.38 in the SD-M group (mean difference [MD] = 0.41),and 1.78 ± 2.05 in the SD-M-PR group (MD = 1.21). The mean number of newly tested alters motivated by index participants was 0.16 ± 0.39 (mean ± SD) in the control group, compared with 0.41 ± 0.73 in the SD-M group (MD = 0.25) and 0.57 ± 0.91 in the SD-M-PR group (MD = 0.41), respectively. Results indicated that index participants in intervention arms were more likely to motivate unique tested alters (control versus SD-M: incidence rate ratio [IRR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.82 to 4.89, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001; control versus SD-M-PR: IRR = 3.26, 95% CI = 2.29 to 4.63, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) and newly tested alters (control versus SD-M: IRR = 4.22, 95% CI = 1.93 to 9.23, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001; control versus SD-M-PR: IRR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.92 to 6.37, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) to conduct HIVST. The proportion of newly tested testers among alters was 28% in the control group, 42% in the SD-M group, and 32% in the SD-M-PR group. A total of 18 testers (3 index participants and 15 alters) tested as HIV positive, and the HIV reactive rates for alters were similar between the 3 groups. The total costs were $19,485.97 for 794 testers, including 450 index participants and 344 alter testers. Overall, the average cost per tester was $24.54, and the average cost per alter tester was $56.65. Monetary incentives alone (SD-M group) were more cost-effective than monetary incentives with peer referral (SD-M-PR group) on average in terms of alters tested and newly tested alters, despite SD-M-PR having larger effects. Compared to the control group, the cost for one more alter tester in the SD-M group was $14.90 and $16.61 in the SD-M-PR group. For newly tested alters, the cost of one more alter in the SD-M group was $24.65 and $49.07 in the SD-M-PR group. No study-related adverse events were reported during the study. Limitations include the digital network approach might neglect individuals who lack internet access.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Monetary incentives alone and the combined intervention of monetary incentives and peer referral can promote the secondary distribution of HIVST among MSM. Monetary incentives can also expand HIV testing by encouraging first-time testing through secondary distribution by MSM. This social network–based digital approach can be expanded to other public health research, especially in the era of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously impacted the AIDS response [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Achieving the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 2025 targets will require openness to innovation and scale-up of breakthroughs in technology and service delivery to put people at the center, especially among marginalized populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These response strategies would also be relevant to other global public health issues. Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China have a high burden of HIV, while testing coverage remains low. In 2019, HIV prevalence was 6.3% among MSM, but only 56.4% were aware of their HIV status [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, methods that can increase HIV testing yield are needed. COVID-19–related restrictions have closed many HIV clinical services, further increasing barriers to HIV testing [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been shown as an effective approach to supplement the HIV testing services and reach individuals who have avoided facility-based testing [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the long run, HIVST can address unique programmatic needs and global HIV testing targets [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Particularly, in China, studies suggested that HIV phobia and institutional discrimination against people living with HIV are common [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The confidential and private nature of HIVST have the potential for addressing stigma and discrimination. More importantly, HIVST as an innovative method can be expected to reach and link people to care [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Social network–based HIV testing approaches are an extension of HIV partner services, where individuals encourage their sexual or social contacts to conduct HIV tests [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They are effective methods in optimizing HIV care and prevention [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. South African and Ugandan studies showed that peer-driven distribution of HIVST within sexual networks can expand HIV test uptake among MSM [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Partner distribution of HIVST has increased partner testing among HIV–negative female sex workers and women seeking antenatal and postpartum care in Kenya [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HIVST secondary distribution is a social network–based method whereby individuals receive multiple HIVST kits and distribute them to people within their social networks, including sexual partners and friends [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Secondary distribution can improve HIV testing coverage. However, the effectiveness of current social network methods is still limited, stressing the necessity to innovate the strategies [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Monetary incentives can increase demand for self-tests and work synergistically alongside network methods to increase HIV testing uptake[<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Conditional economic incentives refer to the financial or other material rewards given to participants for performing specific behaviors that may effectively increase HIV testing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the case of self-testing and distribution to sexual partners, insights from psychology and behavioral economics suggest that the “present-biased preferences” of individuals or preference for present smaller rewards overtakes the larger benefits in the future, maybe a barrier to uptake [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This occurs in HIVST where there are immediate logistical and psychological costs, but the benefits of self-testing are realized later [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The effectiveness of secondary distribution programs, on the other hand, may depend more on intrinsic prosocial preferences (or altruistic motives) of those distributing kits to peers [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and monetary incentives could backfire. Thus, extrinsic monetary incentives could either enhance or diminish intrinsic motivation to distribute kits [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>In-person delivery is one of the limitations of most HIVST secondary distribution models that increase barriers for the index participants to distribute. Online peer referrals can be a solution to this problem. MSM can refer members of their social networks online to order HIVST kits without any offline interactions. Peer referral leverages social networks in identifying undiagnosed HIV infections among marginalized and key populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By taking advantage of both social networks and digital platforms, peer referral with monetary incentives may enhance the effectiveness of HIV testing through a digital network–based HIVST service. In addition, peer-based referral systems may leverage some of the trust built into the social network of index MSM and motivate people to test [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of monetary incentives and peer referral in promoting the digital network–based secondary distribution of HIVST among MSM in China using a 3-arm randomized controlled trial.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>The study was conducted jointly by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Project-China, Zhuhai Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), and Zhuhai Xutong Voluntary Services Center (Xutong). Xutong is a gay-led community-based organization (CBO) in Zhuhai. The study utilized an HIVST online ordering system developed by Xutong. The ordering system was hosted and managed using WeChat, China’s largest social networking platform.</p>
                <p>In this study, we had 3 study groups: (1) standard secondary distribution (control) group; (2) secondary distribution with monetary incentives (SD-M) group; and (3) secondary distribution with monetary incentives plus peer referral (SD-M-PR) group. The trial procedures were similar for the 3 groups, all of which included a secondary distribution process. What distinguished the control group and intervention groups were that monetary incentives were implemented in the SD-M group and in the SD-M-PR group. In addition to monetary incentives, online peer referral, which was a virtual secondary distribution method, was added in the SD-M-PR group. We planned to recruit 300 eligible participants (100 for each arm) with the following inclusion criteria: (1) assigned male at birth; (2) aged 18 years or older; (3) ever had male-to-male sex; (4) be willing to order HIVST kits online; (5) be consented to take baseline and follow-up surveys online; and (6) ordered HIVST through the online platform. We assessed testing uptake rates and administered a follow-up survey 3 months after index participants ordering. All participants gave digital written informed consent by providing electronic signatures before the online baseline survey. Ethics approval was obtained through the Zhuhai CDC, and the study protocol of the trial was published [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

                <title>Randomization and masking</title>
                <p>Volunteers of Xutong enrolled all the participants by advertising the recruitment and trial introduction in the WeChat public platform. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of the 3 arms individually and independently by a computer-generated program electronically without the need for staff interaction. Index participants were asked to play a spinning game at the beginning of the baseline survey, which was to assign them into one of the groups randomly based solely on a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Each participant can only play the game once based on the IP address and phone number. Both study staff and index participants knew about the group assignment at the same time when index participants submitted the baseline survey. Both study staff and index participants were unblinded to allocation, and they knew about the group assignment at the same time when index participants completed the baseline survey. The group allocations remained concealed as the randomization took place before the interventions, and participants could not switch study arms later. Only the statisticians who analyzed the data remained blind to participant allocations.</p>

                  <title>Control group: Standard of care</title>
                  <p>The control group was a standard secondary distribution care model developed and implemented by Xutong [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Index participants in the control group completed the baseline survey and ordered HIV/Syphilis dual rapid test kits (SD Bioline, South Korea) through the online system. Index participants ordered HIVST kits by paying a refundable deposit for each kit, 100 RMB ($15), which was the equal value of the testing kit and gifts (condoms and lubricants) included in the testing package. Each HIVST kit was also attached with a self-testing instruction and a “returning card.” A returning card contained a QR code that allowed testers to scan and upload the photos of the test results anonymously and privately. There was also a confirmation number in the returning card to verify different index participants and their alters. Each index participant shared the same confirmation code with their alters. HIVST kits, self-test instructions, gifts, and returning cards were packaged in unlabeled boxes and mailed to index participants after they provided the shipping addresses and paid the deposit. Index participants could order up to 5 HIVST kits and arrange them by themselves by conducting self-tests, testing together with alters, or distributing the kits to alters.</p>
                  <p>After testing, all testers scanned the QR code in the returning card to submit photographs of their test results and reported whether they were index participants or alters. Alter testers also completed an anonymous survey. Index and alter testers were encouraged to upload their testing results separately and privately using the returning card and did not need to share the results. Testing was free for both index participants and alters, and trained CBO staff refunded all deposits via online transaction after verifying submitted test results. Those who tested positive (reactive) for HIV were referred for confirmatory testing at the local CDC and provided other counseling and linkage to care services by peer volunteers.</p>

                  <p>Index participants in this arm received the same procedures as the control group, with monetary incentives. Index participants could receive monetary incentives for self-tests and distribution. They could receive 20 RMB (approximately equal to $3) for self-tests. In terms of distribution, both the index participant and the alter could receive a 20 RMB when self-test results were uploaded and verified by each unique alters (by checking the confirmation code and phone number). All incentives were through online transactions. In this group, index participants could refer up to 5 alters and receive a maximum of 100 RMB incentives.</p>

                  <p>Participants in this arm were provided with the option of online peer referral, in addition to the monetary incentive arm procedures as previously described. Except for ordering and distributing kits directly to the alters, index participants in this arm could also utilize the approach of peer referral to complete the secondary distribution virtually. Index participants received a unique and personalized peer referral link to share with the alters, and they could distribute up to 5 HIVST kits through this channel (each alter could order 1 test kit through the link). In the system of peer referral, referred alters clicked the link shared by the index participant and completed the process of ordering and returning all by themselves. Alters paid the refundable deposit of 100 RMB ($15) online, provided the address, received the testing kits, conducted self-tests, and uploaded the results back to the platform. Similarly, both index participants and alters received a 20 RMB ($3) for verified tests by a unique alter. In this group, index participants could refer to up to 10 alters (5 kits distribution + 5 peer referral) and receive a maximum of 200 RMB.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>We define a motivated alter as an individual who conducted HIVST using the distributed kits from index MSM, uploaded the testing result, and the result was verified by trained CBO volunteers. For testers who uploaded results more than once, we removed duplication based on their phone numbers and used their most recent results for data analysis. Primary outcomes were (1) the mean number of unique tested alters motivated by index participants; and (2) the mean number of newly tested alters motivated by index participants for each arm. Secondary outcomes included the mean number of alters who tested positive for HIV recruited by index participants in each arm; the mean number of alters who tested positive for syphilis recruited by index participants in each arm; and evaluation of intervention effects for the mean number of alters motivated by index participants in subgroups defined by age, residence, sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and previous testing experience. Using micro-costing, we estimated the costs, including fixed capital costs, fixed costs for staff, fixed consumable costs, variable staff costs, and variable consumable costs, per person tested and costs per alter and newly tested alter of SD-M and SD-M-PR versus the control group. Specific amendments and rationale to primary outcomes and methods of outcome analyses were described in supporting materials (<xref rid="pmed.1003928.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>We calculated the study sample size based on our pilot study findings that the mean number of alters motivated by index participants was 0.65 by standard secondary distribution, 1.0 by SD-M, and 1.4 by secondary distribution with monetary incentives plus peer referral, respectively [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Assuming equal variance among the 3 groups, we applied a standard deviation (SD) of 0.5 (preliminary results) for all groups. A minimum detectable size of 0.35 would be of interest. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up, 300 participants, 100 in each group, would be required to provide 90% power with an alpha of 0.05.</p>
                <p>Baseline characteristics of index participants were reported using descriptive statistics. We used chi-squared tests to compare baseline differences between index participants who completed the 3-month follow-up survey and those who did not. A <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value is less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression for primary outcomes analyses. More specifically, the first primary outcome analyses compared the mean number of unique alters motivated by index participants between the intervention groups (SD-M and SD-M-PR) and the control group and between the 2 intervention groups (SD-M and SD-M-PR) by estimating the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its associated 95% CI. The second primary outcome analysis compared the mean number of newly tested alters motivated by index participants by estimating IRR and its associated 95% CI. We applied logistic regression for secondary outcome analyses, i.e., the mean number of alters with HIV reactive results identified by index participants, by estimating the odds ratio (OR) and its associated 95% CI. We conducted a subgroup analysis for the first primary outcome stratified by age (over or under 30 years), sexual orientation (self-identified as gay or others), previous testing experience (ever tested for HIV or not), or sexual behavior (had condomless anal sex in the past 3 months or not). All IRRs and ORs were adjusted by index participants’ age, highest education level, income, residence, marital status, and sexual orientation. All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio, Version 1.2.5033.</p>
                <p>We conducted an economic evaluation alongside the trial by using microcosting to estimate the total cost of each trial arm, the cost per person tested, the cost per alter tested, and the cost per alter diagnosed with HIV. Fixed (e.g., building rental and management expenses, office equipment, and capacity building) and variable costs (e.g., consumables, personnel time, and incentive cost) were collected from a healthcare provider perspective with a time horizon of 3 months. Economic costs were converted from Chinese Yuan (RMB) and presented as US Dollars USD (2020) (1 RMB = $0.15 USD).</p>
                <p>We followed the intention-to-treat principle and did not have missing data in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. We did not have a data monitoring committee because the potential trial risks were minor. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900025433). Results reporting followed the extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial (CONSORT) 2010 statement [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref rid="pmed.1003928.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

              <p><xref rid="pmed.1003928.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows the total number of kits ordered and secondary distributed by index participants within each arm. Index participants in the control arm ordered a total of 222 kits, and testers returned 209 test results (returning rate: 94%, 209/222), among which 144 results were from index participants self-testing, and 65 (31%, 65/209) results were from 58 unique alters. In the SD-M arm, a total of 275 kits were ordered by the index participants, and we received 257 (returning rate: 93%, 257/275) test results, among which 150 results were from index participants self-testing, and 107 (42%, 107/257) results were from 101 unique alters. In the SD-M-PR arm, index participants ordered 262 kits and referred 75 links, and we received a total of 328 (returning rate: 97%, 328/337) test results, among which 141 results were from index participants self-testing, and 187 (57%, 187/328) results were from 185 unique alters including 110 alters through offline kits distribution, and 75 alters through the online peer referral link. The discrepancies between the number of used kits and the number of identified alters (control: 65 versus 58; SD-M: 107 versus 101; SD-M-PR: 187 versus 185) are because of alters who tested and uploaded results more than once. More information regarding the number of kits ordered and actual kits distribution by index in each group is listed in <xref rid="pmed.1003928.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. The number of index participants who successfully motivated alters to HIVST was 40 (39%, 40/102) in the control group, 49 (48%, 49/103) in the SD-M, and 51 (49%, 51/104) in the SD-M-PR, respectively. In addition, each index participant who successfully motivated alters to HIVST ordered 2.9 kits on average in the control group, 3.6 kits in the SD-M group, and 3.5 kits in the SD-M-PR group (excluding peer referral links). Total 8 alters (7 in the control arm and 1 in the SD-M arm) did not want to complete the survey for alters and self-reported as index participants when returning results, according to the feedback from CBO staff. Most alters were same-sex partners (37%, 97/265) or gay friends (52%, 139/265) of the index participants, according to 269 alters who completed returned survey.

The total program costs were estimated to be $19,485.97 for 794 testers, including 450 index participants and 344 alter testers. Overall, the average cost per tester was $24.54, and the average cost per alter tester was $56.65. <xref rid="pmed.1003928.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003928.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003928.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs give further details of the fixed and variable costs for all 3 groups. The average cost per tester in the SD-M group was $24.20 compared with $23.44 in the SD-M-PR group and $26.69 per tester in the control group. For alter testers, the mean costs in the SD-M and SD-M-PR groups were $61.58 and $41.56, respectively, whereas that in the control group was $96.18. In addition, the average costs increased substantially to more than $100 for one newly tested alter in all 3 groups (<xref rid="pmed.1003928.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Compared to the control group, cost for one more alter tester in the SD-M group was $14.90 and $16.61 in the SD-M-PR group. The incremental cost per additional alter tested in the SD-M-PR group compared to the SD-M group was $17.49. For newly tested alters, the cost of one more alter in the SD-M group was $24.65 and was $49.07 in the SD-M-PR group, compared to the controls. Moving from SD-M to SD-M-R, the incremental cost per newly tested alter was $86.42. Both SD-M group and SD-M-PR group were dominated by the control group as they incurred higher costs yet produced fewer HIV reactive results.</p>

              <p>Improving HIV testing uptake is an important strategy in response to the global AIDS challenges. Social network–based secondary distribution of HIVST is feasible and effective in promoting HIV test uptake and identifying new testers among social contacts of MSM. Our study aimed to further optimize the effectiveness of secondary distribution as an innovative HIVST strategy. Our findings indicated that both incentive and peer referral could improve the efficacy of secondary distribution of HIVST among Chinese MSM. This 3-arm randomized controlled trial extends the literature by comparing the cost evaluation of 2 enhanced secondary distribution strategies, leveraging social networks, and drawing on digital platforms.</p>
              <p>Our trial extends knowledge on HIV care prevention in several ways by incorporating the use of digital distribution and incentives into an existing MSM community–led, social network–based HIVST service program. Our previous implementation evaluation study recruited alters directly in the platform but did not explore strategies to improve such recruitment [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This study provided an additional monetary incentive for index MSM to leverage their social networks and peer influence to distribute HIVST and encourage HIVST results returning from alters. It indicated that monetary incentives significantly improved HIVST secondary distribution among Chinese MSM. This strategy reached more MSM who had never received an HIV test before. Financial incentives have been applied across the HIV care continuum and have been found effective in improving uptake of HIV testing [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Incentives have also been used in other contexts to decrease risk behaviors and confront underlying social and structural vulnerabilities, such as poverty [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A previous study found that financial incentives increased HIVST uptake among male partners of pregnant women in Malawi [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our findings further indicate that the monetary incentive approach is a powerful strategy to improve HIV social network–based HIVST among MSM.</p>
              <p>In this study, a deposit was required for index individuals to acquire testing kits. The results may differ if implemented the program without this requirement. Specifically, the effect of monetary incentives could be either larger or smaller depending on whether monetary incentives substitute or complement any motivational effects of the deposit. Deposits could be an independent source of motivation if they acted as a commitment, whereby, after making a deposit, indexes would be motivated by so-called “sunk cost” effects [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The marginal effect of incentives could be more prominent if requiring a deposit is already a strong source of motivation (thus leaving less room for financial incentives to have notable effects). The effects of a monetary incentive could be smaller without the deposit, however, if the motivational effects of monetary incentives and deposit reinforce one another. Besides, deposits may potentially hinder the participation willingness among those who may be loss averse (89 MSM (21%, 89/417)) consented but an unpaid deposit with unknown reasons), it did ensure the overall performance of HIVST and secondary distribution. For instance, it may facilitate the likelihood to return results from testers, which can further benefit linkage to care and treatments where needed. Deposits may also prompt index participants to order an appropriate number of HIVST kits to reduce waste of HIVST kits or overtesting.</p>
              <p>Our study also indicated that monetary incentives alongside a peer referral approach could also increase the secondary distribution of HIVST, motivating more alters for testing. This was consistent with the literature on peer referral of HIV self-test kits [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our study tapped into the complexity of social networks in the internet era and leveraged digital technology by offering an opportunity for index MSM to send the ordering links to alters and, in turn, increasing testing coverage by encouraging more people within their social network for testing. However, our study results also suggested that online peer referral worked in conjunction with monetary incentives. Online peer referral alone had a suboptimal effect of motivating alters. We speculated that monetary incentives were the key contributors to secondary distribution. Nevertheless, due to the incentivized secondary distribution of HIVST, which might potentially cause privacy concerns and limit the flexibility of alters, the strategy of online peer referral further decentralized power to alters of index MSM and allowed them more freedom to determine when, where, and who to test with. Simultaneously, index MSM also had more options, both in-person or online peer referral, for distributing HIVST services when their social contacts were reluctant to accept an HIVST test kit due to confidentiality or other concerns caused by in-person contact.</p>
              <p>Additionally, our economic evaluation demonstrated that, compared to standard secondary distribution, small monetary incentives to index MSM lead to more alter testers and new alter testers getting tested, therefore lowering the average costs for each alter tested and new alter. Meanwhile, the cost for one additional tester was the smallest in SD-M arm when compared with the standard secondary distribution arm. Our findings suggested that from the health provider’s perspective, SD-M could be an attractive use of health resources to expand HIVST among MSM. However, adding monetary incentives was more expensive than nonincentivized secondary distribution to identify an alter tester with a new HIV diagnosis. Given the low numbers in the trial, there is uncertainty surrounding this finding. Our economic data may help inform HIVST secondary distribution interventions in similar contexts. For those focusing on expanding HIVST using secondary distribution methods in resource restricting settings, adding a small monetary incentive to motivate index individuals holds promise to further amplify the value of distributing HIVST within their social networks. However, the generalizability of the economic findings in this study should be further examined by sensitivity analysis.</p>
              <p>This integrated digital network–based self-testing approach may also hold promise in self-care interventions among key populations, such as other STI self-testing or self-collection. A qualitative study conducted in southern China among MSM demonstrated that their HIV/syphilis testing behaviors and preferences are associated with multilevel factors related to available testing technologies, stigma, service providers, and testing environments [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our approach was built into an existing real-life gay community–led, social network–based HIVST service program, ensuring the provision of MSM-tailored and friendly health services. Index MSM in this process are not only healthcare seekers but also health providers who may potentially introduce HIV-related knowledge or offer HIVST kits to members within their social networks. The decentralized nature of the secondary distribution of HIVST enables index MSM to get tested and distribute kits outside clinical settings. Therefore, they contribute to cross the boundaries between institutions and the community, which is an innovative and effective approach to extend the leverage of social networks and reach marginalized and stigmatized populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. COVID-19 exacerbated the profound inequalities running through the society [<xref rid="pmed.1003928.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our integrated approach can be a promotion of decentralized sexual health services, addressing the inadequate response to HIV/STI services among marginalized populations in LMICs. Moreover, our subgroup analysis also suggested interventions differently impacted MSM with disparate characteristics, including age, sexual orientation, sexual orientation disclosure, HIV testing history, and condomless sex within 3 months. It provided critical implications for future implementation and optimization of the interventions.</p>
              <p>This study had several limitations. First, our study implementation covered the lockdown period (January to May 2020) in China, during which HIV services were disrupted. How this has impacted our study results was uncertain. However, given the randomization of study participants and similar exposure to COVID-19 public health measures, we anticipated the impacts on study outcomes between the 3 groups would be similar. Further, during this period, HIVST was the only HIV testing option during the lockdown period, and facility-based testing services were unavailable. Our approach helped maintain the HIV care continuum by providing HIVST via a digital platform and expanded HIV testing coverage among MSM during a period when many HIV testing sites closed. Second, this study provided no evidence that the 2 interventions group were any better than the control group in finding alters newly diagnosed with HIV. This may be related to our small sample size. Additionally, some people who were self-tested as HIV positive may refuse to return their testing results. However, the returning rate in our study was high (between 93% and 97% across different study groups), and its impact may be small. Third, although our study had a high follow-up rate within 3 months, the loss of follow-up data may be biasing the results. However, the loss of follow-up rate was comparable between the 3 groups, and participants who were not followed up had similar social demographic characteristics as those who completed the 3-month follow-up survey. Fourth, unnecessary testing may occur during the experiment because multiple kits might be ordered, and index participants were expected to use and distribute them within 3 months. However, the original intent that permitted the individuals to order multiple kits was to encourage index participants to apply for more kits and distribute more kits to people in their social network. Finally, this digitally implemented program may neglect those who have limited internet accessibility or digital literacy. The index participants might reach this group through social network kits distribution, but future studies are needed to address this limitation.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study enhanced our understanding of the impacts of small monetary incentives and an additional online peer referral option in improving the reach of secondary distribution of HIVST. These findings have important implications for expanding HIVST among key populations using social network–based strategies in the digital era. This study provides foundational evidence for effective novel strategies to bridge the gap in HIV testing as an essential element of the HIV prevention and care cascade. Furthermore, this form of social network–based digital approach may apply to other public health research, especially in the era of COVID-19.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Tang,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Monetary Incentives and Peer Referral in Promoting Digital Network-Based Secondary Distribution of HIV Self-Testing among Men Who Have Sex with Men in China: A Three-arm Randomized Controlled Trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-02857R1) for consideration at PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>Your paper was evaluated by a senior editor and discussed among all the editors here. It was also discussed with an academic editor with relevant expertise, and sent to independent reviewers, including a statistical reviewer. The reviews are appended at the bottom of this email and any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>In light of these reviews, we will not be able to accept the manuscript for publication in the journal in its current form, but we would like to consider a revised version that addresses the reviewers' and editors' comments. We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response, and we plan to seek re-review by one or more of the reviewers. </p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration, your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments, the changes you have made in the manuscript, and include either an excerpt of the revised text or the location (eg: page and line number) where each change can be found. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file; a version with changes marked should be uploaded as a marked up manuscript.</p>
              <p>In addition, we request that you upload any figures associated with your paper as individual TIF or EPS files with 300dpi resolution at resubmission; please read our figure guidelines for more information on our requirements: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures</ext-link>. While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the PACE digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link>. PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>PLOSMedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript by Sep 22 2021 11:59PM. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement, making sure to declare all competing interests. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. If new competing interests are declared later in the revision process, this may also hold up the submission. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT. You can see our competing interests policy here: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/competing-interests" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/competing-interests</ext-link>.</p>

              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it. </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>In the interest of brevity, please consider shortening your title to ‘Monetary Incentives and Peer Referral in Promoting Secondary Distribution of HIV Self-Testing among Men Who Have Sex with Men in China: A Randomized Controlled Trial’.</p>
              <p>The Data Availability Statement (DAS) requires revision - note that a study author cannot be the contact person for the data. Please direct data requests to a non-author institutional point of contact, such as a data access or ethics committee.</p>
              <p>Line 37: Please update to ‘Conclusions’</p>
              <p>Please trim the ‘Methods and Findings’ section of your abstract – the section should be a single paragraph containing the following: </p>
              <p>* The study design, population and setting, number of participants, exact dates during which the study took place, length of follow up, definition of intervention and control states, who was blinded to the group allocation, and main outcome measures.</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: In this clearly presented, well-designed randomized trial, the authors test two additional strategies to amplify the impact of HIVST and peer testing for MSM in China: financial incentives and online peer referral. This presents relevant outcomes, including testing uptake overall and for first time testers and HIV and syphilis seroreactivity as well as costs. There are minor gaps that should be addressed prior to publication to strengthen this otherwise excellent trial.</p>
              <p>1. Preferred terminology is "assigned male at birth" instead of "born biologically male". Do you know what proportion of the study population identified as cis-men versus trans-women or gender non-conforming?</p>
              <p>2. The authors use a deposit in all arms of their trial, which is a separate mechanism of a financial incentive (contract) and has its own mechanistic influence on behavior. Why was this chosen? This should be added to the introduction and discussion section, along with a discussion of how this might impact trial results. </p>
              <p>3. The authors note that the number of alters per index might be artificially lowered because of the maximum of 5, 5, and 10 alter slots in each arm. Add details on what percentage of indexes in each arm maxed out the total number of alters allocated to further describe and quantify this potentially artificial ceiling. </p>
              <p>4. I am not familiar with the use of bootstrapping for statistical tests where data are not normally distributed (rather than using a non-parametric test or utilizing regression techniques that have more relaxed assumptions about normality). This should be seen by a statistical reviewer if not addressed in the initial review. </p>
              <p>5. Costing analysis: This is very important and I commend the authors for including it alongside the primary trial results. Table 4 has all of the relevant details for an incremental cost per X analysis, and yet all that is presented in the text is the cost per person tested or cost per person diagnosed, which is not the preferred metric for comparing models. The incremental cost per additional person tested is preferable and present in Table 4 but not discussed. </p>
              <p>6. Recruitment drop off: Any information on the drop off from 415 to 309? What do we know about the 106 who did not consent? What data are there to support that the deposit might be a barrier? This is a substantial fraction of the otherwise eligible population and would need to be described further. </p>
              <p>7. Line 247 how did the authors get 65 results from 58 unique alters? And same for line 250. This is unclear</p>
              <p>8. Line 304 "average cost per tester was $24.54." Is this for index clients or all clients collapsed together? Which costs were the largest drivers? Which were the estimates most sensitive to? </p>
              <p>9. Discussion: all of the trial arms include a peer network approach, but what distinguishes third arm is the additional VIRTUAL/ONLINE peer referral instead of in person. This is not well described or clarified in this paper. This should be revised throughout to clarify that peer referral was present in all arms but the third arm had a virtual referral as well. </p>
              <p>10. Lines 343-347: how did this speculation compare to observation from the data?</p>
              <p>11. Table 3 is fascinating and should be interpreted further in the results and discussion. Effects more pronounced in older, non-disclosed, and higher risk men. </p>
              <p>12. Figure 2 error bars needed</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The paper describes a trial of two HIV self-test secondary distribution strategies among men having sex with men in China: incentives and online peer referral. It is an important study given the need to improve uptake of testing among key populations. There are however methodological weaknesses that call for caution in the interpretation of the findings:</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>1. Deposit refunds were only given upon upload of test results. This could have forced index participants to over test so they could get reimbursed - there were 150 tests from 102 control participants, showing unnecessary testing and potential wastefulness of the intervention. Related to this, in lines 384-389, it does not seem convincing that the restriction on number of kits ordered was actually a limitation as it seems people ordered more than they could distribute</p>
              <p>2. In the peer referral arm an index could distribute to/refer more people (ten) compared to five in the other arms. This makes results on mean numbers of testers incomparable with the other arms </p>
              <p>3. There were baseline differences by arm in participant characteristics. Please comment on potential for confounding</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>4. Consider the rewording the definition of alters because in the abstract it sounds like an alter is the whole network/group, rather than one individual</p>
              <p>5. Although it is clear in the manuscript, in the abstract it is unclear where self-test results were uploaded (line 16)</p>
              <p>6. From the abstract it is not immediately clear what is being referred to as the digital approach</p>
              <p>Manuscript</p>
              <p>7. Page 13 lines 81-82: it is not clear what "may crowd them out" means</p>
              <p>8. Line 158 - not clear whether the index received an additional 20rmb to the one described in line 157</p>
              <p>9. Line 182 - Syphilis comes from nowhere without having been described in the methods nor any of the earlier sections. How and where were syphilis tests done?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Included in the uploaded file </p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: I confine my remarks to statistical aspects of this paper. Unfortunately, I think the statistical analysis was not correctly chosen; fortunately, the data are there to fix this pretty easily.</p>
              <p>**Main issue**</p>
              <p>The main issue is that the dependent variables are counts. Therefore, count regression models should be used. The authors could try Poisson regression but will likely want to move to negative binomial regression. as the assumptions of Poisson are rarely met. Simply taking confidence intervals and comparing them isn't adequate. A regression model would also allow the use of control variables such as age. The economic analysis should probably use OLS regression or maybe quantile regression.7u</p>
              <p>p. 3 lines 28-30 (and also in the main text): Instead of giving mean and sd, please give median and IQR. Clearly, these variables are highly skewed and negative values are impossible. In addition, tables of the number of alters by group should be given (something like:</p>
              <p> Control SDM SDMPR</p>
              <p>0</p>
              <p>1</p>
              <p>2</p>
              <p>3</p>
              <p>etc.</p>
              <p>**More minor issues**</p>
              <p>Starting on p 9 line 177: Remove each use of "mean". The outcome variable is the number of alters, not the mean number of alters. A variable should exist for each observation; here, each index person has a number of alters</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Plos Med</p>
              <p>In this revision, the authors have made substantial changes to the manuscript to address reviewer comments. There are a number of typos, lack of clear and precise language, and remaining inaccuracies that detract from this revision. In addition, a few additional comments would be important to address prior to publication.</p>
              <p>1) The wording is unclear in several sections that have been rewritten, including a) the description of the deposit mechanism in the discussion, b) the description of the virtual/online peer referral in the third arm with peer referral. </p>
              <p>2) The authors responded to the question about whether the number of alters per index might be artificially lowered because of the maximum of 5, 5, and 10 alter slots in each arm. They added Supplementary table 1 and a narrative interpretation. However, Supplementary table 1 only shows the 5+ category in the bottom half of the table about the number of test kits distributed, rather than ordered, which prohibits assessing how many ordered &gt;5 kits. Then, the number of kits distributed was higher in the SD-M-PR arm (as per the table), so the interpretation is inaccurate: "the upper limit of the number of kits order[ed] might not be a limitation of alters' motivation". This section should be revised for data completeness and accuracy.</p>
              <p>3) The abstract was fully revised to remove much of the primary results of the paper in favor of a lot of details about the costing analysis; why were the primary results cut? </p>
              <p>4) The main point about the second arm including peer referral (in person) and the third arm including VIRTUAL or DIGITAL peer referral is still really missing in the paper and erroneously makes it seem as though "peer referral" (instead of "virtual peer referral") is the unique concept being tested in the third arm. This point was made nicely on page 8 in response to my prior comment, but then throughout the rest of the manuscript the same clarity is missing. </p>
              <p>5) Page 16 of the marked up manuscript, line 430 says "similarly" to compare two sets of outcomes in which one has an association and the other does not; is there a typo in the interpretation? </p>
              <p>6) Page 16 of the marked up manuscript, most of the absolute value changes and differences between arms have been removed, leaving only the relative changes (IRR). The absolute differences are important, even if only means without bootstrapped 95%Cis. </p>
              <p>7) The titles for Table 2 and 3 are mixed in the text. Subgroup analyses are Table 3, not 2. </p>
              <p>8) The directionality of the association of disclosure of sexual orientation and tested alters is different depending on the comparison groups; the text should reflect this mixed directionality and does not. </p>
              <p>9) I would ask the authors to re-interpret their cost-effectiveness section of the text, especially the wording related to more or less cost-effective. The table is correct but doesn't show the SD-M-PR arm compared to the control arm to support the text interpretation. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Authors have put effort in responding to comments, with improved clarity. There are still aspects related to study design and execution, as well as interpretation, that remain unclear. Specific comments are below:</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>1. The response to Comment 1 from Reviewer 2 still does not address the difference in numbers of tests among index participants and the number of index participants, and the likely over-testing. It would be important to spell out over what time/period the assessments of testing uptake were made for each index. Surveys were conducted three months after randomisation, were assessments of testing uptake also done over three months, in which case unnecessary testing was possible - there were more index testers than index participants, e.g. there were 150 tests received from 103 SD-M index participants?</p>
              <p>2. Related to above, in response to comment 7 from reviewer 1, authors state that there were discrepancies related to people who uploaded results more than once. It would be expected that the study methods would be able to correct such duplication.</p>
              <p>3. The response to Reviewer 3 on allocation concealment does not seem to address the question. How was allocation concealment done? Who told the participants what arm they were in (and how was this done) and how was the computer-generated code concealed from study staff? Was this all done electronically without need for staff interaction? The methods of recruitment and allocation are unclear</p>
              <p>4. Minor comment: Page 11 Author summary: Under the paragraph "What do these findings mean", the term 'digital based programs' comes out of nowhere as the preceding paragraphs haven't mentioned that the programs are digital based</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: The authors have addressed my concerns and I now recommend publication.</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>Please clearly state and define the primary outcomes of the study in the abstract.</p>
              <p>In the abstract, please include effect sizes and 95% CI for the primary outcomes (those found in the lowermost rows of Table 2).</p>
              <p>Please remove the sentence 'The study design and reporting of the results were followed the CONSORT 2010 guidelines' from the abstract.</p>
              <p>Please include the numbers of new HIV infections in the abstract.</p>
              <p>Please remove p-values from Table 1.</p>
              <p>Please amend 'newly testers' in the title of Figure 2.</p>
              <p>Throughout the manuscript, please report relevant p-values after 95% CI. </p>
              <p>At line 191, please make sure it is clear to readers that all participants were required to pay the deposit, not just some of them (or alternatively, please let me know if I have that wrong). </p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors did a strong and detailed revision to all of my prior comments. Brief requested changes below, after which this article is suitable for publication:</p>
              <p>1. Table 2 column headers use the phrase "by each index participant" but it seems to be the total number from ALL index participants. Check and revise throughout as appropriate.</p>
              <p>2. The footnote of Table 2 says "Zero inflated negative binomial regression was used to calculate IRR for outcomes "number of unique alters tested" and "number of newly-tested alters for HIV". Logistic regression was used to calculate OR for outcome "Number of alters identified with HIV-reactive results". Why were different regression methods used for these analyses?</p>
              <p>3. The new CEA interpretation has a sentence, "For programs with a budget of more than $7688·30 and a cost-effectiveness threshold of no less than $17.73 per tester..." Where diid these numbers come from? The $17.73 does not match numbers given in the table and the total budget seems to be driven by the sample size in the study, not a population. The cost-effectiveness thresholds are somewhat arbitrary; are there any data about other interventions that are more or less costly per person tested that have been adopted to ground these estimates in?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript now reads better and is clearer; reviewer comments have been addressed satisfactorily.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Tang,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Monetary Incentives and Peer Referral in Promoting Secondary Distribution of HIV Self-Testing among Men Who Have Sex with Men in China: A Randomized Controlled Trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-02857R4) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by one reviewer. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by Jan 17 2022 11:59PM.   </p>

              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Line 22: Please update the phrasing here to more clearly define your primary outcomes in the abstract. For example, “The primary outcomes were the mean number of motivated alters who have photo-verified self-testing per index in each arm, the proportion of first-time HIV testing among alters in each arm, and the proportion of alters with a positive HIV testing result in each arm. These were assessed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression.” Please adjust phrasing as required to ensure consistency between the abstract and the main text. </p>
              <p>Line 25: Please indicate that these results are mean ± standard deviation.</p>
              <p>Line 35: Please expand this sentence to state the total number of HIV positive participants, and the proportion of first-time HIV testing among alters in each arm (per the outcomes listed in the protocol). Consider including a sentence relating to the third outcome, e.g., “there were similar proportions of alters newly testing positive in the three groups”.</p>
              <p>Please mention the refundable deposit in the abstract. </p>
              <p>Line 75: Please include standard deviation in the Author Summary.</p>
              <p>Line 84: In the interest of brevity, please remove this bullet point (I feel the following bullet conveys a similar point). </p>
              <p>Line 246: Please update ‘Our primary outcomes included to ‘Primary outcomes were …’.</p>
              <p>Line 256: Please check the numbering of your supplementary file contents – the protocol amendments are located in S4 not S3 (please check throughout).</p>
              <p>Line 269: Please note CONSORT discourages baseline comparisons. Please ensure these have been consistently removed throughout the manuscript (beyond removing the p-values from Table 1), from e.g. lines 315-16.</p>
              <p>Line 278: ‘HIV-reactive results’.</p>
              <p>Line 302: Please report &lt;1% rather than 0%.</p>
              <p>Line 322: Please add a space between ‘returned’ and ‘209’.</p>
              <p>Line 344: As above, this should be Supplementary Table 2 not 1 (please check throughout).</p>
              <p>Line 363: Please remove the comma after the full stop.</p>
              <p>Lines 376-377: Please rephrase this sentence for clarity (the wording at line 353-355 is more clear).</p>
              <p>Line 475: ‘would be a cost-effective strategy’.</p>
              <p>478: Please delete the word ‘however; from this sentence.</p>
              <p>Lines 521-523: Please provide a supplementary table with the data to support this statement (participants who were not followed up had similar social demographic characteristics as those who had completed the three-month follow-up survey) and add a reference to it in your Results section. Please re-number all supplementary tables as required. </p>
              <p>Table 2: Unless I am missing it, I cannot see any data to which the footnote labelled ** applies (p&lt;0.001).</p>
              <p>Supplementary Table 3: Please include the full excel sheet of cost items in your supplementary material as a study author cannot be the point of contact for data requests.</p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have made many revisions to this manuscript in this most recent submission, some of which add additional confusion, unfortunately. </p>
              <p>1) Table 2: while the authors stated in their response letter that the headers should refer to "by all participants" rather than "by each participant", but the header was revised to read "Total number of unique alters motivated by each index participant". Recommend revising to have each --&gt; all or "total number of unique alters motivated by participants". As is, it is unclear. (Also recommend a spell check to catch typos like "umber" in lieu of "number" in header). </p>
              <p>2) Table 4 has been flipped in orientation for some reason and the resultant table is not a traditional CEA format and is less clear. If the authors prefer to retain as is for a particular reason, that's fine, but it is an unnecessary change that does not aid in clarity.</p>
              <p>3) The authors state in their response letter that they've removed the thresholds for cost-effectiveness, but this partially remains in the manuscript, along with cost-effective language. Recommend a careful re-read of every section of the manuscript that deals with the health economics evaluation in full with attention to prior review comments to make changes consistent and accurate throughout instead of partially changed and with some retained errors in reach revision. I did not re-read every section in careful detail to catch each of these errors beyond the first one noted.</p>

              <p>Thank you for providing the cost data excel sheet. Please confirm this spreadsheet does not contain any data that could compromise participant privacy.</p>
              <p>Please update the last sentence of the S4 Table legend from 'available on request' to 'available in the supplementary materials'.</p>
              <p>Please delete “(statistician)” at line 9 (abstract).</p>
              <p>At line 9 (abstract), please make that “index participants”.</p>
              <p>At line 23, we suggest some rewording for clarity: “Primary outcomes were the differences in mean number of unique motivated alters with photo-verified self-testing by index participants in each arm; and the mean number of newly-tested alters motivated by index participants in each arm.”</p>
              <p>At line 41, please make that “tested HIV positive”.</p>
              <p>At line 50, please make that “Limitations include …”</p>
              <p>At line 51, please move the trial registration number to a separate line at the end of the abstract. Please move the phrase regarding ITT analysis earlier in the abstract, e.g., to line 27.</p>
              <p>At line 427 (first paragraph of Discussion), please add a sentence, say, to summarize the trial’s findings. </p>
              <p>Please use “PLoS” consistently in the reference list.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr Tang, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Dr Elvin Geng, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Monetary Incentives and Peer Referral in Promoting Secondary Distribution of HIV Self-Testing among Men Who Have Sex with Men in China: A Randomized Controlled Trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-02857R6) in PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>When making the formatting changes, please also make the following updates:</p>
              <p>* Please update your methods (lines 255-256) to refer to 'mean' rather than 'total' numbers (for consistency with the way you define outcomes in your abstract).</p>
              <p>* Delete 'Total number of' from all column headers in Table 2 (as the columns actually contain numbers, means, and measures of risk).</p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>medicinepress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
              <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Thank you again for submitting to PLOS Medicine. We look forward to publishing your paper. </p>
              <p>Sincerely, </p>
              <p>Callam Davidson </p>
