                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>What are the comparative neurocognitive effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, on adults with hypertension and executive mild cognitive impairment?</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi200465-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial of 176 adults with hypertension, 12-month treatment with candesartan was associated with improvement in executive function and episodic memory compared with lisinopril.</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi200465-3">
                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>These findings suggest that among older adults with hypertension and mild cognitive impairment, treatment with candesartan provided better neurocognitive effects compared with lisinopril despite equivalent blood pressure levels.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Observational studies have suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers are associated with a unique cognitive protection. It is unclear if this is due to reduced blood pressure (BP) or angiotensin receptors type 1 blockade.</p>

                  <p>This randomized clinical trial included participants aged 55 years or older with MCI and hypertension. Individuals were withdrawn from prior antihypertensive therapy and randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to candesartan or lisinopril from June 2014 to December 2018. Participants underwent cognitive assessments at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Brain magnetic resonance images were obtained at baseline and 12 months. This intent-to-treat study was double-blind and powered for a sample size accounting for 20% dropout. Data were analyzed from May to October 2019.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Clinical trials have suggested that lowering blood pressure (BP) using antihypertensive therapy provides cognitive protection in individuals without impaired cognition.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It is unclear if this is also true in individuals who have symptoms of cognitive impairment. Studies designed to compare the neurocognitive effects of antihypertensive classes in individuals who are cognitively impaired are limited. It is also unclear if these effects are related to the reduction in BP or to possible pleiotropic BP-independent effects of certain antihypertensive medications. Comparing antihypertensive drug classes independent of the degree of BP lowering is critical to determine if these effects on cognition are only secondary to their BP or other non-BP effects. Such pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive drugs may be leveraged to repurpose drugs for cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD).</p>
              <p>Another limitation of past studies is the use of a global cognitive measure that may not detect significant effects on executive function. Executive function is a key cognitive domain that is highly susceptible to hypertension,<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and impairment in executive function highly correlates with future functional impairment and dementia.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Executive dysfunction, within the context of hypertension, reflects vascular cognitive impairment and underlying vascular brain injury such as white matter lesions (WMLs) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A 2019 study<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> suggested the latter may be ameliorated by antihypertensive therapy. However, it is unclear if there are differential effects among antihypertensive classes.</p>
              <p>Prior observational studies have suggested that drugs that modulate the renin angiotensin system (RAS) have a cognitive protective association.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Of the RAS-modulating drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may have a superior association compared with other classes in affecting cognitive function.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The potential explanation may be related to their differential blockade of the 2 angiotensin receptors (AT<sub>1</sub> and AT<sub>2</sub>) in the brain.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Activation of AT<sub>1</sub> promotes neurotoxic mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, cerebral hypoperfusion and cholinergic depletion.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Stimulation of AT<sub>2</sub> counteracts these mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Therefore, selective blockade of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptors with ARBs may offer superior protection than simultaneously lowering both of AT<sub>1</sub> and AT<sub>2</sub> receptor activities, such as with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). In our previous pilot study in adults with hypertension and mild cognitive impairment (MCI),<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> candesartan, an ARB, was superior to lisinopril, an ACEI, in providing cognitive protection.</p>
              <p>The objective of this 1-year double-blind randomized clinical trial was to compare neurocognitive effects of candesartan with lisinopril in individuals with MCI and hypertension with the goal of achieving equivalent BP levels in both groups.</p>

                <title>Trial Design</title>
                <p>This randomized clinical trial was an investigator-initiated single-center double-blind trial conducted in the metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, area, comparing the neurocognitive effects of oral candesartan with lisinopril during 1 year. Study participants underwent screening, baseline, 6-month, and 12-month evaluations. Additional visits included biweekly titration visits after randomization to escalate hypertension treatment until goal or maximum drug treatment were achieved. Additional visits with the study physicians were conducted as needed when BP was out of range, adverse events were reported, or at the request of the participant. Visits were supplemented with telephone calls throughout the trial period.</p>
                <p>Eligible participants were provided a calibrated BP machine and were trained on using it during the screening visit. All those receiving prestudy antihypertensive medication were guided through a period of gradual taper and washout per a standard protocol. Participants were subsequently randomized in a 1-to-1 block randomization using a computerized random number generator on race (African American vs other) and number of antihypertensive medications prior to study enrollment (≤2 vs &gt;2) to ensure equal distribution between treatment groups and to allow for future preplanned subgroup analyses.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Following baseline and randomization, participants received escalating treatment in identical oral capsule formulations and were evaluated every 2 weeks with the goal of achieving mean sitting BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg. All participants commenced the initial daily dosage of candesartan 8 mg or matched capsule of lisinopril 10 mg. Subsequent dose titration for candesartan was 8 mg to 16 mg to 32 mg and for lisinopril was 10 mg to 20 mg to 40 mg. If BP was still higher than 140/90 mm Hg at the highest dose of the blinded medication, additional open-label antihypertensive therapy was added, starting with hydrochlorothiazide at 12.5 mg to 25 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 10 mg, and metoprolol XL 12.5 mg to 25 mg to 50 mg, until BP control was achieved or all classes were used. Participants received all their antihypertensive therapy from the study site for 1 year from the Emory Investigational Drug Services. Throughout the study, participants did not receive any concomitant BP management from other sources, and all nonstudy medications were reviewed at each visit.</p>

                <p>All participants underwent a full history and examination and provided data by interview or direct observation or examination. Collected data included demographic characteristics (including self-identified race/ethnicity), anthropometric information, seated and standing standardized BP measurements (appropriate cuff size, rest period, unclothed arm), and concurrent medication and supplement inventory. A series of comprehensive neuropsychological tests assessing multiple domains was conducted at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Executive function was assessed using TMT Parts A and B.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Part A was collected to correct for motor speed and visual-perceptual demands on TMT by subtracting completion time for TMT Part A from completion time for Part B (TMT B − A). Part B − A provides a relatively purer measure of executive functioning.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Participants who could not complete the TMT Part B after 5 minutes were stopped, and their scores were recorded as 300 seconds.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial of individuals with MCI and hypertension, 1-year therapy with candesartan was associated with better cognitive outcomes compared with lisinopril, including 1 of the 2 executive function measures, and in memory. Those randomized to lisinopril had significant accumulation of WML, whereas those randomized to candesartan had no significant increase in WML. These effects were independent of BP-lowering properties.</p>
              <p>In the largest observational study to our knowledge, use of ARBs was associated with lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) compared with ACEIs and other antihypertensives.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Analysis of the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> suggests that people who use ARBs have better cognitive trajectories over 3 years and less WML accumulation. More recently, Ding and colleagues,<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> in a participant-level meta-analysis of cohort observational studies of predominantly White individuals, reported no differences in antihypertensive classes and the risk of dementia or AD. Although no specific comparisons between ACEI and ARB use was presented, that study did not seem to account for BP change over a long period. The hypertension group excluded those on treatment with controlled BP and did not investigate the association with executive function. This study, in contrast, suggests that when the BP effects are matched in a clinical trial, ARBs provide neurocognitive protection on executive function even over the short-term. This is the second clinical trial in hypertension and MCI suggesting these favorable effects.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> However, in this trial we also observed that candesartan may positively affect memory, which suggests a role in amnestic disorders, such as AD.</p>
              <p>Prior trials have suggested that lowering of BP is protective against cognitive decline. Only a few of these were designed to compare drug regimens and most excluded individuals with symptomatic cognitive impairment. Two large trials comparing ACEI and ARB included cognitive outcomes: Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial, which compared ACEI, ARB, and the combination, and Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects With Cardiovascular Disease trial, which compared a placebo with ARB in participants who were intolerant to ACEIs.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Neither of these studies included cognitively symptomatic individuals, and the cognitive measure was a single test of global cognition, the Mini-Mental State Exam, which is rather insensitive to executive impairment and in detecting change over time. Hence, our study addresses a key gap in the literature. Although further larger and longer-term studies are needed, this randomized clinical trial provides additional and incremental support to the positive neurocognitive effects of candesartan that are likely independent and additive to their BP-lowering effects.</p>
              <p>Based on our current understanding of the brain RAS activity, we propose that the neurocognitive benefits of candesartan are due to the selectivity of the blockade of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, allowing the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor to remain active. Supporting evidence for AT<sub>2</sub> receptor activation comes from animal models in which AT<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists decreased brain infarct area after ischemic injury by increasing cerebral perfusion in the penumbra,<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> decreased superoxide production,<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and decreased inflammation and axonal degeneration.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Activation of the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor is associated with axonal regeneration, neuronal repair,<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and decreases in vascular inflammation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Additionally, ARBs reduce inflammatory markers more than ACEIs<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and potentially restore endothelial dysfunction via AT<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200465r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> These potential mechanisms should be the focus of future investigations and analyses of this trial data.</p>
              <p>Executive function is an important domain that is highly susceptible to vascular brain injury. Hypertension and executive impairment are associated with microvascular brain damage, and our study provides initial evidence that candesartan, but not lisinopril, protects against WML accumulation and vascular brain injury. However, it is worth noting that the between group difference was not statistically significant.</p>
              <p>The advantages of this study are the inclusion of participants with MCI and comparing 2 drugs that modulate RAS differently, hence providing important insights into the role of RAS in the brain in individuals who are cognitively impaired. Evaluating measures of executive function, the domain most likely to be affected by hypertension and microvascular disease, provides additional unique insights into the hypertension-cognition-RAS axis. In addition, we recruited a highly diverse population and achieved similar BP levels in both treatment groups.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>A limitation of this study is its 1-year study period. Although we have found a positive effect on individual cognitive domains, translation into dementia care should be interpreted within that short-term context. Although executive function has been identified as risk factor for future functional decline, our study did not demonstrate an effect on our functional measures (ie, Dysexecutive Functioning Questionnaire or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living).<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> This is likely owing to the duration of the study combined with a possible ceiling effect on these measures, since our sample was functionally independent at baseline. Longer study duration may offer greater insight into the functional effects of candesartan. Further, this study cannot be generalizable to other drugs within the same classes of ARB and ACEI, and our findings are applicable to a single drug effect within a class, and not a class effect. Additional limitations include the relatively small sample size, which limited our power to correct for multiple comparisons. Approximately 25% of the clinical trial sample did not have neuroimaging data. Although we were able to detect a possible difference in microvascular disease, our ability to examine the effect on hippocampal volume or cerebral perfusion is likely limited by the power of the neuroimaging component and the 1-year duration of the study. Although we have provided analytical approaches to account for the observed differences at baseline in TMT Part B and WML, our results should be interpreted within the context of this limitation. Nevertheless, our study provides additional evidence for the potential role of ARBs in neurocognitive protection. While these findings would fall into hypotheses generation and justify larger trials, ARBs in general, and candesartan in particular, offer an intriguing therapeutic possibility for cognitive disorders in relation to vascular brain injury, and especially when considered cumulatively with prior observational studies<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and our prior pilot.<sup><xref rid="zoi200465r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Currently, there are no available drugs for executive MCI or other cognitive disorders that are becoming more prevalent as populations age. Hence, further investigations of ARBs in this area are critical.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrate that candesartan is superior to lisinopril on executive function and memory outcomes in MCI. These effects are independent of but likely additive to their BP-lowering effects. Future studies in executive and memory impairments, such as those with prodromal AD, are warranted.</p>
