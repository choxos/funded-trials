              <abstract>
                <p>This study compared the effectiveness of two Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) interventions on weight loss among overweight and obese Marshallese adults. The study was a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in 30 churches in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Marshallese adults with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were eligible for the study. The study sample included 380 participants. Participants received either a faith-based adaptation of the DPP or a family-focused adaptation of the DPP, each delivered over 24 weeks. The primary outcome was weight change from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in Hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>, blood pressure, dietary intake, family support for healthy behaviors, and physical activity. Outcomes were examined longitudinally using general linear mixed effects regression models, adjusting for baseline outcomes, sociodemographic covariates, and clustering of participants within churches. Reductions in weight were small for both groups. Overall, only 7.1% of all participants lost 5% or more of their baseline body weight. There were no significant differences in weight loss between the 2 arms at 6 months (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .3599) or at 12 months (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .3207). Significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found between the 2 arms at 6 months (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0293; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0068, respectively). Significant within-arm changes were found for sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and family support for both arms at both follow-ups. Both interventions achieved a modest weight loss. While even modest weight loss can be clinically significant, future research is needed to identify chronic disease prevention interventions that can successfully reduce weight for this at-risk population.</p>

              <p>Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations are the second fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States (US).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Much of the growth is concentrated in Southern and Midwestern states.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> There are approximately 17 000 Marshallese Pacific Islander residents in Arkansas and Oklahoma; most reside in Springdale, Arkansas and Enid, Oklahoma.</p>
              <p>Beginning in 2012, a community- and patient-engaged research team began conducting qualitative and quantitative needs assessments within the community.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Health screening events conducted with adults in the Marshallese community in Arkansas found significant health disparities disproportionate to the general US population. More than a third (38.4%) of participants (n = 401) had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).<sup><xref rid="bibr7-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This proportion is more than 3 times the rate of T2DM observed in the general US adult population.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Another 32.6% of Marshallese participants had prediabetes, and 89.7% were overweight or obese.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Excess body weight is the strongest modifiable risk factor for T2DM, and weight loss of 5-10% of a person’s body weight can lead to clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of T2DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr12-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In response to the aforementioned disparities, researchers and Marshallese stakeholders sought to discover an evidence-based weight loss intervention to reduce T2DM. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a gold standard behavioral weight loss intervention that improves risk factors for T2DM. The DPP has decreased the incidence of T2DM by 58% across multiple settings in the general population and in multiple racial and ethnic populations including African American/Black and Hispanic communities.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> While the DPP has been tested across multiple populations and settings, the DPP had yet to be adequately tested in Pacific Islander populations in general or the Marshallese population specifically.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>After reviewing many of the DPP interventions adapted for other populations, researchers chose 2 DPP adaptations that seemed the most salient to Marshallese and had potential to make significant changes in body weight and other T2DM risk factors: Partnership for Improving Lifestyle Intervention (PILI) DPP<sup><xref rid="bibr16-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and Wholeness, Oneness, Righteousness, Deliverance (WORD) DPP.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Both interventions incorporated all required components of the DPP. These interventions focus on increasing physical activity, eating healthily, and maintaining a healthy weight.

                <title>Purpose of the Study/Study Overview</title>
                <p>Using a community- and patient-engaged approach, we worked with community stakeholders to design and conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT). The primary aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of 2 DPP curriculums (PILI and WORD) on weight loss among overweight and obese Marshallese adults. Given that the PILI DPP included more cultural components relevant to Marshallese and yielded significant weight loss in other NHPI populations, we hypothesized that participants randomized to the PILI DPP arm would show a significantly greater weight loss compared with those randomized to the WORD DPP arm.</p>

                <p>The study was conducted in 30 Marshallese churches in Arkansas and Oklahoma. As described in the study protocol,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Marshallese stakeholders selected churches as the preferred study setting.

                  <title>Cluster eligibility</title>
                  <p>Because randomly assigning participants within churches to different interventions could cause issues of contamination, participants were clustered by churches. Churches with a minimum of 6 eligible participants were considered eligible. Churches with more than 20 eligible participants were split into at least 2 groups for intervention delivery; however, groups within an individual church were randomized to the same arm to prevent potential issues of contamination.</p>

                  <p>Church leaders within the Marshallese community were the first point of contact during the recruitment process. Once a church leader and their congregation agreed to participate in the study, Marshallese research staff held several informational sessions at the church to answer the congregation’s questions. After the informational sessions, eligibility screening events were held at each church. All recruitment and consent materials were produced in the Marshallese and English languages.</p>
                  <p>Bilingual Marshallese research staff reviewed the consent information with groups of eligible persons. After review, Marshallese research staff addressed questions from the group and offered private discussions of the study and the consent document with persons before obtaining informed consent. Each participant received a copy of their consent form.

                  <p>Randomization occurred at the church cluster level with a 1:1 assignment of churches to each arm (PILI DPP or WORD DPP). Churches were blocked according to geographic region and approximate number of adult church members. Within each cohort, randomization of churches was conducted utilizing a random number generation function that concealed the identities of the churches from the person making the assignment. Except for the investigator who conducted randomization, the allocation sequence for each cohort was concealed from study staff until after the cohort was recruited and randomized. Randomization was conducted by a biostatistician co-investigator who had no interaction with potential participants and had no supervisory role with study staff responsible for recruitment, consent, and/or intervention delivery.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Both PILI DPP and WORD DPP focused on self-monitoring, behavioral strategies for weight loss, decreasing caloric intake for weight loss, and increasing physical activity. Both interventions were delivered by bilingual DPP educators in a group setting at the participating churches. Each educator received at least 40 h of DPP lifestyle coach training prior to the start of the interventions. Both interventions provided educational materials in Marshallese and English and offered makeup lessons for missed modules. <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00469580231152051" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link> provides an overview of the specific topics covered in each lesson of each intervention.

                <p>The two-phase PILI DPP curriculum integrated family and community support.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Phase 1 of PILI DPP included all original core DPP lessons, with additional topics specifically focused on the economics of healthy eating (ie, eating healthy within your budget) and talking with your doctor (ie, how to communicate effectively with your healthcare provider). Phase 2 integrated participants’ families and friends in the study, which allowed the participants to proactively elicit specific support from their families and friends for their long-term behavior changes. Such support included family activities focused on eating and being active, managing challenging social situations, effectively communicating their healthy lifestyle goals, and identifying and utilizing community resources like parks and farmers markets. In this study, the PILI DPP intervention was delivered over 24 weeks in 90-min lessons (8 weekly lessons in phase 1 and 6 biweekly lessons in phase 2). The PILI DPP has slightly fewer contact hours compared to the WORD DPP, and the curriculum is culturally adapted to be relevant to Pacific Islanders. The cultural adaptation included a focus on family and leveraging the collectivist nature of the Marshallese community. In the Hawaiian language, <italic toggle="yes">Pili</italic> means “to be close to” or “together,” and <italic toggle="yes">‘Ohana</italic> means “family.”<sup><xref rid="bibr16-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The curriculum emphasizes the importance and inclusion of a person’s friends and family to support lasting lifestyle changes.</p>
                <p>The WORD DPP is based on a community-engaged approach for rural African American communities of faith.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The research team, with input from stakeholders, made slight revisions to the curriculum. These revisions ensured relevance to Marshallese faith communities; however, the curriculum was not adapted for other aspects of Marshallese culture. The WORD DPP curriculum included 16 lessons delivered in 90-min lessons over 24 weeks. The first 8 lessons were delivered weekly before the curriculum switched to a biweekly schedule. The WORD DPP intervention encouraged participants to make healthy lifestyle changes by connecting their health to their faith. This included discussing bible verses and prayers selected by the community that focused on living a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                <p>Post-hoc detectable effects were calculated based on the actual observed number of clusters, average participants per cluster, and ICC for the primary outcome. Sample sizes of 212 in WORD and 166 in PILI, which were obtained by sampling 16 churches with an average of 13 subjects each in WORD and 14 churches with an average of 12 subjects each in PILI, achieve 80% power to detect an effect size between the group means of at least 0.43, per 1 unit standard deviation assumed to be 1, which is close to a medium effect size. The ICC is assumed to be .08 based on the observed model data for weight at post-intervention. The coefficient of variation of cluster sizes is 0.65. A two-sided test was used with a significance level of .05. A one-sided test with a significance level of .05 and same observed data allows us to detect an effect size of 0.38, which is slightly lower than the two-sided test, for a small to medium effect. These effect sizes translate into group differences of approximately 0.5 kg per 1-unit standard deviation. In this study, that would indicate 1 to 1.5 kg detectable differences, given the observed standard deviation of the difference close to 3. This test used degrees of freedom based on the number of subjects. As executed, this study was powered to detect meaningful small to medium effects for primary and secondary outcomes.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome was the change in participant body weight from baseline.

The model also accounted for clustering of churches as a random effect with assumed compound symmetry as an underlying covariance structure. Treatment effects were estimated and tested by comparing the change in arm-specific means from baseline to the 2 post-intervention time points, conservatively adjusting for baseline weight differences.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The primary aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of the WORD DPP with the PILI DPP in achieving weight loss among overweight and obese Marshallese adults. We hypothesized that the PILI DPP intervention would produce greater weight loss than the WORD DPP intervention. However, there were not significant differences in weight change between the PILI DPP arm and the WORD DPP arm. Only 7.1% of participants lost at least 5% of body weight, which is considered clinically meaningful.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr12-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This is a lower proportion of study participants than what has been found in previous studies. Whittemore’s<sup><xref rid="bibr32-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> systematic review showed a range of 11% to 64% met the 5% weight loss goal at follow-ups of 3 to 12 months.</p>
              <p>Regarding secondary outcomes, there were no significant changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. This is in contrast to prior studies of diabetes self-management education adapted for the Marshallese population.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, there were significant improvements within arm for blood pressure, and there were significant differences between arms in SBP and DBP reductions at 6 months in favor of PILI DPP arm. Not only were these reductions statistically significant, but based on prior research, they are likely to be clinically meaningful for participants as well. Prior research has noted that thresholds for clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure tend to start at reductions of 5 mmHg for SBP and 2 mmHg for DBP.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Reboldi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr35-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> found a reduction in SBP of 5 mmHg resulted in a 13% decreased risk of stroke, and reduction in DBP of 2 mmHg resulted in an 11.5% decreased risk of stroke. At 12 months, the reductions in SBP and DBP observed within each arm eclipsed this threshold, with significantly larger reductions in SBP for both arms. A more recent study found that for every 10 mmHg reduction in SBP, the risk of coronary heart disease decreased by 21%.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The reductions in SBP observed in the PILI DPP arm (−9.90 mmHg) may result in similar reductions in risk for those participants. Given that the reductions in SBP observed at 12 months for both arms were greater than the reductions observed at 6 months, these reductions may be maintained beyond the life of the study. However, it should be noted that these reductions cannot be attributed solely to the adoption of positive lifestyle modifications resulting from the DPP interventions; it is possible that participants initiated or began to adhere to previously prescribed blood pressure medications.</p>
              <p>There were observed improvements within arms for SSB consumption in both interventions, with the PILI DPP arm reducing almost a full drink per day, which is a nutritionally meaningful change. There were significant improvements within the WORD DDP arm for fruit and vegetable consumption. Within both arms, there were significant improvements in the proportion of participants who engaged in sufficient levels of physical activity at 6 months. There were significant improvements within both arms for perceived family support at 6 and 12 months. While only the PILI DPP specifically focused on increasing family support, the WORD DPP also increased family support. This could have been the result of delivering the interventions in a close-knit community setting (ie, within churches).</p>
              <p>While neither intervention facilitated significant weight loss, there is potential for the results to help stakeholders make decisions. The null results may indicate the presence of social ecological barriers to weight loss and diabetes prevention. Prior research has shown that social, economic, and environmental determinants are significant predictors of being overweight/obese and having pre-diabetes or diabetes and may inhibit weight loss success.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="bibr38-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr39-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr40-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Marshallese communities face many social, economic, and environmental challenges.<sup>5,<xref rid="bibr41-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="bibr42-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr43-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr44-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Prior studies have shown that Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders have significant food insecurity,<sup><xref rid="bibr45-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="bibr46-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr47-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and food insecurity has been linked to both higher BMI and T2DM in other populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><xref rid="bibr49-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr50-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr51-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Similarly, research has documented that a large proportion of Marshallese live in low-income and unstable housing.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Environmental determinants such as housing have been associated with increasing BMI.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="bibr38-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr39-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr40-00469580231152051" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>The study has both strengths and limitations. Class attendance and retention were not as strong as our prior studies, especially at 12 months, where the COVID-19 pandemic heavily affected our ability to collect data in the community. It is possible that the similarity of the 2 interventions contributed to the lack of differences in baseline to follow-up changes in the primary outcome. Despite each intervention being adapted (ie, PILI for Pacific Islanders and WORD for faith communities), the content of both the PILI DPP and the WORD DPP was aligned with that of the original DPP curriculum. Further, the shared setting (ie, churches) in which both interventions were conducted may have contributed to the interventions being too similar despite the tailoring of the interventions. The WORD DPP was specifically tailored to incorporate faith, while the PILI DPP was not conceived to include this aspect; however, conducting the PILI DPP intervention in churches may have resulted in some aspects of faith being brought into the intervention even if not explicitly mentioned by the educators. Similarly, some educators were involved with leading classes for both the PILI DPP and the WORD DPP, which may have further contributed to the interventions being too similar. The study focused on Marshallese participants from 2 geographic areas, so findings may not hold for other populations or Marshallese communities in other geographic areas. Though we used survey measures that have been shown to be valid and reliable in other populations, there are no measurement studies to our knowledge that have validated survey measures in the Marshallese language or among Marshallese participants. Despite limitations, this study provides important information on an understudied community with significant health disparities. This study fills an important gap in the current literature in several ways. To our knowledge, this study is one of only 2 RCTs conducted with the Marshallese community. This study was also one of the first DPP trials to be conducted solely with Pacific Islander participants in the continental US. Despite showing no difference in the effectiveness of the interventions, the study was methodologically sound and powered to detect a small effect. This provides an important example for others conducting cRCTs that are methodologically rigorous, patient-centered, and community-engaged.</p>
