                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and poor exercise tolerance. Enhanced inflammation is associated with worsening outcomes in HF patients and may play a direct role in disease progression. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that becomes chronically elevated in HF and exerts putative negative inotropic effects.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and Results</title>
                  <p>We developed a model of IL-1β-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in healthy mice that exhibited a 32% reduction in LV fractional shortening (P&lt;0.001) and a 76% reduction in isoproterenol response (P&lt;0.01) at 4 hours following a single dose of IL-1β 3 mcg/kg. This phenotype was reproducible in mice injected with plasma from HF patients and fully preventable by pretreatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra). This led to the design and conduct of a pilot clinical to test the effect of anakinra on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in patients with HF and evidence of elevated inflammatory signaling (n = 7). The median peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) improved from 12.3 [10.0, 15.2] to 15.1 [13.7, 19.3] mL·kg<sup>–1</sup>·min<sup>–1</sup> (P = 0.016 vs. baseline) and median ventilator efficiency (V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope) improved from 28.1 [22.8, 31.7] to 24.9 [22.9, 28.3] (P = 0.031 vs. baseline).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and poor exercise tolerance. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Jessup1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Roger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> While contemporary HF treatments have slowed disease progression and improved survival, the overall incidences of HF morbidity and mortality continue to rise, suggesting that the current treatment paradigm still misses one or more key pathophysiologic mechanisms. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Jessup1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Roger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>
</p>
              <p>Among HF patients, a significant correlation exists between declining functional class and increasing levels of inflammatory cytokines. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Deswal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Arajo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Interleukin-1β (IL–1β) is the prototypal inflammatory cytokine that acts as an acute phase reactant following tissue injury (i.e. ischemia) and becomes persistently elevated in patients with chronic HF. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Bujak1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> Early investigations in septic cardiomyopathy identified IL-1β as a soluble ‘depressant factor’ in the sera of these patients, producing a concentration-dependent depression of myocyte contractility <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0033438-Bujak1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> Further studies identify a pathologic role for IL-1β in ventricular remodeling, systolic dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte death in both ischemic and non-ischemic models of HF. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Bujak1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Bujak2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> IL-1β has also been shown to affect β-adrenergic receptor responsiveness <italic>in vitro</italic>, which may be a key determinant of exercise capacity in HF. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Gulick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Nevertheless, the precise contribution of IL-1β to human HF has not been well established.</p>
              <p>We therefore designed a bench-to-bedside approach to determine the contribution of IL-1β in the development of cardiac dysfunction and ultimately guide the use of IL-1β blockade in a pilot study of patients with HF. We first conducted a dose ranging study with IL-1β in healthy mice to induce LV dysfunction at rest and impaired responsiveness to β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation. We then observed that mice injected with plasma from HF patients exhibited a similar phenotype of impaired systolic dysfunction that was completely prevented by pre-treatment with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). These observations led to the current pilot study in human patients with HF in which 2 weeks treatment with anakinra improved cardiopulmonary exercise performance as measured by peak oxygen consumption, ventilatory efficiency, and exercise time.</p>

                  <p>Mice received intraperitoneal (IP) injection with recombinant human IL-1β (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA) with transthoracic echocardiography to measure left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening at baseline, 4 hours, and 24 hours.

                  <p>Mice underwent transthoracic echocardiography under light anesthesia (pentobarbital 30–50 mg/kg IP). The chest was shaved and the mice were placed supine on a heating pad. Doppler echocardiography was performed with the Vevo770 imaging system (VisualSonics Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and a 30-MHz probe. The transducer was positioned on the left anterior side of the chest. The heart was first imaged in the 2-dimensional mode in the short-axis view of the left ventricle. Then, M-mode images were obtained at the level of the papillary muscles below the mitral valve tip according to the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Schiller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> The M-mode cursor was positioned perpendicular to the anterior and posterior wall to measure the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and end-systolic diameter (LVESD). LV fractional shortening (LVFS) was calculated as follows: LVFS = (LVEDD–LVESD)/LVEDDx100. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated with the Teichholz formula. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Schiller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Transmitral and left ventricle outflow tract pulsed Doppler flow spectra were obtained from the apical view.

These data were used to calculate the Tei index (Tei index = ICT+IRT/ET). In humans, a higher Tei index is associated with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction and worse outcomes. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Schiller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Velocity of circumferential shortening was calculated as FS/ET, with ET divided by the square root of the preceding RR interval to correct for heart rate. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Syed1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> All echocardiograms were performed and interpreted jointly by 2 investigators (BVT and AA) throughout all experiments.</p>

                <p>We collected blood from four groups of patients based upon HF symptoms and elevation of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a surrogate marker of IL-1β activity): healthy controls (CTRL), ambulatory HF patients with low CRP (HF L-CRP), ambulatory HF with high CRP (HF H-CRP), and patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF (ADHF). For inclusion in this stage of the investigation, healthy controls were defined as patients with no history of cardiac disease. Ambulatory HF patients were defined as patients with a documented history of HF with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% but without any recent hospitalizations (previous 12 months) or recent changes in medications (previous 3 months). Patients with acute decompensated HF were eligible if they had been admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of acute decompensated HF within the previous 24 hours. Plasma samples from each group were injected into healthy mice who underwent transthoracic echocardiography to measure LV function at baseline and 4 hours. To neutralize the effects of IL-1β on LV function, separate groups of mice received injections of the same human plasma following pre-treatment with recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra, Kineret®, Biovitrum) 100 mg/kg IP administered 30 minutes prior to injection of human plasma. Upon completion of echocardiography at 4 hours, all groups of mice received an injection of isoproterenol 0.01 mcg/kg IP to evaluate contractile reserve.</p>

                  <p>A physician-supervised maximal CPX was administered using a metabolic cart that is interfaced with a treadmill (Vmax Encore, Viasys, Yorba Linda, CA). A conservative ramping treadmill protocol was used as described previously. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Arena1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> Prior to each test, the oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors were calibrated using gases of known oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide concentrations and the flow sensor was also calibrated using a 3-Liter syringe. Subjects were briefed regarding the protocol and were requested to exercise to fatigue. 12-lead ECG monitoring were conducted at baseline, throughout the test and into recovery. Blood pressure was measured every two minutes using an automated exercise-compatible device (Tango, SunTech Medical). In this technique, expired gases were sampled using a mouthpiece-mounted sensor, and analyzed to continuously measure oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>) and minute ventilation (VE). The highest 10-second average value for VO<sub>2</sub> during the last 30 seconds of exercise defined the peak value (peak VO<sub>2</sub> in mL·kg<sup>–1</sup>·min<sup>–1</sup>). Ten second averaged VE and VCO<sub>2</sub> data, from the initiation of exercise to peak, were input into spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA) to calculate the V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope via least squares linear regression (y = mx+b, m = slope). The oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) was determined using least-squares linear regression analysis (oxygen consumption = a log<sub>10</sub>VE+b, with VO<sub>2</sub> and VE expressed in liters per minute) using spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft, Seattle, Washington). <xref rid="pone.0033438-Baba1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> All exercise data were also used to calculate the OUES.

We further characterized IL-1β 3 mcg/kg as a standard dose in all subsequent experiments as this dose was 10X the minimum dose required to significantly impair contractile function and appeared to give the greatest numerical reduction in LVFS. In addition to changes in contractile indices such as the ratio of fractional shortening/myocardial performance index (FS/MPI) and circumferential shortening–both of which are less sensitive to changes in preload <xref rid="pone.0033438-Tei1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033438-Broberg1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>–IL-1β 3 mcg/kg significantly reduced LV stroke volume from 41±2 µL to 29±3 µL (–27%, P&lt;0.001) and increased heart rate from 345±22 beats/min to 432±30 beats/min (+25%, P = 0.004). Estimated cardiac output remained unchanged. No effects were noted with IL-1β doses less than 0.3 mcg/kg.

Plasma from patients with ADHF induced a 22% reduction in LV fractional shortening (LVFS) in the mouse that was preventable by pretreating the mice with anakinra 100 mg/kg given 30 minutes prior to plasma injection. Plasma from patients with ADHF and HF high CRP reduced contractile reserve in the mouse as measured by LVFS response to isoproterenol. Pre-treating the mice with anakinra 100 mg/kg given 30 minutes prior to plasma injection prevented the reduction in contractile reserve. *P&lt;0.001 versus CTRL, †P&lt;0.05 versus ADHF, ‡P&lt;0.05 versus HF high CRP.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>To test whether HF plasma would also influence contractile reserve, we then injected each mouse with a single dose of isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033438-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lower panel). Plasma from both patient groups with high inflammatory burden (ADHF and HF-HCRP) blunted the response to isoproterenol, whereas mice injected with plasma from patients without high inflammatory burden (HF-LCRP and CTRL) remained fully sensitive to isoproterenol injection. The blunted response to isoproterenol was completely eliminated by pre-treatment with anakinra, indicating a critical role for IL-1β signaling in the impaired contractile reserve induced by plasma from ADHF and HF-HCRP patients. Among mice injected with plasma form patients with stable chronic HF, there was a significant difference in contractile reserve based upon hsCRP status (HF-HCRP vs HF-LCRP, P = 0.042) that also disappeared with anakinra pre-treatment.</p>

                  <p>Patient screening commenced on February 15, 2011. 19 patients met initial entry criteria and underwent laboratory screening for elevation of hsCRP. A total of 11 patients met full entry criteria and were enrolled in the study. Two patients withdrew consent and another patient was revealed to have unstable HF symptoms prior to baseline exercise testing, leaving 8 patients who underwent baseline CPX and received anakinra injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033438-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Seven patients completed both study visits and 1 patient experienced systemic flu-like symptoms and withdrew from the study after 8 days of treatment.

                <title>IL-1 blockade improved CPX performance in patients with HF</title>
                <p>All 7 patients experienced improvement in peak VO<sub>2</sub> and 6 out of 7 patients experienced improvement in the VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope following 2 weeks treatment with anakinra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033438-g005">Figure 5</xref>). All 7 patients experienced improvements in secondary endpoints of exercise time and oxygen utilization efficiency score. There were trends toward improvement in both DASI score (increased score) and BNP (reduced concentration), although these changes failed to reach statistical significance. The median peak VO<sub>2</sub> improved from 12.3 [10.0, 15.2] to 15.1 [13.7, 19.3] mL·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> (P = 0.016 vs. baseline), representing a relative improvement of 23%, 2.8 mL·kg<sup>–1</sup>·min<sup>–1</sup>, or nearly 1 metabolic equivalent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0033438-t003">Table 3</xref>). The median V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope improved from 28.1 [22.8, 31.7] to 24.9 [22.9, 28.3] (P = 0.031 vs. baseline), representing a relative improvement of 12% or 3.2 slope units. No significant changes occurred in resting heart rate (HR), maximum HR, resting blood pressure, maximum blood pressure, or heart rate recovery between baseline and 2 weeks CPX. Despite significant improvements in exercise parameters and significant reductions in hsCRP, the correlation between hsCRP and peak VO2 did not achieve statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033438-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

              <p>The role of inflammation in human HF has not been well established. Multiple pre-clinical investigations have demonstrated plausible mechanisms of pathologic inflammatory mediators, yet there are still no effective clinical treatments that target inflammation in HF.<xref rid="pone.0033438-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Bujak2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Herein we describe that plasma from decompensated HF patients was sufficient to reproduce a phenotype of HF in healthy mice (impaired systolic function at rest and impaired contractile reserve) and that plasma from patients with stable HF and a high inflammatory burden was sufficient to reproduce a phenotype that was absent of symptoms at rest, but was still characterized by impaired contractile reserve. In both cases, the murine phenotypes mirrored the clinical phenotypes and were fully prevented with IL-1β blockade. Moreover, this same IL-1β blocking strategy translated to significant improvements in CPX performance over a 2-week period in a pilot study of HF patients.</p>
              <p>Our results are consistent with previous pre-clinical studies in murine models of both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy that demonstrate significant reductions in LV remodeling and improved cardiac function following IL-1 blockade. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Abbate1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Bujak2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Two small, randomized, double-blind trials have reported significant cardiovascular benefits following IL-1β blockade. Ikonomidis et al. reported improved vascular function (flow-mediated forearm vasodilation), coronary flow, and LV function (ratio of mitral annulus systolic/diastolic velocities) at 3 hours following randomization to a single anakinra injection versus placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Ikonomidis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> Within the same publication, investigators reported similar benefits in a separate population of rheumatoid arthritis patients following open-label assignment to 30 days treatment with anakinra versus prednisolone. In a recently completed study conducted in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, our group observed more favorable LV remodeling (smaller LV end systolic volume index) at 90 days following randomization to 14 days treatment with anakinra versus placebo. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Abbate4" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>
</p>
              <p>Compared to previous approaches to block inflammatory signaling in HF patients, IL-1β blockade represents a novel and finely targeted approach devoid of off-target effects. Prior attempts to inhibit inflammation in HF using corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have shown disappointing results. <xref rid="pone.0033438-LeGal1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Judgutt1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> Although both classes of drugs are powerful anti-inflammatory agents, both are substantially different from the IL-1β blockers and are inevitably non-specific in their effects as they simultaneously block multiple pathways, some of which may be protective. For example, both corticosteroids and NSAIDs promote fluid retention and hypertension that lead to worsening HF. Corticosteroids also induce hyperglycemia and activate the aldosterone receptor in the heart, which is directly linked to adverse remodeling and HF. Moreover, NSAIDs eliminate potential beneficial effects of locally produced prostaglandins and bradykinins. In contrast, IL-1β blockade is a selective mechanism that does not promote fluid retention, hypertension, hyperglycemia or any other significant metabolic alterations. No direct effects of IL-1β blockade on hemodynamic parameters, cardiac function, platelet function or coagulation have been reported in healthy volunteers. Therefore, IL-1β blockade may represent a safer approach.</p>
              <p>As expected, IL-1β blockade in HF patients led to a significant reduction in hsCRP. The observation of potential reductions in IL-1β and IL-6 plasma concentrations without any observable change in TNFα concentration may be meaningful for two distinct reasons. First, the reduction of IL-1β plasma concentration in the presence of IL-1β blockade would be indicative of an underlying auto-inflammatory process in HF. In most physiological systems, administration of a receptor antagonist promotes agonist up-regulation through interruption of negative feedback loops. Conversely, in auto-inflammatory disorders, initial IL-1β activity primes the cellular apparatus for accelerated IL-1β production leading to a vicious cycle of inflammatory activity. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Dinarello2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Mezzaroma1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> While HF has not, as of yet, been identified as an auto-inflammatory disorder, our observations would be consistent with this explanation. Second, the lack of TNFα effects may differentiate the effects of IL-1β blockade from the disappointments with TNFα blockers (i.e. etanercept and infliximab) in previous HF studies. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> Although the 2 classes of anti-cytokine therapy are occasionally considered interchangeable for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, they block distinct signaling pathways that are mostly not convergent and have led to significant differences in efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Moreover, etanercept may exert partial agonist activity through a cytokine “reservoir” effect whereby cytokine binding proteins with prolonged elimination half-lives exhibit nontraditional dose–response curves that describe a maximum effective concentration. In addition, anti-TNF-α antibodies such as infliximab, may induce complement-mediated damage to cardiomyocytes expressing membrane-bound TNF-α.</p>
              <p>There is an urgent need to identify novel treatment strategies for patients with HF. Despite significant advances in primary and secondary prevention strategies, HF remains a leading cause of hospitalization among US patients. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Jencks1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> Poor aerobic exercise capacity and ventilatory inefficiency are common findings among HF patients and impose significant detriments to quality of life. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Task1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> Moreover, quantifiable measures of exercise capacity such as peak VO<sub>2</sub> and the V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope represent strong independent predictors of HF mortality and hospitalization. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Balady1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> In fact, these aforementioned CPX variables have consistently proven to be amongst the strongest predictors of adverse events in this chronic disease population. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Guazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> Given the prognostic implications of improvement in CPX variables, the results of the present study are particularly compelling. We further emphasize that these benefits occurred <italic>in addition</italic> to standard medical therapy including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, β-AR blocker, diuretics, and aldosterone antagonists.</p>
              <p>From a mechanistic standpoint, numerous studies have linked both a lower peak VO<sub>2</sub> and higher V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope to diminished cardiac function in patients with HF. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Arena2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> Therefore, the improvements in these CPX variables observed in the current investigation may be linked to IL-1β blockade-induced improvements in cardiac function. In this context, the degree of CPX improvements induced by IL-1β blockade treatment may be used to gauge therapeutic efficacy, if supported by future investigations.</p>
              <p>There are numerous limitations to our current investigation. First, we were not able to elucidate the signaling mechanism of IL-1-induced systolic dysfunction. We observed a delayed, reversible LV systolic dysfunction coupled with a blunted response to isoproterenol. These findings may be explained by multiple potential mechanisms of β-adrenergic receptor dysregulation that have been published in cellular models of IL-1β signaling. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033438-Gulick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Second, we recognize that IL-1β is not the only circulating factor in human plasma with the potential to alter cardiac function. Instead of quantifying <italic>all</italic> of the numerous signaling molecules present in HF plasma, we focused our experiments on the physiologic effects of HF plasma that were susceptible to IL-1β blockade. While this approach does not reveal the comprehensive network of signaling molecules that may contribute to the phenotype, it does identify IL-1β as a critical mediator of the cardiac dysfunction. Third, our clinical study was not designed as a definitive evaluation of IL-1β blockade on cardiopulmonary exercise. Instead, we designed a pilot study to test the safety and feasibility of anakinra in a stable, ambulatory, HF population. The lack of randomization in the study limits the interpretation of study results to imply a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between anakinra treatment and changes in cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. We therefore report these findings as proof-of-concept for an <italic>association</italic> between anakinra treatment and the significant improvements observed in these patients. Fourth, HF patients are notoriously unstable and often progress through multiple periods of improvement or deterioration in physical symptoms. Any changes observed in non-randomized studies are therefore subject to increased scrutiny to demonstrate the “stability” of the HF population and the reliability of the baseline measurements. We therefore selected a population of ambulatory HF patients free from recent hospitalizations or medications changes and a relatively short study window to minimize the potential of rapid deteriorations or improvements in cardiopulmonary exercise performance over the course the study. We also relied on the use of objective, quantifiable measures of CPX performance (peak VO<sub>2</sub> and the V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope) that have been the most rigorously validated in previous studies of HF patients. <xref rid="pone.0033438-Balady1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> Further studies will soon be underway to confirm these findings and evaluate the persistence of CPX benefits with prolonged IL-1β blockade in a randomized, double-blind clinical trials accompanied by cardiac imaging to evaluate direct changes in cardiac dimension and function. Patients will receive treatment for up to 12 weeks with IL-1β blockade, followed by a prolonged follow-up (i.e. washout period). </p>
              <p>In summary we report the presence of a circulating factor in the plasma of human HF patients that is sufficient to induce cardiac dysfunction in healthy mice and susceptible to IL-1β blockade. Furthermore, we report the safety and feasibility of IL-1β blockade over the course of 2 weeks in stable HF patients with elevated hsCRP. Treatment with anakinra was associated with a significant reduction in hsCRP and significant improvements in aerobic capacity, ventilatory efficiency, and total exercise time. These findings suggest that IL-1β activity contributes to exercise intolerance in patients with systolic HF and identifies IL-1β blockade as a potential novel strategy for pharmacologic intervention.</p>
