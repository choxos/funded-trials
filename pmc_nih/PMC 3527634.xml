                <p><bold>Background </bold> Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) against a variety of strains of pandemic potential are being developed and tested. We describe the results of an open‐label phase I trial of a live attenuated H2N2 virus vaccine.</p>
                <p><bold>Objectives </bold> To evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated H2N2 influenza virus vaccine.</p>
                <p><bold>Participants/methods </bold> The A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) virus used in this study is the attenuated, cold‐adapted, temperature‐sensitive strain that provides the genetic backbone of seasonal LAIV (MedImmune). We evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of 10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of this vaccine administered by nasal spray 4 weeks apart to normal healthy seronegative adults.</p>
                <p><bold>Results </bold> Twenty‐one participants received a first dose of the vaccine; 18 participants received a second dose. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. The most common adverse events after vaccination were headache and musculoskeletal pain. The vaccine was restricted in replication: 24% and 17% had virus detectable by culture or rRT‐PCR after the first and second dose, respectively. Antibody responses to the vaccine were also restricted: 24% of participants developed an antibody response as measured by either hemagglutination‐inhibition assay (10%), or ELISA for H2 HA‐specific serum IgG (24%) or IgA (16%) after either one or two doses. None of the participants had a neutralizing antibody response. Vaccine‐specific IgG‐secreting cells as measured by enzyme‐linked immunospot increased from a mean of 0·5 to 2·0/10<sup>6</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); vaccine‐specific IgA‐secreting cells increased from 0·1 to 0·5/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusions </bold> The live attenuated H2N2 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> vaccine demonstrated a safety profile consistent with seasonal trivalent LAIV but was restricted in replication and minimally immunogenic in healthy seronegative adults.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Influenza A viruses cause periodic pandemics in addition to the yearly outbreaks and epidemics. H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 influenza viruses entered the human population and led to pandemics in the 20th century; the novel 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is the first pandemic influenza virus of the 21st century.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="ref"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="ref"><sup>2</sup></xref> The H1N1 2009 pandemic, as well as repeated introductions of avian influenza strains into human populations, underscore the importance of developing vaccines for influenza viruses of pandemic potential.</p>
              <p>H2N2 influenza viruses emerged in the 1950s through reassortment of the circulating H1N1 human influenza virus with an avian H2N2 virus.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref> The first H2N2 influenza cases occurred in China in 1956, and the disease became widespread in 1957–1958, resulting in the ‘Asian Influenza’ pandemic that was responsible for more than one million deaths worldwide.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> H2N2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968, when they were replaced by H3N2 influenza viruses, and consequently, a large proportion of the population is now susceptible to infection with H2 influenza viruses.</p>
              <p>H2N2 viruses continue to circulate in birds, leading to the potential reintroduction of these viruses into susceptible human populations.

NAI activity in the sera was determined by comparing the NA activity of the virus alone with the activity measured following incubation of the virus with serially diluted sera. The dilution of serum that resulted in a 50% reduction in NA activity of the virus without serum was recorded as the NAI titer.</p>

Vaccine virus was detected by rRT‐PCR in two of the participants who reported headache, including the subject with complaints of sore throat and nasal congestion. A middle ear effusion (without evidence of otitis media) was detected in a subject who had reported decreased hearing in the left ear, but this finding was not associated with the detection of vaccine virus by culture or rRT‐PCR in nasal wash specimens. Other illnesses reported following the first dose of vaccine included nausea and vomiting (two individuals); and localized musculoskeletal complaints including backache (three individuals), shoulder pain (two individuals), and muscle soreness (two individuals). The detection of vaccine virus by culture or rRT‐PCR in the remaining symptomatic participants did not coincide with symptoms. Adventitious viruses were not detected by culture or rRT‐PCR in nasal washes obtained from any participants after the first dose.</p>

Vaccine virus was not detected in either subject. Two participants reported gastrointestinal symptoms, one of whom had moderate (grade 2) nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for several days starting on day 2. Of note, a staff member had similar gastrointestinal symptoms preceding the participants’ symptoms. The subject with gastroenteritis had vaccine virus recovered by rRT‐PCR from the nasal washes on days 1 and 2. The other subject complained of abdominal bloating and loose stools and did not have vaccine virus recovered from the respiratory tract. Again, three participants had musculoskeletal complaints, only one of whom had virus detected by rRT‐PCR on days 1 and 2 (the subject reported back pain from days 2 through 12). One subject had transient tachycardia detected during routine physical assessment on day 9, which was not associated with virus recovery. Adventitious viral cultures were negative for each of these participants.</p>

                <p>Serum IgG and IgA and nasal wash IgA antibodies to a recombinant baculovirus‐expressed H2 HA were measured by ELISA (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 2</xref>).

Three participants had fourfold rises in serum IgA titer: two (10%) following the first dose of vaccine and one (6%) following the second dose. Nasal wash IgA was the least sensitive measure of antibody response to this vaccine: only one subject had a fourfold or greater rise in titer after the second dose of vaccine (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>The development of vaccine‐specific ASCs was also extremely limited. When measured prior to immunization, six participants had detectable vaccine‐specific IgG ASCs, all ≤3 cells/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs. Seven days after the first vaccination, the mean (SD) number of vaccine‐specific IgG ASCs was 2·0 (3·2), and four of 21 participants had an increase of five or more specific IgG ASCs. By the time of the second dose, vaccine‐specific IgG ASCs were nearly undetectable: two participants each had one vaccine‐specific IgG‐secreting cell/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, and specific ASCs were not detected in any of the other participants. Seven days after the second vaccination, the mean (SD) number of vaccine‐specific IgG ASCs was 1·2 (2·6)/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, and only two of 18 participants (one of whom had also responded to the first dose) had an increase of five or more vaccine‐specific IgG ASCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs.

              <p>We have reported results of an open‐label phase I study of a pandemic H2N2 influenza A virus vaccine using the H2N2 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> virus strain. This vaccine demonstrated a safety profile consistent with current seasonal trivalent LAIV but was restricted in replication and minimally immunogenic in immunologically naïve healthy young adults who were born after H2N2 viruses stopped circulating in the human population.</p>
              <p>One of the difficulties in evaluating vaccines for novel influenza strains is determining the correlates of vaccine‐induced immunity.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="ref"><sup>25</sup></xref> For seasonal inactivated influenza virus vaccines, the correlate of protection accepted by regulatory agencies is an HI titer of ≥1:40, measured in a standard assay using 4 U of HA.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="ref"><sup>26</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="ref"><sup>27</sup></xref> However, seasonal LAIV have been shown to protect against natural infection or challenge with wild‐type influenza viruses even when HI titers ≥1:40 were not achieved, presumably through the induction of local mucosal antibody and cellular immunity.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="ref"><sup>28</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="ref"><sup>29</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="ref"><sup>30</sup></xref> Moreover, HI antibody may not be the best measure of protection against infection with H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses, as individuals infected with these viruses often fail to develop substantial HI antibody responses.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="ref"><sup>20</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="ref"><sup>31</sup></xref> For this reason, alternative antibody assays, such as the microneutralization assay and ELISA<xref rid="b20" ref-type="ref"><sup>20</sup></xref> have been developed.</p>
              <p>To assess the antibody response to the H2N2 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> vaccine, we used several assays in addition to the standard HI and microneutralization assays. Using the HI assay, we found that only 12% of participants had a ≥fourfold rise in HI antibody titer after two doses of vaccine, with modest increases achieved (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 1</xref>). We also measured neutralizing antibody, H2‐specific IgG and IgA antibody, and production of ASCs against the vaccine virus. Although the ability of each assay to detect a response differed slightly, minimal responses to the vaccine were detected by all assays (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table-wrap">Tables 2, 3</xref>). Interestingly, unlike other pandemic live attenuated vaccines that we have assessed (H5N1, H7N3), serum IgA was not the most sensitive indicator of an immune response (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, measurement of vaccine‐specific ASCs detected minimal responses to either dose of the vaccine (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 3</xref>), which is quite different from what was previously observed in children who received seasonal LAIV<xref rid="b22" ref-type="ref"><sup>22</sup></xref> or in adults administered a live attenuated H7N3 vaccine.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="ref"><sup>16</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>The substantial restriction in replication and poor antibody response to the H2N2 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> vaccine were somewhat unexpected because the vaccine was shown to be infectious and immunogenic in mice and ferrets in preclinical studies.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="ref"><sup>32</sup></xref> Also, our study participants were born after 1968 and should have been susceptible to H2N2 influenza virus infection.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="ref"><sup>33</sup></xref> However, because of the extensive passage history of the seasonal LAIV MDV in chicken kidney cells and eggs, it is possible that this virus became less infectious for humans. In support of this concept, a previous study of a cold‐adapted, temperature‐sensitive, attenuated A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) virus that had undergone less extensive passage in chicken cells was found to be immunogenic in seven of nine individuals when administered at a 30‐fold lower dose (3·0 × 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) in 1973.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref> It should be noted that in both the 1973 study and the present study, virus replication could not be detected following nasal administration. There are several possible explanations for these observations. Anti‐NA antibodies can restrict the release and spread of influenza viruses. Although only one subject had anti‐NA antibody to the vaccine N2 NA, most subjects (18/21) had pre‐existing antibody to seasonal N2 NA (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that pre‐existing antibodies against the seasonal N2 NA may have limited the replication and consequently the immunogenicity of the attenuated vaccine virus. However, the NA of the seasonal A/Uruguay/716/2007 H3N2 virus and the NA of the 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> vaccine virus share only 84% homology at the amino acid level, and the NAI response was not cross‐reactive (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table-wrap">Table 3</xref>). It appears that the MDV containing this particular H2 and N2 is inherently less infectious and immunogenic than the H1N1 and H3N2 LAIV that have been evaluated in multiple studies.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="ref"><sup>34</sup></xref>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="ref"><sup>35</sup></xref> It is also possible that the H2N2 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> virus might induce protective immunity in the absence of HI or neutralizing antibodies, as it protected mice against homologous viral challenge after one dose in the absence of a detectable antibodies to the homologous virus and protected mice and ferrets against heterologous viral challenge in the absence of detectable antibodies to heterologous H2N2 viruses.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="ref"><sup>32</sup></xref> It may be that the vaccine induces immune responses that were not measured in preclinical or clinical studies, including cellular immune responses as has been demonstrated with trivalent seasonal formulations of LAIV. Such responses should be evaluated in future studies.</p>
              <p>In summary, we have shown that two doses of a live attenuated cold‐adapted H2N2 1960 AA <italic>ca</italic> vaccine resulted in a low incidence of side effects and were modestly immunogenic when given to healthy adults. Contemporary H2 and N2 genes obtained from low passage human virus isolates should be tested on the same backbone to study the human immune response to a pandemic H2N2 LAIV.</p>
