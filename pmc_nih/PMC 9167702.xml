                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> genomic alterations (amplification, mutations, and/or fusions) occur in ∼8% of gliomas, particularly <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic>. We conducted a multicenter open-label, single-arm, phase II study of a selective FGFR1–3 inhibitor, infigratinib (BGJ398), in patients with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic>-altered recurrent gliomas.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>Adults with recurrent/progressive gliomas harboring <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alterations received oral infigratinib 125 mg on days 1 to 21 of 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on available pretreatment archival tissue to explore additional molecular correlations with efficacy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Among 26 patients, the 6-month PFS rate was 16.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0–32.5], median PFS was 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.1–2.8), and objective response rate was 3.8%. However, 4 patients had durable disease control lasting longer than 1 year. Among these, 3 had tumors harboring activating point mutations at analogous positions of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> (K656E; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2) or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> (K650E; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) in pretreatment tissue; an <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion was detected in the other. Hyperphosphatemia was the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event (all-grade, 76.9%; grade 3, 3.8%) and is a known on-target toxicity of FGFR inhibitors.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>FGFR inhibitor monotherapy with infigratinib had limited efficacy in a population of patients with recurrent gliomas and different <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> genetic alterations, but durable disease control lasting more than 1 year was observed in patients with tumors harboring <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> point mutations or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusions. A follow-up study with refined biomarker inclusion criteria and centralized <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> testing is warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gliomas are a clinically diverse group of primary brain tumors, diagnosed in ∼100,000 people/year worldwide (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). Glioblastomas, the most common type of primary brain tumor, are particularly aggressive with a median overall survival (OS) of ∼15 to 18 months after standard care (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Historically, the classification of gliomas was based on histologic findings and pathologic grading. However, comprehensive molecular characterization over the past decade has identified complex genetic, epigenetic, and chromosomal changes that segregate gliomas into distinct molecular subtypes, with some genetic differences impacting response to therapy (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>). For example, methylation of the <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter is both prognostic and predictive of benefit from temozolomide (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> genomic alterations (amplification, mutations, and fusions) occur in ∼8% of gliomas, with most aberrations occurring in <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Chromosomal translocations that fuse the tyrosine kinase domains of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TACC1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">TACC3</italic> have been identified in 2% to 4% of gliomas (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>). These FGFR fusion genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic>, are capable of ligand-independent dimerization by virtue of the newly fused coiled-coil domain and have demonstrated oncogenic potential <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Further, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion has been reported as predictive of response to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors both preclinically (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9, 10</xref>) and clinically in various solid tumors including gliomas (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Less is known about the underlying role of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> point mutations or amplification in gliomas (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The oncogenic effects of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> mutations in human cancers, including gliomas, are variable (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>), with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> amplification typically failing to drive tumor addiction to FGFR signaling (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>Infigratinib (BGJ398) is a potent ATP-competitive FGFR1–3–selective oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) in development for the treatment of patients with FGFR-driven conditions, including cholangiocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and achondroplasia. In clinical studies, infigratinib 125 mg on days 1 to 21 of 28 achieved disease control in 84% of patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma harboring <italic toggle="yes">FGFR2</italic> fusions/translocations (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and in 64% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma harboring <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> alterations (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>We conducted a multicenter phase II study to investigate the antitumor activity and safety of single-agent infigratinib in patients with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR-</italic>altered recurrent gliomas, particularly in tumors with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR-TACC</italic> fusions.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II study of infigratinib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas after failure of initial therapy that harbored <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alterations was conducted at 14 centers in the US, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium (Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT01975701). The study was not randomized. The primary goals were to investigate efficacy, safety, and tolerability, and to explore abnormalities of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> and other genes in pretreatment archival tissue as molecular predictors of efficacy.</p>
                <p>The study was implemented and reported in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, with applicable local regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each participating center. Patients were required to provide written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Originally, male or female patients aged 18 years or older and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 with recurrent gliomas harboring any <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> abnormality (i.e., amplification, fusions, or mutations in <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR4</italic>) determined by local or central Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–accredited laboratories before study entry were eligible. Preclinical research underpinning the rationale for the study suggested that <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusions were predictive of response to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. When the study launched, it was assumed that <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> amplification correlated with presence of fusions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The eligibility criteria were amended 17 months after enrollment started (April 2015) to require fusions or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1–3</italic> activating mutations when further preclinical data showed that amplification was in fact a poor surrogate for the presence of fusion (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Prior external beam radiotherapy and/or temozolomide was required. Otherwise, unlimited prior surgeries and anticancer treatments including bevacizumab were permitted, except for prior treatment with an FGFR inhibitor which was not allowed. Patients receiving anticonvulsant drugs that were strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) were required to discontinue therapy ≥2 weeks before enrollment. Other key entry criteria reflecting the known safety profile of infigratinib entailed normal calcium/phosphate homeostasis and no history of corneal/keratopathy or retinal disorders. There were no specified criteria regarding body weight.</p>

                <title>Treatment</title>
                <p>Patients were intended to receive oral infigratinib 125 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. No blinding was used in the study. Two protocol-specified dose reductions (to 100 and 75 mg/day) and dose interruptions (14 days maximum) were permitted to manage treatment-emergent toxicities. Adherence to a low-phosphate diet was recommended during therapy to manage hyperphosphatemia, a known class effect of FGFR inhibition. Prophylactic use of a phosphate-binding agent, such as sevelamer, was also recommended following a protocol amendment (August 2014).</p>

                <p>Molecular screening of tumor samples prior to study entry for <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alterations was performed by either a local laboratory or sponsor-designated central laboratory as part of eligibility assessments. Separately, archival tissue (≥10 unstained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded slides) was also collected when available and underwent comprehensive genetic profiling using a clinically validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform that sequences 324 genes for mutations, indels, copy-number alterations, and select gene fusions (by Foundation Medicine; Cambridge, MA; ref. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) for <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> molecular correlative analysis. Central pathology review of diagnoses was not performed.</p>
                <p>Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was performed at baseline and every 8 weeks while on study. Response (or progression) was reported by the local investigator's interpretation of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Central review was not performed. Adverse events were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Ophthalmologic examinations (visual acuity testing, slit-lamp examination of anterior eye segment, intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy) were performed at baseline and then on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, and day 1 of all subsequent cycles.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Sample size calculations were based on simulations of the operating characteristics of the study, rather than a power consideration. Assuming a true 6-month PFS rate of 50% and a uniform accrual of 1 patient per month, with a sample size of 24 evaluable patients in the per-protocol set (∼17 PFS events), there was about 86.1% chance to achieve success at the end of the study, where a 6-month PFS rate of &lt;16% was defined as unacceptable efficacy, 16% to 25% as demonstrating limited efficacy, 25% to 40% as demonstrating moderate efficacy, and &gt;40% was consistent with clinically relevant efficacy.</p>
                <p>Efficacy analyses were performed in the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients who received ≥1 dose of infigratinib (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 26). ORR was evaluated in patients from the FAS who had measurable disease per RANO criteria at their baseline scan and who were also reassessed during treatment (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 21). Safety analyses were based on the safety set, which included all patients who received ≥1 dose of infigratinib and had ≥1 valid post-baseline safety assessment (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 26).</p>
                <p>The Kaplan–Meier method was used to analyze time-to-event endpoints and provide estimates of survival rates and median values with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For PFS, patients who discontinued the study and were lost to follow-up on or before the cut-off date were censored at the date of their last available tumor assessment. For OS, patients who were alive at the time of completion of the study were censored at the last contact date or end of treatment visit date if the patient elected not to be followed post–study treatment. If the patient was still being followed, the patient was censored at the data cut-off date. Statistical analyses were generated using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software, version 9.4 or later (RRID:SCR_008567; SAS Institute Inc.). No formal statistical comparative tests were performed.</p>

              <p>Between December 2013 and May 2016, 731 patients were screened of whom 26 patients (3.6%) were enrolled into the study and included in the FAS; 11 (1.5%) and 15 (2.1%) patients, respectively, were enrolled before and after the protocol amendment that excluded patients with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> amplifications only.

              <p>Patients had a median age of 55 years (range, 20–76), 16 (61.5%) were male, and 18 (69.2%) had an ECOG performance status of ≤1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> amplifications, mutations, or fusions were identified in 1 (3.8%), 3 (11.5%), and 1 (3.8%) patients, respectively, and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> amplifications, mutations, or fusions were identified in 11 (42.3%), 2 (7.7%), and 10 (38.5%) patients, respectively (Supplementary Figs.

                <p>A swimmer plot showing outcomes for individual patients at each assessment is presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Four patients had durable disease control with infigratinib lasting &gt;1 year; 1 patient had a partial response (<italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> K656E mutation) with a PFS of 21.9 months, and 3 patients had stable disease (<italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> K656E mutation, PFS, 13.2 months; <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion, PFS, 30.2 months; <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> K650E mutation, PFS, 12.9 months). Two of the patients with stable disease (<italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> K656E and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion) had received two prior lines of systemic treatment including bevacizumab. In both cases treated with bevacizumab before infigratinib, the timing of progression for which infigratinib was started (approximately 8 years after radiotherapy and 10 months after radiotherapy in one case each) makes enrollment for pseudoprogression extremely unlikely; moreover, in one of these cases, there was histologically proven recurrence before starting infigratinib. In 1 patient with partial response, the pattern of progression after chemoradiotherapy (newly enhancing, leptomeningeal, outside the high-dose radiotherapy field) and biomarker pattern (<italic toggle="yes">H3 K27M</italic> mutation which is nearly always mutually exclusive with <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter; refs. <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20, 21</xref>) also makes it unlikely the patient was treated with infigratinib for pseudoprogression (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) rather than disease refractory to standard treatment. Magnetic resonance images of all 4 patients with durable stable disease or partial response are shown in Supplementary Figs. S5–S8.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We tested targeted therapy with an FGFR1–3 inhibitor, infigratinib, in a multicenter phase II study in patients with recurrent gliomas and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alterations. At the outset, the study was designed to include patients with any <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> abnormality (i.e., amplification, fusions, or mutations) in the hope that broad selection criteria would enrich the population of responders. The inclusion criteria were subsequently restricted to <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> mutations and fusions after it became apparent that <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> amplification alone did not predict benefit preclinically or serve as a surrogate for fusion (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Our data further support this observation, as most patients with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1/3</italic> amplification had progressive disease and the only RANO-confirmed response was observed among the 16 patients with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> fusions or mutations. One patient with an <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> amplification that achieved a 64% decrease in tumor size from baseline had a concurrent <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> R132H mutation that may have contributed to the patient's best response of stable disease. This absence of response for amplification-positive patients is consistent with other cancers where point mutations/deletions rather than amplification alone, predict response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for example <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> mutations in non–small cell lung cancer (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Perhaps impacted by the inclusion of amplification-only patients, our study showed that FGFR inhibitor monotherapy had limited efficacy, with a 6-month PFS rate of 16% and ORR &lt;5%. Although this technically met the prespecified threshold for 6-month PFS rate as meriting further study, treatment of patients with broad <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> selection criteria is not warranted in this disease setting.</p>
              <p>Our study was also limited by lack of consistent or mandated central confirmation of the <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alterations used for eligibility, with discordance for <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> amplification between the screening assays and <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> NGS observed commonly (Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S3). We view NGS as a “gold standard” for the detection of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alterations absent a suitable and reliable alternative, and we recommend that future studies use a single, central assay for molecular screening to homogenize the biomarker-selected population for <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> fusions or activating point mutations in determining eligibility.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the small ORR, durable disease control lasting &gt;1 year was observed in 4 patients, one of whom continues to receive infigratinib on a compassionate-use basis with stable disease lasting 46.5 months (as of January 17, 2020). It is also notable that 2 of the 4 patients with prolonged benefit had received prior bevacizumab, a patient profile with a particularly poor prognosis. Molecular profiling in these cases with durable response or stabilization revealed the presence of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) or activating mutations in <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> K656E (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2) or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> K650E (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) which occur at analogous positions in these two receptors (Supplementary Fig. S9). While it has been reported previously that the presence of <italic toggle="yes">FGFR-TACC3</italic> fusions in patients with glioma confers sensitivity to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), we are unaware of any reports describing clinical activity through FGFR inhibition in glioma tumors with <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> point mutations. Therefore, our study provides additional information about genetic lesions that sensitize gliomas to FGFR inhibition. Of note, the patient with a durable partial response had a <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> K565E-positive midline glioma with a <italic toggle="yes">H3K27M</italic> mutation, a condition that is associated with a poor prognosis and is not sensitive to standard treatment options (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that a future trial of infigratinib, either alone or in combination with another targeted agent and/or radiotherapy, in patients with gliomas harboring <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> point mutations and/or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> fusions or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic>-mutated midline gliomas would be of interest. Coincident alterations in cell-cycle genes (CDK4, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B) or H3F3A observed in our study population provide insight into possible combination partners with targeted inhibitors of CDKs and histone deacetylase enzymes.</p>
              <p>Unlike the more common activating mutations that occur in the extracellular IgG-like domains in <italic toggle="yes">FGFR2</italic> in cholangiocarcinoma (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> in urothelial carcinoma (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), the activating mutations that were detected in this glioma cohort occurred within the intracellular kinase domains in both <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> (N546K and K656E) and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> (K650E). Of the 4 patients with mutations in the intracellular kinase domain, 3 had durable benefit as described above and the fourth patient, with an <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> N546K mutation, had a decrease of 32%. The stable disease control observed for patients with kinase domain mutations is supported by <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell growth inhibition assays, which showed that the growth of Ba/F3 cells transformed by FGFR1-N546K, FGFR1-K656E, FGFR3b-K652E, and FGFR3c-K650E could be inhibited efficiently by infigratinib (ref. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S10). These observations lend further support to the importance of activating point mutations at <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1/3</italic> as both are transforming and adequately targeted by infigratinib. Infigratinib also showed clinical activity in 2 patients with recurrent glioblastomas and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> fusions, the same as we found here, in a separate basket trial (Supplementary Table S5; Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT02160041; ref. <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our findings are particularly encouraging in a disease setting where there is currently no established therapy beyond radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy for patients with recurrent gliomas (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and outcomes with available treatment options are generally poor. For example, nitrosoureas (lomustine or carmustine), recommended for patients with recurrent disease after standard radiotherapy and temozolomide (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), provide only short-lived disease control (median PFS, 1–4 months; ref. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref>). Future clinical investigation in glioma should consider further refinements to the FGFR biomarker criteria and glioma subtypes that are most likely to benefit from FGFR inhibition. Combinatorial trials with an FGFR inhibitor and existing treatments may help to identify specific biomarker cohorts that show increased sensitivity to radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy. Of note, FGFR-mediated phosphorylation of PTEN (pY240-PTEN) has been identified as a mechanism of radiation resistance and actionable target for improving radiotherapy efficacy (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Similar to most anticancer drugs, FGFR inhibitors were not developed specifically for CNS tumors, and the distribution of FGFR inhibitors within intracranial tumors is largely unknown because of a lack of supporting pharmacokinetic studies (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Preclinical studies in Wistar rats suggest that infigratinib penetrates into the CNS: infigratinib was detectable in the brain for up to 12 hours with a brain-to-plasma under the time-concentration curve ratio of 0.68 after a single oral 10-mg/kg dose (data on file, QED Therapeutics). The protocol design encompassed a surgical arm to explore tissue pharmacokinetics, but it did not accrue any patients, which is a limitation of our study. Additional preclinical and clinical studies to investigate the CNS penetration of infigratinib are currently in progress and will be reported separately.</p>
              <p>The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events with infigratinib at the oncologic doses used in this study included hyperphosphatemia, fatigue, and diarrhea, a safety profile that is consistent with previous clinical trials (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16, 17, 32</xref>). Hyperphosphatemia, a class effect thought to be due to FGFR inhibition of FGF-23–mediated renal phosphate homeostasis (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), was the most common toxicity. A proactive strategy, including an intermittent dosing schedule, active monitoring, early intervention with dose interruptions or dose reductions, dietary restrictions, and prophylactic use of a phosphate-lowering agent (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), appeared to be effective for the management of hyperphosphatemia in our study.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, single-agent infigratinib had limited efficacy in a population of patients with recurrent gliomas without robust molecular selection other than harboring any <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic> alteration. However, durable disease control lasting &gt;1 year was observed in a patient subset with activating <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> point mutations or <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic> fusions. Further trials with refined biomarker inclusion criteria and centrally conducted molecular analyses are under development.</p>
