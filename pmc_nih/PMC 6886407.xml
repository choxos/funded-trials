                <p>Quality of response to immunosuppressive therapy and long-term outcomes for pediatric severe aplastic anemia remain incompletely characterized. Contemporary evidence to inform treatment of relapsed or refractory severe aplastic anemia for pediatric patients is also limited. The clinical features and outcomes for 314 children treated from 2002 to 2014 with immunosuppressive therapy for acquired severe aplastic anemia were analyzed retrospectively from 25 institutions in the North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium. The majority of subjects (n=264) received horse anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG) plus cyclosporine (CyA) with a median 61 months follow up. Following hATG/CyA, 71.2% (95%CI: 65.3,76.6) achieved an objective response. In contrast to adult studies, the quality of response achieved in pediatric patients was high, with 59.8% (95%CI: 53.7,65.8) complete response and 68.2% (95%CI: 62.2,73.8) achieving at least a very good partial response with a platelet count ≥50×10<sup>9</sup>L. At five years post-hATG/CyA, overall survival was 93% (95%CI: 89,96), but event-free survival without subsequent treatment was only 64% (95%CI: 57,69) without a plateau. Twelve of 171 evaluable patients (7%) acquired clonal abnormalities after diagnosis after a median 25.2 months (range: 4.3-71 months) post treatment. Myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia developed in 6 of 314 (1.9%). For relapsed/refractory disease, treatment with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant had a superior event-free survival compared to second immunosuppressive therapy treatment in a multivariate analysis (HR=0.19, 95%CI: 0.08,0.47; <italic>P</italic>=0.0003). This study highlights the need for improved therapies to achieve sustained high-quality remission for children with severe aplastic anemia.</p>

              <p>Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare disorder characterized by peripheral bi- or pancytopenia and bone marrow (BM) hypoplasia. Initial therapy for younger patients with SAA is a matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) if a matched sibling donor is not available.<sup><xref rid="b1-1041974" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> There is a paucity of data for children with SAA treated during the modern era from the ethnically and geographically diverse population of North America. Pediatric studies from the National Institutes of Health,<sup><xref rid="b2-1041974" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> the Japanese Childhood Aplastic Anemia Study Group,<sup><xref rid="b3-1041974" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="b6-1041974" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Brazil,<sup><xref rid="b7-1041974" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and the Severe Aplastic Anemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (SAAWP-EBMT)<sup><xref rid="b8-1041974" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-1041974" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> have been reported. However, diagnostic evaluation for constitutional disorders has been limited, and duration of follow up has often been variable and short. Many published studies report outcomes with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) due to the withdrawal of horse ATG (hATG) from some European and Asian markets in 2007; however, a large prospective study of upfront rATG <italic>versus</italic> hATG reported inferior response rates and lower survival with rATG.<sup><xref rid="b10-1041974" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, contemporary data to inform therapeutic decisions in pediatric patients treated with IST in North America are of interest given international differences in treatment regimens, recent advances in diagnosis of genetic marrow failure disorders, improvements in HSCT outcomes, and better supportive care.</p>
              <p>To facilitate collaborative clinical studies of pediatric aplastic anemia, a consortium of 25 institutions (now numbering 39) across North America, named the North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium (NAPAAC), was formed in 2014.<sup><xref rid="b11-1041974" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The urgent need for evidence-based guidelines for patient management in pediatric SAA was highlighted by a NAPAAC survey of clinical practices of member institutions which revealed considerable variability in diagnostic evaluation and management.<sup><xref rid="b11-1041974" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Recognizing the challenges of performing a prospective trial to address these critical knowledge gaps, NAPAAC conducted a retrospective study of presentation and outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2014 with SAA and treated with IST with a minimum of two years of follow up in member institutions. The objectives of the study were to determine the rates of response and survival following IST, to assess rates of clonal abnormalities, and to explore patient-specific factors contributing to survival, refractory disease, relapse, and clonal progression following IST. This NAPAAC effort represents the first large study of pediatric SAA reflecting the racially diverse population of children afflicted by SAA across multiple centers in North America. These contemporary data from a large number of pediatric patients will inform future studies of additional diagnostic or prognostic testing, and guide evidence-based clinical management.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>A retrospective chart review was conducted by member institutions of all patients aged 1-20 years treated with IST as the first therapy for pediatric SAA between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2002 and 30<sup>th</sup> June 2014 for whom follow up was available for a minimum of 24 months or until death. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each participating institution or <italic>via</italic> a reliance agreement with the central study IRB at Boston Children’s Hospital. Each site abstracted data from the local medical record and entered them into a central Red Cap database. The data included demographics, disease characteristics at diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. When available, the original anonymized written reports of specific studies including BM aspirate and biopsy, cytogenetics, fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), clonal analysis for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), telomere flow-FISH analysis, immunological analyses, and autopsies were uploaded for central review.</p>
                <p>Submitted cases were included only if the diagnostic BM was reported as hypocellular and the patient had at least two peripheral cytopenias: 1) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 0.5 ×10<sup>9</sup>/L; 2) platelet count (Plts) &lt; 20×10<sup>9</sup>/L; 3) hemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 8 g/dL. Central review of diagnostic marrow slides was not feasible but marrow pathology reports were reviewed to confirm that the marrow cellularity was &lt;25% or hypocellularity was stated to be consistent with the diagnosis of SAA without a specified percentage cellularity. Patients with a local diagnosis of an inherited BM failure syndrome were excluded from this study, as were subjects with an HLA-matched sibling who went to transplant upfront. Date of diagnosis was considered to be the date of the BM biopsy. Date of treatment was considered the first day of IST, and all outcomes were timed from the first day of treatment. Structured reporting of status and blood counts was required at initiation of IST, as well as at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months, and at last follow up.</p>

                <p>Overall survival (OS) was measured from the time from first day of IST until death or date last known alive. Event-free survival (EFS) was measured from the time from start of IST until an event (death or start of a second therapy for SAA, either HSCT or a second course of IST) or the date last known to be without an event.</p>
                <p>Response<sup><xref rid="b12-1041974" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> was defined using hemoglobin (Hb), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelets (Plts). Complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) and partial response (PR) required the indicated levels in all three lineages as noted below; no response (NR) was defined as failure in any lineage:

                <p>Patients receiving transfusions of packed red blood cells within six weeks or platelets or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)/granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) within two weeks of evaluation were deemed to have had NR at that time point. An objective response (OR) was defined as at least a PR (PR+VGPR+CR) and a deep response (DR) was defined as at least a VGPR (VGPR+CR). Duration of response (DOR) was defined as time from start of response to an event (death or start of a second therapy for SAA, either HSCT or a second course of IST).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Summary statistics included median and range for continuous variables and frequency and proportion for binary variables. Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare proportions and medians, respectively. The proportion of subjects with an OR, DR, and CR were reported along with the exact binomial 95% confidence interval (95%CI). OS, EFS and DOR were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method (log-log transformation for Confidence Interval) and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare EFS by treatment adjusting for covariates of interest [age, gender, time from initial IST treatment to 2<sup>nd</sup> treatment, and lymphocytopenia (lymphocyte count &lt;1×10<sup>9</sup>/L)]. Reference groups in this model were: IST treatment, age at second treatment ≥10 years, male gender, lymphocyte count at diagnosis ≥1×10<sup>9</sup>/L. An indicator variable was included in the model for missing lymphocyte data as these data were not provided for all subjects. The median follow up among all subjects was 62 months. There was 80% power to detect differences of at least 16% difference in proportions for 314 and 264 subjects, respectively (two-sided Fishers exact test, alpha=0.05). In terms of precision, the maximum Confidence Interval width of the exact binomial 95%CI for an observed proportion was 0.12 and 0.11, respectively, with n=314 and n=264. R language was used for analysis (R Core Team, 2016, Vienna, Austria; <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.R-project.org">https://www.R-project.org</ext-link></italic>).</p>

                <p>Hepatitis was noted prior to diagnosis in 43 (13.7%) patients, of whom 33 (12.5%) were treated with hATG/cyclosporine (CyA). Laboratory features at diagnosis are summarized in <xref rid="t2-1041974" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. PNH test results were available at diagnosis for 140 patients and a PNH clone was noted in 55 (39.3%). In most cases, the clone size was small [interquartile range (IQR): 0-0.12%]. Only 5 patients had PNH clones larger than 10% (range: 12.56-28.4%) in the granulocyte lineage and none had clinically evident hemolysis or thrombosis at diagnosis.</p>

                <p>The most commonly investigated inherited BM failure syndromes at diagnosis were Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita. Fanconi anemia screening was negative for 292 patients (93%), 18 patients were not tested, and results were not available for four subjects. Genetic testing for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome was available for 46 patients (14.6%); all of these were negative. Perhaps reflecting the evolution of understanding the role of dyskeratosis congenita in BM failure over the past five years, telomere length was assessed at the time of diagnosis in only 115 patients (36.6%) and a report of a clinical telomere flow-FISH test was available for 93 patients (29.6%). No patient exhibited a pattern suspicious for a primary telomere disorder (telomeres &lt;1<sup>st</sup> percentile in at least 3 different lymphocyte subsets).<sup><xref rid="b13-1041974" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, telomere lengths &lt;1<sup>st</sup> percentile were found in total lymphocytes in six patients, of whom only two had a complete 6-panel analysis.</p>
                <p>The current diagnostic criteria for SAA includes an ARC (absolute reticulocyte count) of &lt;20-60×10<sup>9</sup>/L.12,14,15 Many institutions relied on hemoglobin (Hb) rather than the ARC as a more clinically relevant indicator of erythroid hypoplasia to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions. Comparison of ARC <italic>versus</italic> Hb for the 231 subjects with ARC &lt;100 revealed a lack of concordance [(estimated Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.15 (95%CI: 0.02, 0.27)] between the commonly utilized diagnostic criteria of ARC of &lt;60 ×10<sup>9</sup>/L and significant anemia defined as Hb &lt;8 g/dL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1041974">Figure 1</xref>). A subset of patients meeting ARC criteria of ARC &lt;60 ×10<sup>9</sup>/L had Hb &gt;8 g/dL (12.7%, 28 of 220), and conversely, some patients who did not meet diagnostic criteria for ARC had Hb levels &lt;8 g/dL (74%, 26 of 35).</p>

Of these subjects, one patient received hATG but switched to rabbit ATG (rATG) due to an anaphylactic reaction. Overall, the demographics of the hATG/CyA population was similar to that of the entire group (Tables 1-3). The small number of subjects in groups treated with alternative IST regimens limited intergroup comparisons, and so only outcomes of the entire population and that of the hATG/CyA group were analyzed.</p>

CyA target trough levels were variable (100-400), with the majority 200-400. Following treatment with hATG/CyA, data regarding the cyclosporine taper were available for 194 patients. CyA was discontinued by six months for 13 subjects, between 6-12 months for 40 subjects, between 12-18 months for 34 subjects, between 18-24 months for 37 subjects, and after two years for 34 subjects.

Further, since the magnitude of a partial platelet response carries clinical implications for quality of life, the group attaining a deep response (Plts ≥50×10<sup>9</sup>/L) was separately analyzed. A deep response was achieved by 68.2% (95%CI: 62.2,73.8). No response (NR) was noted in 66 subjects (25%) and 10 subjects (3.8%) were not evaluable (NE, <xref rid="t4-1041974" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and <xref rid="t5-1041974" ref-type="table">5</xref>).

                <p>Of the 271 patients in the cohort who had BM metaphase cytogenetics (n=254) and/or FISH (n=133) assessments performed at diagnosis, seven (3%) had detectable clonal chromosomal abnormalities (<xref rid="t6-1041974" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Six of these patients had follow-up cytogenetic assessments. Two patients had a del(13q) clone at diagnosis, which remained detectable through the duration of follow up (range: 33-49 months) but was not associated with acquisition of additional chromosomal abnormalities. In contrast, other small clones present at diagnosis, including del(7q) in one patient and del(16q) in one patient, were no longer detectable at follow-up assessment.</p>

One additional subject had a clonal abnormality [+der(14;21)(q10;q10)] at 143 months from the time of initial diagnosis; however, the baseline status was unknown. The most common genetic alteration after IST was loss of chromosome 7 [either −7 or del (7q)] occurring in six patients (3.5%), all of whom had normal cytogenetics at baseline. Three patients had a del(13q) clone detected during follow-up BM assessments of which one was acquired after treatment. Among those patients with no clonal abnormalities at presentation, but who subsequently developed abnormalities at follow up, the median time to observe an abnormality was 25.2 months (range: 4.3-71.0 months; IQ range: 5.3-66.6 months). Interestingly, only four patients had BM pathology reports confirming the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome of whom two proceeded to HSCT prior to further clonal evolution. One patient developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and three developed acute myeloid leukemia.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We report a multi-institutional study of the presentation and outcomes of 314 North American pediatric SAA patients treated with IST. Although retrospective studies are limited by potential confounding factors and data availability, this multicenter study provides a contemporary analysis of the diagnostic evaluation and treatment outcomes for pediatric SAA. Since the natural history, risks, benefits, and outcomes of treatments are not identical between children versus adults with SAA, the study of rare diseases such as pediatric SAA requires collaborative effort through large consortia with the goal of improving diagnosis and treatment. As with any rare disease, national registries would greatly advance the prospective study of pediatric aplastic anemia.</p>
              <p>Although traditionally reticulocytopenia has been used as a diagnostic criterion for SAA, in this large study, reticulocytopenia with an ARC &lt;60×10<sup>9</sup>/L did not correlate with a Hb &lt;8 g/dL in a subset of patients. We found that the majority of clinicians were using clinically significant anemia and need for transfusion, rather than the ARC, to inform diagnosis and initiation of therapy. Indeed, in the setting of severe anemia without BM failure, the reticulocyte count would be expected to be markedly higher, so even an ARC within the normal range may be a sign of impaired erythropoiesis.</p>
              <p>Red cell macrocytosis may be indicative of the time frame from evolution of reduced hematopoietic stem cell numbers and clinically significant cytopenias. In addition, red cell macrocytosis may be associated with dysplastic processes. However, no association between macrocytosis and likelihood of hematologic response or survival was observed. Lymphopenia in pediatric patients with other cytopenias may be seen with primary immunological disorders; however, no association with response was observed. Development of cytogenetically abnormal clones or overt hematologic clonal disease was rare, although post-treatment marrow surveillance was not uniformly conducted or captured due to the retrospective nature of this analysis.</p>
              <p>A correlation between short leukocyte telomere length at diagnosis, measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, with increased risk of relapse, clonal evolution, and reduced survival has been reported.<sup><xref rid="b21-1041974" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Since current clinically available telomere length testing utilizes flow-FISH,<sup><xref rid="b13-1041974" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> we explored whether the results of this clinical telomere length assay correlated with outcomes. We did not detect a correlation between telomere lengths less than either the 1<sup>st</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for age with response to IST.</p>
              <p>We observed some notable differences from reported outcomes for adult SAA patients treated with hATG/CyA. Since the magnitude of blood count recovery is especially important to support normal growth and activity in children, we examined the quality of response to IST. Of those pediatric patients who responded to hATG/CyA, the quality of response was high, with 59.8% achieving a CR and 68.2% achieving a DR. In contrast, typical rates of CR cited for adults is 10%.<sup><xref rid="b12-1041974" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition, a lower rate of clonal progression was noted for children in comparison to the 10-15% clonal progression reported in adults, although this observation is potentially limited by the retrospective nature of this study and short follow-up time.<sup><xref rid="b22-1041974" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-1041974" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, EFS was low, with events continuing to accrue well past five years post IST without an apparent plateau. EFS is of particular concern for pediatric patients given their long future lifespan. Accordingly, both clinical decisions and evaluation of new therapies should be based on pediatric data whenever possible, rather than on extrapolation of data from adult cohorts. For patients with refractory or relapsed disease, EFS was superior for patients receiving second-line treatment with HSCT compared with IST even after adjusting for age, gender, time from initial IST to second treatment, and lymphocytopenia. A prospective study of 21 pediatric SAA patients receiving a second course of IST for refractory disease reported anaphylaxis in three patients and a trilineage response in only two (11%) of the remaining 18 patients, with a 5-year failure-free survival of only 9% at five years post second-line therapy.<sup><xref rid="b6-1041974" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Together with the excellent contemporary outcomes of MUD transplantation,<sup><xref rid="b24-1041974" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="b26-1041974" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> these data strongly suggest that allogeneic transplantation with a MUD is a superior second-line therapy for relapsed or refractory SAA after IST for pediatric patients. In addition, these data suggest a potential role for MUD HSCT as upfront therapy in young patients. A randomized pilot and feasibility trial comparing hATG/CyA <italic>versus</italic> MUD HSCT in newly diagnosed SAA patients lacking an HLA-matched family donor is currently underway.</p>
