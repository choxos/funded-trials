              <abstract id="Abs1">
                <p id="Par1">Malaria is spread by the transmission of sexual stage parasites, called gametocytes. However, with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, gametocytes can only be detected in peripheral blood when they are mature and transmissible to a mosquito, which complicates control efforts. Here, we identify the set of genes overexpressed in patient blood samples with high levels of gametocyte-committed ring stage parasites. Expression of all 18 genes is regulated by transcription factor AP2-G, which is required for gametocytogenesis. We select three genes, not expressed in mature gametocytes, to develop as biomarkers. All three biomarkers we validate in vitro using 6 different parasite lines and develop an algorithm that predicts gametocyte production in ex vivo samples and volunteer infection studies. The biomarkers are also sensitive enough to monitor gametocyte production in asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> carriers allowing early detection and treatment of infectious reservoirs, as well as the in vivo analysis of factors that modulate sexual conversion.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Malaria transmission from human-to-human via a mosquito requires the production of sexual-stage parasites, called gametocytes. During each cycle of intraerythrocytic asexual replication, a subpopulation of parasites commits to sexual differentiation and produces gametocyte-committed (gc)-ring-stage parasites. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the parasite responsible for the most virulent human malaria, the gc-ring matures over the course of ~8–12 days through five morphologically distinct stages (I–V) to become a mature, transmissible stage V gametocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In vivo, immature gametocyte stages (I–IV) are sequestered primarily in the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and spleen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and only terminally matured gametocytes (stage V) egress into the blood stream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, circulation of stage V gametocytes in a patient’s peripheral blood only happens ~8–12 days after sexual commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and currently serves as the only diagnostic stage for transmission potential. This delay in gametocyte detection after the initial commitment to sexual differentiation also makes it difficult to evaluate factors influencing the production of gc-rings in vivo as well as for early diagnosis and treatment of gametocytes before a person is infectious. In most locations, gc-rings are still effectively cleared by artemisinin derivatives. However, this activity against gc-rings is not universal among antimalarials acting against blood-stage parasites, such as antifolates and piperaquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, drug sensitivity decreases rapidly as gametocytes mature and by stage V gametocytes are refractory to many antimalarials, with the notable exception of the 8-aminoquinolines: primaquine and the newly approved drug, tafenoquine. In Southeast Asia, reports of delayed parasite clearance following artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) administration have also been associated with increased gametocyte production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> consistent with increased survival of gc-rings, but without markers this could not be directly tested.</p>
              <p id="Par4">In vitro attempts to define early gametocyte markers by comparing the transcriptomes of culture-adapted gametocyte-producing and -deficient parasite lines identified genes expressed in early gametocytes (e.g., <italic>pfs16, ge1, ge2, ge3, ge7, ge8, msrp1, pfgeco,</italic> and <italic>gexp5</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, expression levels of most of these genes are low in early gc-rings and they continue to be expressed at some level in stage V gametocytes, which complicates their use as gametocyte-committed ring biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, an ex vivo gametocyte assay was developed that allows quantification of gc-rings in patient’s blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This approach identified asexual parasitemia, fever, parasite genotype, and possibly plasma lysophosphatidylcholine levels as factors that influence in vivo gametocytogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To better understand the early stages of sexual differentiation in vivo and to develop molecular markers for gc-rings, this study examines the transcriptomes of uncomplicated malaria patients that had either high (H)-gametocyte-conversion rate (GCR) or low (L)-GCR in the ex vivo assay. Out of 18 genes overexpressed in gc-rings, 13 are consistently, significantly upregulated in H-GCR samples obtained from cross-sectional studies from two malaria seasons. <italic>Ap2-g</italic> (PFL1085w), <italic>surfin 1</italic>.<italic>2</italic> (PFA0650W), and <italic>surfin 13.1</italic> (PF13_0075) expression levels in gc-rings predict GCRs in samples from in vitro culture, uncomplicated malaria patients and human malaria volunteer infection study (VIS) subjects allowing their use as gc-ring biomarkers. We suggest gc-ring biomarkers are important tools to predict gametocyte production in submicroscopic to symptomatic infections ~8–12 days prior to circulation.</p>

                <title>Genes differentially expressed in vivo in gc-rings</title>
                <p id="Par6">Our recent demonstration of a wide range of gametocyte-conversion rates (GCR) in uncomplicated malaria patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> provided the opportunity to identify genes differentially expressed in blood samples with H- and L-GCRs. In this prior study, an aliquot of blood was preserved for RNA isolation, and the rest was cultured ex vivo for 8 days in the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine to block asexual growth and allow GCR quantification. We selected a subset of these D0 blood samples from the 2016 cohort that had H-GCR (&gt;5.5%) or L-GCR (0%) for transcriptome analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Samples with H- (<italic>n</italic> = 8) or L- (<italic>n</italic> = 8) GCR also had high or low transcript levels of mature gametocyte-specific genes <italic>pfs25</italic> and <italic>pfs230</italic> in D8 ex vivo parasite RNA, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Mature gametocytes were not detected in any of the D0 samples by microscopy or RT-PCR analysis of <italic>pfs25</italic> transcripts (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). All the selected samples had an initial parasitemia above 1.56% and other parameters such as range of D0 parasitemia, age, sex, hemoglobin levels, and WBC counts had a similar distribution in both groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par7">Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant increase in the transcript abundance of 18 genes (&gt;2.0-fold) in D0 blood samples from the H-GCR (<italic>n</italic> = 8) compared to the L-GCR (<italic>n</italic> = 8) cohort (FDR &lt; 0.16) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). These genes were also more highly expressed in gametocyte-producing (wild-type, strain NF54 (wt) and <italic>Pfgdv1.gfp.dd</italic> parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> with stabilization ligand Shield 1 (Shld1) (~7–10% GCR)) than gametocyte-deficient (<italic>Pfgdv1.gfp.dd</italic> parasites without Shld1 (0.1% GCR)) lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Cluster analysis using the expression profile of the 18 upregulated genes completely segregated the H-GCR samples (<italic>n</italic> = 8) from the L-GCR samples (<italic>n</italic> = 8) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), indicating the consistency of the expression profile. In contrast, ring-stage-specific genes (e.g., <italic>sbp1, nat</italic>, and <italic>kahrp</italic>) show no differential expression between H- &amp; L-GCR groups (FDR &gt; 0.16). These transcriptomic data provide the first glimpse of the gene sets upregulated in circulating gc-rings, providing potential molecular markers as well as insight into the first hours of gametocyte differentiation. Of note, a number of early gametocyte genes identified in vitro were also not significantly upregulated in the H-GCR cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 8), suggesting that they may be expressed after sequestration. Current gene annotations divide the in vivo, gc-ring genes into five functional groups: (1) gene expression regulation, including the AP2 transcription factor required for gametocytogenesis (<italic>ap2-g</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, <italic>hda, lshd, rga</italic>, and <italic>nyn</italic>, (2) enzyme activity, <italic>arom</italic> (3) proteins predicted or known to be exported to the erythrocyte cytoplasm or surface, <italic>ep1, ep2, ep3, surfin 13</italic>.<italic>1, surfin 1</italic>.<italic>2, surfin 4</italic>.<italic>2, ge7, gexp5</italic>, and <italic>vap1</italic>, (4) putative invasion ligands, <italic>tra</italic>, and <italic>msrp1</italic>, and (5) conserved Plasmodium proteins (<italic>cpp)</italic>.

                <title>In vivo gc-genes are regulated by AP2-G</title>
                <p id="Par8">AP2-G is a critical regulator of gametocytogenesis and its presence is essential for the differentiation of gc-rings into early gametocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, a gametocyte-inducible parasite line, <italic>E5.ap2-g.dd</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> was produced by integrating a ligand-regulatable degradation domain (dd) in the frame at the 3′ end of the <italic>ap2-g</italic> coding region. In the absence of Shdl1 ligand, the presence of this dd domain targets AP2-G to the proteasome for degradation and blocks gametocytogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In contrast, the presence of Shld1 stabilizes AP2-G protein allowing gametocyte production. Using this system, we first evaluated the expression of all 18 genes in the presence and absence of Shld1 and demonstrate a Shld1-dependent increase in the transcript (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To further evaluate whether the expression of all 18 genes correlated with gametocyte production, we regulated AP2-G protein levels by varying Shld1 concentration. As expected, there was a tight positive correlation between GCR and Shld1 concentration (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.96) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Transcript levels for all 18 genes also showed a dose-dependent increase, which was in marked contrast to the RNA profile of the control genes, <italic>kahrp</italic> and <italic>ap2-expo</italic> (PF3D7_1466400), which are expressed regardless of sexual commitment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">We selected 13 genes for RT-qPCR validation of differential expression in the original D0 samples used for microarray analysis. All the genes were significantly upregulated in the H-GCR samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and the expression-fold change ratio between the H- and L-GCR (H/L) samples ranged from 7.59 to 103, which confirms the microarray results.

                <p id="Par11">Given the strong correlation between the biomarker expression and a wide range of GCRs in vitro, we extended our analysis to validate the GCR prediction. To do this, we used RNA from all the samples that were assessed in our ex vivo system on D8 over two malaria seasons (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

The ex vivo GCRs were then compared with the relative abundance of D0 gc-ring biomarkers RNA levels in the same patient samples. There was a significant correlation between the expression levels of all three gc-ring biomarker genes and the ex vivo GCR (<italic>ap2-g</italic>

<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.614) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), as well as tight co-expression of the three gc-ring biomarkers in all the D0 clinical samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The predicted GCR was then calculated from the gc-ring biomarker D0 ΔCts using the algorithm developed for the in vitro samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d–f</xref>) and compared with the observed ex vivo GCR in samples with &gt;0.5% D0 parasitemia (2016, <italic>n</italic> = 81 and 2017, <italic>n</italic> = 110), excluding those used in the original microarray. The &gt;0.5% D0 parasitemia cutoff was used because of the limited sensitivity of the microscopy-based ex vivo GCR assay at low parasitemias. Good correlation was observed between the samples’ predicted and observed ex vivo GCRs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–f</xref>). In addition, Bland–Altman method comparison and intra-class correlation coefficient analysis show a good agreement between both methods (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The VIS study was originally conducted to test drugs for gametocytocidal efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Eight days after infection the participants were treated with piperaquine (PQP), an anti-malarial which only kills asexual stages allowing continued maturation and differentiation of gc-rings into mature gametocytes that were then targeted with a variety of test compounds. This experimental design provided an in vivo system to validate gc-ring biomarker GCR predictions at low parasitemias that could not be assessed using the microscopy-based ex vivo assay.

                <p id="Par13">To facilitate application to larger field studies, we designed a TaqMan-based RT-qPCR to increase the sensitivity, specificity, and enable multiplexing. TaqMan-based RT-qPCR was developed for each gc-ring biomarker (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>) and the resulting GCR predictions were strongly correlated with those from the SYBR RT-qPCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a–d</xref>). We extend this TaqMan-based multiplexed RT-qPCR to analyze blood samples from Ghanaian school children with asymptomatic malaria infection during the peak (July) and end (November) of the malaria season when symptomatic malaria rises and falls, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. All study subjects were negative for malaria infection by microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. However, by <italic>sbp1</italic> RT-qPCR, 57.14% (24/42) of the children at the peak and 49.09% (27/55) at the end of the malaria season had circulating ring-stage parasites. Even at these low parasite densities (0.069–80.0 parasite/µl blood), each gc-ring biomarker predicted GCR using 100 µl packed RBCs. Among parasite carriers, the proportion of children that were positive for at least two gc-ring biomarkers was higher at the end of the season (85.15%, 23/27) than during the peak season (62.50%, 15/24). The lowest predicted GCRs in these low-density asexual infections were 1.7%, 2.1%, and 2.08% for <italic>ap2-g</italic>, <italic>surfin 13.1</italic>, and <italic>surfin 1.2</italic>, respectively. The average GCR predicted by the ΔCt values for each biomarker was &gt;9%, regardless of transmission season (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Interestingly, a 10% GCR is the minimal level of gametocyte production required at low parasitemia (20 parasites/µL blood) to meet the theoretical transmission limit of two gametocytes/µL blood, which would be consistent with the observation that asymptomatic parasites carriers can transmit to mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>TaqMan probe-based RT-qPCR for GCR prediction.</title><p><bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> Correlation between predicted gametocyte-conversion rates (GCR) using SYBR green and TaqMan RT-qPCR.

              <p id="Par14">Here, we identify the genes differentially expressed in gc-ring-stage parasites circulating in malaria patient’s blood. This unique window between RBC invasion and sequestration could not be detected in vitro and provides a portal to assess malaria transmission potential prior to the release of stage V parasites into the blood circulation, which occurs ~8–12 days later. Three genes upregulated during this period were developed as gc-ring biomarkers that predict gametocyte conversion using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems. These gc-ring biomarkers can be widely used in submicroscopic to symptomatic malaria infections to detect gametocyte production in human infections in the field, as an aid to reducing malaria transmission, one of the priorities of the current research agenda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par15">These new biomarkers allow, for the first time, the detection of immature gametocytes over a week before they can be transmitted to a mosquito, allowing the prioritization of investigational antimalarials that have activity against gc-rings and the potential to block further malaria transmission. Although, not currently a problem in areas where parasites remain artemisinin sensitive, the activity of the artemisinins against gc-rings in parasites in Southeast Asia where the K13 mutant parasite is prevalent requires monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Previously, the programatic switch from chloroquine to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, which only clears asexual rings, not gc-rings, lead to an increase in gametocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The biomarkers identified here also enable wide-scale screening to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that modulate the transition from asexual to sexual differentiation, as well as the survival and maturation of stage V gametocytes. The identification of individuals that do and do not effectively clear gc-rings will enable the comparison of their metabolic and immune responses to define effective natural transmission-blocking mechanisms. Naturally acquired antibodies against gametocyte antigens (e.g., Pfs48/45, Pfs230, etc.) have been associated with transmission-blocking activity in the mosquito midgut (reviewed by Acquah et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>), but to date no antibodies have been identified that are specific for the surface of the intraerythrocytic gametocyte. Recently, a set of antibodies against surface molecules shared by early asexual and gc-committed parasites were reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The availability of biomarkers for both gc-rings and stage V gametocytes provides a tool to further define the role of such antibodies in the field.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Evaluating the prevalence of gc-rings in different populations and regions with different transmission dynamics will also extend our understanding of the role of host parameters in the modulation of gametocytogenesis in various malaria settings such as high- and low-endemicity, residual and active transmission seasons, and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. GCR variability was found in both uncomplicated malaria patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and in previously naive VIS subjects. Such variability is not surprising and has been associated with a number of factors (e.g., asexual parasitemia, fever, <italic>gdv1</italic> alleles, and plasma lysophosphatidylcholine levels) that could influence sexual conversion in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, asymptomatic children had relatively high GCRs, either at the peak or end of the malaria season, which is intriguing and suggests that parasites in submicroscopic infections in the absence of symptoms produce gametocytes at a higher rate, which would increase the chance of crossing the theoretical transmission threshold (two gametocyte/µL). Individuals with submicroscopic infection, including asymptomatic or VIS subjects, can successfully transmit to mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> consistent with the production of an adequate number of gametocytes and provides support for the high predicted GCRs in asymptomatic individuals and some VIS subjects. If confirmed by further longitudinal studies, these results suggest treatment of asymptomatic infections will be needed to advance malaria elimination efforts. Further longitudinal testing is also needed to determine whether GCR is a stable or transient characteristic, as our current work has only determined GCR at a single time point per subject.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The identification of gc-ring biomarkers could also facilitate efficacy testing of lead compounds against gametocytes, which has been challenging due to the lack of an established marker to predict gametocyte production early in the assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Previously developed transgenic reporter lines express fluorescent proteins under the <italic>alpha tubulin II</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> or <italic>gexp2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> promoters to identify stage I gametocytes (~ ≥ 36 h post invasion). While these reporter lines are good for in vitro assays, neither were found to be differentially expressed in the H-GCR samples suggesting that they are only expressed after sequestration, which will limit their in vivo use in clinical trials. The gc-ring biomarkers developed in this study allow quantification of GCR before and after treatment in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo to evaluate the efficacy and stage specificity of the drug/molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, gc-ring biomarker could be used to test the hypothesis that drug-resistant strains can make gc-rings at a higher rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and enhance the spread of drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Identifying this tendency early in the drug development process will allow for appropriate surveillance and management strategies to be put into place. As a note, gc-ring biomarkers are unable to distinguish male and female gametocytes, and the relationship between sex ratio and conversion rates needs to be explored in future studies, as earlier work demonstrates the importance of this to design interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par18">The AP2-G-dependence of all the genes differentially overexpressed in the H-GCR cohort provides a separate line of support for their gc-ring specific upregulation. In addition to monitoring AP2-G dependence by treating the AP2-G inducible line (<italic>E5.ap2-g.dd</italic>) with a single Shld1 concentration in triplicate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), the dose-response experiment independently tested gc-ring gene expression at 6 different Shld1 concentrations in duplicate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) increasing confidence in the results. Additionally, AP2-G-dependent regulation of the transcript levels of 10 of the 18 genes was also corroborated in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, five of the 18 gc-ring genes have not been identified in prior in vitro studies, including the two <italic>surfins</italic> selected as gc-ring biomarkers. The <italic>surfins</italic> are members of a multigene family characterized by the presence of a schizont-infected cell agglutination (SICA) C-terminal inner membrane domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This domain was first identified in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> and thought to be exposed on the RBC surface. The <italic>surfins</italic> also have a noncanonical export signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, consistent with transport to the RBC and, possibly, exposure on the iRBC surface. Together, these characteristics suggest that SURFIN 1.2 and 13.1 could be involved in modifications of the gc-ring-infected erythrocyte that may provide the first step toward sequestration; however, this needs to be investigated further. It is not clear why these genes were not identified in previous work. It could be due to their relatively short duration of expression, challenges associated with experimentally synchronizing and regulating gametocyte production, or the low yield of RNA from ring-stage parasites. It is also possible that the gene expression levels are higher in the parasite’s natural niche than in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par19">While gc-ring biomarkers offer exciting tools to enhance malaria elimination by identifying transmission hotspots and determinants of the sexual conversion, to date they have only been studied in field samples obtained in the central region of Ghana over the course of 2 years and in lab-adapted parasite lines. Additional studies using samples collected from diverse malaria settings are needed to ensure their general applicability. More information is also needed about the relationship between gc-rings and sequestered immature gametocytes and whether gc-ring biomarkers can predict the sequestered reservoir of immature gametocytes. The algorithm we have developed is based on a range of in vitro GCRs which varies from 0 to 20.85% and we have observed a decrease in sensitivity of GCR prediction using gc-ring biomarkers if the observed GCR is at or beyond the limits of this range (&lt;1% and &gt;23%).</p>
              <p id="Par20">The gametocyte prognosis tools developed here will sharpen the existing molecular arsenal targeting malaria elimination. This early detection provides an 8–12 day window for treatment prior to transmission and can be used with submicroscopic and symptomatic infections. Additionally, these gc-ring biomarkers are vital to investigating host and parasite factors that drive sexual conversion and modulate gametocyte survival in the field. They also expedite the evaluation of drug efficacy against sexual stages.</p>
