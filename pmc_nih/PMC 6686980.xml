              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common reproductive health problem associated with significant age and racial/ethnic health disparities.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Potential sequelae of PID include ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and chronic pelvic pain (CPP).<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The risk of fertility impairment increases with each subsequent episode of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and/or PID<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>; thus, a national health objective was created to reduce infection among young women with 2 common STIs and key causative agents for PID: <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Research with urban adolescents and young adults has demonstrated the importance of fertility and the value of preventing the sequelae associated with PID.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Although researchers have focused on childbearing, the PID Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) study revealed that CPP affected more than 40% of patients with PID. Given the effects on health-related quality of life, prevention of CPP is critically important.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>During the past 2 decades, care of adolescent and young adult patients with PID has shifted from inpatient to outpatient settings based on the data from the PEACH study and subsequent health economic analyses using these data.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Our analysis<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> of data from 831 women in the PEACH study indicated that the overall outcomes for patients in the trial were suboptimal. Although 52% of enrolled participants experienced a live birth, a primary outcome assessment of well-being used by reproductive health researchers, 21% of participants experienced a recurrent STI or PID diagnosis, 40% of patients experienced CPP, and 21% of affected patients experienced infertility. Furthermore, among adolescents 19 years or younger in the trial, those who experienced recurrent disease were 5 times more likely to report CPP.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Although research has demonstrated the significant cost differential between inpatient and outpatient treatment for PID, health economic analyses indicate that hospitalization of young women is no longer a cost-effective approach to management of mild to moderate PID.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Adherence and longitudinal clinical outcomes from randomized trial data<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> suggest that some additional intervention is merited.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, research has demonstrated poor practitioner adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment guidelines across the United States and poor patient adherence in randomized clinical trials<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and in institutional care settings with standardized approaches to outpatient PID management.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The CDC recommendation for a 72-hour follow-up visit suggests that interactive intervention is necessary to reduce the disparities observed among the mostly young women affected by this disorder, although few young women follow up for care.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Alternate clinical and behavioral interventions designed to improve patient adherence are essential to ensure recovery and for prevention of recurrent disease, CPP, and infertility among affected patients. The Technology Enhanced Community Health Nursing (TECH-N) study examined the first intervention to date, to our knowledge, designed to meet this specific need in adolescent and young adult care.</p>
              <p>The objectives of this analysis were to compare the effectiveness of the TECH-N intervention vs standard of care for improving (1) short-term self-management adherence and (2) the 90-day longitudinal <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> outcomes for female adolescents and young adults enrolled in the TECH-N study. Although we evaluated patient adherence to self-care behaviors, we hypothesized that the TECH-N group would have a better rate of short-term (5-day) clinical follow-up compared with the control group and a lower rate of recurrent STIs at 90 days compared with the control group.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The design of this randomized clinical trial has been previously reported in the literature<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but is described briefly here (trial protocol is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190345-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>). Patients with mild to moderate PID aged 13 to 25 years were recruited from pediatric and adolescent medicine clinics and pediatric and adult emergency departments within a large urban academic medical center located in a community with high STI prevalence from September 6, 2012, to December 8, 2016.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The final analysis of data was completed in November 2018. Patients were referred by their practitioner to the study, and eligible patients were enrolled by trained research staff using written informed consent procedures approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Although enrolled participants were encouraged to engage a parent or other supportive adult in their life, a waiver of parental consent was granted by the institutional review board because patients were being treated for an STI and Maryland state law provides for minor consent to counseling and treatment for STIs. For patients younger than 18 years who were enrolled in the intervention, additional written parental consent was required at the time of the home visit to conduct the intervention in the home. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.</p>

                <p>At baseline, participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview and were randomized to intervention and standard of care control groups based on a computer-generated block randomization sequence that was generated by the studyâs data analyst (S.C.) and sealed in an envelope until sequential enrollment.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Although PID is a polymicrobial illness, the hallmark of assessment and treatment of patients is based on the effective treatment of <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> as commonly known pathogens. All participants provided self- or practitioner-collected vaginal swabs to test for STIs, including <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> infections, and received a full course of medications per the CDC STI treatment guidelines<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> that were dispensed through their practitioner with routine discharge instructions. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone per their routine clinical care and received twenty-eight 100-mg doxycycline tablets to take 1 tablet orally twice daily for 14 days. Other medications were available when practitioners requested them (eg, 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 14 days) to dispense at discharge with doxycycline. All participants were provided with standard discharge instructions per institutional PID treatment guidelines, and control participants were asked to arrange a 72-hour visit with their primary care practitioner or with the Title X program offered through the institutional adolescent and young adult clinic.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Intervention participants received daily, automated text-message reminders for 2 weeks and then weekly booster messages provided through the Health Cloud SMS mobile communications platform (ReifyHealth LLC) for 1 month using their personal mobile phone or a prepaid, disposable mobile phone with text-messaging capacity provided by the study to patients without mobile phone access at the time of enrollment for use during the study. The daily messages reminded patients to take their medications and prompted patients to provide data about how many scheduled doses they had consumed each day with a tailored automated message to affirm and encourage adherence to the treatment regimen based on their responses (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190345-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>A community health nurse interventionist trained to deliver the PID-specific, short-term clinical follow-up visit that included a complete clinical assessment with abdominal examination and a 20-minute skills-based sexual risk reduction and condom negotiation counseling session using the Sister-to-Sister Teen Intervention<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> also visited intervention participants within 5 days of the enrollment visit to complete the CDC-recommended short-term clinical reassessment. This time frame was set up based on standards set by other national PID trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Alternative community sites (eg, local school-based health centers and health department clinical sites) for follow-up visits were determined in consultation with participants who did not believe that they were able to have the visit at home safely. The outreach worker saw all patients for research study visits at 14, 30, and 90 days after enrollment. During these visits, research staff conducted interviews and STI specimen collection. All study participants with positive results were contacted by a research nurse practitioner, notified of their positive test result, and referred for treatment to the Title X clinic per the protocol. Cases of <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> infection were reported to the local health department per Maryland state law. The TECH-N research staff encouraged partner notification and treatment while providing education, resources, and no-cost clinical care through the institutional Title X program for patient and partner treatment.</p>

              <p>The TECH-N group had a significantly greater decrease in <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> infection during 90 days than the standard of care control group. The TECH-N intervention was also efficacious for improving adherence to the CDC-recommended short-term clinical follow-up visit after PID among adolescents and young adults 13 to 25 years of age.</p>
              <p>These findings fill a particularly significant gap in the field given that more than half of the patients in the sample had prior STIs, which has the potential to compound the risk for sequelae in the context of recurrent disease. Many women seek services in emergency department settings but require close follow-up after their diagnosis to ensure recovery and to address related issues, such as STI and HIV risk reduction and contraceptive counseling. Community health nursing has been an effective strategy for treating adolescents and young adults who require ongoing support for management of clinical issues, such as asthma, teen pregnancy, and parenthood.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190345r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Working with adolescents and young adults with complex STIs in the community must be navigated thoughtfully to preserve confidentiality, while also providing needed services. This study demonstrates that the TECH-N approach is safe and efficacious for adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate PID.</p>
              <p>The use of technology as a part of the TECH-N design to support intervention patients is also in line with the notion of reaching adolescents where they are. National data demonstrate that 95% of adolescents have a smartphone and are online almost constantly.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, study findings suggest that the digital divide has closed for low-income urban youth owing to smartphone access. Only 3% of intervention participants required a study-provided mobile phone at enrollment. Technology access via a mobile phone is consistent with our prior research demonstrating that more than 95% of sexually active adolescent and young adult women have access to mobile phones with text messaging and internet access.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This work provides information for the potential development of interventions that leverage technology for care management and decision support for serious conditions for which confidentiality and personalized support are essential.</p>
              <p>Pelvic inflammatory disease is a common condition that can affect the reproductive health trajectory of female adolescents and young adults. There has been a shift in the CDC guidelines over time to deliver care to youth with mild to moderate disease in outpatient settings in response to the outcomes from the PEACH trial.<sup><xref rid="zoi190345r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although patients were captive in the hospital during the PEACH trial, inpatient care did not include individualized risk-reduction counseling for STIs, HIV infection, and pregnancy using evidence-based approaches and it did not account for most care being self-provided in the outpatient setting. To our knowledge, this was the first intervention trial designed to improve key adherence measures and health outcomes for female adolescents and young adults in the outpatient setting.</p>
              <p>Treatment of PID requires a complex set of behaviors to ensure not only that the patient and her sexual partner are adequately treated but also that future behavior is appropriately managed, with careful sex partner selection and condom negotiation behaviors. Although this single intervention was not able to adequately address all the required behavioral changes for patients, participation in the TECH-N intervention significantly increased the receipt of the CDC-recommended short-term clinical follow-up care and reduced the rate of acquisition for <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> infection, 2 key organisms associated with PID and its sequelae. Given that the recommendation for follow-up care in the office within 72 hours is standard practice, these data suggest that community health nursing may be a more effective strategy for actual care delivery; less than 20% of the control participants sought the recommended short-term clinical services available at no cost to them.</p>
              <sec id="H2-12-ZOI190345">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The findings from this research must be considered in light of several general limitations. This sample was a relatively homogeneous group of mostly low-income, African American adolescents and young adults who were cared for within a single institution and community. Findings may not be generalizable to other institutions or communities. However, there are significant STI and PID disparities facing young, African American women; thus, work with this population is important from a public health perspective. Similar to the PEACH trial, the potential confounding effects of socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity are difficult to parse because of the PID burden borne by low-income youth facing a high community burden of STIs. Texting for adherence reports was only used for intervention participants; thus, we used a self-report for the medication adherence variable. The outreach worker who collected the 2-week, 30-day, and 90-day data was a single individual and was not blinded to group assignment information. It is possible that interactions with the outreach worker may have influenced the longitudinal behavior of adolescents in the control group, but this individual did not interact with participants during the 14-day intervention period. This role requires a highly specialized skill set for field-based operations and represents an important attention control and mechanism for effective data collection in vulnerable populations that are difficult to engage in research involving randomized clinical trials. In addition, because of the delay in detection of <italic>C trachomatis</italic> as the causative agent for PID and the necessity of immediate action related to intervention participants, randomization was not stratified by <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> diagnosis and an imbalance in baseline <italic>C trachomatis</italic> infection was observed. This delay in access to testing results is standard of care because federally approved point of care testing for <italic>C trachomatis</italic> with results within the visit time frame is not currently available. This study had active outreach with all participants at 14, 30, and 90 days, and there was potential for a positive influence on control group behavior.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The TECH-N intervention showed sufficient success for delivery of the CDC recommendations for interim care and short-term reduction in STI acquisition and should be considered as a potential enhancement of standard of care approaches for female adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate PID in urban communities facing significant STI disparities. Training the local pool of home and community health nurses to complete the CDC-recommended post-PID assessments and risk reduction counseling in the field may optimize outcomes by providing essential acute care management support and reducing subsequent <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C trachomatis</italic> infections. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of such a community-level scale-up is warranted.</p>
