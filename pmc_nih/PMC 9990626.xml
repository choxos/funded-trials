                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The burden of disease attributed to drinking water from private wells is not well characterised. The Wells and Enteric disease Transmission trial is the first randomised controlled trial to estimate the burden of disease that can be attributed to the consumption of untreated private well water. To estimate the attributable incidence of gastrointestinal illness (GI) associated with private well water, we will test if the household treatment of well water by ultraviolet light (active UV device) versus sham (inactive UV device) decreases the incidence of GI in children under 5 years of age.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The trial will enrol (on a rolling basis) 908 families in Pennsylvania, USA, that rely on private wells and have a child 3âyears old or younger. Participating families are randomised to either an active whole-house UV device or a sham device. During follow-up, families will respond to weekly text messages to report the presence of signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal or respiratory illness and will be directed to an illness questionnaire when signs/symptoms are present. These data will be used to compare the incidence of waterborne illness between the two study groups. A randomly selected subcohort submits untreated well water samples and biological specimens (stool and saliva) from the participating child in both the presence and absence of signs/symptoms. Samples are analysed for the presence of common waterborne pathogens (stool and water) or immunoconversion to these pathogens (saliva).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 was enacted to ensure that public water systems in the USA supply high quality drinking water to the public. However, approximately 40âmillion people (12%) in the USA rely on water from private wells, which do not fall under the purview of the SDWA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Households with private wells are responsible for monitoring and maintaining their wells. This issue is not unique to the USA as most countries do not regulate private well water, and homeowners bear the responsibility of testing and treating their own water. Research suggests that testing and treatment are infrequent. For example, fewer than half of the private well owners tested their water annually when offered free testing services.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Other USA well water stewardship studies have observed that less than half of the surveyed households reported treating their water even when they are aware that their wells might contain nitrates and arsenic.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref></p>
              <p>A common misconception is that groundwater is free of contaminants, but a growing body of evidence demonstrates that well water can contain chemical and microbial contaminants.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â9</xref> Well water can be adulterated by agricultural activity, septic systems and other sources.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â13</xref> Contaminants can enter well water after precipitation and flooding, and intrusion may be facilitated by local hydrogeology.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 14 15</xref></p>
              <p>Epidemiological data regarding the effect of microbial content of groundwater on disease in households are scant.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that over 16âmillion annual cases of acute gastrointestinal illness (GI) occur from <italic toggle="yes">regulated</italic> public water systems, but there are no reliable corresponding estimates for those relying on private wells.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is likely that the burden of waterborne disease is greater for those consuming unregulated private well water. Better estimates of this burden would promote awareness around the risks of private well water consumption and the benefits of treatment. In addition, it would provide evidence for policymakers to recommend interventions, which may include more stringent guidelines/regulations for well construction and septic system management and opt-in, fee-based household treatment services run by local water services that have been proposed outside of the USA (eg, Aquarevo in Australia).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Non-urban households relying on private wells are excluded from the health benefits of consuming water from treated public water systems.</p>
              <p>The Wells and Enteric disease Transmission (WET) trial attempts to fill this gap in our understanding of the burden of waterborne disease faced by households that rely on private wells. The WET trial is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) globally to estimate the burden of childhood infectious disease attributed to the consumption of untreated private well water. The intervention involves installation of a commercially available, whole-house ultraviolet (UV) water treatment system, aimed to decrease exposure to waterborne pathogens in drinking water. Disease outcomes will be evaluated in children under 5 years of age, who are at the highest risk for enteric and respiratory infections.</p>

Individuals are given the opportunity to review the study description and consent form (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental text S2</xref>) and to ask study personnel questions before electronically consenting to study participation. Households have the option to submit photos of their well water pressure tank and location of nearest electrical outlet so that the study team can verify that (a) the household does not currently have an ineligible treatment system installed, and (b) installation will be feasible.</p>
                <p>Water treatment installers, who are blinded to the intervention, visit the homes of potentially eligible participants to assess the feasibility of installation and instal UV and sham systems. For most participants, the UV devices are installed to treat water for the entire house. In rare instances, only the primary drinking water source (eg, kitchen tap) is treated because of installation necessity and extant premise plumbing infrastructure. During the visit, installers conduct a site survey, survey participants and review well construction and septic records (when available) to collect information regarding the well (construction, depth, age), wastewater management (eg, on-site septic system) and agricultural activities proximal to the home. At study end, participants have the option to replace their own lamp/sleeve or request a replacement service from the installer. For participants who opt to replace their own lamp/sleeve, written consent is obtained. Written consent for submission of biological specimens from children is also obtained for a subcohort of households randomly selected to submit water, stool and saliva samples.</p>

Following the installation of the device, participants complete an online intake baseline questionnaire, which covers demographics, household composition, domestic animals in and around the home, diaper use, water consumption and medications. At least 7âdays after the device is installed, participants begin to receive weekly text messages asking if their child exhibited signs/symptoms of GI or acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the previous week. Prior studies of drinking water interventions have relied on paper-based symptom diaries often returned biweekly or monthly, which can be prone to recall bias.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 32</xref> More frequent contact and more prompt response through weekly SMS is likely to reduce such bias. Participants respond âYesâ or âNoâ to these text messages. When symptoms are reported, participants are texted (or emailed) a link to an online illness questionnaire that requests information on symptom type, severity, onset and duration. The illness questionnaire also includes questions on potential other sources of infection, including travel, food and daycare during the 7-day pre-illness exposure period. The illness questionnaire uses an interactive calendar feature (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>) to aid recall. Text message responses and illness questionnaires are compiled in a secure, online dashboard so that select members of the research team (eg, trial manager) can conduct additional follow-up via phone, text or email for participants who have not responded within 48 hours of receiving their initial text or questionnaire link.</p>

                <p>Sample size estimations for the study were based on the primary outcome.

For a two-sided test using the Variance Stabilised test statistic, samples of 399 subjects in each group with exposure time of 1.0âyear will achieve 80% power to detect an incidence rate ratio of 0.84 when the incidence rate in consuming untreated groundwater group is 1.45 and the significance level (two-sided alpha) is 0.05. The attrition rate for sample size calculations is estimated at 14%, which is greater than the rate from our pilot study (28 participants; rate=0%). Using this conservative estimate for attrition, we will enrol 454 individuals in each group to ensure 399 subjects per group for final analyses to attain our desired level of power.

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p>This innovative study is the first RCT to estimate the burden of waterborne disease attributed to drinking untreated private well water. One strength of this study is the provision of a whole-house water treatment system (vs a point-of-use system) to cover all potential within-house water exposures (eg, bath water) for the children. Another strength is the implementation of weekly text message-based illness reporting with an interactive calendar feature to aid families with recall (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>The analysis of groundwater, stool and saliva samples from the subcohort will represent a novel contribution to the understanding of the influence of private well water quality on child health. The concurrent collection of untreated groundwater and stools will make possible a previously unexplored examination of the relationship between the presence of pathogens in well water and in childrenâs stool. The many viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens (n=11) included for groundwater analysis is also novel, as studies of pathogen occurrence in groundwater typically include only two or three pathogens, with viruses tested more often than bacterial or protozoan pathogens.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 16</xref> Furthermore, this study will implement an innovative multiplex method of using antibody response to waterborne pathogens in saliva samples as a biomarker of infection in children.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the water samples collected through the study will allow for a QMRA alongside the large-scale epidemiological study. Few studies have directly compared epidemiological data to a QMRA.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> If the burden estimates from the QMRA and RCT are similar, the results of this study would provide support for the use of QMRA for estimating the burden of disease attributed to private well water contamination.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Moreover, most groundwater QMRAs use assumed pathogen values rather than measurements,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 51</xref> and few studies that use pathogen measurements consider more than one pathogen.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 47 52</xref> Our QMRA is based on 270 measurements of each pathogen, so risk estimated by QMRA represents many of the viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens that can cause the GI recorded by our epidemiological observations, allowing a robust comparison.</p>
                <p>Another trial strength is the diversity of drivers of groundwater contamination in the study counties. The study region is localised to the counties surrounding Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, but comprises counties with a wide range of geology, land use, contaminant sources and septic system density. The subcohort of participants is randomly selected from these counties, and thus, the samples from these households will be accordingly diverse.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>One limitation of this trial is the reliability of self-reported disease data. This study relies on a shorter recall period (7âdays) for parents/guardians than the recall period employed in many prior RCTs (weekly vs biweekly or monthly). However, parents/guardians may still find it difficult to recall specific details regarding illness even in the previous week. Capturing detailed illness histories may be further complicated by the presence of multiple caretakers (family members and daycare). Furthermore, parents/guardians are asked to report symptoms and potential exposures that occurred the week prior to illness onset. Hence, they may be asked about details extending back as far as 2âweeks, which may make recall challenging. Even so, compared with paper-based diaries, the use of weekly text message-based illness reporting with prompt follow-up potentiates the collection of illness data less impacted by recall bias.</p>
                <p>While the WET trial is the largest RCT of its kind globally, only a randomly selected subcohort of 180 participating families will submit stool, saliva and groundwater samples because of budget restrictions. The size of this subcohort and the geographical limitation (area surrounding Philadelphia) presents a challenge to achieving spatial and temporal heterogeneity in groundwater quality. Even so, the groundwater sample size of the WET trial with 180 wells (270 samples) is similar to, if not greater than, many well water studies globally that have examined pathogen presence.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 13</xref></p>
