However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear. Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase I–IIa clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres that were 5.0-fold and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020 on day 71 after vaccination. Median binding antibody titres were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement deposition and natural killer cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, including central and effector memory responses, were comparable among the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.</p>

Such variants of concern may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines and natural immunity from SARS-COV-2 strains that were prevalent at the beginning of the pandemic. The mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines have been reported to induce lower neutralizing antibody titres against the B.1.351 variant than against the original WA1/2020 strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

In the phase III ENSEMBLE trial, a single dose of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S resulted in 72%, 68% and 64% protection against moderate to severe COVID-19, and 86%, 88% and 82% protection against severe or critical COVID-19 in the US, Brazil and South Africa, respectively, by day 28 after vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In this trial, 69% of sequenced viruses from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazil were the P.2 variant, and 95% of sequenced viruses from confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa were the B.1.351 variant, which demonstrates that Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protective efficacy against these SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

No spike-specific ELISPOT responses were observed in vaccine recipients who received placebo. Spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were evaluated by multiparameter intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays on days 57 and 85 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Higher breadth of spike-specific TCRs was observed in vaccine recipients compared with placebos (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0014, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). By contrast, the breadth of non-spike TCRs was comparable in vaccine recipients and controls, as expected because the vaccine did not contain any non-spike immunogens. Substantial breadth of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses was also observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>TCRβ repertoire analysis.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Spike and non-spike T cell breadth by TCRβ sequencing on day 63. <italic>P</italic> values were determined by two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

              <p id="Par12">SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged with several mutations in targets of neutralizing antibodies, such as the E484K mutation. Median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres induced by Ad26.COV2.S were 5.0-fold lower against the B.1.351 variant and 3.3-fold lower against the P.1 variant as compared with the original WA1/2020 strain, which is a comparable reduction of psVNA titres that has been reported for other vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. By contrast, functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.</p>
              <p id="Par13">In the phase III ENSEMBLE trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, Ad26.COV2.S was evaluated in the USA, Latin America including Brazil, and South Africa. In South Africa, 95% of sequenced viruses from COVID-19 cases were of the B.1.351 variant, and in Brazil, 69% of sequenced viruses from COVID-19 cases were of the P.2 lineage. Protective efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S against severe or critical disease was similar in all geographic locations by day 28, and protective efficacy against moderate to severe disease was only slightly reduced in South Africa compared with the USA. Although the mechanistic correlates of protection for COVID-19 are not yet known, the robust protective efficacy in these regions despite reduced neutralizing antibodies raises the possibility that functional non-neutralizing antibodies and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses may also contribute to protection. Indeed, TCRβ sequencing revealed substantial breadth of T cell responses in individuals vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S. Alternatively, it is possible that low levels of neutralizing antibodies are sufficient for protection. In a non-human primate model, adoptive transfer of purified IgG was sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 if titres of psVNA exceeded a threshold of approximately 50, but CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also contributed to protection if antibody titres were subprotective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par14">In conclusion, neutralizing antibody responses elicited by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but other functional antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against these variants. The relevance of these immune parameters to mechanistic correlates of vaccine efficacy remains to be determined.</p>

In brief, the packaging plasmid psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program), luciferase reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene), and spike protein expressing pcDNA3.1-SARS CoV-2 SΔCT of variants were co-transfected into HEK293T cells (ATCC, mycoplasma tested) using lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). Pseudoviruses of SARS-CoV-2 variants were generated by using the WA1/2020 strain (Wuhan/WIV04/2019, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402124), D614G mutation, B.1.1.7 variant (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_601443), CAL.20C (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_824730), P.1 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_792683), or B.1.351 variant (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_712096). The supernatants containing the pseudotype viruses were collected 48 h after transfection, and then were purified by centrifugation and filtration with a 0.45-µm filter. To determine the neutralization activity of the plasma or serum samples from participants, HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1.75 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well overnight. Three-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum or plasma samples were prepared and mixed with 50 µl pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated at 37 <sup>o</sup>C for 1 h before being added to HEK293T-hACE2 cells. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titres were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in relative light unit (RLU) was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.</p>

Extracted genomic DNA was amplified in a bias-controlled multiplex PCR, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Sequences were collapsed and filtered to identify and quantitate the absolute abundance of each unique TCRβ CDR3 region for further analysis as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The fraction of T cells was calculated by normalizing TCRβ template counts to the total amount of DNA usable for TCR sequencing, where the amount of usable DNA was determined by PCR amplification and sequencing of several reference genes that are expected to be present in all nucleated cells. TCR sequences from repertoires were mapped against a set of TCR sequences that are known to react to SARS-CoV-2 by matching on V gene, amino acid sequence and J gene. In brief, these sequences were first identified by Multiplex Identification of T-cell Receptor Antigen Specificity (MIRA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. TCRs that react were further screened for enrichment in COVID-19-positive repertoires collected as part of ImmuneCODE compared to COVID-19-negative repertoires to remove TCRs that may be highly public or cross-reactive to common antigens. Individual response could be quantified by the number and/or frequency of SARS-CoV-2 TCRs seen post-vaccine. TCRs were further analysed at the level specific ORF or position within ORF based on the MIRA antigens. The breadth summary metric is calculated as the number of unique annotated rearrangements out of the total number of unique productive rearrangements, while depth summary metric corresponds to the sum frequency of those rearrangements in the repertoire. Sequences of known variants were obtained from GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org">www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) and aligned to known MIRA antigen locations.</p>
