                <p>Intratumoral vidutolimod (CpG-A TLR9 agonist) together with pembrolizumab overcomes PD-1 blockade resistance in 25% of patients with metastatic melanoma with manageable toxicities in a phase I trial.</p>

                <title>Abstract</title>
                <p>Patients with advanced melanoma that is resistant to PD-1 blockade therapy have limited treatment options. Vidutolimod (formerly CMP-001), a virus-like particle containing a CpG-A Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, may reverse PD-1 blockade resistance by triggering a strong IFN response to induce and attract antitumor T cells. In the dose-escalation part of this phase Ib study, vidutolimod was administered intratumorally at escalating doses with intravenous pembrolizumab to 44 patients with advanced melanoma who had progressive disease or stable disease on prior anti–PD-1 therapy. The combination of vidutolimod and pembrolizumab had a manageable safety profile, and durable responses were observed in 25% of patients, with tumor regression in both injected and noninjected lesions, including visceral lesions. Patients who responded to vidutolimod and pembrolizumab had noninflamed tumors at baseline and induction of an IFNγ gene signature following treatment, as well as increased systemic expression of the IFN-inducible chemokine CXCL10.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Significance:</title>
                  <p>In this phase Ib study in patients with advanced melanoma, intratumoral TLR9 agonist vidutolimod in combination with pembrolizumab had a manageable safety profile and showed promising clinical activity, supporting the further clinical development of vidutolimod to overcome PD-1 blockade resistance through induction of an IFN response.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Tumors that contain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and express an IFN response signature, including PD-L1 expression, are most likely to regress following single-agent PD-1 blockade (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>), and type I IFN response is essential for induction of antitumor immunity (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The major innate immune cells producing type I IFN in response to viral infection are plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which express Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>) and are frequently present in tumors in an inactivated state (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). TLR7 can be activated by most RNA sequences, whereas TLR9 is specifically activated by unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, which are prevalent in the genomes of pathogens (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7, 8</xref>). Intratumoral injection of TLR agonists could induce an IFN response signature and antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby improving responses to PD-1 blockade. As TLR9-mediated T-cell activation can induce PD-1 expression (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), combining TLR9 agonists with approved PD-1 blockade therapies is a rational approach to target cancer immune evasion.</p>
              <p>CpG-A, CpG-B, and CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotides are the three major classes of TLR9 agonists and differ in their molecular structures, endosomal trafficking, downstream TLR9 signaling, and patterns of pDC activation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 10</xref>). CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotides induce the strongest differentiation of pDCs into the transcriptionally distinct P1 subset, which is primarily responsible for the type I IFN response (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotides have been shown to activate tumor-associated pDCs to secrete type I IFNs and stimulate CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, pDC activation by nucleic acids can be greatly enhanced when the nucleic acids are contained within immune complexes resulting in the costimulation of CD32 (Fcγ receptor II), which is also expressed on pDCs (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 13</xref>).</p>
              <p>Vidutolimod (formerly termed CMP-001, CYT003, or QbG10) is a CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotide packaged within a virus-like particle (VLP) formed by a bacteriophage coat protein, Qβ (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In preclinical studies, vidutolimod induced anti-Qβ antibody production after the first dose, and, upon subsequent injections, these antibodies formed immune complexes with the VLP to facilitate pDC uptake and activation through CD32 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In a mouse model, intratumoral injection of vidutolimod induced similar local tumor regression but greater systemic tumor regression than naked CpG-A (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), suggesting that costimulation of TLR9 and CD32 may improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes. The benefit of intratumoral delivery is selective activation of tumor-associated pDCs that can present tumor antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, driving a specific antitumor response. In addition, local administration allows a reduction in the amount of drug used, thereby reducing systemic exposure and limiting off-target toxicities. Furthermore, intratumoral strategies have the potential to overcome resistance to single-agent PD-1 blockade by converting uninflamed tumor microenvironments (TME) into inflamed TME, locally priming T cells and/or allowing their intratumoral homing. In this phase Ib study, we evaluated intratumoral vidutolimod in combination with systemic anti–PD-1 therapy to overcome PD-1 blockade resistance in patients with advanced melanoma.</p>

                <title>Patient Characteristics</title>
                <p>Between April 14, 2016, and June 14, 2017, 44 patients with advanced melanoma previously treated with anti–PD-1 therapy were enrolled at four academic institutions in the dose-escalation phase of this study. The median time of all prior anti–PD-1 treatments was 5 months (range, 1.1–29.9 months), and 61% of patients (27/44) received their last prior anti–PD-1 treatment within 2 months of their first dose of vidutolimod and pembrolizumab. At the time of study entry, 91% of patients (40/44) had progressive disease (PD) as their last response to prior anti–PD-1 therapy; the remaining patients had stable disease (SD; 2/44) or unknown response (2/44; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Seven percent of patients (3/44) had melanoma confined to the skin, 30% (13/44) had soft tissue and/or lymph node involvement, and the remaining 64% (28/44) had bone and/or visceral metastases (Supplementary Table S1). Vidutolimod injection sites included skin, lymph nodes, soft tissue, and, in one patient, a liver metastasis. No major differences were observed between vidutolimod dosing schedule A (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) and B (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13; Supplementary Fig. S1) with respect to demographics, baseline characteristics, adverse events (AE), or treatment response; therefore, these schedules were pooled for analysis. At the time of data cutoff (May 8, 2020), one patient remained on study treatment. The other patients discontinued the study due to PD [52% (23/44)], consent withdrawal per investigator reporting [23% (10/44)], investigator decision [18% (8/44)], or treatment-related adverse events [TRAE; 5% (2/44); Supplementary Fig. S1]. Among the patients withdrawing consent, one patient stopped after their initial complete response (CR) assessment and maintained a CR for at least another 22 months, and four patients had PD prior to study discontinuation.</p>

                <p>Patients received a median of 8 vidutolimod injections (range, 2–48) and a median of 5.5 pembrolizumab doses (range, 1–52). All patients received pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W); four patients also received at least two 200-mg doses. Two patients discontinued treatment because of TRAEs, and two discontinued because of AEs related to PD. Supplementary Table S2 reports the incidence of AEs of any grade regardless of attribution to PD or study treatment. One patient had fatal respiratory failure, which was considered unrelated to study treatment. AEs attributed to the study treatment are reported in Supplementary Table S3. Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 20 patients (45%); incidence was highest following the third injection of vidutolimod (initial weekly injection phase) and declined in frequency and severity after the sixth injection and during subsequent Q3W dosing (Supplementary Fig. S2). No grade 5 TRAEs occurred. The most common TRAEs (≥25%) were flu-like symptoms (chills, fever, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea), hypotension, injection site pain, and arthralgia, which are expected side effects with the activation of pattern-recognition receptors. The most commonly reported grade 3/4 TRAE was hypotension [16%; grade 3 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6); grade 4 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1)]. There was no apparent dose relationship in the severity or incidence of all-cause AEs or TRAEs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).</p>

                <p>Eleven of the 44 patients [25%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13%–40%] achieved a partial response (PR) or CR when assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Four patients had a CR and seven patients had a PR. Of these responders, one patient had a last response of SD and 10 patients had a last response of PD to prior anti–PD-1 therapy. All responses were confirmed except for two PRs. In responding patients, target lesions showed progressive reductions in tumor volume, suggesting that responses deepened over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Median duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 was 19.5 months (95% CI, 5.8–not estimable), including 5 patients with responses &gt;23 months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Median time to response was 2.5 months (range, 1.9–5.8), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.7–5.4). Responses were also observed in patients receiving on-study steroids (Supplementary Table S4) and in patients with various baseline disease sites (Supplementary Table S2). Using modified RECIST v1.1 for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST; ref. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) assessed by blinded central review, there were two additional patients with a response to therapy (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B), one of whom had experienced PD on treatment with a different TLR9 agonist (SD-101; CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotide) and pembrolizumab.</p>

                <p>Vidutolimod-injected and noninjected target lesions, including visceral metastases, demonstrated similar tumor volume reductions (Supplementary Fig. S4). Complete regression of two injected scalp metastases was observed in a 77-year-old man who experienced PD on prior pembrolizumab monotherapy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This patient was previously treated with pembrolizumab for 1 month (best response of PD), with 2 months elapsing from the last pembrolizumab dose to the start of vidutolimod study treatment.

A 48-year-old woman who was previously treated with pembrolizumab for 2.5 months, with 8 months elapsing from the last dose of pembrolizumab to the start of vidutolimod study treatment, had regression of visceral lung metastases (noninjected target lesions) following injection of an inguinal lymph node (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

On the basis of emerging data and the absence of dose-limiting toxicities or a clear dose response, vidutolimod 10 mg was selected as the dose for further clinical development.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The advent of PD-1 blockade dramatically changed the treatment paradigm across different tumor types, including melanoma. Unfortunately, many patients do not achieve a meaningful antitumor response, and established therapies to overcome primary or secondary resistance to PD-1 blockade are lacking (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In this study in patients with melanoma, the combination of intratumoral vidutolimod and intravenous pembrolizumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and promising clinical activity to overcome PD-1 blockade resistance by inducing durable regression of both injected and distant, noninjected tumors, including visceral metastases. With an objective response rate (ORR) of 25% per RECIST v1.1, the response rate of vidutolimod plus pembrolizumab in this heavily pretreated patient population was substantially higher than the response rates observed in patients treated with PD-1 blockade beyond initial progression (6%–7%; ref. <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and in line with response rates observed with other anti–PD-1 combinations as second-line treatments (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Reports of response rates with PD-1 blockade retreatment in later lines of therapy are scarce. On the basis of a limited number of biopsies, tumors in patients with responses were generally noninflamed at baseline, which may have contributed to the patients' progression on prior anti–PD-1 therapy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 3, 4</xref>). Intratumoral injection of vidutolimod induced IFN-mediated tumor inflammation, as demonstrated by increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers, PD-L1 expression, and IFNγ gene signature, in injected and noninjected lesions of the only responder with available baseline and on-treatment biopsies. In contrast, patients with PD showed a trend toward lower induction of IFN-regulated serum CXCL10 compared with patients with CR/PR/SD, and three of four patients with PD and baseline and on-treatment biopsies showed no increase in tumor IFNγ gene signature.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have demonstrated tumor regression in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma following intratumoral administration of a CpG-B oligodeoxynucleotide (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and in patients with advanced melanoma treated with intratumoral administration of the CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotide SD-101 in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab, including 2 of 13 patients who had progression on prior anti–PD-1 therapy (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, a phase III trial of the CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotide tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab recently failed to improve survival in advanced PD-1 blockade–refractory melanoma (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ir.iderapharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/idera-pharmaceuticals-announces-results-illuminate-301-trial" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://ir.iderapharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/idera-pharmaceuticals-announces-results-illuminate-301-trial</ext-link>). This lack of confirmed efficacy may be driven by insufficient clinical activity of the TLR9 agonist or the checkpoint inhibitor used in the combination. In contrast to SD-101 and tilsotolimod, vidutolimod is a CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotide that induces a distinct pattern of pDC differentiation, leading to a much greater magnitude of type I IFN secretion, and greater stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 11</xref>). Vidutolimod's activity is further enhanced by its delivery within the Qβ VLP, which triggers an anti-Qβ antibody response that provides immune complex–mediated costimulation of CD32 (Fcγ receptor II; refs. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 13</xref>). The cell population targeted by anti-Qβ–coated vidutolimod is broader than that targeted by TLR9 agonist alone (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, anti-Qβ–coated vidutolimod altered the response of TLR9-negative myeloid cells to cytokines (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This altered response to cytokines may contribute to an enhanced antitumor response with vidutolimod. Consistent with these key distinguishing features, vidutolimod is the only TLR9 agonist that has shown clinical activity as a single agent in patients with advanced anti–PD-1–refractory melanoma (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Lastly, it may be critical to use an anti–PD-1 agent in combination with a TLR9 agonist to counteract the effects of PD-L1 upregulation and allow for the sustained activity of antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by the TLR9 agonist. Our results demonstrate the ability to durably overcome PD-1 blockade resistance with a VLP-encapsulated CpG-A TLR9 agonist in combination with pembrolizumab. These data are also consistent with the hypotheses that (i) in responding patients with advanced melanoma, intratumoral vidutolimod activates tumor-associated pDCs to secrete type I IFN, which induces Th1 antitumor immunity manifested by the rapid production of CXCL10 and the subsequent generation of IFNγ-secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells; and (ii) nonresponding tumors may have primary resistance to TLR9 activation in tumor-associated pDCs, similar to observations in several other advanced cancers (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). The promising clinical activity observed in this phase Ib study supports combining the potent CpG-A TLR9 agonist vidutolimod with PD-1 blockade as a rational approach to target cancer immune evasion. Clinical studies have been initiated to confirm the safety and efficacy of vidutolimud in combination with PD-1 blockade in previously untreated patients with melanoma (NCT04695977) and in patients with PD-1 blockade–resistant melanoma (NCT04698187).</p>

                <p>Eligible patients were age ≥18 years, had histologically confirmed metastatic nonuveal melanoma, had metastatic lesions amenable to intralesional injection, and had current or previous treatment with any anti–PD-1/PD-L1 at time of study enrollment; patients with current treatment must have had SD per RECIST v1.1 after ≥12 weeks (≥4 doses), or must have had PD per RECIST v1.1 on treatment; patients with previous treatment (anti–PD-1/PD-L1 alone or in combination) must have been deemed to have not responded to this therapy/combination, irrespective of the timing of the prior therapy relative to first dose of vidutolimod. PD-1 blockade was not required to be the last treatment prior to study entry. Patients were required to have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Key exclusion criteria included anti-CTLA4 or investigational therapy administered within 30 days, requirement of systemic corticosteroids &gt;10 mg per day prednisone equivalent, prior grade 4 autoimmune toxicities resulting from prior immunotherapy, or known active central nervous system metastases.</p>
                <p>The study protocol and its amendments were approved by the relevant institutional review boards, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All patients signed written informed consent prior to receiving study treatment.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Treatment</title>
                <p>The dose-escalation part of this open-label, multicenter, phase Ib study (NCT03084640) of vidutolimod in combination with pembrolizumab followed a 3+3 design. Vidutolimod (1, 3, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg) was injected intratumorally into ≥1 lesion weekly for 7 weeks, followed by Q3W thereafter (schedule A); or weekly for 2 weeks, followed by Q3W thereafter (schedule B). Investigators were advised to use their discretion to identify and inject the most aggressively growing accessible lesion; the total dose of vidutolimod could be split among several lesions. If the injected tumors regressed or if a new lesion appeared, the investigator could inject another accessible tumor; if no accessible lesions remained, the investigator could inject vidutolimod subcutaneously in the area of former disease. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously according to the Keytruda (pembrolizumab) prescribing information. Study treatment could be discontinued because of PD, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, or withdrawal of consent. Patients with PD could continue study therapy at the discretion of the investigator.</p>
                <p>Premedications, including antipyretics, antiemetics, and intravenous fluids, were recommended but not required. A subsequent protocol amendment recommended treatment with stress-dose steroids before or immediately after injection of vidutolimod for patients with adrenal insufficiency due to an increased risk of moderate to severe AEs, such as hypotension.</p>

                <title>End Points and Assessments</title>
                <p>The primary objective of the dose-escalation part of this phase Ib study was to determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule of vidutolimod in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives were to assess the overall safety profile, pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of vidutolimod plus pembrolizumab.</p>
                <p>Safety assessments were performed at baseline and at each vidutolimod dosing visit. All AEs reported were treatment emergent. TRAEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 18.1. The relationship of AEs to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</p>
                <p>Antitumor activity was determined as best ORR (i.e., percentage of patients with CR or PR), DOR, time to response, and PFS by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1. Tumor assessments were conducted at screening, every 12 weeks during treatment, and at the end-of-treatment visit. Archival and on-study tumor biopsy samples were collected when possible. Tumor regression in patients who continued study treatment after PD per RECIST v1.1 was assessed by blinded central review according to iRECIST (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The sample size was based on clinical considerations and a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. All patients who received ≥1 dose of vidutolimod were included in the intention-to-treat population and evaluated for safety and antitumor activity. Descriptive statistics included means with SD or medians with minimum and maximum values for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Exact methods (Clopper–Pearson 95% CIs) were used for ORR. Patients who discontinued prior to having a postbaseline follow-up tumor assessment were counted as nonresponders. Median DOR (starting from first evidence of response) and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Missing data were not imputed. Censoring of DOR and PFS data was based on US Department of Health and Human Services censoring rules. Given the exploratory nature of this study, no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made and no formal comparisons of dose levels were performed for any end points. Analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4.</p>
