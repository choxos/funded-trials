                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2) and ephrin type A receptor 2 (EPHA2) are attractive therapeutic targets, being expressed in ~90% of canine and human gliomas, and absent in normal brain. Clinical trials using an earlier generation IL-13 based cytotoxin showed encouraging clinical effects in human glioma, but met with technical barriers associated with the convection-enhanced delivery (CED) method. In this study, IL-13 mutant and ephrin A1 (EFNA1)–based bacterial cytotoxins targeted to IL13RA2 and EPHA2 receptors, respectively, were administered locoregionally by CED to dogs with intracranial gliomas to evaluate their safety and preliminary efficacy.</p>

                <sec id="s0101">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation trial, cytotoxins were infused by CED in 17 dogs with gliomas expressing IL13RA2 or EPHA2 receptors. CED was performed using a shape-fitting therapeutic planning algorithm, reflux-preventing catheters, and real-time intraoperative MRI monitoring. The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the cytotoxic cocktail in dogs with gliomas.</p>

                <sec id="s0102">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Consistent intratumoral delivery of the cytotoxic cocktail was achieved, with a median target coverage of 70% (range, 40–94%). Cytotoxins were well tolerated over a dose range of 0.012–1.278 μg/mL delivered to the target volume (median, 0.099 μg/mL), with no dose limiting toxicities observed. Objective tumor responses, up to 94% tumor volume reduction, were observed in 50% (8/16) of dogs, including at least one dog in each dosing cohort &gt;0.05 μg/mL.</p>

              </caption>
              <p>Using a real-time MRI-monitored convection enhanced delivery technique in a canine model of spontaneous intracranial glioma, we demonstrate that locoregional administration of recombinant bacterial cytotoxins targeting IL13RA2 and EPHA2 tumor-associated receptors is safe and capable of inducing objective and clinically relevant antitumor effects over a range of doses. Given the shared molecular fingerprint of IL13RA2 and EPHA2 overexpression in canine and human malignant glioma, our findings provide evidence that justifies translational investigations of CED platforms that incorporate real-time imaging and evolving technical advancements in conjunction with personalized biomarker screening for rational locoregional delivery of targeted therapeutics to humans with malignant glioma.</p>

            <p>High-grade gliomas represent primary brain tumors with unmet medical needs. The most common malignant glioma is glioblastoma (GBM), which is incurable with surgery and chemoradiotherapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Obstacles to GBM treatment include tumor heterogeneity, which limits lasting effects from single-factor targeted drugs, and the blood‒brain and blood‒tumor barriers, which limit access of systemically administered drugs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
            <p>One approach to glioma treatment is the use of targeted cytotoxins, which bind to plasma membrane receptors and are subsequently internalized to deliver a lethal toxin load to targeted cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2) is one of 2 receptors that bind IL13 ligand and has been widely studied in glioma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref></sup> IL13RA2 is overexpressed in canine and human glioma cells, but not normal brain cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> We have modified the IL13 ligand for IL13RA2 to increase target specificity by differentially increasing binding avidity for tumor-expressed IL13RA2, but not for the physiological receptor, IL13RA1/IL-4A.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p>To advance the targeted cytotoxin approach, we sought to make therapy more specific and combinatorial and have identified ephrin type A receptor 2 (EPHA2), which is also overexpressed in gliomas, but not in normal brain.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this study, we used a superagonist conjugate of ephrin A1 (eA1), a specific ligand for EPHA2 receptor, with PE38QQR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref></sup> IL13RA2 and EPHA2 are conjointly present in &gt;90% of glioma patients, with the majority expressing at least one of these proteins in 50–100% of tumor cells, as well as within the tumor vasculature, glioma stemlike cells, and tumor cells infiltrating normal brain.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> By concomitantly delivering IL13- and eA1-based cytotoxins, we address tumor heterogeneity to some extent by killing glioma cells that express either IL13RA2, EPHA2, or both receptors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
            <p>A first-generation IL13-based cytotoxin, huIL13-PE38QQR,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> produced significant clinical responses in early trials, which was the chief reason for moving the candidate drug to the efficacy trial.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, the phase III trial design required a 50% extension of overall survival over controls, which made achieving the primary endpoint difficult, since few oncologic drugs demonstrated such efficacy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Other flaws of the trial included lack of real-time imaging of the drug distribution during convection-enhanced delivery (CED), use of a catheter with a tendency for infusate reflux and air blockade, and lack of confirmation of target expression.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Regardless, patients with recurrent GBM lived a mean 45 weeks (range, 35 to 53), a result that has not been seen in other subsequent efficacy trials in this patient cohort.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> To address these limitations associated with CED technique, we utilize antireflux catheters and real-time intraoperative imaging, which have been shown to improve CED.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Use of a canine model of spontaneous glioma, which represents the closest translational model to human disease, provides a more realistic assessment of potential efficacy in human trials regarding mechanistic and biological aspects of treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In this study, we demonstrate the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of cytotoxins targeting IL13RA2 and EPHA2 receptors administered with CED in dogs with gliomas. A secondary objective was to characterize the serum cytokine profiles of dogs subjected to cytotoxin treatment. We hypothesized that dogs with glioma would have elevated concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and that a cytokine signature reflecting immunogenic cell death (ICD) would be observed after cytotoxin treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Given the shared IL13RA2 and EPHA2 expression in canine and human glioma, this trial provides crucial knowledge regarding translation of this therapy to humans.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>

MTD was defined as the dose below the one in which dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in 2 dogs.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In dogs with gliomas expressing IL13RA2 and EPHA2 receptors, treatment with targeted cytotoxins was well tolerated and induced clinically relevant responses over a range of doses. Using therapeutic planning, reflux-preventing catheters, and real-time MRI monitoring, we demonstrate that robust volumes of canine brain can be infused with CED. Given the shared expression of IL13RA2 and EPHA2 between canine and human gliomas,<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> our results provide a framework for future trials of novel targeted cytotoxins in human glioma and highlight the study design and technical delivery limitations that have contributed to non-optimal results of CED as a drug delivery platform.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Locoregional cytotoxin delivery was sufficiently safe as to preclude identification of an MTD, although the maximum administered drug concentration given here represents a 6-fold increase over the doses of huIL13-PE38QQR delivered to human patients with glioma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> We have shown in translational models that tumoricidal concentrations of IL13RA2/EPHA2-targeted cytotoxins are likely orders of magnitude less than MTD defined by neurotoxicity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Non–dose limiting intraoperative systemic hypertension was the only adverse event possibly attributed to the cytotoxin infusion. Transient systemic hypertension was reported in dogs with gliomas treated using CED with an agent targeted at epidermal growth factor receptor, suggesting that this may be a nonspecific response to brain infusions in dogs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Two procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred during the 28-day observation window, including an indirectly fatal pulmonary thromboembolic event and transient cerebral edema associated with catheter placement. These SAEs have occurred in canines and humans with gliomas that are subjected to neurosurgical interventions, including CED of huIL13-PE38QQR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Real-time imaging was essential for confirmation of catheter positioning, quantitative evaluation of surrogates of the quality of infusions such as tumor coverage, assessment of therapeutic efﬁcacy as a function of target coverage, evaluation of the feasibility and efficiency of high-rate CED infusions, and early identification of UTEs. Suboptimal catheter placement has contributed to poor target coverage and therapeutic outcomes in humans and dogs with glioma,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and 25–30% of canine tumors have been inaccurately targeted in previous CED studies that did not utilize intraoperative imaging.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The last 6 dogs were treated at infusion rates of up to 20 μL/min through individual catheters with tumor coverages that were comparable to lower rate infusions, and without any reflux, which supports the utility of the reflux preventing catheter.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Intraoperative catheter revisions were critical for continued target infusion in this study, as catheter air obstruction, reflux, and ventricular infusate leakages have notoriously impeded drug delivery in previous CED studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Intraoperative imaging was also paramount to safety evaluations, as it allowed for characterization of UTE in temporal and clinical contexts, confirmation of the safety of the catheter placement and removal, and allowed assessment of possible toxicity in regions of normal brain exposed to cytotoxins during necropsy.</p>
              <p>Our technique resulted in improved delivery metrics, with 100% of gliomas in this study receiving a cytotoxin payload with a median tumor coverage of 70%. Another canine glioma study quantified CED using real-time imaging with a median target coverage of 28%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> With the exception of the V<sub>d</sub>:V<sub>i</sub> ratio, which was significantly higher in nonresponders, other differences in quantitative CED variables between responders and nonresponders were not observed, suggesting that limitations of the CED delivery technique were not a major contributor to lesser responses in this trial. This difference in V<sub>d</sub>:V<sub>i</sub> may be related to the significantly lower contrast-enhancing tumor volumes in nonresponders. In humans undergoing CED treatment of glioma, the V<sub>d</sub> of infusates in non-enhancing tumor may be up to 10-fold higher compared with enhancing tumor.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Despite improvements in delivery metrics, achieving consistent and complete targeting of MRI-defined tumor volumes remains a challenge of CED.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The longest PFS occurred in the two dogs that had ≥92% target coverage with V<sub>d</sub> that extended beyond the T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)–defined tumor. This supports the need to target the infiltrative, microscopic tumor burden that occurs adjacent to the imaging-defined enhancing tumor mass that often accounts for local treatment failures. Although we could not assess V<sub>d</sub>:V<sub>i</sub> in the non-enhancing lesion separately from enhancing tumor due to close proximities of catheters, our experience supports routine placement of catheters into specific targeting of non-enhancing tumor regions. The use of multiport catheters that allow for infusion of large volume through a single portal represents one solution for more complete tumor targeting.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our study provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the cytotoxins as a sole treatment modality as assessed with MRI response criteria and demonstration of tumor cell death on necropsy. Objective PR was observed in 8 dogs, and an additional dog experienced SD associated with a &gt;50% tumor reduction for one year. Imaging responses were associated with clinical benefits including improved KPS scores, seizure control, and QoL surveys. Limited survival data in dogs with histologically confirmed gliomas treated with conventional modalities currently exist.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The PFS (187 days) and OS (224 days) observed in our trial were longer than those of dogs with gliomas treated palliatively (OS, 79 days) or surgically (OS, 66 days), similar to trials in dogs that underwent investigational therapies including surgery followed by dendritic cell vaccination (OS, 185 days), surgery and metronomic chemotherapy (OS, 254 days), repeated CED infusions (OS, 190 days) of liposomal camptothecin-11 (CPT-11), and comparable to dogs treated with radiotherapy (OS range, 225–390 days).<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Necropsy examinations allowed for evaluation of tissue level treatment effects and confirmed tumor necrosis in infused regions, providing insight into a range of histologically defined effective cytotoxin doses. Tumor cells with a modified posttreatment phenotype, characterized by less cellular anaplasia and a decrease in the proliferative index, were observed in one dog receiving the lowest concentration of cytotoxins. The mechanism of phenotypic change is unclear but may involve selective targeting of more proliferative tumor cells, leaving residual terminally differentiated tumor cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We observed similar changes after CED of liposomal CPT-11 treatment in orthotopic murine tumor models with a canine glioma cell line and in dogs with gliomas.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The presence of essentially nondividing, yet apparently viable, tumor tissue after therapy has important implications for both the prognosis and assessment of therapeutic efficacy if measured by a reduction in tumor volume. Tumor cells at the infusion margin may also have been exposed to sublethal cytotoxin concentrations, or the drug exposure time was insufficient, as data suggest that it can take several hours for internalization of cytotoxin after receptor binding.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> It is unlikely that the 0.5 μg/mL cytotoxin concentration is subtherapeutic, as tumor necrosis in treated regions was observed at necropsy in another dog in this dosing cohort.</p>
              <p>Cytokine analyses supported our hypothesis that dogs with glioma have increased concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8, as well as IL-10, KC, MCP-1, and IFN-δ, although no differences in TNF-α were observed between tumors and controls. Similar cytokine patterns occur in humans with glioma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, these findings are not specific to glioma, being seen in other human and canine cancers, and support the coexistence of both local immunostimulation and immunosuppression in cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Glioma dogs had simultaneously increased IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations. IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, and IL-10 generally an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by tumor cells that can inhibit antigen-presenting properties of dendritic cells and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> IL-8 and IL-10 promote glioma cellular proliferation, motility, and invasion, and in the case of IL-8, tumor angiogenesis and endothelial permeability. MCP-1 secretion by glioma cells, monocytes, and microglia promote immunosuppression by driving accumulation of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> This cytokine profile, which likely reflects both inherent features of the canine glioma microenvironment as well as responses to the cytotoxin infusion, could result in dysregulated immunosurveillance in which immune cells are recruited to the tumor, but tumor cells are spared from destruction by infiltrating immune cells by local immunosuppressive factors. Upregulated <italic>CCL2</italic> (MCP-1), <italic>IFNG</italic>, and <italic>IL10</italic> gene expression were observed in gliomas from dogs enrolled in this trial.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We found significant and temporally sustained increases in IL-2, IFN-δ, and TNF-α in responders, which are hallmarks of ICD and antitumor T helper cell 1 responses, coinciding with serial tumor volume reduction in prolonged responders. The small size of our study, as well as the lack of inclusion of control groups precludes us from specifically associating this cytokine signature with the cytotoxin treatment, but this preliminary data are encouraging that cytotoxins may exert an in situ vaccination effect by producing ICD of targeted cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We envision an approach in which a targeted cytotoxin is administered to cause tumor death and release a spectrum of tumor-associated antigens that induce an adaptive immune response coupled with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p>While surgical resection benefits local disease control in humans, its efficacy in canine glioma has not been established.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> As local tumor control was achieved in several cases, extensions of our work would be to repeat CED, combine it with other approaches, or incorporate new technologies such as multiport catheters that have shown promise for large-volume locoregional infusions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Although we did treat several canine glioma entities, expression of IL13RA2 or EPHA2 were unifying molecular denominators for all dogs, and we observed tumor responses that were agnostic to tumor phenotype. However, the variable cytotoxin dosing and low numbers of dogs with each type and grade of glioma treated in this study limit our ability to robustly determine effects of tumor phenotype on therapeutic response. This trial serves as a template supporting our parallel development of cytotoxins simultaneously targeting 4 tumor-associated receptors—IL13RA2, EPHA2, EPHA3, and EPHB2—and our own arborizing, multiport CED catheter intended to facilitate locoregional CED infusions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Expanding targeting to include EPHA3 and EPHB2 receptors will further address intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity and allow treatment of differentiated tumor cells, glioma stemlike cells, infiltrative tumor cells, neovasculature, and tumor-infiltrating cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In conclusion, CED of IL13RA2/EPHA2 cytotoxins at concentrations ranging from 0.05–1.6 μg/mL was safe and resulted in clinically relevant responses in 50% of dogs with gliomas. Further investigation of locoregional delivery of targeted therapeutics by CED are warranted for the treatment of dogs and humans with glioma.</p>
