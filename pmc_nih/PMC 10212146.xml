                  <p>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem often associated with serious mental health and physical health implications.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The current study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a brief computerized intervention to reduce alcohol and drug use among women with IPV. Fifty women with recent IPV and alcohol and drug use risk were recruited from domestic violence shelters and randomized to the experimental computerized intervention or to an attention and time control condition. The primary outcome was percent heavy drinking or drug using days in 3 month increments over the 6 months after leaving the shelter. Receipt of substance use services and IPV severity were evaluated as secondary outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The computerized intervention was feasible and acceptable, with high (n = 20, 80%) completion rates, engagement with the intervention, and satisfaction scores. As expected in this pilot trial, there were no significant differences between conditions in percent heavy drinking/drug using days or receipt of substance use services and large individual differences in outcomes. For example, receipt of substance use services decreased by a mean of 0.05 times/day from the baseline to the 6-month time period in the control condition (range -1.00 to +0.55) and increased by a mean of 0.06 times/day in the intervention condition (range -0.13 to +0.89). There were large decreases in IPV severity over time in both conditions, but directions of differences favored the control condition for IPV severity.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive and significant public health problem. It is often defined as violence by an intimate partner that may involve physical altercations (e.g., such as hitting, slapping or kicking), emotional or physical threats, and/or forced sexual relations [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over 48 million women experience IPV in their lifetime, and about 41% of female IPV survivors report some form of physical injury due to the IPV [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; including traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The degree of morbidity associated with IPV is reflected in the fact that it negatively affects eight of the 10 leading health indicators identified by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Substance use problems are highly prevalent in women with IPV. Lifetime prevalence rates for substance abuse or dependence are twice as high for women with IPV than women in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and women with IPV are 5.6 times more likely to develop a substance use disorder compared to women not exposed to IPV. For women in U.S. domestic violence shelters, it has been estimated that 42% use substances [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, given the multitude of competing concerns and high degree of stress faced by women with IPV in shelters and when they leave shelters, women with prior substance use problems appear to be at high risk of relapse. Common theories to explain the strong association between these two phenomena have included the self-medication hypothesis, that is, IPV survivors use substances to cope with the effects of violence [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Conversely, substance use can impair a woman’s judgement or compromise her ability to move to safety [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A third possibility is that substance use may increase conflict in relationships, leading to violent behavior towards the woman, especially if her partner is also using alcohol or drugs [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The pathways linking IPV and substance use are complex. In general, research supports a strong bidirectional relationship between these two morbidities [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Comorbid substance use increases risk of new episodes of violence for women with IPV [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Negative consequences of IPV such as substance use can, in turn, impede a woman’s ability to curtail future violence [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consistently, longitudinal studies have found that substance use is associated with new episodes of abuse in women with IPV [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, drug use is related to increased severity of physical partner victimization [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Given that cessation of violence is necessary for recovery from its traumatic effects, it seems imperative to address victimized women’s substance use difficulties. Such an intervention may improve women’s ability to effectively use resources to help break the cycle of violence and establish their and their children’s safety.</p>
              <p>There is consensus among experts that a critical time to provide substance use interventions for women with IPV is when they are seeking shelter services, because at these times women are open to changes in their lives and identities [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and most likely to recover from violence and from substance use [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A huge challenge for domestic violence shelters is that at current funding levels they cannot meet the overwhelming demand for services.</p>
              <p>Digital interventions including mHealth and eHealth, may hold a strong promise of reducing IPV victimization and may improve mental health symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, they are generally considered feasible and acceptable [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, computer-delivered interventions can be delivered without substantial investments of time or energy from staff. Other advantages of computer-based interventions are that they are potentially low-cost and scalable while maintaining fidelity across sites. Therefore, computer-delivered interventions for residents of domestic violence shelters with substance use problems can overcome existing obstacles to addressing substance use in domestic violence shelters, particularly time, training, and cost challenges.</p>
              <p>The current study presents findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a brief computerized intervention that addresses known barriers in early identification and intervention for residents of domestic violence shelters with substance use issues. The current study examines the feasibility and acceptability (<italic toggle="yes">primary</italic>) of this brief a computerized program and presents preliminary evidence of whether the computerized intervention leads to improvements in substance use (heavy drinking or drug using), increased utilization of substance use services (both treatment and self-help utilization), and reduction in IPV severity over a 6- month post-shelter period compared to an attention-time matched control condition.</p>

                <title>Participants, eligibility criteria, and settings</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from shelters in Rhode Island (n = 21), Ohio (n = 22) and Massachusetts (n = 7). Shelter staff informed research staff as new residents were admitted to the shelter. The research staff attended house meetings and scheduled times to be at the shelters when new residents were available and provided a description of the study. Shelter residents were recruited to participate in a computer-based survey to help women with IPV be healthy. Women who expressed interest were given the study information sheet. Women who showed interest in the study were screened for eligibility using the Computerized Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) software delivered on an easy to use, ultraportable Tablet PC in a 10-15-minute screener or a computer in a private setting. The screener included a brief series of questions about general health, exercise, and diet. All screened participants received a standard health information brochure with further information and resources on the health topics mentioned, including a list of local substance use treatment referrals and community resources. Those meeting full inclusion criteria were asked to provide signed informed consent and completed the computer-based baseline assessments. <xref rid="pone.0285560.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> presents the study flow chart.</p>

Participants were excluded if they were unable to provide informed consent (e.g., due to florid psychosis or other clear cognitive impairment), 2) who did not understand English 3) who did not endorse on the baseline Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) for substance use and/or intimate partner violence in the 3 months prior to shelter stay. Women who had a prescribed medical marijuana card were also excluded from the study (if medical use was the only use). All women received standard shelter services, which primarily included case management and crisis intervention.</p>

                <sec id="sec009">
                  <title>The computerized intervention</title>
                  <p>The intervention was a computer-based, brief intervention to reduce substance use among residents of domestic violence shelters with IPV. The intervention used a sophisticated intervention development tool, the CIAS which is highly interactive with immediate responses to most input, occasional summaries, branching based on participant characteristics, responses, or preferences, and empathic reflections. The intervention consisted of a 50-minute intervention on the Tablet PC and a 15-minute “booster” session on the Tablet PC two weeks after the 50-minute intervention session to reinforce the effects of the intervention. Both sessions took place in a private shelter setting while the participant was a resident of the shelter. The computer-based intervention and booster session were conducted in a private space at the domestic violence shelter during participants’ shelter stay. The intervention took place during participants’ shelter stay because women are more likely to initiate changes when they are in a supportive environment. In addition, digital interventions raise privacy and safety concerns for women who live with their abusive partner.</p>
                  <p>Motivational strategies such as reflective listening and tailored summaries and feedback were utilized to enhance participants’ motivation. The intervention presented personalized feedback from the baseline assessment. Next the intervention delivered psychoeducation about participant’s substance use and associated risks for the woman, including partner substance use; the bidirectional relationship between substance use and IPV; and risks of untreated substance use such as increased risk of IPV. The intervention was tailored based on the current substance use status of each participant (see <xref rid="pone.0285560.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The intervention contained language referring to either substance use in general (past or present behaviors and beliefs) or current substance use and does not assume current substance use. For women who stated that they have already quit (see “No” in <xref rid="pone.0285560.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), the focus was on how they can remain abstinent now and after they leave the shelter (Relapse Prevention). Women who endorsed current substance use were asked about their interest/readiness in quitting their substance use (“Ready to Quit?”) leading to a bifurcated treatment response such that those participants reporting a goal of immediate abstinence were moved more quickly to a section consistent with primary goalsetting for substance use reduction. This arm included components of a quit contract and assist the woman in identifying specific goals and a timeline for reaching these goals. These participants had the option to create a personalized Safety Plan on paper that included the specific goals that the women have identified and/or optionally, can enter their own change goals in free text. Some examples of goals include attending AA or NA, attending substance use treatment, speaking to shelter staff about coordinating substance use treatment, planning for support groups after leaving the shelter such as IPV support groups. For the remaining participants who reported not being ready to quit at this time, the narrator presented sections including pros and cons, feedback, and optional goal setting. The interventions ended with a motivational video.</p>

                  <p>Within two weeks of the intervention, women completed a 15-minute computerized booster session in which they review the relevant components of the intervention session for each woman (e.g., pros and cons, feedback, and goal setting) and their own personalized safety plan. The booster session aimed to bolster the effects of the intervention. Women were given the option to revise their personalized Safety Plan and were allowed to select from a menu of potential personal change goals.</p>

                  <p>Participants in the control condition also completed the same assessments. After randomization, participants in the control condition received a 50-minute session and a 15-minute booster session within two weeks after the initial session on the Tablet PC, which comprised of the viewing of popular entertainers/shows videos. This condition controlled for time spent on the computer-based intervention, maintain blinding of research assistants, and mimic the interactivity of the computer-based intervention condition. The control condition was conducted in a private space at the shelter during participants’ shelter stay.

                <title>Sample size and power analysis</title>
                <p>For this intervention development pilot project, assessment of feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and research procedures was the primary goal. Nonetheless, pilot data can be used to demonstrate whether the effects of treatment look promising across a set of outcome variables, and to suggest, in concert with results from larger scale clinical trials in related fields, the range of effect sizes that would be reasonable to expect in a future trial. As a result, the goal was to obtain estimates of the differences between treatment conditions with 95% confidence intervals and effect size estimates. The actual enrollment was 50 participants with an 88% retention rate (for an evaluable sample of n = 44).</p>
                <p>Given the sample size, the unadjusted effect size Cohen’s d = 0.86 was detectable in between-group comparisons with power of .80 at .05 level of significance in two-sided tests. In longitudinal analysis of two repeated measures adjusted for baseline, with correlations between pairs of repeated measures ranging from 0.1 to 0.6, the detectable adjusted effect sizes ranged from 0.57 to 0.66. If the observed effect size was smaller, statistical significance in between-group comparisons would not be reached, however statistical significance was not the goal of this pilot study. Sample size guidelines for treatment development projects [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] such as this one recommend 15 to 30 participants per cell to produce reasonable estimates of the effect sizes. The available sample sizes of 21 and 23 in each condition are within this recommendation. No interim analyses or stopping guidelines were planned in this small pilot trial.</p>

                  <p>All participants completed demographic information, including age, race, ethnicity, educational level, marital status and employment (status, # hours per week). <italic toggle="yes">The NIDA-Modified Alcohol</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Smoking</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Substance Involvement Screening Test (NIDA-Modified ASSIST</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used to assess for alcohol use, illegal drug use, and nonmedical prescription drug use in the past three months prior to shelter stay. After eligibility was confirmed, those who were considered at risk were categorized as an at-risk drinker and/or at moderate or high risk for substance use based on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] criteria for these risk categories. At screening, IPV in the past three months prior to shelter stay was assessed with the WAST [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The WAST is an 8-item instrument that measures physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and is consistent with the definition of IPV as defined by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>Our primary outcome was the percent of heavy drinking or drug using days in 3 month increments over the 6 months after leaving the shelter, assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB)-modified computer version [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], administered in person. Baseline TLFB assessment covered the 90 days prior to entering the shelter. For primary analysis, days using drugs and heavy drinking days were combined to create a single variable that reflected the total number of days that woman used drugs or had 4+ drinks. The TLFB has excellent reliability [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and is sensitive to change as used other studies [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Breath alcohol tests were conducted at each follow-up assessment (i.e., at the 3 months and 6 months periods) to ensure that the client had consumed no alcohol prior to the assessment (breath alcohol content &lt; .02). Assessments were rescheduled if the participant had been consuming alcohol.</p>

                  <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>Secondary outcomes included use of substance use services and IPV severity over a 6-month post-shelter period. The Treatment Services Review (TSR) [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was used to assess substance use services (both treatment and self-help utilization) received (including outpatient, day patient, residential treatment, NA, AA) to capture the extent to which women reached out to access recovery-related resources. At the 3 time points, the TSR was used to assess substance use services used in the 90 days prior to entering the shelter, since leaving the shelter, and since the last assessment, respectively. Because total days during each follow-up time point varied from participant to participant, days in the follow-up period was used as an offset in analyses predicting number of substance use treatment sessions attended.</p>
                  <p>Severity of IPV was assessed using several measures assessed for the 90 days prior to baseline and at each follow-up time point. The primary IPV severity measure was the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS). The CAS is a widely used self-report of behaviors scale with 4 subscales that measure severe, combined abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and harassment. The CAS has been published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compendium of intimate partner violence measures [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It consists of 30 items presented in a six-point format requiring respondents to answer “never”, “only once”, “several times”, “monthly”, “weekly” or “daily” in a twelve-month period [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It includes a victimization scale and a perpetrator scale. A woman’s adoption of safety behavior was evaluated using Safety Behavior Checklist (SBC) [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. SBC has 15 items that assess the use of strategies suggested to keep victim safe (e.g., hiding money and extra clothing). To measure another aspect of IPV, cyberstalking, a 6-item scale based on the prevailing literature on cyberstalking was administered. This cyberstalking measure assessed cyberstalking behaviors and was presented in the same 6-point format as the CAS.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>Feasibility and acceptability measures were examined descriptively. Unadjusted comparisons of outcomes at 3 and 6 months were performed using t-tests or non-parametric tests (i.e., the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for independent samples) for outcomes not approximately normally distributed, such as count-like variables (i.e., percent heavy drinking or drug using days, substance use services received per day). Adjusted analyses used longitudinal modeling for repeated measures of the outcomes (3 and 6 months) with study group as the independent variable and baseline value as a covariate. The technique for longitudinal modeling was generalized estimating equations with weighted estimation approach that allowed for data missing at random, so that all participants with at least one non-missing follow-up observation were included. The error distribution was chosen based on each outcome’s distribution: Normal (scale score; readiness and self-efficacy), or Negative Binomial for over-dispersed count outcomes (all other outcomes). In the Negative Binomial models, log link was used, and differences between logarithms of group means were evaluated. To facilitate the interpretation on the original measurement scale, the estimated of logarithms were then back transformed (exponentiated) to the original scale. As a result of exponentiation, the differences between logarithms of two group means corresponded to the ratios of exponentiated estimates of the means. We obtained 95% confidence intervals for the differences of group means or logarithms of the means along with effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for the differences between two groups.</p>

Differences seemed to be driven by differences at the 6 month follow-up (see <xref rid="pone.0285560.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Controlling for baseline values, analysis of the 15-item Safety Behavior Checklist (with higher scores reflecting better adoption of safety behaviors) and of Cyber-Stalking Scale scores over follow-up showed no differences between conditions (see <xref rid="pone.0285560.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, CAS Victimization, CAS Perpetration, and Cyber-Stalking Scale scores improved dramatically over time in both conditions. For example, median baseline CAS Victimization scores were over 50 in both conditions at baseline, and less than 10 across both follow ups in both conditions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a brief computerized intervention for residents of domestic violence shelters with substance use disorders who also report IPV in the past three months. Results suggested that a computerized intervention to improve SUD is feasible and acceptable among women with IPV and substance use problems at domestic violence shelters across 3 U.S. states (RI, MA and OH).</p>
              <p>Results support the feasibility and acceptability of the brief computerized intervention for women with SUD in domestic violence shelters. This was demonstrated by the high (80%) study completion rate and higher rates of client satisfaction with the intervention as measured by the CSQ-8-R. The high CIAS scale satisfaction scores also indicate the overall satisfaction with the program and engagement with the computerized intervention.</p>
              <p>Within the context of a small pilot trial which was designed to provide a preliminary test of the feasibility and acceptability of a new intervention, the main conclusions that can be drawn are about feasibility and acceptability. Any preliminary efficacy results should be interpreted with extreme caution. Individual variation for almost all outcomes was wide, and given small sample size, the resulting confidence intervals for the differences were very wide, nearly one baseline standard deviation in length (<xref rid="pone.0285560.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285560.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). In the negative binomial modeling shown in <xref rid="pone.0285560.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Cohen’s d was estimated based on the differences between estimated logarithms of the means. When the estimates of the logarithms were exponentiated, the width of resulting confidence intervals for the ratios of the means of two conditions was one to 4 times the magnitude of the ratio itself. As expected, due to its pilot nature, this pilot trial did not produce statistically significant differences in percent heavy drinking/drug using days between conditions. Point estimates favored the intervention condition for more substance use treatment received and readiness to reduce substance use. The study was not designed to provide statistical power to formally compare conditions; a subsequent fully-powered trial is the needed to provide definitive efficacy conclusions.</p>
              <p>In this pilot trial, we measured IPV severity in the domains of victimization, perpetration, cyberstalking and safety behavior, there were large decreases in IPV severity over time in both conditions. However, effect sizes tended to favor the control condition for IPV severity. This finding (where IPV variables declined overall regardless of the intervention status and in some cases trended in favor of the control condition) is consistent with what was reported by other brief safety interventions for women with history of IPV and SUD [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A modification of the intervention might be required in the future to enhance its impact on IPV variables. Given that all participants were in a shelter, participants in both groups had an overall lower risk of severe IPV. It is also possible that the dose received of the computerized intervention was much smaller than the other (shelter-based) services women were receiving.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This study followed a rigorous design, used validated measures and a robust/randomized approach to testing the feasibility and acceptability of a brief computerized intervention to reduce SUD in women with IPV. The goal of this study was to establish feasibility and acceptability of the computerized intervention. Therefore, it was not powered for effectiveness outcomes, and effectiveness results should be interpreted with caution [<xref rid="pone.0285560.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Moreover, the use of self-reports, assessment reactivity and effect on measured outcomes, the inclusion of only English-speaking participants are also limitations of this study.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Computerized intervention to improve SUD is feasible and acceptable among women with IPV with substance use disorders at domestic violence shelters across 3 states. Further effectiveness testing in a larger sample is needed.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript presents data analysis from a randomized pilot study on computer-based ntervention to reduce alcohol and drug use among women with IPV. The topic is of importance, the study was registered as a RCT with a valid NCT number, and was approved by the respective IRB/Ethics Committee. While the study objectives sound interesting, is important, and on target, some shortcomings were observed, in regards to abiding by the CONSORT guidelines for conducting and reporting results of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Some other (statistical) comments were also provided.</p>
              <p>1. Methods:</p>
              <p>Methods reporting need some work. An orderly manner is suggested, following CONSORT guidelines, without repeating information, such as Trial Design, Participant Eligibility Crtieria and settings, Interventions, Outcomes, sample size/power considerations, Interim analysis and stopping rules, Randomization (details on random number generation, allocation concealment, implementation), Blinding issues, etc, should be mentioned. The authors are advised to create separate subsections for each of the possible topics (whichever necessary), and that way produce a very clear writeup. I see the Authors indeed made an attempt; however, they are advised to write it carefully, following nice examples in the manuscript below:</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>Specific comments:</p>
              <p>(a) For instance, the randomization and allocation concealment should be made very clear (they are NOT the same thing); the trial staff recruiting patients should NOT have the randomization list. Randomization should be prepared by the trial statistician, and he/she would not participate in the recruiting.</p>
              <p>(b) The manuscript does not provide details on the randomization procedure; it just states as a "standard" procedure. Provide more details. Why was block randomization (BR) used? If not, any specific reason, why? This is because BR is often recommended in clinical studies/trials to ensure a balance in sample size across groups over time.</p>

              </p>
              <p>(c) Sample size/power: A sample size/power statement is still required even in a randomized pilot trial; see</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435612002740" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435612002740</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>It's better if that is provided, utilizing the primary response, acceptable effect size, and at 90%, or 95%. Even pilot trials need to be conducted with some ballpark number. It should also be described in a separate sub-section.</p>
              <p>(d) Statistical Analysis: Based on the (longitudinal) design of the study, the authors justifiably conducted a mixed linear model analysis. Who were the underlying Gaussian assumptions (of the random effect &amp; error) assessed? Furthermore, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) would also be adequate; any reason why that was not conducted? (I am not asking authors to do it).</p>
              <p>2. Results &amp; Conclusions:</p>
              <p>(a) The authors should check that any statement of significance should be followed by a p-value in the entire Results section. Otherwise, the Results section look OK.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The study is addressing two important public health challenges in women's health, IPV and substance use. The use of technology based interventions in the domestic violence shelter is justified given the multiple needs and overburdened staff. However, the manuscript would be strengthened with more details on the intervention (screen shots), details on the content related to substance use, given there may be use of multiple substances, etc. For example, what skills building, etc. are the focus for behavioral change? Does the intervention provide the user with specific local referrals to service organizations in the community, what is the link between the intervention content and increase daily substance abuse treatment use? The intervention describes a personalized safety plan, does this mean that the safety plan includes strategies to seek treatment or discussing substance use with counselors for example? Are advocates/case managers in the shelter trained on the intervention, would be likely that a participant would discus the information provided for behavior change and/or discuss/review personalized safety plan with an advocate, how was the advocate involvement in supporting participant taking into consideration when examining the implications of the findings? More detail on the choice of control condition is needed, as it appears the control condition is not related to behavioral change but rather on time that equal intervention group. All the women are in shelter, it would be interested to understand what other services they are receiving during the stay that may also influence findings, such as case management, legal support, child care, employment assistance, substance abuse treatment referrals, etc. More discussion is needed related to increase in self-efficacy in control group. Further, more discussion is needed related to the findings on IPV, it appears that IPV perpetration over time has a pattern towards significance with intervention group reporting more perpetration than control group, and control condition appears to have greater reduction in IPV victimization, cyberbullying and perpetration than intervention, although not significant - it would be interested in more discussion about these findings given IPV severity is stated outcome. Further, would be useful to report that participants in control condition used more safety strategies than intervention, this may not matter as use does not indicate that strategy was helpful/useful, so think need more discussion of these findings and how they inform future versions of the intervention. For example, the lower use of strategies by intervention group may be related to the personalized strategies so intervention participants did not need to use more strategies.</p>
              <p>I do think detailing a framework for feasibility/acceptability testing would be useful, what was the measure used for acceptability for the intervention? I would recommend a table of the feasibility/acceptability, outcome and mediator measures used for study, would make it easier to read and follow. More information on human subjects protections given that many shelters do not allow women to use substance, what strategies were used if a woman was active user?</p>
              <p>The study did not detail limitations, small non generalizable sample from 3 different shelters, no race/ethnic difference assessed related to substance use, IPV severity, etc. No discussion of reasons why control group had significantly improved self-efficacy? Although the intervention was reviewed as feasible, there was little indication that the intervention would be effective given the outcomes of reduce substance use, IPV severity and self-efficacy, what additional work, like qualitative interviews, etc will need to be done to revise the intervention to meet the needs of survivors?</p>

              <p>Dear Editor,</p>
              <p>On behalf of the coauthors and myself, I would like to submit our revised manuscript titled “Computer-based intervention for residents of domestic violence shelters with substance use: A randomized pilot study” to be considered for publication. We thank the reviewers and the editor for the extensive feedback that has strengthened our manuscript. </p>
              <p>We have thoroughly addressed the concerns raised by the editor and the reviewers. Below are the point-by-point responses to the concerns along with a specific reference to changes made within the manuscript. In this revision, we have also invited in a co-author who is statistician who assisted in the reanalysis of the data. </p>
              <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript presents data analysis from a randomized pilot study on computer-based intervention to reduce alcohol and drug use among women with IPV. The topic is of importance, the study was registered as a RCT with a valid NCT number, and was approved by the respective IRB/Ethics Committee. While the study objectives sound interesting, is important, and on target, some shortcomings were observed, in regards to abiding by the CONSORT guidelines for conducting and reporting results of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Some other (statistical) comments were also provided.</p>
              <p>1. Methods:</p>
              <p>Methods reporting need some work. An orderly manner is suggested, following CONSORT guidelines, without repeating information, such as Trial Design, Participant Eligibility Criteria and settings, Interventions, Outcomes, sample size/power considerations, Interim analysis and stopping rules, Randomization (details on random number generation, allocation concealment, implementation), Blinding issues, etc, should be mentioned. The authors are advised to create separate subsections for each of the possible topics (whichever necessary), and that way produce a very clear writeup. I see the Authors indeed made an attempt; however, they are advised to write it carefully, following nice examples in the manuscript below:</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>Response: We reorganized the section based on the example provided. Please see highlighted titles in pages 5-9. </p>
              <p>Specific comments:</p>
              <p>(a) For instance, the randomization and allocation concealment should be made very clear (they are NOT the same thing); the trial staff recruiting patients should NOT have the randomization list. Randomization should be prepared by the trial statistician, and he/she would not participate in the recruiting.</p>
              <p>Response: Randomization was conducted within the computer program in real time. Because randomization and both intervention conditions were computer delivered, research staff stayed blind to intervention condition throughout the study. We have now clarified this section and also added a separate section on blinding as suggested. Please see page 8 lines 187-190 and page 9, lines 210-216.</p>
              <p>(b) The manuscript does not provide details on the randomization procedure; it just states as a "standard" procedure. Provide more details. Why was block randomization (BR) used? If not, any specific reason, why? This is because BR is often recommended in clinical studies/trials to ensure a balance in sample size across groups over time.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Response: The article did not mention block randomization. As noted above, we have added clarification and reorganized the section based on the example provided above. Please see the pages mentioned above. </p>
              <p>(c) Sample size/power: A sample size/power statement is still required even in a randomized pilot trial; see</p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>It's better if that is provided, utilizing the primary response, acceptable effect size, and at 90%, or 95%. Even pilot trials need to be conducted with some ballpark number. It should also be described in a separate sub-section.</p>
              <p>Response: This has been added. Please see page 13, lines 294-305. </p>
              <p>(d) Statistical Analysis: Based on the (longitudinal) design of the study, the authors justifiably conducted a mixed linear model analysis. Who were the underlying Gaussian assumptions (of the random effect &amp; error) assessed? Furthermore, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) would also be adequate; any reason why that was not conducted? (I am not asking authors to do it).</p>
              <p>Response: The reviewer is correct. We have re-analyzed the data with models more appropriate to the very skewed and zero-inflated nature of most of the dependent variables in the study. The manuscript has been revised accordingly. Please see the description in the methods section page 13, lines 294-305 and the revisions reflected throughout the manuscript including the tables. </p>
              <p>2. Results &amp; Conclusions:</p>
              <p>(a) The authors should check that any statement of significance should be followed by a p-value in the entire Results section. Otherwise, the Results section look OK.</p>
              <p>Response: we have added p-values as suggested. Please see tables 2 and 3. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The study is addressing two important public health challenges in women's health, IPV and substance use. The use of technology-based interventions in the domestic violence shelter is justified given the multiple needs and overburdened staff. However, the manuscript would be strengthened with more details on the intervention (screen shots), details on the content related to substance use, given there may be use of multiple substances, etc. For example, what skills building, etc. are the focus for behavioral change? </p>
              <p>Response: unfortunately, we no longer have access to make screenshots of the intervention. However, we have described the intervention in this paper to explain its key components. Please see pages 6 and 7. </p>
              <p>Does the intervention provide the user with specific local referrals to service organizations in the community, what is the link between the intervention content and increase daily substance abuse treatment use? </p>
              <p>Response: the intervention did not provide referrals to local organizations. However, safety monitoring was conducted at each assessment session to identify and promptly refer those who might need additional services, regardless of their intervention status. Those who reported IPV or other safety concerns were referred to additional services. In the revised analysis, there is no longer a link between the computerized intervention and use of substance use treatment services. </p>
              <p>The intervention describes a personalized safety plan, does this mean that the safety plan includes strategies to seek treatment or discussing substance use with counselors for example? </p>
              <p>Response: the intervention offered participants the option to create a personalized Safety Plan that included specific goals and strategies for change that were part of the content of the intervention. We have added this detail in the intervention description. Please see page 7, lines 169-174. </p>
              <p>Are advocates/case managers in the shelter trained on the intervention, would be likely that a participant would discuss the information provided for behavior change and/or discuss/review personalized safety plan with an advocate, how was the advocate involvement in supporting participant taking into consideration when examining the implications of the findings? </p>
              <p>Response: The intervention did not involve shelter staff. Participants completed the intervention on their own in a private office at the shelter. </p>
              <p>More detail on the choice of control condition is needed, as it appears the control condition is not related to behavioral change but rather on time that equal intervention group. All the women are in shelter, it would be interested to understand what other services they are receiving during the stay that may also influence findings, such as case management, legal support, child care, employment assistance, substance abuse treatment referrals, etc. More discussion is needed related to increase in self-efficacy in control group.</p>
              <p>Response: the control condition controlled for time spent on the computer-based intervention, maintain blinding of research assistants, and mimic the interactivity of the computer-based intervention condition[1]. Throughout the study, participants received other standard services they are eligible for regardless of their intervention condition. We have included this detail in the manuscript. Please see page 8 lines 187-192. </p>
              <p> Further, more discussion is needed related to the findings on IPV, it appears that IPV perpetration over time has a pattern towards significance with intervention group reporting more perpetration than control group, and control condition appears to have greater reduction in IPV victimization, cyberbullying and perpetration than intervention, although not significant - it would be interested in more discussion about these findings given IPV severity is stated outcome. </p>
              <p>Response: we did not propose IPV outcomes as main outcomes because this was a feasibility and acceptability study with a small sample size. Results can be swayed a lot by one or two people due to the study being under powered. The intervention focused on their drug use, as they were already receiving services targeting their IPV. </p>
              <p>Further, would be useful to report that participants in control condition used more safety strategies than intervention, this may not matter as use does not indicate that strategy was helpful/useful, so think need more discussion of these findings and how they inform future versions of the intervention. For example, the lower use of strategies by intervention group may be related to the personalized strategies so intervention participants did not need to use more strategies.</p>
              <p>Response: these findings are exploratory, from a small sample size, hence, may be difficult to explain them further. We have added a paragraph in the discussion section clarifying this. Please see page 21, lines 420-426.</p>
              <p>I do think detailing a framework for feasibility/acceptability testing would be useful, what was the measure used for acceptability for the intervention? I would recommend a table of the feasibility/acceptability, outcome and mediator measures used for study, would make it easier to read and follow. </p>
              <p>Response: results related to feasibility and acceptability of the computerized intervention are presented in table 2 and pages 16-17. </p>
              <p>More information on human subjects protections given that many shelters do not allow women to use substance, what strategies were used if a woman was active user?</p>
              <p>Response: This is seldom the case anymore. Use of substances does not lead to discharge from most shelters currently. We have submitted the IRB protocol with details on human subjects protections as a supplemental file. </p>
              <p>The study did not detail limitations, small non generalizable sample from 3 different shelters, no race/ethnic difference assessed related to substance use, IPV severity, etc. No discussion of reasons why control group had significantly improved self-efficacy? </p>
              <p>Response: we have expanded the limitations section. The goal of this study was to establish feasibility and acceptability of the computerized intervention. Therefore, it was not powered for effectiveness outcomes, and effectiveness results should be interpreted with caution. We have included this statement in the limitations of the paper. Furthermore, the self-efficacy finding was no longer statistically significant on re-analysis. Please see page 21, lines 420-426. </p>
              <p>Although the intervention was reviewed as feasible, there was little indication that the intervention would be effective given the outcomes of reduce substance use, IPV severity and self-efficacy, what additional work, like qualitative interviews, etc will need to be done to revise the intervention to meet the needs of survivors?</p>
              <p>Response: Evaluating the effectiveness was not the goal of this study; feasibility and acceptability was the goal of this study. This study is underpowered to show changes in those outcomes. A future effectiveness study with a large sample size is needed. </p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
