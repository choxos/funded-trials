                  <title>Introduction:</title>
                  <p>Anxiety and dyspnea are 2 common symptoms for lung cancer survivors. Although
research suggests decreasing respiration rate can reduce anxiety in several
populations, potential benefits of device-guided breathing have not been
studied in lung cancer survivors. This feasibility study (WF-01213) provides
estimates of accrual, adherence, retention, and preliminary efficacy of 2
doses of a device-guided breathing intervention versus a usual breathing
control group for improving self-reported anxiety and dyspnea in
post-treatment lung cancer survivors.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Stage I-IV lung cancer survivors were recruited through the NCI Community
Oncology Research Program (NCORP) and randomized to 12 weeks of a
device-guided breathing intervention (high dose vs. low dose) or control
device. Self-reported outcomes (anxiety, depression, dyspnea, cancer-related
worry, fatigue) were assessed at baseline, mid-intervention (Week-6), and
post-intervention (Week-12).</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Forty-six participants (ages 41-77, median = 65; 78% White) were randomized
to the high-dose intervention (n = 14), low-dose intervention (n = 14), or
control (n = 18) groups between July 2015 and September 2019. Study accrual
rate was 0.92 per month for 50 months (projected accrual was 6.3/month).
Fourteen participants (30%) withdrew early from the study, with almost half
of those discontinuing at or immediately following baseline assessment. No
participants were adherent with the intervention per protocol
specifications. The proportion minimally adherent (using device at least
1x/week) was 43% (6/14), 64% (9/14), and 61% (11/18) for high-dose,
low-dose, and control groups, respectively. Anxiety significantly decreased
from baseline for all groups at Week 12. Adherence to the intervention was
low across all treatment groups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>This study did not establish feasibility of a community-based randomized
trial of 2 doses of device-guided breathing and a control group using an
identical-looking device for lung cancer survivors. In both the high-dose
and control groups, there were significant improvements from baseline for
anxiety and dyspnea. In the low-dose group, there were significant
improvements from baseline for anxiety and depression. Ratings and feedback
on the intervention were mixed (although leaned in a positive direction).
Participants reported liking the feeling of relaxation/calm, helping others,
breathing awareness, and music. Participants reporting liking least
finding/making time to use the device, frustration with the device, and
completing study forms.</p>

              <p>Breathing interventions have been effective at reducing anxiety and distress in
several populations. Interventions focused on slow, deep breathing have decreased
anxiety, stress symptoms, and physiological arousal in various groups including
healthy adults, adults with elevated anxiety, and adults with chronic physical
health issues (eg, chronic pain, cardiac disorders).<sup><xref rid="bibr35-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="bibr36-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr37-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr38-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr39-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Relaxation training

              <p>The present study sought to build on growing evidence for the efficacy of breathing
interventions in cancer survivors through the use of the RESPeRATE device, which
guides the user to reduce respiration rate and increase exhalation time.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> RESPeRATE has FDA approval as an adjunctive treatment for hypertension.
Positive outcomes, including improved cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life,
have been observed in heart failure patients, particularly in groups receiving
longer treatment and in participants who were successful at increasing their
inhalation/exhalation ratio (deemed “responders”).<sup><xref rid="bibr47-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> However, these studies did

Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base (1UG1CA189824), a national network
designed to increase community participation in cancer trials. This feasibility
study aimed: (1) to estimate accrual, retention, and adherence to a device-guided
breathing intervention versus a usual breathing control group in lung cancer
survivors; and (2) to obtain intervention feedback and preliminary estimates of the
variability and efficacy of 2 doses of a device-guided breathing intervention for
reducing anxiety and improving dyspnea, cancer-related worry, and fatigue in lung
cancer survivors.</p>

meetings or site calls as needed. Detailed instructions were given to each site
coordinator on how to use the device, how to view and record the values saved on

addition to bi-monthly site calls. At the baseline visit, the site coordinator
provided a demonstration on how to use the device and assist the participant

mid-section to reduce breaths per minute by prolonging exhalation (device
pictured at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.resperate.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.resperate.com</ext-link>). Respiration rate is reduced by asking the
person to breathe in conjunction with the gentle tones audible through
earphones; the rate of the tones starts at the person’s initial respiration rate
and then gradually slows down. For the low-dose group, participants were

randomized to the low-dose group, and 18 to the control group (<xref rid="fig1-15347354231164406" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <xref rid="table1-15347354231164406" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes
baseline characteristics of the sample. Ages ranged from 41 to 77 (median = 65)
years. The majority were White (78%), non-Hispanic (100%), married (63%), and
non-smokers (78%). Slightly half of the participants (56%) were stage III or IV
lung cancer survivors, and most had an ECOG status of 0 or 1 (89%). There were
no significant group differences across any demographic or clinical
characteristics.</p>

                  <p>Protocol specified adherence was calculated as the actual number of times the
device was used divided by the prescribed times with successful adherence
defined as completing ≥75% of prescribed sessions. No participants in any
group had successful adherence with the intervention. Minimally adherent was
defined by reaching specified breathing parameters at least once a week for
5 out of 6-week intervals or 9 out of the 12-week total study intervention.
The low-dose group had the largest proportion of adherent participants
(12/14; 86%) for Weeks 1 to 6. The high-dose group had the lowest proportion
adherent (7/14; 50%). During Weeks 7 to 12, no participant met the
pre-defined minimally adherent definition regardless of randomized group.
Across all weeks, the low-dose had the highest proportion of minimally
adherent participants (9/14; 64%). The proportions in the high-dose and
control groups were 43% (6/14) and 61% (11/18), respectively. There was no

                <p>On all rated items, more than 47% of participants in all groups provided
favorable ratings of “quite a bit” or “very much.” Unfavorable (“not at all”/“a
little bit”) participant ratings were rare and comparable between groups with
all rated items receiving &lt;28% negative ratings. Participants in the high and
low dose intervention groups were less likely to report favorable ratings than
control participants for “I liked using the breathing device.” (25%, 25%, and
50%, respectively), but more likely to report favorable ratings for “Using the
breathing device was enjoyable” (62.5%, 62.5%, and 35.7%, respectively).
Responses to open-ended feedback questions are summarized in <xref rid="table5-15347354231164406" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The most
common responses for what participants liked best were the feeling of
relaxation/calm, helping others, breathing awareness, and music. The most common
responses for what they liked least were finding/making time to use the device,
frustration with the device, and completing study forms. The responses re:
frustration with the device included comments about the elastic belt that needed
to be positioned around the abdomen, having to “hook everything up” to use it,
and having to reposition the sensor due to the “touchiness” of the device.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study did not establish feasibility of a community-based randomized trial of 2
doses of device-guided breathing and a control group (using an identical-looking
device) for lung cancer survivors. The accrual target was 60 participants; this
study accrued 46 participants over a nearly 4-year period (0.92 participants/month).
Despite a large research network, it was very challenging to accrue participants to
this study. Estimates from study sites suggested that they anticipated being able to
enroll at least 1 participant every 1 to 2 months. To be conservative, our accrual
target was at the low end of this estimate (6/month). Coordinators reported that it
was difficult to identify lung cancer survivors who likely met screening criteria.
Several eligibility criteria are not easily queried from the electronic medical
record (eg, completion of treatment, no evidence of or stable disease, clinically
significant distress), which made chart screening laborious. Identifying cancer
survivors with clinically meaningful symptoms for intervention research is also
challenging in the absence of routine patient-reported outcome monitoring.</p>
              <p>We also saw difficulties with adherence and retention; 30% of participants withdrew
from the study early. There were no participants who used the device at a rate that
would be considered adherent as defined in the protocol (using the device ≥75% of
the prescribed sessions). Minimal adherence defined as reaching specified breathing
parameters at least once a week for 9 of 12 weeks, was limited at 43%, 64%, and 65%
of participants for high-dose, low-dose, and control groups, respectively. Data from
the device proved difficult to interpret. The bottom line is that adherence was
quite poor. Similarly, another study intervening on caregivers of allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, showed that only 16% of caregivers had
consistent weekly use of the RESPeRATE device throughout the intervention phase.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The impact of the intervention arms on patient-reported outcomes was mixed. We
observed decreases in anxiety for all 3 groups at Week 12, suggesting a lack of
specific treatment effects. Improvements in dyspnea, worry, fatigue, and VAS
emotional distress appeared to favor the high-dose group compared to the low-dose
and control groups. Intervention feedback was also mixed, yet trended toward more
positive than negative feedback. Approximately half of participants in all groups
provided favorable ratings of their randomly assigned intervention. Clearly, many
participants (per their ratings and comments) found the intervention useful, yet a
substantial minority did not. Interestingly, despite the adherence challenges, many
of the comments were quite positive. Observationally, if participants used the
device, many of them really liked it. It is possible that pre-intervention
behavioral session(s) providing more guidance about using the device and identifying
facilitators/barriers to its use would be immensely helpful.</p>
              <p>A strength of this randomized feasibility study is inclusion of a control group that
offered an inactive intervention using a device that looked identical to the actual
intervention devices and blinding of study staff who collected outcomes data to
group assignment. A primary limitation of this study is the small sample size and
great difficulty with recruitment. As a feasibility study, it lacked power to make
definitive conclusions about intervention efficacy for lung cancer survivors.
Another limitation is the lack of a usual-care control group. The control device
also encouraged participants to sit quietly and focus on their breathing and thus
may have had some active effects. Including such a group in future research would
help to determine whether the interventions prevented an exacerbation of symptoms
and to estimate non-specific intervention effects. The relatively low rates of
device use across the 3 study groups also make it challenging to interpret the
findings, especially between the high- and low-dose groups. Additionally, we did not
collect comorbidity data as part of this protocol so cannot speak to how many had
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the cohort, which could also
contribute to dyspnea and fatigue. Importantly, accrual for this study largely
happened prior to widespread uptake of immunotherapy.</p>
              <p>Future research should carefully consider strategies for identifying potentially
eligible cancer survivors that minimize burden on research staff and referring
providers. Future studies may also consider expanding eligibility criteria to which
this approach may also be beneficial (eg, lung cancer patients undergoing active
treatment). Additional strategies to support cancer survivors in using the RESPERATE
device successfully are likely needed. A stronger supportive component might include
helping participants plan when and how to use the device, discussing potential
barriers to using it, and offering a designated person “on call” to assist with
device difficulties so participants can address any frustrations in real time.
Additionally, creative strategies to boost interest and engagement in the device may
include developing introductory materials (eg, brief video) that incorporates
positive testimonials from other lung cancer survivors who have benefited from the
device or sending brief text reminders to use the device. Further, incorporating
feedback from patient stakeholders into the design and conduct of future studies
would be extremely helpful to address issues with recruitment and adherence. It may
also be important to compare various deep breathing strategies (device vs recorded
instruction) to compare acceptability. Also, ensuring that there is a
straightforward way to reliably capture adherence data is critical. There was much
interest in this study and use of the devices from oncology clinicians, some of whom
suggested that targeting other types of cancer survivors would likely yield much
greater feasibility.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The mixed feedback on the device-guided breathing intervention, low adherence to
prescribed sessions, and modest enrollment rates of eligible lung cancer survivors
(61%) suggest a lack of fit of the device-guided breathing intervention with the
lung cancer survivor population. The lung cancer survivors enrolled in this trial
likely had more distress and overall emotional and physical symptoms compared with
the patients with hypertension enrolled on prior RESPERATE trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><xref rid="bibr47-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr48-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr49-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr50-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr51-15347354231164406" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> While the trial did not reach
pre-specified feasibility metrics, it is possible that more intensive efforts to
support lung cancer survivors in successfully using the device and overcoming
schedule and other barriers might improve adherence, retention, and intervention
feedback. It is not known whether an enhanced intervention might prove to be more
successful in a different population of cancer survivors.</p>
