                  <title>Background and Objectives</title>
                  <p>The central vein sign (CVS), a central linear hypointensity within lesions on T2*-weighted imaging, has been established as a sensitive and specific biomarker for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the CVS has not yet been comprehensively studied in newly developing MS lesions. We aimed to identify the CVS profiles of new white matter lesions in patients with MS followed over time and investigate demographic and clinical risk factors associated with new CVS+ or CVS− lesion development.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this retrospective longitudinal cohort study, adults from the NIH MS Natural History Study were considered for inclusion. Participants with new T2 or enhancing lesions were identified through review of the radiology report and/or longitudinal subtraction imaging. Each new lesion was evaluated for the CVS. Clinical characteristics were identified through chart review.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 153 adults (95 relapsing-remitting MS, 27 secondary progressive MS, 16 primary progressive MS, 5 clinically isolated syndrome, and 10 healthy; 67% female) were included. Of this cohort, 96 had at least 1 new T2 or contrast-enhancing lesion during median 3.1 years (Q1–Q3: 0.7–6.3) of follow-up; lesions eligible for CVS evaluation were found in 62 (65%). Of 233 new CVS-eligible lesions, 159 (68%) were CVS+, with 30 (48%) individuals having only CVS+, 12 (19%) only CVS−, and 20 (32%) both CVS+ and CVS− lesions. In gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, the CVS+ percentage increased from 102/152 (67%) at the first time point where the lesion was observed, to 92/114 (82%) after a median follow-up of 2.8 years. Younger age (OR = 0.5 per 10-year increase, 95% CI = 0.3–0.8) and higher CVS+ percentage at baseline (OR = 1.4 per 10% increase, 95% CI = 1.1–1.9) were associated with increased likelihood of new CVS+ lesion development.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>In a cohort of adults with MS followed over a median duration of 3 years, most newly developing T2 or enhancing lesions were CVS+ (68%), and nearly half (48%) developed new CVS+ lesions only. Importantly, the effects of edema and T2 signal changes can obscure small veins in Gd+ lesions; therefore, caution and follow-up is necessary when determining their CVS status.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic CNS disease, characterized by inflammatory demyelination and neuroaxonal loss.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The clinical diagnosis of MS currently relies on MRI to demonstrate evidence of lesion dissemination in space and time.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> MRI is key to the determination of inflammatory disease activity, manifested by an increasing quantity of T2 and/or gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) white matter lesions. An increasing lesion load is associated with worsening disability progression and treatment failure in patients treated with disease-modifying therapy (DMT).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Despite the importance of monitoring lesion load in patients with MS, a variety of etiologies can contribute to the appearance of T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense lesions on brain MRI that can mimic MS lesions, such as small vessel disease, migraine, inflammatory vasculopathies, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Increased prevalence of vascular risk factors in patients with MS has been well established in the literature, along with corresponding increased lesion burden and more advanced brain atrophy compared with healthy controls (HC).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Similarly, it is not uncommon to observe confounding etiologies of new white matter lesion development, such as migraine or cerebral small vessel disease, in radiologically active patients with MS in clinical practice. Therefore, devising improved methods of differentiating new inflammatory demyelinating MS lesions from lesions due to comorbid small vessel disease or migraine is of high clinical value. Understanding the lesion etiology has important ramifications for determining the need for DMT escalation, as this might be indicated in patients demonstrating breakthrough MS disease activity but not in patients with new non-MS white matter lesion development.</p>
            <p>The central vein sign (CVS) is a central linear hypointensity within lesions, visualized on susceptibility-sensitive MRI sequences (such as T2*-weighted scans) and corresponding to the small vein or venule around which the lesion formed.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The CVS has been proposed as a radiologic biomarker and is seen with high frequency in MS lesions,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> such that it can effectively differentiate MS from other etiologies associated with nonspecific white matter lesions.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, whereas the CVS has shown promise in aiding the initial diagnosis of MS based on the evaluation of established lesions, the CVS characteristics of newly appearing T2/FLAIR or Gd+ lesions in MS have not been comprehensively described. In this study, we sought to (1) investigate CVS characteristics of newly developing lesions in MS cases and HCs followed longitudinally; (2) study their relationship with clinical and radiologic measures of disease burden; and (3) describe the frequency of associated DMT changes seen retrospectively in this cohort.</p>

                <p>To allow for lesion review and CVS rating at the submillimeter isotropic resolution of the acquired T2*-weighted images, we upsampled the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 and International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) nonlinear symmetric millimetric atlas template (<ext-link xlink:href="http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?p=904" ext-link-type="uri">nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?p=904</ext-link>) to the resolution of the T2*-weighted images. Subsequently, the baseline and follow-up T2*-weighted, T1-MP(2)RAGE, and FLAIR images for all included cases were rigidly registered to the upsampled MNI-ICBM brain template at T2*-weighted image resolution.

The CVS+ percentage of previously Gd+ lesions increased to 82% (92/114) at time points after gadolinium enhancement had resolved, which on visual inspection appeared to be driven in most cases by improvement in the extent of edema and accompanying T2 hyperintense signal changes obscuring small vessels within these lesions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2, C and D</xref>).</p>

                <title>Risk Factors for CVS-Stratified New Lesion Formation</title>
                <p>Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed several notable variables associated with modulation of the risk of CVS+ and/or CVS− development over time. The likelihood of CVS+ lesion development increased with younger age (OR = 0.5 per 10-year increase in age, 95% CI = 0.3–0.8) and higher baseline CVS+ percentage (OR = 1.5 per 10% increase in baseline CVS+ percentage, 95% CI = 1.1–1.9), adjusting for sex, race, T2*-weighted gadolinium status, and follow-up duration (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Sex, race, and MS disease subtype were not associated with risk of CVS+ lesion development (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Although there was a relationship between the odds of any new CVS− lesion formation and younger age at study inclusion (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2–0.8), this association appeared to be driven by the cases who developed both CVS+ and CVS− lesions over time and was not present in a sensitivity analysis of cases who formed new CVS− lesions only (OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.4–1.6; eTable 3, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXI/A678" ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds">links.lww.com/NXI/A678</ext-link>). An increased size of newly developing lesions was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of being CVS+ (OR 1.07 per each 10 mm<sup>3</sup> increase in lesion volume, 95% CI 1.0–1.1). In addition, new juxta/leukocortical lesions had a lower OR of CVS+ status compared with subcortical/deep WM or periventricular lesions after adjusting for lesion size (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2–0.8, eTable 1).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We characterized the CVS profile of new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing lesions in adults followed longitudinally in a single-center natural history study of MS. As expected, individuals who developed new lesions were younger and more likely to have RRMS. Furthermore, new lesions were more frequent in African Americans, consistent with prior reports describing a more active MS disease course in this cohort.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Of the new lesions that were eligible for CVS analysis, 68% were CVS+, which is in line with the overall rates of cross-sectional baseline CVS+ percentage previously described in MS, illustrating how these percentages evolve from the accumulation of new, primarily CVS+, lesions over time.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In contrast, neurologically normal HC with nonspecific T2/FLAIR hyperintensities on baseline MRI were less likely to form new lesions over time compared to MS cases; in the 2 HC who formed new lesions, both lesions were CVS−, consistent with their lower baseline CVS+ percentage.</p>
              <p>The CVS has been proposed as a sensitive and specific radiologic biomarker for the diagnosis of MS. Previous cross-sectional studies have described thresholds based on the percentage of CVS+ lesions obtained cross-sectionally, such as the 40% rule, as a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for the diagnosis of MS.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Our results build on this by showing that a higher baseline CVS+ percentage is indeed predictive of the risk of developing new CVS+ lesions over time at the cohort level. This finding suggests the presence of patient-level factors associated with a higher propensity for formation of perivenular lesions over time or perhaps prominent overall venular conspicuity. A corollary is that in patients with a high CVS+ percentage, the development of a new CVS− lesion should be considered as an outlier event and a flag to investigate potential coexistence of other etiologies associated with T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion development. This is particularly important if a change in DMT is being considered based on radiologic disease breakthrough. In fact, our results show that whereas DMT switches after new lesion formation did not differ between the groups with vs without new lesions, the most common reason cited for DMT change in individuals with only CVS+ and both types of lesions was breakthrough disease activity. This contrasts with the group with no new lesions, in which adverse reactions were more commonly listed (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Although DMT switch rates in this study were determined retrospectively and thus clinicians were unaware of the CVS status of new lesions at the time of DMT switch, this analysis provides an interesting opportunity for future prospective studies to investigate the impact of DMT change or escalation on the likelihood of new CVS+ or CVS− lesion formation longitudinally in patients with active MS.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shed light on the association between cardiovascular risk factors and increased lesion burden in MS.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Although a clear pathogenic process has not been identified, recent studies have suggested that vascular risk factors worsen MS disease severity, possibly due to their proinflammatory effects.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, vascular risk factors are also associated with a higher risk of cerebral small vessel disease, which in turn could increase the risk of developing predominantly CVS− T2/FLAIR hyperintensities on MRI.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Recently, a cross-sectional retrospective analysis noted that older age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated cross-sectionally with a lower percentage of CVS+ lesions in MS.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Extending on this prior work, increasing age in this study was associated with a lower likelihood of developing new CVS+ lesions longitudinally. There were no associations between other vascular risk factors and risk of new CVS+ or CVS− lesion development, except for diabetes being more frequent in those with only new CVS+ lesions, but this effect lost significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Of interest, newly developing juxta/leukocortical lesions in this study had a lower OR of CVS+ compared with subcortical or periventricular lesions, which is in line with previous studies demonstrating a lower CVS percentage within juxtacortical lesions vs periventricular and deep white matter lesions cross-sectionally.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Whether this result has a radiological (poorer visibility of juxtacortical veins) or biological (different mechanism of lesion formation) explanation is uncertain, but we favor the former possibility.</p>
              <p>When examining newly developing lesions in MS, analysis is effectively restricted to a small subset of lesions present in a proportion of radiologically active patients<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>; therefore, it is plausible that our study was not sufficiently powered to detect the influence of vascular risk factors longitudinally. Another interesting possibility is that a minority of newly forming lesions in MS (including in patients with no overt vascular risk factors) are truly nonperivenular and that this phenomenon is more common in those with a relatively lower baseline CVS+ percentage. Given that the pathophysiology of focal white matter inflammatory demyelination in MS is thought to be perivenular, such a finding, if confirmed, should prompt detailed analysis of the process by which those lesions form, as done previously for perivenular lesions.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Alternatively, current MRI techniques may be imperfectly sensitive to the CVS, particularly in the setting of new lesion formation; possible reasons could include intralesional edema reducing the apparent size of intralesional veins<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> or gadolinium itself interfering with vein detection. Indeed, in this cohort, the venular visibility within Gd+ lesions was proportionately lower compared with nonenhancing lesions. Importantly, when the same lesions were examined at later time points following the resolution of enhancement and/or intra-/perilesional edema, a higher proportion of central veins was observed, indicating the need for caution and follow-up when attributing development of a Gd-enhancing or very recent CVS− lesion to a cause other than MS.</p>
              <p>Despite the strengths of our study, it is not without limitations. Most participants in our study had RRMS, and our study was therefore underpowered to study the characteristics of newly developing lesions in progressive MS. In addition, as mentioned above, our results investigating the influence of vascular risk factors on newly developing lesions were limited by the small number of cases with newly developing lesions who had comorbid vascular disease. This highlights the need for larger, multicenter studies with longer durations of follow-up to fully interrogate the longitudinal effects of vascular risk factors on new lesion development in MS stratified by CVS status.</p>
              <p>In summary, our study describes the characteristics of newly developing lesions in MS along with associated risk factors. Patients who developed new lesions were more likely to be younger and have a RRMS diagnosis with shorter disease duration. Furthermore, we identified a link between baseline CVS+ percentage and the likelihood of development of new CVS+ lesions over time, suggesting that patients tend to develop lesions longitudinally that match their overall baseline CVS proportion. These results underscore the need for prospective studies examining the influence of DMT changes on the likelihood of new lesion development stratified by CVS characteristics and the impact of vascular risk factors. Ultimately, this will inform and lay the groundwork for the implementation of the CVS as a radiologic biomarker in the evaluation of patients with breakthrough MS disease activity and underscores its potential in guiding clinical practice.</p>
