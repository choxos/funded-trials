                <p>This Phase 1, randomized, two-site (United States), double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 18 sexually abstinent men and women. All received a single 300-mg dose of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and were then randomized 2∶1 to receive single and then seven daily rectal exposures of vaginally-formulated tenofovir (TFV) 1% gel or a hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) placebo gel. Blood, colonic biopsies and rectal and vaginal mucosal fluids were collected after the single oral TDF, the single topical TFV gel dose, and after 7 days of topical TFV gel dosing for extracellular analysis of TFV and intracellular analysis of the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate (TFVdp) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated mucosal mononuclear cells (MMC), including CD4+ and CD4- cell subsets. With a single rectal dose, TFV plasma concentrations were 24–33 fold lower and half-life was 5 h shorter compared to a single oral dose (p = 0.02). TFVdp concentrations were also undetectable in PBMCs with rectal dosing. Rectal tissue exposure to both TFV and TFVdp was 2 to 4-log<sub>10</sub> higher after a single rectal dose compared to a single oral dose, and after 7 daily doses, TFVdp accumulated 4.5 fold in tissue. TFVdp in rectal tissue homogenate was predictive (residual standard error, RSE  = 0.47) of tissue MMC intracellular TFVdp concentration, with the CD4+ cells having a 2-fold higher TFVdp concentration than CD4- cells. TFV concentrations from rectal sponges was a modest surrogate indicator for both rectal tissue TFV and TFVdp (RSE  = 0.67, 0.66, respectively) and plasma TFV (RSE  = 0.38). TFV penetrates into the vaginal cavity after oral and rectal dosing, with rectal dosing leading to higher vaginal TFV concentrations (p&lt;0.01).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Both topical and oral tenofovir (TFV)-containing regimens have demonstrated efficacy in HIV prevention. TFV 1% gel demonstrated 39% protective efficacy in women using the gel within 12 hours before and after sexual activity in the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 004 study <xref rid="pone.0106196-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The fixed dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (Truvada) prescribed daily in a population of men who have sex with men in the iPrEx study provided 44% protection against HIV infection <xref rid="pone.0106196-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Daily dosing of TDF or Truvada provided 62 to 73% protection against HIV transmission in serodiscordant men and women enrolled in the Partners PrEP Study <xref rid="pone.0106196-Baeten1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, daily dosing of oral TDF provided 49% reduction in HIV incidence rates among IV drug users <xref rid="pone.0106196-Choopanya1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In both CAPRISA 004 and iPrEx, the level of protection was related to drug exposure and adherence <xref rid="pone.0106196-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Karim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of the Phase 1 RMP-02/MTN-006 clinical trial was to evaluate the systemic safety of TFV 1% gel when applied rectally <xref rid="pone.0106196-Anton1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Built into this study was a comprehensive pharmacokinetic evaluation comparing systemic and compartmental pharmacokinetics among oral TDF and rectal TFV 1% gel users. These novel within-subject pharmacokinetic analyses were also used in an <italic>ex-vivo</italic> biopsy HIV challenge model to correlate TFVdp exposure with protection against <italic>ex vivo</italic> infection (<italic>reported in accompanying paper: Richardson-Harman et al.</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0106196-Anton1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This is the first study to quantify human rectal mucosal pharmacokinetics after topical administration of tenofovir in multiple compartments concurrently, to compare it to exposure after oral administration and to determine whether less-invasive indicators of TVFdp concentrations in tissue CD4+ cells emerge, potentially playing a future role in large clinical trials.</p>

                    <p>All 18 trial participants received a single oral dose of 300 mg TDF followed by intensive 24 h PK. After ∼2 week resting period, 12 subjects were randomized to receive a single rectal gel dose of 1% TFV gel with intensive 24 h PK followed, after ∼2 week resting period, by 6 sequential, daily, self-administered rectal 1% TFV gel doses with the 7th dose administered in-clinic with subsequent 24 h intensive PK.</p>

                <p>Briefly, in this three-stage trial, all participants received a single dose of oral TDF followed 4 weeks later by rectally applied TFV 1% gel or the HEC gel given as a single dose, and 4 weeks later, seven daily doses of the same product previously administered rectally. After enrollment, each subject was assigned to either the treatment or placebo arm (2∶1; TFV 1% gel:HEC gel) and also to one of two post-exposure biopsy sampling arms (groups “A” and “B”) to ensure mucosal safety. This limited the number of sigmoidoscopic procedures per participant to three sigmoidoscopic procedures in each of the first two study stages (single oral, single rectal) with several days delay between biopsy collections for mucosal healing. A single sigmoidoscopy biopsy collection point was used following the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage (7-day rectal exposures). All subjects provided biopsies (and other compartment samples) 0.5 h after their dose of oral TDF or single/7-day dose of TFV gel. For the single oral and single rectal exposures, in addition to all subjects being sampled at 0.5 h, Group ‘‘A’’ subjects were also biopsied on days 1 (24 hr) and 7; Group ‘‘B’’ subjects were also biopsied on days 4 and 10. Participants were allowed a 2 day visit window for this sampling but nearly all were seen on the first day of their 3-day window. Just prior to each biopsy sample, blood samples were obtained for plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation, and rectal and vaginal mucosal fluids were collected by sponge. Each 2 weeks of biopsy sampling was followed by a 2-week resting period. The sample size (N = 18) was based on a similar phase 1 study of topical microbicide UC781. <xref rid="pone.0106196-Anton2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> The study was conducted from November 2009 to July 2010.</p>

TFV 1% gel (weight/weight) is tenofovir (PMPA, 9-[(R)-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine monohydrate), formulated in purified water with edetate disodium, citric acid, glycerin, methylparaben, propylparaben, and hydroxyethyl cellulose with pH adjusted to 4–5 with an osmolarity of 3111 mOsmol/kg. The HEC placebo gel contained hydroxyethyl cellulose as the gel thickener, purified water, sodium chloride, sorbic acid, and sodium hydroxide. The gel was isotonic with a pH of 4.4, osmolarity of 304 mOsmol/kg, 24 and viscosity similar to the other microbicide gel candidates. Both TFV and HEC gels were prefilled into single-use, opaque applicators (HTI Plastics, Lincoln, NE) containing 4 ml of gel.</p>

                <title>Sample Processing</title>
                <p>Plasma was collected in tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant. Samples were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minutes at 4°C, plasma aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at −70°C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated via centrifugation from cell preparation tubes (CPT) at 1,800×g for 25 min at 28°C. PBMCs were collected from the buffy coat and washed twice with normal saline at room temperature (∼21°C). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml normal saline for cell counting. Cell pellets were lysed with 70% methanol and stored at −80°C until analysis.</p>
                <p>To release cells for intracellular analysis from colonic tissue, biopsies were incubated with a dissociative enzyme cocktail consisting of collagenase (0.5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), DNase I (0.083 U/ml, Roche, Indianapolis, IN), elastase (0.07 U/ml, Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ), and hyaluronidase (0.4 U/ml, Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ). The digestions were carried out in RPMI with 7.5% FBS in 50 ml-conical tubes at 37°C with agitation (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described. <xref rid="pone.0106196-Louissaint1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Louissaint2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Cells were counted using Guava/Millipore EasyCyte Plus (Millipore, Billerica, MA).</p>
                <p>CD4+ T cells from tissue and PBMCs were isolated via positive selection with CD4 microbeads using magnetic affinity column separation (MACS) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). CD4-positive and CD4-negative fractions were collected for cell counting and intracellular drug analysis. We used PBMCs to test for changes in intracellular TFV-DP concentrations as a result of tissue cell extraction and cell subset isolation compared to typical PBMC preparation. Compared to usual PBMC processing, there was no difference in PBMC TFV-DP concentrations resulting from the tissue digestion cocktail, monoclonal antibody incubation, or running cells over the MACS column.</p>

                <p>All TFV and TFVdp concentrations were measured using validated LC–MS/MS methods. Total numbers of samples analyzed were as follows: 275 blood plasma, 460 PBMCs, 205 tissue homogenates, 98 isolated mononuclear cells, 99 CD4+ cells, 99 CD4- cells, 264 rectal sponges, 54 vaginal sponges <xref rid="pone.0106196-Beigi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Briefly, TFV and TFVdp concentrations were determined by previously described LC-MS/MS methods <xref rid="pone.0106196-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-King1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> validated for all matrices by the Johns Hopkins Clinical Pharmacology Analytical Laboratory. TFV and TFVdp assays meet the FDA bioanalysis guidance values of ≤ ±15% for precision and accuracy <xref rid="pone.0106196-Hendrix1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. All calibrators were prepared using analyte calibrator stock solution diluted in the relevant human biological matrix corresponding to the samples to be assayed (plasma, PBMC lysate, cervicovaginal fluid, rectal fluid, homogenized colon or vaginal tissue). Thawed aliquots of plasma and tissue homogenate with <sup>13</sup>C-TFV internal standard were protein precipitated with methanol. Vaginal and rectal fluid sponges were eluted in 50∶50 methanol:water mixture. Sponges were weighed both before and after. Aliquots, also with <sup>13</sup>C5-TFV internal standard, underwent solid phase extraction using HLB oasis cartridges. The supernatants and eluants were collected, dried, and reconstituted in 0.5% acetic acid for analysis. For chromatographic separation of samples, a gradient elution with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column, with positive electrospray ionization (ESI) was used, with detection via multiple reaction monitoring using a LC-MS/MS system (Waters Acquity UPLC and Agilent 1100 HPLC Applied Biosystems API4000 mass spectrometer). Calibration standards for the TFV assay ranged from 0.31 to 1,280 ng/ml (0.25–50 ng/sample for tissue).</p>
                <p>For intracellular TFVdp analysis, tissue homogenates and isolated cell lysates were analyzed using an indirect assay <xref rid="pone.0106196-King1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. TFVdp was isolated from cell lysates on a Waters QMA cartridge (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) over a salt (KCl) gradient. TFV and tenofovir monophosphate (TFVmp) were separated from the cartridge under lower salt concentrations followed by elution of TFVdp with application of 1 M KCl to the cartridge. Isolated TFVdp was then enzymatically dephosphorylated to TFV via phosphatase digestion with incubation with phosphatase and <sup>13</sup>C-TFV internal standard. TFV was isolated from the KCl solution using trifluoroacetic acid and eluted in methanol. TFV with <sup>13</sup>C-TFV internal standard was analyzed via UPLC-MS/MS mass spectrometer as described above.</p>

                <title>PK Parameter Calculations</title>
                <p>Actual time after dosing was used for NCA. When calculating individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>24 h</sub>, half-life), only profiles with: a) greater than two data points, b) last concentration time point less than or equal to 24 h, and c) first concentration time point less than or equal to 12 h were used. A composite PK profile was constructed for rectal tissue homogenates using the median concentrations from all subjects at each nominal time point, regardless of the actual time. In this case, PK parameters were calculated based on this composite profile with nominal times. Composite profiles must be calculated with protocol-specified nominal times because descriptive statistics cannot be calculated with actual times; there were minor deviations in sample collection time during the trial, as it is impossible to collect at the exact protocol-specified time. For calculating AUC<sub>24 h</sub>, linear interpolation was used to interpolate the concentration at 24 h if the actual time was greater than 24 h. If actual time was between 22 h and 24 h, then that concentration was imputed to be the 24 h concentration. Half-life estimation was performed by choosing points during the beta-phase of the elimination slope.

                <p>Parameter calculation was performed with Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3.0.395 (Certara/Pharsight). Data manipulation and plotting was performed with R 2.15.10 <xref rid="pone.0106196-R1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> with libraries: lattice <xref rid="pone.0106196-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, latticeExtra <xref rid="pone.0106196-Sarkar2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, plyr <xref rid="pone.0106196-Wickham1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and reshape2 <xref rid="pone.0106196-Wickham2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Accumulation ratio for rectal dosing was defined in one of two ways: either the AUC<sub>24 h</sub> ratio of multiple dose gel to single dose gel, or if unavailable, the 0.5 h concentration ratio of multiple dose gel to single dose gel.</p>

                <p>Robust linear regression was carried out with robust package for R <xref rid="pone.0106196-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and fitted to the model: DV = β<sub>0</sub>+β<sub>1</sub>×IV+β<sub>2</sub>×CV+β<sub>3</sub>×IV×CV. Dependent (DV) and independent variables (IV) are continuous, while categorical variable (CV) is either 0 or 1. Any parameter terms with p&gt;0.05 were dropped and excluded from the statistical model, and re-fitted with a simpler model (backward elimination). All robust linear regression was performed with log<sub>10</sub>-transformed concentration data. Robust linear regression allows for differential weights to datapoints in respect to outlier datapoint; outliers were given less weight. This results in a more stable model. <xref rid="pone.0106196-Hampel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> All statistical comparisons were performed using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a bonferroni correction for 2 comparisons (oral to single rectal, single to multiple rectal), resulting in a critical p-value of 0.025 (0.05/2). Standard error (SE, standard deviation) was a measure of uncertainty around parameter estimates. Relative standard error (RSE) was a measure of overall goodness of fit (0 would be a perfect fit).</p>

For oral dosing, the following data were used for pharmacokinetic analysis: 139 plasma samples, 131 PBMC samples, 149 rectal tissue homogenates, 72 rectal tissue isolated MMC samples, 31 vaginal sponges, and 135 rectal sponges. For topical dosing, the following data were used for pharmacokinetic analysis: 228 plasma samples, 210 PBMC samples, 144 rectal tissue homogenates, 69 rectal tissue isolate MMC sample, 46 vaginal sponges, and 224 rectal sponges.

                <p>As expected, systemic TFV exposure, measured by both AUC<sub>24 h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, was 24–33 fold higher after a single oral dose (median AUC<sub>24 h</sub> 2200 ng/mL ×h, median C<sub>max</sub> 250 ng/mL) than after a single rectal dose (median AUC<sub>24 h</sub> 66 ng/mL ×h, median C<sub>max</sub> 11 ng/mL). An accumulation ratio of 0.73 demonstrated that there was no clinically relevant difference in plasma exposure between single and multiple rectal dosing. A 24-fold lower C<sub>max</sub> was achieved approximately 1.5 h faster with rectal dosing than with oral dosing (median T<sub>max</sub> single rectal  = 0.32 h versus single oral  = 1.9 h; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106196-t002">Table 2</xref>). TFV half-life was noted to be at least 5 h shorter (paired t-test on log-transformed half-lives, p = 0.02) for single and multiple rectal dosing (4.6–6.6 h) compared to oral dosing (11 h). (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106196-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g003">Figure 3</xref>) Inter-individual variability of the PK parameters (CV%) ranged from 31–100% during oral dosing, 55–106% during single rectal dosing, and 53–103% during multiple rectal dosing. T<sub>max</sub> was the most variable PK parameter with CV% consistently above 100%.</p>

                <title>Rectal Tissue</title>
                <p>There was a linear relationship (p = 0.04) between TFVdp and TFV in rectal tissue homogenates during oral dosing. This relationship can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The resulting model (± standard error) was as follows: Rectal Tissue homogenate TFVdp concentration (fmol/mg)  = 2.37 (±0.168)+0.366 (±0.121)× rectal tissue homogenate TFV concentration (ng/mg). Although rectal data from topical dosing was excluded from the model due to nonsignificance, they are overlaid in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g004">Figure 4</xref> for reference.</p>
                <p>Population composite AUC showed that topical dosing resulted in 2-log<sub>10</sub> higher rectal exposure to TFV (single oral vs. single rectal dose AUC<sub>24 h</sub>  = 0.79 vs. 70 ng/mg ×h, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106196-t002">Table 2</xref>) and a 4-log<sub>10</sub> higher rectal exposure to TFVdp (single oral vs. rectal dose AUC<sub>24 h</sub>  = 0.24 vs. 5500 fmol/mg ×h). When comparing tissue concentrations 30 minutes post-dose, single topical dosing resulted in 2-fold higher TFV (paired p = 0.016) and 4-fold higher (paired p&lt;0.001) TFVdp concentrations compared to oral dosing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g004">Figures 4A, 4B</xref>). Multiple rectal dosing resulted in a non-statistically significant 2-fold accumulation in TFV concentrations compared to single dosing (paired P&gt;0.8), with TFVdp concentrations accumulating 4.5-fold (paired p&lt;0.01). Over 24 h, we observed TFV concentrations continuing to increase after oral dosing, such that 24 h concentrations post-dose were similar between oral and topical dosing: median TFV concentration at 24 h was 0.060 ng/mg after oral dosing vs 0.060 ng/mg after rectal dosing, paired p&gt;0.8). However, median TFVdp concentrations 24 h post topical rectal dose were almost 300-fold higher than after an oral dose, though not statistically significant. (paired p = 0.125). With 4 subjects having missing paired C<sub>24 h</sub> rectal biopsy samples for rectal dosing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, this may have resulted in biased TFVdp concentrations after topical dosing.</p>

The CV% of TFVdp ranged from 0–307%, 85–312%, and 132% for single oral, single rectal, and multiple rectal dosing.

              <p>This is the first study examining the pharmacokinetic distribution of rectally applied tenofovir gel in various tissues and cells relevant to HIV infection. This study also compares compartment concentrations of rectally applied TFV kinetics to oral dosing. It is important and biologically relevant to quantify TFV and TFVdp exposures in tissues and cells targeted for HIV infection. Measuring these concentrations allows for a better understanding of how drug distributes from the sites of absorption to target tissues, what factors can impact this distribution, and the possible identification of less-invasive surrogate markers of exposure that could be useful in larger clinical trials.</p>
              <p>In this study's intra-subject comparison, the TFV exposure (AUC<sub>24 h</sub>) in plasma was, expectedly, more than 30 times higher after oral administration of 136 mg of TFV equivalent than after rectal administration of 44 mg of TFV. Additionally, T<sub>max</sub> was 1.6 h shorter with rectal administration than with oral dosing. Differences in absorption kinetics between the rectum/lower large intestine and upper small intestine may explain this discrepancy. The extent and rate of absorption is often lower in the rectum compared to the intestines. This can be due to the relatively smaller surface area of the rectum for drug absorption, the inherent differences in the formulation, and the environment surrounding the route of administration, such as pH and fluid content <xref rid="pone.0106196-VanHoogdalem1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0106196-De1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the particular case of TFV gel, the major difference is the formulation. Oral TFV is administered as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a di-ester prodrug <xref rid="pone.0106196-Fung1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Kearney1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In contrast, TFV gel contains only the drug. Thus, TFV gel would not require the additional metabolism step, leading to a faster T<sub>max</sub>. The lower plasma exposure after gel dosing is not completely explained by the lower dose, since the equivalent oral dose was only 3 times higher. This is most likely due to the lower extent of drug absorption in the rectum, and also possibly due to gel leakage.</p>
              <p>The half-life of TFV in plasma was 4–6 h longer (p = 0.02) with oral dosing than with rectal administration, and consistently longer in all patients except for one. The plasma half-life observed was 1–3 hours shorter than typically reported <xref rid="pone.0106196-Fung1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Kearney1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> most likely due to lack of data in this study during the terminal elimination phase. Nonetheless, the relative difference in half-life between oral and rectal administration is significant. One possible explanation is that the kinetics with rectal dosing may be driven by absorption, leading to flip-flop kinetics <xref rid="pone.0106196-Yez1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. If this is the true, then the half-life would be rate-limited by the rate of absorption instead of elimination. One other explanation may be the saturation of renal elimination processes <xref rid="pone.0106196-VanGinneken1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> as a result of higher TFV plasma exposure. Tenofovir is eliminated by filtration and secretion <xref rid="pone.0106196-Fung1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although renal filtration is not saturable, tubular secretion is carrier-protein mediated and can exhibit nonlinear, saturable behavior. During tubular secretion, tenofovir is a substrate for the MRP4 transporter in the tubular lumen <xref rid="pone.0106196-RodrguezNvoa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0106196-Ray1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Saturation of this excretion transporter could explain nonlinear elimination.</p>
              <p>In the case of topical administration, the decreased half-life and lower plasma exposure during both single and multiple administrations can minimize systemic toxicity. C<sub>max</sub> of TFVdp after a single oral dose was below limit of detection (LLOQ  = 8 fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells); this is significantly lower than what has been previously reported (20 fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells <xref rid="pone.0106196-Louissaint1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>), but not unexpected based on inter-individual variability. This is probably also due to lower cell penetration of TFV compared to TFVdp. Due to the low plasma exposure following rectal dosing (median plasma AUC<sub>24 h</sub> 66 ng/mL ×h), TFVdp exposure was undetectable in PBMCs of all subjects.</p>
              <p>As expected, rectal tissue exposure to TFV and TFVdp was 2–4 log<sub>10</sub> higher with topical administration than with oral dosing. After multiple dosing, TFV does not appear to significantly accumulate in the tissue. Although the accumulation ratio from the median profile showed an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC<sub>24 h</sub>, a paired analysis of concentration within individuals showed no statistically significant changes between the 30 min and 24 h post-dose samples. TFVdp, however, did show significant accumulation in rectal tissue (approximately 5-fold) and in isolated mucosal mononuclear cells (approximately 3-fold). The long intracellular half-life of TFVdp is likely the cause of this tissue accumulation <xref rid="pone.0106196-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
              <p>It has previously been noted that an increase in TFV tissue homogenate concentration yields an increase in TFVdp concentration <xref rid="pone.0106196-Louissaint1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106196-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We confirmed this at 24 h after oral dosing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The correlation may have been stronger if there would have been more data to analyze. Furthermore, it is possible that the different absorption kinetics of the rectum compared to the intestines could cause variations in this correlation.</p>
              <p>To address the question of whether TFVdp in tissue homogenates accurately reflect TFVdp concentrations in target cells for HIV transmission, or whether the heterogeneous mix of cells in mucosal tissue confounds the results, we compared homogenate results to those of isolated mucosal mononuclear cells. Encouragingly, a linear relationship was noted between TFVdp concentration in rectal tissue homogenate and isolated mucosal mononuclear cells. This linear relationship was not influenced by CD4 status: as TFVdp concentration in the homogenate increased by 100%, there was a 63% increase of TFVdp in the isolated mucosal mononuclear cells. However, the data did suggest that there may be differences in phosphorylation based on the CD4 expression status of the cell. When plotting the relationship between TFVdp in tissue homogenates and in CD4+ and CD4- cells, the Y intercept in CD4+ cells was 1.6-fold higher than in CD4- cells. That is, for every observed TFVdp concentration in the homogenate, the TFVdp concentration in the CD4+ cells was 1.6-fold higher than CD4- cells. This difference persisted throughout the 10–10,000 fmol/mg range of TFVdp concentrations, and achieved statistical significance (p&lt;0.01), even with small numbers of samples. The source of this difference is unclear, as some studies suggest that tenofovir is phosphorylated to a similar extent between quiescent and stimulated cells, while others suggest higher phosphorylation in resting cells <xref rid="pone.0106196-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Although it is currently unknown whether these concentration differences are of clinical significance, these data are encouraging, as they suggest that TFVdp is found in higher concentrations in the cells that are targets for HIV infection.</p>
              <p>In this study, rectal mucosal fluid was collected to determine whether it could be a surrogate for TFV and TFVdp concentration in rectal tissue. TFV concentrations in the rectal fluid linearly correlated with rectal tissue TFVdp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106196-g008">Figure 8</xref>) This relationship remained consistent regardless of dose route or frequency. Despite dramatic differences between oral and rectal absorption characteristics, we still observe a similar linear relationship between these two matrices. Therefore, rectal fluid TFV concentrations collected by sponge are useful in estimating drug concentrations in the target rectal tissue.</p>
              <p>We also attempted prediction of plasma TFV exposure from rectal mucosal concentrations. There was high variability in these predictions, so a precise prediction was not possible. However, our data suggest that a rough estimation of high or low plasma TFV based on rectal TFV concentration could be feasible. Therefore, rectal sponge TFV concentration could be used as a non-invasive surrogate for plasma TFV concentrations for safety and toxicity monitoring. With more patient data, prediction variability may be decreased using patient demographic covariates, which could potentially minimize the need for blood sampling in future trials of rectal dosing. We did not observe similar correlation with oral dosing; this is probably due to the high variability in the data compared to the possible strength of the correlation. If we had a higher range of rectal fluid concentration, through either different oral dose levels or sample collection times, then it is possible a correlation may be observed.</p>
              <p>Previous data in macaques has demonstrated that 5–7% of tenofovir dosed rectally can be found in vaginal fluid <xref rid="pone.0106196-Nuttall1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We evaluated this phenomenon in 4 women, and found that vaginal concentrations were 8.7% of rectal secretion concentrations sampled at the same time, similar to the 1–2 log<sub>10</sub> difference found previously in animals. Additionally, we noted a 1.6-fold higher exposure of TFV in vaginal secretions with rectal dosing than with oral dosing. Since the slopes of the relationship between vaginal fluid TFV and plasma TFV with the two administration routes are not significantly different, the rate of TFV penetration into the vagina does not vary with administration route. As plasma concentrations with oral dosing are much higher than with rectal dosing, systemic re-distribution into the vaginal fluid cannot be the only mechanism by which TFV reaches the vaginal lumen. Vaginal TFV penetration was further confirmed when we observed a linear relationship between vaginal TFV exposure and rectal tissue exposure. When rectal tissue TFV and TFVdp exposure increased, there was also a linear increase in vaginal exposure to TFV. Due to the low number of data points, we could not discern whether route of administration affected this relationship.</p>
              <p>It is interesting to note that there was accumulation of TFV in the vaginal fluid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106196-t002">Table 2</xref>, single rectal dose AUC  = 1.4 ng/g ×h, multiple rectal dose  = 11), but not rectal fluid (single rectal dose AUC  = 11 ng/g ×h, multiple rectal dose  = 7.0). There are two possible explanations for this. One is that the rectal site is already saturated due to proximity to administration, whereas vaginal site is more distal and takes time to build up. Another is that there may be differences in fluid turnover between the two sites. Therefore, the kinetics is inherently different between the two sites.</p>
              <p>One limitation of this analysis is the treatment of BLQ values and nominal times used for the composite PK profiles in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106196-t002">Table 2</xref>. BLQ numbers are still valuable because there is a lot of information content in these numbers. Therefore, the treatment of BLQ values depended on the analysis performed. They are imputed as 0.01 for NCA, and ignored for correlation analysis due to statistical difficulties in treating these numbers. Since this was done systematically and consistently, there should be no impact on the overall conclusions. Also, the proportion of BLQ values for plasma was low (2.4%), so this should have little impact on the calculated plasma PK parameters. Similarly, since only datapoints that fell within a specific time window were included in the composite profiles, there should not have been a significant bias in PK parameter estimates.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This was the first comprehensive pharmacokinetic study of rectally administered tenofovir gel that describes the distribution of TFV and TFVdp into various tissue compartments relevant to HIV infection. The compartments included rectal fluid, rectal tissue and its isolated mucosal mononuclear cells, vaginal fluid, blood plasma and PBMCs. It was expected, and now confirmed, that rectally applied TFV would have lower systemic exposure and higher vaginal exposure compared to oral. There was accumulation of TFVdp in the rectal tissue, due to the long intracellular half-life. An unexpected yet biologically interesting finding was detecting a consistent difference in concentrations of TFVdp in rectal mucosal CD4+ cells, prime targets for new HIV infections. It is useful to know that TFV rectal fluid concentrations may be reasonable bio-indicators of plasma and, importantly, rectal tissue concentrations, making it easier to estimate adherence and TFV concentrations in the target tissue.</p>
              <p>We were encouraged to see many concentration correlations across various relevant matrices, such as rectal mucosal mononuclear cells and rectal tissue homogenate TFVdp, and vaginal fluid and plasma. This will enable more advanced population pharmacokinetic modeling methods and developing a single mathematical model that describes the distribution of TFV with more accuracy. Furthermore, if target TFV and TFVdp concentrations are identified, then these data and models will assist in dose/regimen selection that maximizes efficacy and minimizes toxicity.</p>
