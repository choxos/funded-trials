                  <title>Objective:</title>
                  <p id="P2">It is unclear why Black smokers in the United States have elevated risk of some tobacco-related diseases compared to White smokers. One possible causal mechanism is differential intake of tobacco toxicants but results across studies are inconsistent. Thus, we examined racial differences in biomarkers of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in tobacco smoke.</p>

                  <title>Method:</title>
                  <p id="P3">We analyzed baseline data collected from 182 Black and 184 White adult smokers who participated in a randomized clinical trial in 2013–2014 at 10 sites across the U.S. We examined differences in urinary levels of 10 VOC metabolites, total nicotine equivalents (TNE), and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), controlling for covariates such as cigarettes per day (CPD), as well as differences in VOCs per TNE to assess the extent to which tobacco exposure, and not metabolic factors, accounted for racial differences.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p id="P4">Concentration of metabolites of acrolein, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and methylating agents were significantly higher in Blacks compared to Whites when controlled for covariates. Other than the metabolite of methylating agents, VOCs per TNE did not differ between Blacks and Whites. Concentrations of TNE/CPD and VOCs/CPD were significantly higher in Blacks. Menthol did not contribute to racial differences in VOC levels.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p id="P5">For a given level of CPD, Black smokers likely take in higher levels of acrolein, acrylonitrile, and ethylene oxide than White smokers. Our findings are consistent with Blacks taking in more nicotine and toxicants per cigarette smoked, which may explain their elevated disease risk relative to other racial groups.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P6">Tobacco smoking is a major contributor to racial disparities related to lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases in the United States.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The leading type of cancer death in the U.S. is lung cancer,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> of which about 80% of cases are attributed to smoking.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Despite similar smoking prevalence and the fact that African Americans (Blacks) smoke fewer cigarettes per day (CPD) and on fewer days of the month compared to Whites,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> several studies have found higher lung cancer risk among Black smokers compared to White smokers.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For example, the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study found that, for the same number of CPD, Blacks had higher lung cancer risk compared to Whites.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Smoking is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and compared to Whites, Blacks have higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P7">A proposed hypothesis for higher tobacco-related disease risk for Blacks relative to Whites is that at any given level of cigarettes smoked per day, systemic exposure to nicotine and toxicants is higher for Black smokers than it is for White smokers. Early support for this hypothesis came from a study in a controlled research setting which found that Blacks took in about 30% more nicotine per cigarette compared to Whites.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> These findings have been supported by some observational studies. The MEC study found that Black smokers, with a median of 10 CPD, had higher levels of urinary total nicotine equivalents (TNE, the molar sum of nicotine and its metabolites) than White smokers who consumed a median of 20 CPD.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Interestingly, at fixed TNE, indicating similar daily nicotine intake and toxicant exposure, a recent publication from the MEC study showed no difference in cancer risk between Blacks and Whites,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> suggesting that differences in exposure to toxicants explain differential lung cancer risk between these two racial groups.</p>
              <p id="P8">Indeed, the MEC study found that Blacks had significantly higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), a metabolite of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), than Whites after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity and urinary creatinine levels.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A large body of laboratory data<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and some human epidemiology studies<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> provide evidence that NNK is an important contributor to lung cancer in smokers. Nonetheless, studies do not consistently show that Black smokers have higher NNAL levels compared to White smokers. An analysis of nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007–2010 found higher urinary NNAL levels in Whites compared to Blacks along the CPD spectrum even though the corresponding serum cotinine levels were higher in Blacks.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>

As shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, Whites had significantly higher creatinine-normalized biomarker levels than Blacks because Whites had lower creatinine levels in their urine, 0.76 (0.68–0.85) vs 1.00 (0.91–1.11) (GM, 95% CI). As a result, to control for urine dilution and to avoid the inherent bias introduced by creatinine-normalization when examining race and sex differences, we used an approach described by O’Brien and colleagues, which controls the covariate-independent, short-term multiplicative effect of hydration on urinary dilution.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>

We present concentrations of urinary biomarkers unadjusted for urinary creatinine concentration (unit: mass/mL), those normalized for creatinine concentration (mass/mg creatinine), and the covariate-adjusted standardized biomarker concentrations (mass/mL) by race in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. P values for comparisons by race are based on univariate analyses.

On the other hand, for Whites, the geometric mean of the covariate-adjusted concentrations were similar to the uncorrected concentrations but the creatinine-normalized concentrations were generally higher; while the geometric mean of the creatinine ratio for Whites was 1.00 (0.90–1.11), the geometric mean of the absolute creatinine levels was 0.76 (0.68–0.85).</p>

The ratios are independent of creatinine levels and were used to address the question of whether racial differences in VOC biomarker levels were related to differences in extent of intake of the parent compounds (in which case the ratios would be similar by race) or to differences in metabolic conversion of VOCs to mercapturic acids (in which case the ratios would differ by race).</p>

              <p id="P31">Understanding the causal pathways as to why Blacks have disproportionately higher rates of some tobacco-related diseases compared to other racial-ethnic groups may potentially lead to novel preventive and therapeutic interventions. In this study, urinary metabolites of acrolein, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and methylating agents were significantly higher in Black smokers compared to White smokers after controlling for covariates such as CPD. These results indicate that Black smokers have higher intake of toxic and carcinogenic VOCs from each cigarette smoked, which may contribute to increased risk of smoking-related diseases. These findings are consistent with a few previous studies showing higher levels of some VOC metabolites in Black smokers compared to White smokers.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>

Ours is among the first studies suggesting higher acrolein intake in Black smokers relative to White smokers, with the implication of higher risk of cardiopulmonary disease risks among Blacks smokers relative to White smokers. Other studies have reported higher acrolein exposure (3-HPMA) in White smokers compared to Black smokers, but the bias introduced by creatinine normalization<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and not controlling for differences in CPD across races<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> could have influenced these findings.</p>

              <p id="P34">The largest difference between Blacks and Whites was seen for MMA, the metabolite of methylating agents, and is a potentially important finding of our study. While tobacco smoke contains several constituents that are known to act as methylating agents, a prior study found that urinary MMA levels were not associated with tobacco smoke exposure.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Consistent with the conclusions of that study, we found weak correlations between MMA levels and levels of TNE and NNAL, which are tobacco-specific. It seems MMA is related to other sources of methylating agents, including dietary and environmental, and that intake from these sources may differ by <sub>race.</sub><sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P35">Regardless of the source, higher exposure to methylating agents among Blacks compared to Whites has implications for health disparities.

              <p id="P36">Since mercapturic acid metabolites are products of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mediated detoxification reactions, racial differences in <italic>glutathione S-transferase</italic> genotypes, which have been observed,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> might contribute to differences in mercapturic acid levels between Blacks and Whites.

While not statistically significant, we found that TNE levels, which are independent of differences in metabolic pathways, were 1.10 times higher in Blacks compared to Whites, suggestive of a general trend of higher tobacco constituent intake in Blacks.</p>

It is known that nicotine and toxicants are emitted in mainstream smoke at relatively constant ratios (i.e. yields are highly correlated, <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> &gt; 0.98 from one study<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>). Thus, it can be assumed that if there is no significant racial difference in VOC metabolism between racial groups, then the average VOC metabolite/TNE would be equal between the racial groups. Indeed, mercapturic acid metabolites normalized per TNE were not significantly different by race, except for MMA, indicating that differences in intake of VOCs and not differences in VOC metabolism explains the racial differences in levels of VOC metabolites observed.</p>
              <p id="P38">Higher intake of some VOCs among Blacks compared to Whites might be related to differences in the cigarette products used and/or smoking behavior. Use of menthol, which is more prevalent among Blacks, is frequently offered as an explanation for smoking-related health disparities. Other than HEMA, metabolite of acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride and ethylene oxide, which was higher in Black non-menthol smokers compared to Black menthol smokers, levels of VOC metabolites were not significantly different across menthol use among Black or White smokers, consistent with other studies.<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P39">We did not find a significant effect of the rate of nicotine metabolism, measured by the NMR, on racial differences in VOC metabolites, possibly because the main nicotine-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP2A6, are not known to be involved in the metabolism of the VOCs measured.<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> We found no effect of education, as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES), independent of race on toxicant biomarker levels, and this may be due to a higher proportion of Blacks with less years of education. Although cannabis smoking is a source of the same VOCs measured in tobacco smoke,<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> prevalence of cannabis use (positive THC test) did not differ by race in this study; cannabis use did not alter the magnitude of differences in VOC metabolite levels between Blacks and Whites. Finally, while secondhand smoke exposes nonsmokers to significant levels of VOCs,<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> the levels are proportionately much lower than that from smoking and are unlikely to explain racial differences among smokers. It is possible that other environmental sources can contribute to racial differences in VOC intake, but we are unable to conduct source apportionment due to limited data.</p>
              <p id="P40">The generalizability of our findings may be limited by the exclusion of people who smoke less than five CPD – a growing number of smokers in the U.S.,<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> and our enrollment of participants drawn from a clinical trial. As stated before, we are limited by a lack of <italic>GST</italic> genotype data to tease out the potential contribution of metabolic differences to the observed racial differences in biomarker levels. Nevertheless, VOCs normalized to TNE did not vary across race, suggesting that while we cannot rule out metabolic differences, differential intake of tobacco smoke constituents across race may explain, in part, our observations. Finally, we used an improved method to correct for the effect of urine diluteness on biomarker levels measured in spot urine samples across individuals.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P41">Our findings indicate that for a given level of cigarette consumption per day, Black smokers have higher average levels of biomarkers of acrolein, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and possibly 1,3-butadiene, than White smokers, suggestive of higher intake of these constituents per cigarette smoked. MMA was significantly higher in Blacks compared to Whites, however this may not be related to smoking as a prior study demonstrated that smoking cessation did not lower urinary MMA levels.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Our findings provide evidence to support the biological plausibility of reported elevated lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease risks among Black smokers compared to White smokers for a given level of cigarette consumption. Why Black smokers take in more smoke and more toxicants per cigarettes than White smokers remains an unresolved question.</p>
