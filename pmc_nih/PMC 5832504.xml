                <p id="P1">Protective efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may be
affected by the methods and routes of vaccine administration. We have studied
the safety and immunogenicity of oral (PO) and/or intradermal (ID)
administration of BCG in healthy human subjects No major safety concerns were
detected in the 68 healthy adults vaccinated with PO and/or ID BCG. Although
both PO and ID BCG could induce systemic Th1 responses capable of IFN-γ
production, ID BCG more strongly induced systemic Th1 responses. In contrast,
stronger mucosal responses (TB-specific secretory IgA and bronchoalveolar lavage
T cells) were induced by PO BCG vaccination. To generate preliminary data
comparing the early gene signatures induced by mucosal and systemic BCG
vaccination, CD4+ memory T cells were isolated from subsets of BCG
vaccinated subjects pre- (Day 0) and post-vaccination (Days 7 and 56), rested or
stimulated with BCG infected dendritic cells, and then studied by Illumina
BeadArray transcriptomal analysis. Notably, distinct gene expression profiles
were identified both on Day 7 and Day 56 comparing the PO and ID BCG vaccinated
groups by GSEA analysis. Future correlation analyses between specific gene
expression patterns and distinct mucosal and systemic immune responses induced
will be highly informative for TB vaccine development.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P2">Over one-third of the world’s population is currently infected with
<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), and more than 1.5 million
individuals die of tuberculosis (TB) each year.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) The current TB vaccine, the attenuated <italic>Mycobacterium
bovis</italic> strain <italic>Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG),</italic> is
effective at preventing disseminated forms of TB in very young children. (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)
However, the efficacy in prevention of adult pulmonary TB, the major form of
transmissible disease, at best is only 50%.(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) Intradermal (ID) administration is the major route of BCG vaccination
worldwide, but this vaccination method is unlikely to induce optimal lung mucosal
immunity.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) We hypothesize that combining systemic and mucosal TB
vaccinations may induce not only systemic immunity protective against the worst
forms of disseminated TB disease, but also mucosal immunity protective against
initial TB infection and/or secondary transmission. We have initiated a series of
BCG vaccination trials with the overall goal of identifying the major human immune
responses that BCG does and does not induce, and to determine the immune responses
new and improved TB vaccines must stimulate to provide better protection than ID
BCG. An additional goal of our ongoing work is to investigate the possibility that
mucosal BCG vaccination can uniquely induce immune responses relevant for optimal
lung mucosal TB immunity. Because oral (PO) BCG vaccination was the original route
used by Calmette and Guerin,(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and millions
of persons have been vaccinated with BCG orally in Brazil over the past 50
years,(<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) there are considerable safety
data to support the use of PO BCG in humans.(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) In addition, activated memory T and B lymphocytes have been shown to
develop differentiation programs allowing them to circulate and home to multiple
different mucosal tissues, indicating that PO vaccines could induce increased
immunity at distant mucosal sites.(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) Administration of
ID and/or PO BCG in ongoing research protocols allows for comparison of the mucosal
and systemic TB-specific immune responses induced with current and alternative
methods of vaccine administration. We report here the first detailed analysis of
human immune responses induced by ID and/or PO BCG. Our results support the
hypothesis that a combined ID and PO BCG vaccination approach could induce the best
combination of mucosal and systemic TB immunity.</p>
              <p id="P3">Recent studies have used systems biology approaches to obtain a global
picture of the immune responses to vaccination in humans.(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)
Systems biology tools have enabled the identification of early innate signatures
that predict the immunogenicity of vaccines, and identification of potentially novel
mechanisms of immune regulation. In this work we have taken a novel systems biology
approach focusing on the identification of gene expression networks involved in the
induction of CD4+ T cells, critically important for optimal mucosal and
systemic TB immunity. Our preliminary data indicate that PO and ID BCG induce
distinct profiles of molecular signatures, suggesting that more detailed analyses
will identify genes and/or gene networks that should be differentially targeted by
vaccines designed to induce both optimal mucosal and systemic TB immunity.</p>

                <title>Summary of enrollment, safety and determination of optimal PO BCG Danish
dose</title>
                <p id="P4">All 16 subjects enrolled into the initial Danish BCG PO dose escalation
trial completed 6 months of observation, and none developed any significant
adverse events. Optimal BCG-specific blood T cell IFN-γ responses and
nasal wash Mtb LAM-specific sIgA responses post-vaccination were detected in
subjects given 2×10<sup>8</sup> cfu of Danish BCG PO (data not shown).
In the double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 60 subjects were randomized among
the groups A–F (10/group) (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure
1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary
Figure 1</xref>). In addition, 8 subjects were enrolled into an open label
arm (group G) who received 2×10<sup>6</sup> cfu of Connaught BCG
intradermally. All 68 subjects received their initial BCG vaccinations as
planned, 63 subjects were followed for at least 6 months after the initial
vaccinations, 43 received second vaccinations 1 year later (20 received BCG
revaccination and 23 received placebo 1 year after the first vaccinations), and
48 completed 2 years of follow up. The number of drop outs during the second
year reduced sample sizes to less than optimal for detection of significant
increases in the immunogenicity parameters induced by the booster BCG
vaccinations. Therefore, for most immunogenicity results presented below, groups
A+B, C+D and E+F were combined based on the type of BCG
vaccination given at the beginning of the trial. Only limited comparisons
between group G and the other groups are shown because of the smaller sample
size in group G, further reduction in sample size due to drop outs, and the lack
of meaningful differences detected between groups A+B (given ID Danish
BCG) and group G. However, some group G subjects were recruited into a BAL study
and these results are presented along with the results from all other groups. No
deaths or other significant adverse events (SAE) occurred during these trials.
There were no severe AEs caused by vaccination except for in 1 subject (ID BCG
alone/Group A) who developed transient erythema at the ID vaccination site
graded as severe by size. This severe graded erythema did not interfere with the
subject’s normal activities and was not associated with any other
symptoms. There were eleven moderate related unsolicited adverse events, nine of
which occurred post vaccination 1. Seven of these events, experienced by
subjects in all Groups except PO BCG alone (groups C + D), were
described as continued reactogenicity. The remaining four events, experienced by
subjects in ID BCG alone, PO BCG alone and combined ID and PO groups (1 subject
in each of the following groups: A, B, C and E), included: appetite loss, upper
respiratory infection, URI and mandibular pain. Overall, these results indicate
that no safety signals were detected in this small trial.</p>

IFN-γ responses specific for the major secreted protein, Ag85B, and for
all Mtb CF secreted proteins, were both significantly increased
post-vaccination. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows

the different time points. It can be seen that only the groups given ID BCG
(with or without PO BCG) developed significantly increased Mtb-specific
IFN-γ responses post-vaccination (by Wilcoxon matched pairs test). <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> further confirms these results
demonstrating that significantly increased proportions of subjects in the groups
given ID BCG developed positive IFN-γ responses post-vaccination
(defined as a response greater than the mean plus 2 SE of all baseline
responses; all significant differences detected are presented). In 5 different
comparisons of antigen-specific responses at both early and late time points, ID
groups had significantly higher proportions of responders than PO recipients.
Furthermore, 2 comparisons indicated that combined ID plus PO BCG vaccination
induced higher proportions of positive IFN-γ responses than PO BCG
alone, providing additional support for the conclusion that ID BCG induces
stronger systemic TB-specific immunity than PO BCG. Two comparisons indicated
that ID BCG alone induced higher proportions of responders than ID plus PO,
perhaps because more T cells were recruited out of the blood and into the
peripheral mucosal tissues, due to the higher doses of BCG given PO (40 fold
more BCG cfu were used for PO compared with ID vaccination).</p>

both ID BCG alone and PO ± ID BCG induced significant increases in

PO and ID BCG, respectively, we performed additional studies of the CD4+
T cell transcriptomes present post-vaccination. We hypothesized that distinct
individual genes and gene networks important for differential mucosal and
systemic immune responses would be induced by the different routes of
vaccination. We compared vaccine-induced transcriptomal changes at the predicted
peak of post-vaccination T cell activation (Day 7 post-vaccination), and at an
early memory time point (Day 56 post-vaccination). We focused on comparisons of
transcriptomes at Day 7 directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> without further

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P12">Our major original hypothesis was that the combination of mucosal and
systemic BCG vaccination would induce the optimal combination of mucosal and
systemic TB-specific immune responses important for TB protective immunity. Overall
the results of this trial support this conclusion by indicating that PO BCG induced
stronger mucosal responses and ID BCG induced stronger systemic immune responses.
Furthermore, the combination of PO and ID BCG resulted in both increases in mucosal
and systemic immune responses. In addition, no major safety signals were identified,
further supporting the rationale for additional studies of mucosal BCG
vaccination.</p>
              <p id="P13">ID BCG vaccination induced stronger and more reproducible systemic immune
responses compared with PO BCG vaccination. Positive response rates post-vaccination
in both PBMC IFN-γ ELISPOT and lymphoproliferative assays, were greater in
subjects given ID compared with PO BCG. Numerous examples of ID recipients
developing significantly higher response rates than PO recipients were seen in these
assays that measure functional characteristics of systemic CD4+ T helper
type 1 responses thought to be critical for TB protective immunity. In <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, groups E+F are shown to have
increased responses at Day 7, but then the responses are decreased. The increased
responses at Day 7 in subjects given both PO+ID BCG suggest early induction
of T cells, but these induced T cells may traffic to mucosal peripheral sites
leading to decreased numbers of T cells circulating in the blood.</p>
              <p id="P14">PO BCG vaccination induced stronger/more reproducible mucosal secretory IgA
responses compared with ID BCG vaccination. Positive response rates in the
LAM-specific secretory IgA responses detected in nasal wash and tear specimens
collected post-vaccination were higher in subjects given PO BCG compared with ID BCG
alone. These relative increases compared to Day 0 seen in the PO BCG vaccination
groups did not achieve statistical significance (by Wilcoxon matched pairs tests),
probably because of the small sample sizes. However, combined with our previously
published data from PO dose escalation trials reporting that PO BCG can
significantly increase TB-specific sIgA responses,(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) our current results
further support the unique induction of nasal wash and tear sIgA responses by PO
BCG. In contrast, despite these results, the stool secretory IgA responses were not
increased in PO BCG recipients. Initially, this might seem surprising because the PO
BCG delivery is expected to induce gut mucosal immunity after being taken up by
mucosal immune inductive sites within the Peyer’s patches lining the small
bowel. However, our current negative results for stool secretory IgA after PO BCG
are similar to the findings in our 2 previous PO BCG trials, in which we have not
detected post-vaccination increases in stool secretory IgA responses. Stool contains
a high content of proteases which can degrade secretory IgA over time(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and the method for collection of stool
samples results in much higher dilutions of stool secretions compared with the
methods for collection of nasal washes and tears.(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) Therefore, stool studies are the least reliable for detection of
mucosal immune responses induced by vaccination compared with other mucosal
secretions. The detection of increased secretory IgA responses in nasal washes and
tears document mucosal immune responses induced by PO BCG, and also demonstrate that
these mucosal immune responses were able to traffic to distant mucosal tissues
including those lining the upper respiratory track, possibly relevant for protection
against TB infection.</p>
              <p id="P15">The comparison of BAL cell and PBMC responses in subjects recruited for the
BAL sub-study demonstrated that PO BCG also induced highly significant increases in
T cell surface markers important for lymphocyte trafficking to the lung. Highly
reproducible and significant increases in both BAL T cell expression of CXCR3 and
PBMC T cell expression of the α4/β1 integrin complex were induced in
subjects given PO with or without ID BCG, compared with those given ID BCG alone.
These T cell surface markers have been shown in numerous model systems to be
important for the trafficking of CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ T cells to
the lungs.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) Both
CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T cells specific for TB antigens are thought to be
critically important for protective TB immunity.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) Therefore, the BAL/PBMC sub-study results indicate that PO BCG
induces the potential for more T cells protective against TB to traffic to the site
of initial infection.</p>
              <p id="P16">Also evident in the BAL/PBMC sub-study, PO BCG with or without ID BCG led to
higher BAL overall TB-specific T cell responses in the lungs compared with persons
given only ID BCG. The numbers of antigen-specific BAL T cells producing
IFN-γ after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with Ag85, PPD and BCG
were 4–6 fold increased in persons given PO with or without ID BCG. The fact
that reproducible increases were detected with all TB antigens used to stimulate T
cell responses <italic>in vitro</italic>, further supports our conclusion. Despite
the reproducible increases in TB-specific T cells in subjects given PO BCG, the
responses in PBMC obtained from these subjects on the same day as the BAL procedures
were similar in subjects given ID BCG alone and subjects given PO BCG with or
without ID BCG. These latter results provide additional support for the conclusion
that PO BCG uniquely induced increased TB-specific T cells with lung-trafficking
potential. The BAL procedures were done 1–12 months post-vaccination in
these subjects, further indicating the robustness of our findings. These results,
combined with the sIgA and lymphocyte trafficking molecule expression results
discussed above, provide complementary evidence that PO BCG more strongly induces
multiple mucosal immune responses relevant for protective mucosal TB immunity.</p>
              <p id="P17">We have hypothesized previously(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)
that PO BCG induces differential T cell trafficking compared with ID BCG. The above
findings are consistent with this hypothesis. In addition, the PPD-specific
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses detected in subjects at the end of
this trial support our earlier published results(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) indicating that PO BCG fails to induce PPD-specific DTH responses,
and even may suppress these responses. These results support our earlier conclusion
that PO BCG could provide TB immunity against initial infection without the
induction of PPD-specific delayed type hypersensitivity that can interfere with
detection of latent TB infection and disease.</p>
              <p id="P18">The preliminary CD4+ T cell transcriptomal studies produced
provocative data suggesting that PO and ID BCG vaccination induce distinct profiles
of molecular signatures, which may explain the differences in mucosal and systemic
immune responses induced. The sample size studied in this manner needs to be
expanded with additional stored PBMC to further confirm the validity of our
conclusions, and to allow for studies of correlations between the expression of
specific genes and gene sets and the mucosal and systemic immune responses induced
in this trial. This work is currently ongoing.</p>
              <p id="P19">Further research in this area should focus on at least two major areas to
learn how optimal TB-specific mucosal and systemic immunity can be induced. First,
we have only explored one combined schedule of PO and ID BCG vaccination. Additional
work could investigate the effects of different doses of PO and ID BCG, different
strains of BCG given PO and ID, different sequences of mucosal vs. systemic BCG
vaccination (e.g.-first priming with mucosal vaccination followed at different
intervals by ID vaccination), different routes of mucosal BCG vaccination
(intranasal or aerosolized vaccinations with BCG may induce even stronger
TB-specific lung immunity, although additional safety concerns would need to be
addressed), and mucosal and systemic vaccinations with newer and potentially more
potent TB vaccines. Second, additional studies investigating the molecular events
which drive the induction of optimal mucosal and systemic TB-specific immune
responses are needed to allow further iterative improvements in mucosal and systemic
vaccinations. To this end, the preliminary CD4+ T cell transcriptomal
studies in subjects given PO vs ID BCG vaccination need to be expanded as noted
above.</p>
              <p id="P20">Overall, these results demonstrate that ID BCG induces the strongest
TB-specific systemic immune response, while PO BCG induces the strongest TB-specific
mucosal immune responses. Therefore, these results support our original hypothesis
that mucosal and systemic vaccinations with BCG will induce the optimal combination
of mucosal and systemic immune responses relevant for protection against TB
infection and disease progression. In addition, these results will greatly
facilitate further targeted development of methods for assessing mucosal and
systemic immune responses induced by other TB vaccines.</p>

                <p>Ten subjects were recruited into each of the groups A–F, randomized in a
double blind fashion to receive PO vs ID vs PO+ID Danish BCG. An
additional 8 subjects were recruited into an open label, ID Connaught BCG
vaccination cohort (to compare ID immunity induced by Danish vs Connaught BCG).
During year 1 of the trial, groups A and B were identical (given only ID BCG),
groups C and D were identical (given only PO BCG), and groups E and F were
identical (given both ID and PO BCG). Blood, tear, nasal wash and stool samples
were collected at 9 different time points (pre-vaccination, and 1 week, 2
months, 6 months, 12 months, 12 months plus 1 week, 14 months, 18 months and 24
months post-vaccination).</p>

blood monocytes and infected or not with BCG. The 3 different serial memory
CD4+ T cell populations were cultured for 24 hours with uninfected or
BCG-infected DC, and then RNA harvested for Illumina BeadArray transcriptomal
analysis. Panel A. shows heat maps for the top 100 altered genes comparing day 7
and day 0 direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> responses (PO N=4 and ID

day 7 were the same in PO vs ID BCG recipients. Panel C. shows heat maps for the
top altered genes comparing day 56 and day 0 after re-stimulation with
BCG-infected DC (PO N=4 and ID N=7). Panel D. shows that only 2
of the top altered genes detected at day 56 were the same in PO vs ID BCG
recipients.</p>
