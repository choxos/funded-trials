                <p id="Par1">Whole-exome sequencing of samples from affected members of two unrelated families with late-onset non-syndromic hearing loss revealed a novel mutation (c.2090 T &gt; G; NM_017433) in <italic>MYO3A</italic>. The mutation was confirmed in 36 affected individuals, showing autosomal dominant inheritance. The mutation alters a single residue (L697W or p.Leu697Trp) in the motor domain of the stereocilia protein MYO3A, leading to a reduction in ATPase activity, motility, and an increase in actin affinity. MYO3A-L697W showed reduced filopodial actin protrusion initiation in COS7 cells, and a predominant tipward accumulation at filopodia and stereocilia when coexpressed with wild-type MYO3A and espin-1, an actin-regulatory MYO3A cargo. The combined higher actin affinity and duty ratio of the mutant myosin cause increased retention time at stereocilia tips, resulting in the displacement of the wild-type MYO3A protein, which may impact cargo transport, stereocilia length, and mechanotransduction. The dominant negative effect of the altered myosin function explains the dominant inheritance of deafness.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Hearing loss is the most frequent sensory disability, affecting almost 360 million people of different ages (World Health Organization, WHO, 2012). Multiple causative factors including genetic, environmental, or a combination of both give rise to enormous heterogeneity associated with hearing loss. According to Keats and Berlin (1999), roughly 70% of the hearing loss cases lack additional clinical signs and are categorized as non-syndromic hearing loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Autosomal recessive (DFNB) inheritance is the most common (80% cases) pattern of hearing loss inheritance in genetic cases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iro.es/cx26deaf.html">www.iro.es/cx26deaf.html</ext-link>), whereas only 10–20% of the cases correspond to an autosomal dominant (DFNA) mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Previous studies have mapped approximately 170 loci for non-syndromic hearing loss out of which, only half of the genes have been identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org</ext-link>). It is important to note that, in addition to extensive locus heterogeneity and allelic diversity within the same locus, some genetic mutations lead to a recessive hearing loss while other mutations in the same gene lead to a dominant hearing loss. Most of these mutations lead to an early onset hearing loss phenotype, whereas other mutations result in dominant inheritance and late onset phenotypes. There is a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms of dominant inheritance and/or late onset hearing loss of genetic origin, thus any clinical data related to such phenotypes are vital to understand the molecular basis of hearing loss progression. Moreover, insights into the mechanism can be crucial to develop therapies for late-onset hearing loss cases which may be more amenable to corrective treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Vertebrate class III myosins (MYO3) consists of two isoforms encoded by separate genes, myosin IIIA (<italic>MYO3A</italic>) and myosin IIIB (<italic>MYO3B</italic>). The <italic>MYO3A</italic> gene was mapped to locus DFNB30 in a three-generation Jewish family with individuals affected by autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. NINAC (neither inactivation nor activation potential C) was the first member of MYO3 to be discovered in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. NINAC null mutant flies demonstrated a defective phototransduction cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Members of the unconventional myosin superfamily, class III myosins uniquely have a kinase domain at their N-terminus, followed by a conserved motor domain, two IQ motifs and a class specific C-terminal tail region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Vertebrate MYO3 proteins are actin-dependent motor proteins that move towards the plus end of actin filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. MYO3 dependent transport of espin-1 (ESPN-1) and espin like (ESPNL) from the base to the tips of hair cell stereocilia is thought to be crucial for stereocilia length regulation and maintenance of the staircase-shaped stereocilia bundle organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par4">A mouse model harboring human <italic>MYO3A</italic> mutations (DFNB30) demonstrated significant hearing loss at 2.5 months of age, beginning first at high frequencies and eventually producing hearing loss at all frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Recently, two studies reported novel <italic>MYO3A</italic> mutations associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. The first report revealed an autosomal recessive mutation in a highly conserved residue of the MYO3A motor domain (p.Ser614Phe) from a consanguineous Kazakh family with a congenital hearing-loss phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The second report characterized an autosomal dominant mutation (p.Gly488Glu) in the MYO3A motor domain associated with progressive hearing loss in a two-generation African American family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of the impact of <italic>MYO3A</italic> mutants p.Ser614Phe and p.Gly488Glu on stereocilia structure and function is not well established.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In the current study, we carried out massive parallel whole-exome sequencing of affected individuals from two large unrelated Brazilian families presenting autosomal dominant hearing loss and identified a novel mutation in <italic>MYO3A</italic> on 26 affected members from family 1 and 10 affected individuals from family 2. Thus, this report is the second to implicate <italic>MYO3A</italic> in autosomal dominant hearing loss, suggesting an essential role for this protein in hearing. The novelty of the mutation and the lack of understanding about <italic>MYO3A</italic> associated autosomal dominant hearing loss, motivated us to investigate the molecular basis of the unusual dominant and late-onset phenotype. We hypothesized that the mutant MYO3A would impair the function of the wild-type MYO3A in the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells. We performed a complete functional characterization of the mutant protein using biochemical/biophysical assays of the purified MYO3A motor. Additionally, we performed cell biological analysis of the localization of the mutant MYO3A in actin-based protrusions known as filopodia and in stereocilia. Our results allowed us to propose a model for how the mutation leads to a dominant negative impact on the function of MYO3A in inner ear hair cell stereocilia.</p>

Family 2 presented a congenital hearing loss case, and the age of onset ranged from 0 to 36 years.

                <p id="Par7">We collected 52 samples from affected and unaffected individuals from family 1. Whole exome sequencing was performed in four samples of this family with paired-end reads of 99 base pairs, to an average coverage of 120× per individual. All exonic or splicing variants present in the four affected individuals, that were not detected in 62 Brazilian whole-exome sequencing control samples, were screened for quality and checked against the 1000 Genomes Project public variant database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org/">http://www.1000genomes.org/</ext-link>), the 6500 exomes database from Washington University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>) and the Brazilian ABraOM database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abraom.ib.usp.br">http://abraom.ib.usp.br</ext-link>). Sixteen variants with a frequency of less than 1% in control populations were identified, however, because of the dominant pattern in the pedigree, only the four variants that have never been reported in controls (1000 Genomes, 6500 ESP exomes, and ABraOM) were selected for primary analysis (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Two of the four variants were selected first for segregation studies because the candidate genes could be functionally related to hearing loss. The variant c.1543 C &gt; T: p.Gln515*, 16:48.333.581 in gene <italic>LONP2</italic> (NM_031490) is a nonsense mutation. The variant c.2090 T &gt; G: p.Leu697Trp, [hg19]chr10:26.414.513 in the gene <italic>MYO3A</italic> (NM_017433.4) is a nonsynonymous substitution mutation, in a gene that has already been related to autosomal recessive hearing loss. Polyphen2 predictions indicated a probability of being damaging of 98.9% (score of 0.989) for p.Leu697Trp in MYO3A. SIFT and Mutation Taster also provided a damaging prediction (scores of 1 and 0.0001, respectively).</p>
                <p id="Par8">All 52 samples collected from family 1 were screened by Sanger sequencing for the presence of the variants c.2090 T &gt; G(<italic>MYO3A</italic>) and c.1543 C &gt; T(<italic>LONP2</italic>). The variant in the <italic>LONP2</italic> gene does not co-segregate with the phenotype, but the variant in the <italic>MYO3A</italic> gene was shown to correlate with the phenotype and it was present in 26 of 27 affected individuals. It was absent in one exceptional affected individual presenting unilateral hearing loss (V-38, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), who reported the onset of hearing loss on the right ear after infection at the age of six. In addition, the <italic>MYO3A</italic> variant was found in two unaffected individuals (VI-18; VI-22, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) who are below the average age of onset (28 and 29). Two-point Lod scores were calculated, one point being the phenotype of hearing loss and the second being the presence of the variant c.2090 T &gt; G. The Lod score obtained with Merlin software was 9.50.</p>
                <p id="Par9">A similar strategy of filtering variants was applied to the four samples of family 2. A total of 75 exonic or splicing variants were present in the four affected individuals, with a frequency &lt;1% in 1000 Genomes Project public variant database, the 6500 exomes database from Washington University, and the Brazilian ABraOM database. Once again, only 4 variants were not present in the control population and among those there was the same variant in <italic>MYO3A</italic> identified in family 1 (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Since the segregation of hearing loss with variant c.2090 T &gt; G (<italic>MY03A</italic>) was confirmed in family 1, its transmission in family 2 was promptly investigated. It was found to be present in 10 affected patients and was detected in only one of the 10 unaffected individuals (IV-11, Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), who is 30 years old. This individual presents normal thresholds, but complains of tinnitus. Another exceptional affected individual without the mutation was found in family 2 (IV-2, Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) and noise induced hearing loss was suspected as the cause of hearing loss. A Lod score of 3.31 was obtained in family 2.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Inspection of the seven-generation pedigree of family 1 did not show any link to family members of family 2. To examine the possibility of kinship between the individuals of the two pedigrees, IBD analyses was performed in pairs, including 5 individuals from family 1 and 5 individuals from family 2, genotyped with the SNP array - Axiom Human Origins. In 16 pairs of individuals, there was no evidence of a close relationship. However, in 9 pairs, the kinship coefficient was equivalent to second cousins (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The examination of shared haplotypes revealed all 10 individuals share a 560.878pb haplotype that includes 131 SNPs. These data indicate the mutation probably has a common origin in the two families, who are remotely related.</p>

The L697W mutation maps in the motor domain of MYO3A (amino acids 340-988 of NM_017433.4). To localize the L697W mutation in the MYO3A motor domain structure, we generated a homology model using SWISS-MODEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and the human MYO10 structure (PDB ID: 5i0h) as a template (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A, B</xref>).

                <p id="Par13">The impact of the L697W mutation on MYO3A biochemical and biophysical properties were examined using purified human MYO3A. The kinase domain of MYO3A is known to autophosphorylate the MYO3A motor and reduce motor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which may have an impact on its cellular localization and function. To examine the effect of the L697W mutation on MYO3A without any influence of autoregulation, we used MYO3A constructs lacking the kinase domain (MYO3AΔK) for our biochemical and cell-biological experiments. We used C-terminal GFP tagged wild-type and L697W MYO3A constructs lacking the kinase domain and containing the motor and 2IQ domains (MYO3AΔK 2IQ c-GFP) for ATPase and <italic>in vitro</italic> motility experiments. The C-terminal GFP tag was used to attach the protein to the surface of coverslips coated with anti-GFP antibody to perform the <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assay. Our results show that the construct containing the mutation (MYO3AΔK 2IQ L697W) has a ~7 fold lower maximal ATPase rate and ~2 fold higher actin affinity (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C, E</xref>) compared to the corresponding WT construct. The actin dependence of the ATPase activity (K<sub>ATPase</sub>) of the L697W mutant was reduced at least 2-fold indicating that the mutant reaches maximal ATPase activity at extremely low actin concentrations.

We hypothesized that because of its unique kinetic properties, MYO3A L697W could exert a dominant negative effect on MYO3A WT function by competing and displacing MYO3A WT from its characteristic tipward accumulation in actin protrusions. We examined the tip localization profiles of mCherry-MYO3A WT and GFP-MYO3A L697W when coexpressed in the presence and absence of untagged ESPN-1.</p>
                <p id="Par19">In absence of ESPN-1, GFP-MYO3AWT and mCherry-MYO3AWT coexpression in COS7 cells showed overlapping fluorescence profiles with a steep tip-to-base gradient at the filopodia tips (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). Coexpression of MYO3A WT and MYO3A L697W also demonstrated a steep tip-to-base gradient but MYO3A L697W exhibited a slightly more tipward position compared to MYO3A WT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Similarly, in presence of ESPN-1, coexpression of GFP-MYO3A WT and mCherry-MYO3A WT showed a robust overlap of the fluorescence profiles at the filopodia tips for both WT-tagged proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Whereas coexpression of GFP-MYO3A L697W and mCherry-MYO3A WT in the presence of ESPN-1 demonstrated a predominant tipward localization of MYO3A L697W with MYO3A WT trailing behind with a relatively shallower tip-to-base gradient (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Interestingly, the sum of the MYO3A WT and L697W fluorescent intensity profiles (grey line, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>) shows a tip to base comet tail decay similar to that observed when expressing GFP- MYO3A WT or mCherry-MYO3A WT, indicating that the overall distribution of MYO3A is not affected when the combination of both WT and L697W mutant forms are present. These data suggest that MYO3A L697W displaces MYO3A WT from the tips of actin protrusions and that this effect is enhanced in the presence of ESPN-1 cargo. Our actin binding data combined with cellular localization observations suggests that this could be a result of MYO3A L697W presenting a higher stability (residency time) at the tips. These observations support our hypothesis that MYO3A L697W can exert dominant negative effect on MYO3A WT.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Cargo specific tip localization behavior of MYO3A L697W.

                <p id="Par20">MYO3A is known to localize at the tips of vertebrate hair cell stereocilia in a steep tip-to-base gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The differing tip localization pattern of MYO3A WT and MYO3A L697W when coexpressed in the presence and absence of ESPN-1 in COS7 cells prompted us to examine their localization pattern in hair cell stereocilia. Exogenous coexpression of mCherry-MYO3A WT and GFP-MYO3A L697W in mouse cochlear explants demonstrated a consistent tipward localization of MYO3A L697W and proximal localization of MYO3A WT in both auditory and vestibular hair cell stereocilia (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E–H</xref>). This localization pattern was similar to the localization pattern we observed in COS7 cells coexpressing MYO3A WT, MYO3A L697W and ESPN-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), confirming that MYO3A L697W can exert a dominant negative effect by displacing the MYO3A WT protein from the tips of stereocilia.</p>

              <p id="Par21">Walsh <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> investigated a three-generation Jewish family with individuals presenting an onset of hearing loss near the second decade of life and affected by autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Three different mutations were identified in <italic>MYO3A</italic> (DFNB30) in this study and all the affected individuals carried at least two of these mutations, some of them being homozygotes and others being compound heterozygotes for the mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Since then, several reports have identified additional <italic>MYO3A</italic> mutations associated with autosomal recessive hearing loss.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The variant described in the current study has not been reported in any of the mutation databases (1000 Genomes Project, 6500 Exomes, and ExAC), and prediction programs indicated it as likely pathogenic. Our genetic and clinical data from two unrelated families clearly show that the mutation segregates with autosomal dominant hearing loss. The <italic>MYO3A</italic> variant c.2090 T &gt; G identified in this work leads to a substitution of amino acid 697 in MYO3A motor domain, replacing leucine with tryptophan. The leucine 697 is located in the U50 domain of MYO3A motor, exposed to the solvent and far from the ATP-binding pocket and the actin-binding domain. However, when we introduced the mutation in the predicted MYO3A structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>), we observed a clash between tryptophan 697 and lysine 462 that may disrupt the conformational changes in the U50 domain. Spectroscopic and crystallographic studies have demonstrated that conformational changes in the U50 domain are coordinated with the movement of the conserved switch I region of the active site, which is critical for coordinating nucleotide binding and hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Since the U50 domain also interacts with actin, its conformation is altered by actin binding and the conformation of switch I in the active site and vice-versa. Our biochemical and biophysical data suggests that the mutation could impair the actin-activation of ADP release and slow the ADP release rate constant. The slower ADP release rate constant would be consistent with the slower ATPase and <italic>in vitro</italic> motility of MYO3A L697W we measured, suggesting that the mutant has an increase in duty ratio (fraction of the ATPase cycle that myosin motor is bound to actin). Indeed direct measurements of steady-state actin affinity (K<sub>Actin</sub>) and the actin-dependence of the ATPase assay (K<sub>ATPase</sub>) indicate that the L697W mutant enhances duty ratio and overall actin affinity of MYO3A. Interestingly, leucine 697 is conserved in all MYO3 family members, but it is not conserved in other myosins. The observation that a single amino acid change in this particular location of the MYO3A motor domain affects protein function may help elucidate the unique structure-function mechanisms proposed for this unique motor (e.g. proposed MYO3 inchworm motility mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>).</p>
              <p id="Par23">In our previous study, we proposed that tip localized MYO3A functions as a motorized actin crosslinker, a property which would require an active motor domain and intact tail domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our previous results demonstrated that MYO3A lacking an intact tail domain retains tip localization but fails to induce or elongate actin protrusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our current results demonstrate that MYO3A L697W with reduced motor activity also retains a tip localization phenotype, however, shows a significantly reduced ability to induce and elongate actin protrusions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that MYO3A requires an active motor domain and intact tail domain for tip localization as well as actin protrusion initiation and elongation activity. Our results are consistent with previously published data and we predict that the reduced actin protrusion elongation activity of MYO3A L697W is correlative to its reduced motor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It is important to note that although the MYO3A L697W mutant is able to tip localize in actin based protrusions (filopodia and stereocilia), the members of the two pedigrees carrying the mutation developed deafness. We believe that our results demonstrating reduced actin protrusion initiation and elongation activity of tip localized MYO3A L697W in the absence or presence of ESPN-1 (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A–D</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A–D</xref>), partially explains the dominant negative impact of this mutant form. Furthermore, coexpression of MYO3A WT with MYO3A L697W in the presence or absence of ESPN-1 rescued filopodia initiation but not filopodia elongation activity (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E–H</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E–H</xref>), demonstrating the dominant negative effect of the mutant form on actin protrusion elongation.</p>
              <p id="Par24">It has been proposed that the ability of MYO3A to transport ESPN-1, ESPNL and Protocadherin-15 along parallel actin bundle-based protrusions is crucial for maintaining the ultrastructure and function of the vertebrate inner ear hair cell stereocilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The specificity of interactions between MYO3 isoforms and its proposed cargo leads to differential regulation of stereocilia length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For example, ESPNL has been shown to facilitate shorter actin protrusions in the presence of MYO3A and longer actin protrusions in the presence of MYO3B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. MYO3A and MYO3B coexpression in the presence of ESPN-1 lead to a differential tip localization pattern, such that MYO3A WT predominantly occupies a tipward position, while MYO3B localizes proximally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It is believed that the combination of higher motor activity and actin binding affinity of MYO3A compared to MYO3B is a major cause for the observed distribution pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In this study, we observed a difference in the fluorescence profiles of MYO3A WT and MYO3A L697W when coexpressed in the presence or absence of ESPN-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A–D</xref>). It is important to note that there is an enhanced distribution of MYO3A WT and MYO3A L697W fluorescence peaks at actin protrusion tips in the presence of ESPN-1 compared to their distribution in the absence of ESPN-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The enhanced distribution of MYO3A WT and MYO3A L697W fluorescence peaks in the presence of ESPN-1 highlights the complexity of MYO3A regulation in the presence of its multiple cargoes within the vertebrate hair cell stereocilia.</p>
              <p id="Par25">We speculate that the enhanced duty ratio of MYO3A L697W may allow it to be retained at the distal actin protrusion tips more efficiently than MYO3A WT. The observed inversely proportional amounts of MYO3A WT and MYO3A L697W at the overlapping regions near the filopodia tips suggest that the two proteins may be competing to occupy a distal (tipward) position. Our results are suggestive of a mechanism where MYO3A L697W is capable of transporting ESPN isoforms from the base to the tips of stereocilia, however, it may not be able to influence the ESPN turnover rate similar to MYO3A WT, which may gradually lead to stereocilia degeneration. It is also possible that MYO3A L697W is unable to maintain the turnover and function of Protocadherin-15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, a crucial component of the mechanotransduction complex or inner hair cells essential for hearing. Overall, these results suggest that although MYO3A L697W could compete with MYO3A WT and retain tip localization phenotype, MYO3A L697W cannot compensate for retaining normal actin regulation and cargo transport functionality. The predominant tipward localization pattern demonstrated by MYO3A L697W in both filopodia and stereocilia strengthens our hypothesis that the dominant tipward localization phenotype may be a major factor that contributes to the gradual loss of hearing function. The gradual hearing loss phenotype highlights that MYO3A and its cargoes are crucial for maintaining stereocilia length and function, but also demonstrates that compensatory mechanisms for lack of function mutations in MYO3A can be quite complex.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Interestingly, the variant was found in two unaffected individuals from family 1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, VI-18 and VI-22) who are young (28 and 29 years old), below the maximum age of onset of hearing loss observed in other family members, and in one individual (30 years old) from family 2 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, IV-11). We speculate that they are non-penetrant or late-onset carriers. It is also possible that MYO3B could partially compensate for the effects of mutations in MYO3A and the effectiveness of this compensation could vary among individuals, explaining non-penetrance and differences in age of onset of hearing loss. MYO3B has a slightly different spatiotemporal expression pattern than MYO3A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and the possibilities for its involvement in the delay of the onset of hearing loss in individuals with the dominant MYO3A L697W mutation are complex and difficult to predict. The presence of congenital hearing loss in individual V:1, from family 2 is also noteworthy. Hearing loss was detected at birth after neonatal screening and the child underwent cochlear implantation at the age of 2. Frequent mutations associated with hearing loss were excluded in this case (Sanger sequencing of <italic>GJB2</italic> gene, screening of deletions in <italic>GJB6</italic> gene and m.1555 A &gt; G mutation were performed). The contribution of either environmental or genetic factors in causing early onset of hearing loss cannot be ruled out.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The first known deafness causing MYO3A dominant mutation (MYO3A G488E) was reported recently in a small African American family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The G488E mutation is located near the switch I region of the MYO3A motor domain and reduces the ATPase activity and increases <italic>in vitro</italic> actin sliding velocity compared to MYO3A WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It was also demonstrated that MYO3A G488E was capable of reaching the tips of rat organotypic inner ear culture stereocilia, and showed a localization pattern similar to that seen for wild-type MYO3A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, MYO3A G488E failed to tip localize in COS7 cell filopodia. Thus, although both L697W and G488E mutations are associated with dominant phenotypes, their impact on the structure and/or function of the MYO3A motor is distinct. It will be interesting to further examine the impact of these mutations on the kinetic steps of MYO3A ATPase cycle and their differential impact on cellular functions. Overall, our results highlight that MYO3A mutations leading to subtle changes in biochemical properties appear to have a major impact on stereocilia initiation and ultrastructure maintenance. Our results suggest that a combination of 1) complexity of MYO3- multiple cargo system, 2) competition and compensation of the mutant MYO3A with MYO3A WT and MYO3B WT, and 3) proposed redundant function of MYO3B WT in the absence of MYO3A, may contribute to the observed variation in the age of hearing loss onset and extent of progression.</p>

Briefly, the mutant and WT MYO3A motor ATPase was examined in the presence of a range of actin concentrations in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used to determine the K<sub>ATPase</sub> (actin concentration at which the ATPase activity is one-half maximal) and k<sub>cat</sub> (maximal actin-activated ATPase rate), using a hyperbolic fit of the ATPase rates as a function of actin concentration.</p>

                <p id="Par38">The steady-state actin affinity of MYO3AΔK 2IQ c-GFP in the presence of ATP was measured using an actin co-sedimentation assay. MYO3A (0.5 µM) was equilibrated with various actin concentrations (0–60 µM) in KMg50 buffer containing the ATP regeneration system (20 unit s<sup>−1</sup>·ml<sup>−1</sup> pyruvate kinase and 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate). MYO3A was pre-spun for 10 min at 4 °C (TLA.120.1 rotor at 95,000 rpm) prior to equilibrating it with actin. We added 1 mM ATP and immediately centrifuged the samples for 10 min at 25 °C (TLA.120.1 rotor at 95,000 rpm). The supernatant was examined by GFP fluorescence using a 96 well plate reader (ex:485 nm/em: 530 nm long pass). The fraction bound was determined by examining the relative decrease in GFP fluorescence in the supernatant compared to the sample without actin [1 − (sup/0 actin sup)]. The supernatant and pellet were also examined by SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining to detect MYO3A. The intensity of the MYO3A bands was examined using ImageJ and the fraction bound was calculated [(pellet/(supernatant + pellet)]. The plot of fraction bound as a function of actin concentration was fit to a hyperbolic function to determine the steady-state actin affinity (K<sub>actin</sub>). Both the coomassie staining and GFP fluorescence methods yielded similar results.</p>

Briefly, the nitrocellulose-coated glass coverslip surface was coated with anti-GFP antibody (Life Technologies). The surface of the coverslip was then blocked with 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA solution in KMg50 buffer, followed by addition of C-terminal GFP tagged MYO3AΔK 2IQ WT or MYO3AΔK 2IQ L697W. Rhodamine labelled F-actin was then added to the flow chamber which was followed by the addition of activation buffer, which consisted of KMg50 supplemented with 0.35% methylcellulose, 1 mM DTT, 10 µM calmodulin, 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA, 2 mM ATP and an ATP regeneration system (20 units ml<sup>−1</sup> pyruvate kinase, 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate). To reduce photobleaching 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> glucose, 0.1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> glucose oxidase and catalase were included in the activation buffer. After the addition of activation buffer, the motility of the rhodamine-phalloidin labeled F-actin filaments was observed using Nikon TE2000 microscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.
