                <p id="Par1">Immunization with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Pf) sporozoites under chemoprophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac) is the most efficacious approach to malaria vaccination. Implementation is hampered by a complex chemoprophylaxis regimen and missing evidence for efficacy against heterologous infection. We report the results of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a simplified, condensed immunization regimen in malaria-naive volunteers (EudraCT-Nr: 2018-004523-36). Participants are immunized by direct venous inoculation of 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge) of the PfNF54 strain or normal saline (placebo) on days 1, 6 and 29, with simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg/kg chloroquine base. Primary endpoints are vaccine efficacy tested by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) using the highly divergent, heterologous strain Pf7G8 and safety. Twelve weeks following immunization, 10/13 participants in the vaccine group are sterilely protected against heterologous CHMI, while (5/5) participants receiving placebo develop parasitemia (risk difference: 77%, p = 0.004, Boschloo’s test). Immunization is well tolerated with self-limiting grade 1–2 headaches, pyrexia and fatigue that diminish with each vaccination. Immunization induces 18-fold higher anti-Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) antibody levels in protected than in unprotected vaccinees (p = 0.028). In addition anti-PfMSP2 antibodies are strongly protection-associated by protein microarray assessment. This PfSPZ-CVac regimen is highly efficacious, simple, safe, well tolerated and highly immunogenic.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">The global disease burden of malaria is a major public health challenge. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated a total of 228 million cases and 405,000 deaths in 2018 worldwide; the majority caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Pf) in sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite the decreasing incidence in many countries, the economic and social consequences of malaria are still enormous. New interventions for prevention and treatment are critically needed to control and eradicate the disease. An effective vaccine would be an ideal additional tool to reach this goal. However, developing a vaccine against parasites is particularly challenging because of their complexity in genome size, life cycle, epidemiology, and immunology. The only vaccine against malaria that has completed clinical development is RTS,S, a recombinant protein vaccine targeting the Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), the predominant sporozoite surface protein. It received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency in 2015 but has not received marketing approval (licensure) so far due to moderate vaccine efficacy (VE) and inconclusive safety signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Whole-cell Pf sporozoite (PfSPZ)-based vaccines are a promising way to evoke immunity, since a broad antigenic repertoire of the parasite is present in the pre-erythrocytic development stages, especially in the liver phase.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The history of attempts in humans to develop such a vaccine dates back to the 1970s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The translation of experimental immunization using mosquito bites into a candidate vaccine was only recently achieved by developing aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ for use in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Availability of PfSPZ products boosted the development of malaria vaccines. It was shown in previous trials that immunization with whole-cell sporozoites, either radiation-attenuated (PfSPZ Vaccine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or chemoattenuated by the concomitant administration of an antimalarial (PfSPZ chemoprophylaxis vaccine, PfSPZ-CVac)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, is highly immunogenic and induces robust protection against homologous (vaccine) strain-controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). However, after mosquito bite immunization with this approach, which is called chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS), VE against heterologous (non-vaccine) strain CHMI was minimal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In our previous PfSPZ-CVac trial TÜCHMI-002 (NCT02115516), we showed that direct venous inoculation (DVI) administration of three doses of 5.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ Challenge (infectious PfSPZ) over 8 weeks under weekly chloroquine (CQ) chemoprophylaxis protected 100% (9/9) of study participants against CHMI conducted with the homologous (vaccine) strain of Pf and performed 10 weeks after immunization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. CQ, a blood schizonticide without effect on liver stages, was selected as the partner drug rather than a liver active drug to allow parasite multiplication within hepatocytes, thereby increasing the antigenic stimulus and the expression of late liver stage and early blood stage antigens. However, this regimen was suboptimal for a routine setting as it required 13 clinic visits including ten for administration of CQ. In the second cohort of this trial, a condensed immunization regimen requiring fewer doses of CQ was selected. Here, three doses of 5.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ Challenge at 5- or 14-day intervals protected 63% (5/8) and 67% (6/9) of volunteers, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These results indicated that shorter regimens with fewer doses of CQ could be used, although potentially at the cost of reduced VE.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Building on these data, the aim of the current study was to establish a condensed immunization regimen of three injections of PfSPZ Challenge offering improved VE compared to the prior condensed regimens. To compensate for the potentially reduced VE due to the condensed regimen and heterologous CHMI, the dose was increased from the previously administered dose (5.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ Challenge)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> to a dose of 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ Challenge per injection. To facilitate the procedure for future application (e.g. in endemic countries and for travelers) CQ was given only on the days of PfSPZ Challenge injection, thereby requiring only three visits to complete vaccination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Additionally, we aimed to determine if a condensed regimen with increased dose of PfSPZ Challenge protected against heterologous CHMI.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Diagram illustrating the differences between the established and current vaccination regimen for PfSPZ-CVac (CQ).</title><p><bold>a</bold> The previously used vaccination regimen included 13 clinic visits during 9 weeks, 10 for administration of CQ, and 3 for immunizations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <bold>b</bold> The immunization regimen assessed in this study included three clinic visits during 4 weeks, three for administration of CQ, and the same three for immunizations.

                <p id="Par8">We enrolled 21 volunteers from 30 April 2019 to 15 May 2019. One participant dropped out due to a new onset ECG abnormality on Day 1 before any study treatment was given. Hence, 20 volunteers were randomized and received at least one immunization (intention to treat population). A total of 18 participants underwent all three immunizations and CHMI (per protocol population). Two volunteers withdrew consent after the second immunization and received rescue treatment with atovaquone/proguanil on Days 34, 35, and 36 (later identified as placebo recipients). Third immunization was postponed in the case of one volunteer (to Day 35 instead of Day 28) because of an acute gastroenteritis (later identified as placebo recipient).

Participants developed parasitemia detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) with a median prepatent period of 7 days (interquartile range (IQR) 0) after CHMI; median peak parasite density was 2925 parasites/ml (IQR 2168–6218) in the three unprotected vaccine participants and 11,555 parasites/ml (IQR 7937–12,563) in the placebo group. Median time to treatment threshold was 9 days (IQR 9.0–10.0) in the placebo group and 10 days (IQR 9.5–12.0) in the unprotected vaccinated participants, which was not significantly different (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

                <p id="Par12">There were no related grade 3 adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) during the immunization phase, but there was one unrelated grade 3 AE, a case of diastolic hypertension. In all, 222 grade 1 or 2 AEs occurred during the immunization period. One hundred and thirty-five (109 in vaccinees and 26 in controls) were considered as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational product (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Headache and/or dizziness occurred in 92.3% of vaccinees and 71.4% of controls, and fatigue in 69.2% of vaccinees and 42.9% of the controls, suggesting that CQ may have played a significant role in causing AEs. Solicited grade 1 and 2 AEs within the first 5 days following the first and third immunization are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Nervous system disorders occurred in 46% of vaccinees and 43% of placebo controls after the first vaccination/CQ treatment, and 46% and 14% after third vaccination/CQ treatment for vaccinees and placebo controls, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par21">Immunization with chemoattenuated PfSPZ in a condensed regimen with three doses of 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ administered on Days 1, 6, and 29 with 10 mg/kg CQ base protected 77% of malaria-naive volunteers against heterologous CHMI 12 weeks after the immunization. This study established three key principles that are critical for moving forward with PfSPZ-CVac: (1) VE was demonstrated against a heterologous strain of Pf parasite, (2) VE was achieved after a 4-week immunization period, and (3) VE and safety were achieved while administering CQ only on the days of administration of PfSPZ.</p>
              <p id="Par22">For implementation of this vaccine for use in endemic areas, it was crucial to demonstrate VE against heterologous CHMI. It has been reported that immunization by mosquito bite gave only minimal protection against heterologous CHMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Here, we used Pf7G8, which originates from Brazil. Compared to PfNF54, Pf7G8 possesses tens of thousands of genetic variations, including regulatory and immunologically important regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. More importantly, Pf7G8 varies more from PfNF54 at the genome, proteome, and CD8 T cell immunome level than do &gt;700 Pf strains from East, West, and Central Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it has been shown that when the same immunization regimen of PfSPZ Vaccine is administered, it is more difficult to protect against heterologous CHMI with Pf7G8 than against field acquired malaria in Mali<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We think that we achieved such good VE against a heterologous parasite, because we increased the immunizing dose more than twofold from our studies that gave 100% VE against homologous CHMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and because immunization on Days 1 and 6 achieves multi-dose priming, which enhances VE. In the mosquito bite CPS studies that did not show heterologous VE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the subjects were immunized with only a maximum of bites from 15 infected mosquitoes three times (total of 45). It requires the bites of five Pf-infected mosquitoes or 3.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge to achieve 100% infection of subjects in CHMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The two systems to infect humans with Pf sporozoites are difficult to compare directly, as the number of Pf sporozoites injected by a mosquito is highly variable, but nevertheless we estimate that the dose of 15 mosquito bites is the equivalent of 9.6 × 10<sup>3</sup> PfSPZ, which is approximately a 10-fold lower dose than the 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ we used in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par23">A number of CPS and PfSPZ-CVac regimens with different routes of administration (mosquito bite, intradermal injection, DVI), intervals between doses and numbers of doses of PfSPZ have been assessed in the last decade with intention to evoke sterile VE. With PfSPZ administered by mosquito bite (CPS) or by DVI (PfSPZ-CVac), VE was 75–100%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> against homologous CHMI using longer vaccination schedules (three doses at 4-week intervals). Our results from a former PfSPZ-CVac trial suggested that shorter three-dose regimens—desirable for general use—show reduced VE. Therefore, in retesting a 5-day interval between the first and second doses in this trial, we increased the dose of PfSPZ and delayed the third dose from Day 11 to Day 29 to improve VE. The increased dose of PfSPZ might raise concerns about a higher parasite density at the time of parasite egress from the liver with more pronounced symptoms and signs of malaria, eventually carrying a higher risk of a possible breakthrough infection during the immunization phase. However, our data showed that parasitemia was at submicroscopic levels and was efficaciously cleared by the simplified dosing of CQ during immunization. However, as in the previous study, parasite egress into the blood 7–9 days after the first immunization was associated with a non-significant, self-limiting increase in grade 1 or 2 headaches (62% of vaccinees), pyrexia (32%), and fatigue (31%); the incidence rate was lower after second and third doses (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par24">In previous studies we administered a loading dose of 10 mg/kg CQ base 2 days before the first immunization and then 5 mg/kg weekly thereafter through 5 days after the last immunization for a total of 10 doses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is a rigorous schedule to follow and we have been concerned that if after administration of the first dose of PfSPZ, vaccinees were lost to follow-up and did not take their subsequent CQ doses, they could develop malaria. In this study the CQ was administered prior to each dose, ensuring the CQ was swallowed and retained before PfSPZ were administered (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For all three doses 10 mg/kg CQ base was administered. This approach was adequate to kill all the blood stage parasites. However, 71.4% of the controls had headache and/or dizziness, which we speculate to be attributed to CQ.</p>
              <p id="Par25">It would be useful if it was possible to predict protective efficacy. One possibility might be the prediction of protection based on the peak parasitemias seen after each immunizing dose. After the first and second doses, vaccinees who were protected had greater median levels of peak parasitemia (1187 vs 501 after first dose and 651 vs 150 after second dose). We will continue to investigate whether RT-qPCR results can be used to predict protective efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par26">A number of studies of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that protected vaccinees had significantly higher antibodies to PfSPZ as measured by PfCSP ELISA, PfSPZ immunofluorescence assay, and/or inhibition of sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our previous study of PfSPZ-CVac, the nine highest dose subjects had the highest levels of antibodies to PfCSP, but all were protected, so we could not try to correlate protection with antibody level. In the intermediate dose group 6/9 were protected, and the difference in PfCSP antibody levels between protected and infected subjects was not significant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this study the 10 protected vaccinees had significantly higher levels of antibodies to PfCSP 2 weeks after the last immunization, and prior to CHMI, than did the three infected vaccinees. This indicates that anti-PfCSP antibodies either play a role in protection and/or are a biomarker for other protective immune responses. In animal studies protection by sporozoite vaccines is dependent on cellular immune responses, especially CD8 T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, the anti-PfCSP antibody levels can serve as a correlate of protection, even though we cannot elucidate the mechanistic function in this work. Nevertheless, PfCSP-specific antibodies are highly functional in inhibiting sporozoite invasion into the liver and were recently shown to neutralize sporozoites in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In our previous work, using a whole proteome microarray, 22 antigens were identified by qualitative analysis as specifically immunogenic (recognized by 5/9 subjects) after immunization with 5.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ-CVac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Of these 22 antigens, 7 were on the microarray used in this study, including PfCSP, PfMSP4, PfLSA1, PfGLURP, PfLISP2, and two unknown function antigens. Our microarray data confirm the immunogenicity of PfCSP, PfLSA1, and PfLISP2 but we did not identify elevated antibodies against PfMSP4, PfGLURP, or the two unknown function antigens. In addition, we confirmed the immunogenicity of PfMSP2, which has been described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We also identified several novel or less considered markers of vaccination. These include PfMSA180, a protein with unknown function (PF3D7_01083Na00) and the sporozoite surface protein, PfSIAP2. In the microarray studies, only PfMSP2 was consistently recognized by sera from protected vs infected subjects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). The expression of the antigen PfMSP2 has been confirmed by immunofluorescence in day 5 Pf liver stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This result shows that vaccine-induced immunity to the late liver stage is of importance for the protection. The majority of identified immune markers, especially LSA1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>) and MSP2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>), but also SIAP2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>) and most recently MSA180 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>), a merozoite surface protein with assumed function during erythrocyte invasion, have been suggested as promising targets for peptide-based vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Despite the promising, high level and cross-strain protection, our study has limitations. The number of participants in this early phase of clinical development was low. Thus, possible individual differences could lead to overrepresentation of chance effects. Furthermore, the longevity of protection beyond 12 weeks induced by this condensed PfSPZ-CVac regimen needs to be followed-up. The long-term protection against heterologous CHMI is part of the study protocol and will be further investigated. However, in the CPS model, durable immunity for 28 months against homologous CHMI was achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">A 4-week immunization regimen with PfSPZ-CVac, in which the PfSPZ and CQ were administered on the three same days (Days 1, 6, and 29), was a practical and effective immunization strategy that reached more than 75% cross-strain protection in CHMI 12 weeks after immunization. This work is an important step in the clinical development of PfSPZ-CVac for protection against malaria and a milestone towards regulatory approval. Further optimization of the study regimen will include the replacement of oral CQ as the chemoprophylactic drug. To increase tolerability of vaccination and to ensure the administration of the drug, we aim to replace oral CQ by intramuscular pyronaridine.</p>
              <p id="Par30">We believe that PfSPZ-CVac will be an excellent vaccine for travelers to Africa, as usually more than 90% of travelers are voyaging for less than 12 weeks, and a vaccination regimen as proposed here can be well-included into the travel preparation.

The full list of eligibility criteria is listed in the protocol which is available in the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplementary material</xref>.</p>

                <p id="Par34">Participants were randomly allocated to immunization with either 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge (PfNF54) or normal saline as placebo on the day of first vaccination. All vaccinations were administered by DVI in 0.5 ml on Days 1, 6, and 29.</p>
                <p id="Par35">All volunteers received 10 mg/kg CQ base orally (up to a maximum dose of 620 mg CQ base) within 2 h prior to each immunization (Resochin, Bayer Schering Pharma). PfSPZ Challenge (PfNF54) for immunization consisted of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious PfSPZ, strain PfNF54, produced by Sanaria Inc. (Rockville, USA). PfSPZ were stored and transported in liquid nitrogen vapor phase and thawed and diluted at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Tübingen within 20 min before DVI.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Twelve weeks after the last dose of immunization with PfSPZ or placebo, all volunteers underwent CHMI by DVI of 3.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> PfSPZ Challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, using the heterologous Pf strain 7G8 to assess VE. Pf7G8 is derived from a Brazilian isolate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, is antigenically highly divergent from PfNF54 the West African vaccine strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and in prior challenge studies has been harder to protect against than for CHMI using homologous PfNF54 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>), thereby increasing the stringency of the CHMI. Thick blood smear (TBS) and RT-qPCR were performed daily from Day 6 to 21 and on all later follow-up visits (Day 28 and 56) after CHMI as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Subjects were treated regardless of symptoms in case of TBS positivity or three positive PCR results, at least 12 h apart and at least one of them above 100 parasites/ml. First-line treatment was 1000 mg atovaquone and 400 mg proguanil once daily for three consecutive days.</p>

                <p id="Par37">Randomization was performed on the day of first immunization prior to injection by a third party outside the study team and sponsor. The randomization list was generated using a random number generator (Mersenne-Twister implemented in R; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>) and given to a dedicated member of the formulation team who did not have a further role in the trial. The allocation ratio for PfSPZ Challenge to placebo was 2:1. All syringes used were identical and labeled with the volunteer identification code. PfSPZ Challenge (PfNF54) and placebo were both clear fluids and not distinguishable by appearance or consistency. Clinical team, funder, and volunteers remained blinded until database lock. First unblinding was done following an interim database lock after Day 56 of CHMI to allow assessment of VE by an independent statistician.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par38">The aim of the trial was to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a condensed immunization regimen with three doses of PfSPZ Challenge and CQ. The primary VE endpoint was the proportion of protected volunteers. Protection was defined as the absence of parasitemia in the peripheral blood for 28 days after CHMI. According to the study protocol, parasitemia was defined as at least one RT-qPCR result above 100 parasites/ml among three positive results, at least 12 h apart or as a positive TBS.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of related grade 3 and 4 AEs events following the first CQ administration until the end of the trial. Related AEs were recorded and reported using the terminology defined in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).</p>
                <p id="Par40">Further exploratory endpoints were time to parasitemia (defined as the time to the first positive RT-qPCR result among three positive results at least 12 h apart, with at least one of them being above 100 parasites/ml, or the time to a positive TBS) and the characterization of immune responses including the identification of parasitological and immunological correlates of protection against CHMI.</p>

                <p id="Par42">To detect infection rates of 25% or less in the vaccination and 85% in the placebo groups (allocated in a 2:1 ratio) with a power of 80% and a two-tailed alpha of 5%, 14 PfSPZ-CVac immunized, and 7 placebo-treated volunteers were required. Sample size was calculated in R using the nBinomial function provided in the gsDesign package v3.2.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Safety and tolerability data are presented as descriptive analyses. VE was calculated as 1−relative risk of reaching the parasitemia endpoint for vaccinated participants compared to unvaccinated participants. Proportions between immunized and placebo-treated volunteers were compared with an unconditional exact test (Boschloo’s test) using R (exact2x2 package v1.6.5). The level of significance was set at a two-tailed type 1 error alpha &lt;5%.</p>
