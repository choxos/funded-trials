                  <p id="Par1">We previously reported our phase Ib trial, testing the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of T-DM1 + neratinib in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. Patients with ERBB2 amplification in ctDNA had deeper and more durable responses. This study extends these observations with in-depth analysis of molecular markers and mechanisms of resistance in additional patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Forty-nine HER2-positive patients (determined locally) who progressed on-treatment with trastuzumab + pertuzumab were enrolled in this phase Ib/II study. Mutations and HER2 amplifications were assessed in ctDNA before (C1D1) and on-treatment (C2D1) with the Guardant360 assay. Archived tissue (TP0) and study entry biopsies (TP1) were assayed for whole transcriptome, HER2 copy number, and mutations, with Ampli-Seq, and centrally for HER2 with CLIA assays. Patient responses were assessed with RECIST v1.1, and Molecular Response with the Guardant360 Response algorithm.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The ORR in phase II was 7/22 (32%), which included all patients who had at least one dose of study therapy. In phase I, the ORR was 12/19 (63%), which included only patients who were considered evaluable, having received their first scan at 6 weeks. Central confirmation of HER2-positivity was found in 83% (30/36) of the TP0 samples. HER2-amplified ctDNA was found at C1D1 in 48% (20/42) of samples. Patients with ctHER2-amp versus non-amplified HER2 ctDNA determined in C1D1 ctDNA had a longer median progression-free survival (PFS): 480 days versus 60 days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015). Molecular Response scores were significantly associated with both PFS (HR 0.28, 0.09–0.90, <italic>P</italic> = 0.033) and best response (<italic>P</italic> = 0.037). All five of the patients with ctHER2-amp at C1D1 who had undetectable ctDNA after study therapy had an objective response. Patients whose ctHER2-amp decreased on-treatment had better outcomes than patients whose ctHER2-amp remained unchanged. HER2 RNA levels show a correlation to HER2 CLIA IHC status and were significantly higher in patients with clinically documented responses compared to patients with progressive disease (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The following biomarkers were associated with better outcomes for patients treated with T-DM1 + neratinib: (1) ctHER2-amp (C1D1) or in TP1; (2) Molecular Response scores; (3) loss of detectable ctDNA; (4) RNA levels of HER2; and (5) on-treatment loss of detectable ctHER2-amp. HER2 transcriptional and IHC/FISH status identify HER2-low cases (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ and FISH negative) in these heavily anti-HER2 treated patients. Due to the small number of patients and samples in this study, the associations we have shown are for hypothesis generation only and remain to be validated in future studies.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">In 2013, T-DM1 was the first HER2-targeted antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) granted FDA-approval for late-stage metastatic breast cancer after prior trastuzumab. In 2019, T-DM1 was approved as post-neoadjuvant therapy in patients with residual disease based on the KATHERINE trial, demonstrating that post-neoadjuvant T-DM1 was statistically more beneficial than trastuzumab, preventing recurrence of invasive disease or deaths in patients with residual disease in breast or lymph nodes after treatment with trastuzumab ± pertuzumab (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.05: 95% CI 0.039–0.64; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. KATHERINE required archival HER2-positivity but did not mandate HER2 status at study entry. Because multiple studies have confirmed that HER2 status is plastic with conversion of HER2-positive disease to HER2-low (IHC = 0–1+ or IHC 2+ /FISH-negative) under pressure of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], this raised the question of ADC efficacy in HER2-low patients—either de novo (HR + /HER2-negative) or acquired from conversion of HER2-amplified to HER2-low. There are now several breast cancer-targeting ADCs in the pipeline in addition to the newly approved trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Initial approval of T-DXd was for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after prior progression on multiple lines of anti-HER2 therapy (DESTINY-Breast01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In DESTINY-Breast03, T-DXd improved PFS and OS compared to T-DM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in patients with metastatic disease with progression on trastuzumab. In heavily pretreated HER2-low breast cancer patients, T-DXd was evaluated in a single arm phase II study. The objective response rate (ORR) to T-DXd by central review was 37%, with median duration of response of 10.4 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. DESTINY-Breast04, a randomized, multicenter trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, reported highly significant improvements in PFS and OS in patients receiving T-DXd compared to physician choice of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]—a particularly striking observation, because neither trastuzumab nor T-DM1 has shown consistent activity in HER2-low populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. HER2 status (expression, mutation, amplification) is thus emerging as a predictor of clinical efficacy for anti-HER2-therapy. In our NSABP phase Ib trial of HER2-targeted therapies using T-DM1 + neratinib in HER2-positive patients, we showed a discordance in HER2 status between archival tissue and a liquid biopsy obtained at study entry. Loss of ctHER2-amp occurred in 63% (17 of 27) patients. Deeper and more durable responses were observed with T-DM1 + neratinib in patients with ctHER2-amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We now report on an expanded cohort. Our aims were to: (1) confirm activity of T-DM1 + neratinib in patients progressing on a taxane with trastuzumab + pertuzumab (HP), (2) evaluate discordance in HER2 amplification between archived tissue, contemporaneous tissue, and blood, and (3) compare mutation and gene-expression profiles at different time points. Finally, in a subset of patients, we assessed response by RECIST 1.1 with the Guardant Molecular Response score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par7">FB-10 was a single-arm, nonrandomized, unblinded clinical trial approved by participating institutions’ institutional review boards. Written informed consent was required. FB-10 was conducted according to Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
                <p id="Par8">The phase Ib trial was a dose escalation study evaluating T-DM1 + neratinib in women with metastatic HER2-postive breast cancer based on local determination of HER2. Patients received 3.6 mg/kg T-DM1 intravenously on a 3-week cycle and oral neratinib was taken daily in one of four dose cohorts (120, 160, 200 and 240 mg). Twenty-seven patients enrolled, with 5 experiencing a dose-limited toxicity. Three withdrew early for other reasons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Nineteen patients were evaluable for response, which required follow-up imaging after the second cycle of treatment (6 weeks). The recommended phase II dose of neratinib was determined to be 160 mg/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, we did not detect a dose response, i.e., neratinib at 120 mg/d was as effective as higher doses and less toxic.

                <p id="Par9">The phase II expansion included all patients (N = 22) who received at least one dose of study therapy in the analysis of safety and efficacy. Eligibility criteria were identical in phase Ib and phase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All eligible patients had prior HP and a taxane as neoadjuvant therapy or for de novo metastatic disease, had measurable disease, were ECOG PS ≤ 2, with adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function. Patients with known stable brain metastases were eligible. Brain imaging at entry was not required. Treatment in phase II included T-DM1 at 3.6 mg/kg iv q 3 weeks and neratinib at 160 mg/day. Primary diarrhea prophylaxis was mandated as described in phase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par10">Safety assessment was similar in phase Ib and phase II including physical examination, interim history, and laboratory assessments. Patients remained on treatment until progressive disease or discontinuation because of withdrawal, physician discretion or toxicity. For phase Ib patients, adverse event (AE) assessment occurred on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1; on day 1 of each cycle and for 30 days after therapy discontinuation or when alternate therapy began. Phase II AE assessments were made on day 1 of each cycle.</p>

                <title>Response evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par11">In phase Ib, patients were assessed for best response beginning with their first follow-up scan after 2 cycles (6 weeks). Response by RECIST v1.1 was complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progression (PD). In phase II, imaging studies were performed after every 3 cycles (9 weeks). The clinical benefit rate included all CR, PR, and SD patients with duration ≥ 180 days. Patients with stable disease of &lt; 180 days were included with progressive disease patients. A confirmatory scan at least one month after the best response was not required in this study, perhaps accounting for partial responses of short duration in several patients.</p>

                <p id="Par12">Blood samples were required before treatment at cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1), and after treatment at cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1) for all patients in phase Ib and II (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Archived tissue (TP0) of diagnostic blocks or slides were required on all phase Ib and II patients which included 27 patients from phase Ib and 22 patients in phase II. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Contemporaneous biopsy specimens or slides at study entry (TP1) were optional in phase Ib but in phase II, after enrollment of the first 6 patients, the study was amended to require a study entry biopsy.

                <p id="Par13">Samples were analyzed by the Guardant360 assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A), which detects single-nucleotide variants, indels, fusions, and copy number alterations in 74 genes. For HER2 amplification, a cutoff of ≥ 2.14 was used. Where amplification could not be determined because of failed assays or no blood, samples were categorized as indeterminant.

                <title>ctDNA molecular response</title>
                <p id="Par14">Guardant360 Molecular Response is a next generation sequencing (NGS)‐based liquid biopsy that assesses changes in tumor‐derived cell‐free DNA (ctDNA) between baseline and an early on‐treatment timepoint in patients with solid tumor malignancies. It employs an algorithm to identify informative somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions and gene fusions and calculates the percent ctDNA change between the two timepoints based on the mean variant allele frequency (VAF) between two [(mean VAF2/mean VAF1) −1 × 100%]. Using the Molecular Response panel and the Guardant bioinformatics pipeline, the change in ctDNA levels between baseline and the initial follow-up scan (6 weeks in phase I and 9 weeks in phase II) was calculated and the change in VAF determined. Molecular Response is calculated as the ratio of mean VAF on-treatment to baseline with a cutoff of 50%. Decreases in ctDNA of 50%‐100% during this timeframe are associated with clinical benefit in patients on anti‐cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

To overcome this problem, phase Ib RNAs were made library-ready via the HTG EdgeSeq system and the HTP panel, which includes probes to interrogate 19,398 genes representing most of the human transcriptome (details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

In the phase II expansion cohort, in which neratinib was administered at the RP2D of 160 mg/d, the intention was to confirm clinical efficacy and tolerability of the combination and to extend the correlative findings. Given the small sample size, the endpoint analyses remain descriptive.</p>
                <p id="Par23">The aim of the single-arm phase II expansion was to rule out the null hypothesis that the ORR was 25% with the alternative hypothesis of an ORR of 45%. With these assumptions, the sample size required was 22 and the decision rules are to declare success if &gt; 8 responses; to declare failure if &lt; 7 responses; and to consider the trial inconclusive if 7 or 8 responses (7/22 = 32%, 8/22 = 36%). At the outset of the study, we did not anticipate the large number of patients with loss of HER2-amplification in blood as determined by the Guardant assay. Thus, the subset analyses based upon HER-amplification detected in blood were performed post-hoc.</p>

These PIK3CA variants also have the highest VAFs (ranging from 10 to 72% across samples), however, PIK3CA mutations do not appear to influence patient outcomes, because response rates between PIK3CA mutant and WT tumors were similar: 42% (4/12) versus 45% (14/31), respectively. In one case, a PIK3CA mutation was detected only in TP1 but this patient had a PR, again indicating that PIK3CA is not a resistance marker for study therapy.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par40">Approximately 35% of HER2-positive patients may have a loss of HER2 amplification after undergoing chemotherapy + anti-HER2 therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In a retrospective analysis of 525 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) + HP, 141 patients with residual disease had HER2 status determined pre-and post-NAC-HP. HER2 was concordant (positive/positive) in 84/141 (60%). HER2 protein expression was lost (IHC 0) in 13/57 (23%) and designated as HER2-low in 44/57 (77%) including IHC 1 + in 31 and IHC 2 + /FISH non-amplified in 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity is likely one cause of discordant HER2 status between primary and post-treatment residual or metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Other possibilities include decreased HER2 expression, which could be a transient change or a result of the selection of HER2-low subclones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">We have assessed HER2 status before and after pre- and post-study therapy in not only solid tissue but also blood. We have determined the HER2 status in tissues with CLIA IHC/FISH assays, which is the gold standard for HER2 assessment, plus with Ampli-Seq, because it provided a quantitative analysis of HER2 copy number with a greater dynamic range. Ampli-Seq was able to detect a decrease in HER2 copy number in samples that had not lost HER2 amplification based on IHC/FISH. We have also monitored HER2 status in liquid biopsies, which has several advantages over genomic analysis of tissues. Blood has exposure to all potential metastatic sites allowing for the detection of different variants from different metastatic sites. Thus, blood may be more representative of the metastatic tumor than examination of a single biopsied lesion, and may reflect tumor evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Blood samples are more easily collected, making multiple serial collections possible. Collecting multiple serial tissue samples is impractical, costly, and represents a much greater risk to patients than does serial collection of blood. The assessment of ctDNA is a powerful tool, showing very promising results to monitor tumor recurrence and response to therapy, but it does not yet replace the current gold standard, IHC/FISH, for the assessment of HER2 status in solid tumors. However, the monitoring of the HER2 status in ctDNA does provide an indicator of tumor response to therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par42">In our phase Ib/II study, HER2 tissue was amplified in the baseline samples (TP0) (pre- anti-HER2 therapy) in all patients by local determination, however, in liquid biopsies at C1D1 after chemotherapy + HP, HER2-amplification was detected in only 20/42 (48%) of patients. Patients with ctHER2-amp versus non-amplified HER2 ctDNA determined in C1D1 ctDNA had a longer median PFS, 480 days versus 60 days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015). It is expected that patients with HER2 amplification would respond to study therapy (chemotherapy + HP).</p>
              <p id="Par43">Loss of HER2 amplification observed after one cycle of study therapy may indicate that responders are either clearing ctDNA completely or that the amplification falls below the limit of detection. In the 5 cases who were ctHER2 DNA amplified, and completely cleared ctDNA, the response rate was 100%.</p>
              <p id="Par44">We applied a Molecular Response VAF ratio calculation to measure the change in ctDNA from baseline to C2D1, with the hypothesis that an early decrease in ctDNA levels would predict response to T-DM1 + neratinib therapy, as measured by PFS and RECIST response. Indeed, Molecular Response was associated with both PFS and best response to therapy. This should be confirmed in larger dataset, however, our findings are in line with other studies demonstrating the ability of ctDNA to predict short- and long-term efficacy. Early data from the PADA-1 trial suggests that changing therapy based on alterations detected in ctDNA, prior to evidence of progression via imaging, may provide clinical benefit. In that trial, patients with ER + /HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer being treated in the first line setting with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) + palbociclib were monitored for hotspot ESR1 alterations via ctDNA using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Patients with rising ESR1 VAF on therapy, but no synchronous evidence of disease progression via RECIST 1.1, were randomized to either continue receiving an AI + palbociclib or switched to fulvestrant + palbociclib. PADA-1 met its primary efficacy objective, with patients randomized to receive fulvestrant + palbociclib having a significantly longer PFS compared to those who stayed on an AI + palbociclib (median PFS 11.9 months [95% CI 9.1–13.6 months] versus 5.7 months [95% CI 3.9–7.5 months]; stratified HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.43–0.86], two-sided <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. More data on mutational evolution is needed to determine whether similar strategies employing ctDNA to inform change in therapy will be broadly applicable across breast cancer subtypes and therapy classes in order to further prolong OS.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Although a cross comparison of studies can be problematic, phase II and III studies suggest that as patients are more heavily treated with anti-HER2 regimens, the PFS and ORR decrease with each subsequent anti-HER2 therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, in a phase III randomized trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) versus trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients (N = 524) whose disease progressed on anti-HER2 therapy, the reported ORR for patients treated with T-DXd or T-DM1 were 79.7% versus 34.2%, respectively. The landmark analysis of PFS at 12 months was 75.8% with T-DXd as compared to 34.1% with T-DM1 (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.22–0.37; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although both T-DXd and T-DM1 have a trastuzumab backbone, there are substantial differences in the linker-payload chemistry, which favors an increased intracellular payload and a bystander effect with T-DXd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">We have shown in our study that the benefit from T-DM1 + neratinib is limited in HER2-non-amplified tumors. This finding is consistent with a study reporting a PFS with T-DM1 of 1.5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] in patients discordant for HER2 in primary and metastatic tissue (HER2-positive/negative). Although loss of HER2-amplification appears to be one mechanism of resistance to T-DM1, half of the patients with HER2-amplified tumors did not respond to T-DM1 + neratinib, indicating that resistance to T-DM1 is not limited to loss of HER2-amplification. Many other mechanisms of resistance to T-DM1 have been proposed, such as altered cellular uptake, intracellular transport, and metabolism of the payload. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par47">Based on the low level of activity of T-DM1 monotherapy in patients failing HP, we speculate that the combination of T-DM1 and neratinib is more effective than T-DM1 monotherapy. We are unaware of any trials in HER2-positive breast cancer in which patients progressing on HP have been randomized to compare the response to T-DM1 as monotherapy with a combination of T-DM1 and an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). However, in preclinical lung models with ERBB2 mutation and/or amplification, the combination of T-DM1 + neratinib did show increased efficacy over monotherapy. Anecdotally, enhanced efficacy was demonstrated in a breast cancer patient progressing on monotherapy with T-DM1 who then responded with addition of neratinib. The mechanism of action of the antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) such as T-DM1 and T-DXd involves the recognition and binding of the trastuzumab backbone to the extracellular HER2 surface receptor. The ADC-protein complex is internalized with cleavage of the cytotoxic payload. Irreversible TKIs such as neratinib and afatinib (unlike reversible TKIs such as lapatinib) have been shown to enhance HER2 internalization and lysosomal sorting, which has the potential to increase uptake of bound ADC and release of their cytotoxic payload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">The KATHERINE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] study established T-DM1 as a standard of care in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DESTINY-Breast03 has clearly shown superiority of T-DXd over T-DM1 in HER2-positive metastatic disease. The currently recruiting DESTINY-Breast05 study will compare T-DXd with T-DM1 in high-risk HER2-positive patients with residual disease following NAC-HP (NCT04622319). Another study, DESTINY-Breast06 (NCT04494425), will address the question of HER2-low (IHC 1 + or IHC 2 + /FISH-negative or HER2 IHC &gt; 0, &lt; 1 +) in patients with metastatic hormone-positive disease with progression on at least two lines of endocrine therapy comparing T-DXd with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The 30-40% of HER2-positive patients with residual or metastatic disease after neoadjuvant therapy who have lost HER2 amplification, while not directly being addressed with these ADCs studies, warrant further investigation with newer generation ADCs.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Our study has several limitations including the non-randomized design, the logistic difficulties in obtaining samples of blood and tissue on all patients and the small sample size, which limited its power and the ability to perform multivariant analysis.

First, retrospective confirmation in a large phase III study that loss of HER2-expression under the pressure of therapy can be detected with liquid biopsy; second, the overall response, depth, and duration of response to anti-HER2 therapy is greater in patients with HER2-amplified than in non-amplified patients; third, the activity of T-DM1 or other ADCs with a trastuzumab-backbone may be enhanced with addition of an irreversible TKI such as neratinib. This hypothesis, testing the interaction of an ADC with a TKI, reversible and irreversible, could be evaluated in patient-derived xenografts or other model systems and should be validated prior to a randomized trial. Finally, a small fraction of HER2-nonamplified patients did benefit from T-DM1 + neratinib. Possible explanations, which require further investigation, include a false negative assay, enhanced internalization of T-DM1 in presence of neratinib, or EGFR becoming the driver in patients with loss of HER2-amplification, and inhibition by neratinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We also realize that a low ctDNA fraction could have prevented the detection of ctHER2 amplification.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Gene expression analysis revealed several important observations. First, the level of HER2 RNA expression in TP1 tissues was closely correlated with the response rate to study therapy. Second, non-luminal subtypes had a better response rate than luminal tumors, although this difference was not statistically significant. Third, there was a non-significant association of the 8-gene trastuzumab benefit groups with the rate of responses to study therapy. Fourth, changes in intrinsic subtypes were seen between TP0 and TP1 tissue samples, indicating that these changes may be a result of tumors evolving to become resistant to HP. These results highlight the importance of collecting and monitoring molecular changes in tissue samples as patients move through their treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par52">PIK3CA mutations are a known oncogenic driver in breast cancer and drive therapeutic resistance in multiple HER2-targeted therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the EMILIA trial, patients with PIK3CA mutations, treated with capecitabine + lapatinib were associated with a shorter PFS than were patients with wild-type tumors; however, in patients treated with T-DM1 this was not the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We likewise see that in patients treated with T-DM1 + neratinib, PIK3CA mutations were not associated with outcomes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a subset of patients, refractory to T-DM1 + neratinib with PIK3CA mutations, may be responsive to PIK3CA inhibitors.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par53">We demonstrate the usefulness of serial assessment of HER2 status in blood and tissue in patients with an initial diagnosis of HER2-positive disease. Loss of HER2 amplification in ctDNA, or the complete loss of ctDNA on treatment with T-DM1 + neratinib, was associated with clinical benefit. Further, we show that many of the patients with short-lived PR or PD were HER2-low in tissue. These patients may be better treated with the recently approved ADC, trastuzumab deruxtecan. We observed that the ADC, T-DM1, plus neratinib, was well tolerated. The combination with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor with other ADCs warrants investigation.</p>
