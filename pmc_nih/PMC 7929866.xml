                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Although intravesical BCG is the standard treatment of high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), response rates remain unsatisfactory. In preclinical models, rapamycin enhances BCG vaccine efficacy against tuberculosis and the killing capacity of γδ T cells, which are critical for BCG’s antitumor effects. Here, we monitored immunity, safety, and tolerability of rapamycin combined with BCG in patients with NMIBC.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A randomized double-blind trial of oral rapamycin (0.5 or 2.0 mg daily) versus placebo for 1 month was conducted in patients with NMIBC concurrently receiving 3 weekly BCG instillations (NCT02753309). The primary outcome was induction of BCG-specific γδ T cells, measured as a percentage change from baseline. Post-BCG urinary cytokines and immune cells were examined as surrogates for local immune response in the bladder. Secondary outcomes measured were adverse events (AEs) and tolerability using validated patient-reported questionnaires.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Thirty-one patients were randomized (11 placebo, 8 rapamycin 2.0 mg, and 12 rapamycin 0.5 mg). AEs were similar across groups and most were grade 1–2. One (12.5%) patient randomized to 2.0 mg rapamycin was taken off treatment due to stomatitis. No significant differences in urinary symptoms, bowel function, or bother were observed between groups. The median (IQR) percentage change in BCG-specific γδ T cells from baseline per group was as follows: −26% (−51% to 24%) for placebo, 9.6% (−59% to 117%) for rapamycin 0.5 mg (versus placebo, p=0.18), and 78.8% (−31% to 115%) for rapamycin 2.0 mg (versus placebo, p=0.03). BCG-induced cytokines showed a progressive increase in IL-8 (p=0.02) and TNF-α (p=0.04) over time for patients on rapamycin 2.0 mg, whereas patients receiving placebo had no significant change in urinary cytokines. Compared with placebo, patients receiving 2.0 mg rapamycin had increased urinary γδ T cells at the first week of BCG (p=0.02).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Four weeks of 0.5 and 2.0 mg oral rapamycin daily is safe and tolerable in combination with BCG for patients with NMIBC. Rapamycin enhances BCG-specific γδ T cell immunity and boosts urinary cytokines during BCG treatment. Further study is needed to determine long-term rapamycin safety, tolerability and effects on BCG efficacy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>BCG is one of the first FDA-approved cancer immunotherapy agents. BCG treatment of bladder cancer was initially described in 1976.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Half a century later, BCG continues to be the standard of care and the most effective therapy for bladder cancer in two scenarios: (1) to eradicate carcinoma in situ (CIS) and (2) to prevent disease relapse after endoscopic removal of papillary Ta and T1 bladder tumors.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Despite BCG efficacy in treating bladder cancer, up to 40% patients do not respond to therapy and there are no approved combination strategies that boost BCG efficacy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Several properties of the mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin, support testing in combination with BCG in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). First, rapamycin enhances BCG antigen presentation by promoting autophagy, thereby improving the vaccine efficacy of BCG against tuberculosis in preclinical models.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Induction of BCG immunity during BCG treatment of bladder cancer, determined by purified protein derivative (PPD) testing, is associated with an improved clinical response.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Thus, boosting of BCG specific immunity by rapamycin could improve BCG’s antitumor efficacy. Lack of efficacy of BCG is likely multifactorial, but may be related to age-dependent decline in immune function.

              <p>These observations prompted testing of rapamycin in combination with BCG to treat bladder cancer. To investigate whether rapamycin affects γδ T cells in humans as predicted and to examine the safety and tolerability of rapamycin during routine BCG treatment, we conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral rapamycin (0.5 mg or 2.0 mg) plus intravesical BCG in individuals with NMIBC. We tested the specific hypothesis that rapamycin would boost BCG-specific γδ T cells, measured as a percentage change from baseline.</p>

Eligibility criteria included patients with NMIBC (that is, stage CIS, Ta, or T1) receiving intravesical maintenance TICE BCG. Patients were randomized to receive one of three agents using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio, including oral rapamycin (0.5 mg), oral rapamycin (2.0 mg), or placebo for 4 weeks starting immediately following a cystoscopy confirming no evidence of visible bladder tumors. During the month of study drug administration, patients also received intravesical maintenance BCG, including three weekly full-strength BCG treatments beginning approximately 1 week after starting study drug. The study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT02753309) prior to activation.</p>

                <p><italic>Tolerability</italic>. We measured tolerability based on changes in patient score of two validated bladder cancer questionnaires: (1) American Urologic Association Symptom Score (AUASS) administered weekly during intravesical BCG treatment, immediately prior to BCG and at day 28 from registration; (2) Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) quality of life (QoL) administered at baseline on the day of registration, days 28 and 90 following registration. Together, AUASS and BCI QoL scores measure function and bother (inconvenience) of urinary, bowel, and sexual health functions. BCI scores were calculated by standardizing Likert scale question responses to a 0 to 100 scale, where a score of 100 indicated the patient answered ‘no problem/bother’ to all questions; thus, higher scores represent better health states. AUASS and BCI scores were compared over time using a two-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparison test.</p>

                <p>A three-arm randomized study of the immune effects of rapamycin in patients undergoing maintenance BCG therapy for bladder cancer was conducted. The primary study objective was to determine the effect of rapamycin on γδ T cell effector function in response to BCG. The sample size was calculated based on the primary immune endpoint, which was the number of BCG-specific γδ T cells (ie, γδ T cells that proliferated and produced IFN-γ in response to live BCG) in paired blood samples (baseline and post-treatment) among rapamycin-treated and placebo subjects. We tested the hypothesis that rapamycin-treated (either 0.5 mg or 2.0 mg daily for 4 weeks) patients would have a significantly increased mean percentage change in number of BCG-specific γδ T cells following treatment compared with patients that took the placebo. Our preliminary data, conducted in patients with bladder cancer receiving BCG without rapamycin, found a mean percentage increase in BCG-specific γδ T cells of 11.25% (SD 6.3%). Based on convincing preliminary laboratory findings and on published observations,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> we anticipated that rapamycin would result in an absolute increase of 8.5% in BCG-specific γδ T cells corresponding to total number change in BCG-specific γδ T cells of 19.5% (SD 6.3%). Our estimates rendered a necessary sample size of 30 completers, including 10 patients per treatment group, which achieves 81.4% power to detect a difference of 0.085 between placebo and rapamycin (at either dose) using a two-sided t-test at a significance level of 0.05. The SD in the placebo and treatment groups were assumed to be approximately equal. The study was blinded, and the random allocation was 1:1:1, and we allowed for one additional patient per group. Thus, the total enrolment per arm was targeted to be 11+11+11=33 with 30 completers. Sample size calculation was performed with Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) software.</p>
                <p>Significance of urinary cytokine changes over time in each group of patients was assessed by linear regression analysis run on slope over weeks 1, 2, and 3. Differences in the change of BCG-specific responding T cell subsets in periphery at day 28 over baseline, or week 1 T cell subset percentages in the urine among patient groups were all assessed by t-test or Mann-Whitney test based on normality testing. P values are two-sided and p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5–6 or Stata IC/10.1.</p>

The median (IQR) rapamycin blood concentration for patients treated with 0.5 and 2.0 mg was 2.3 ng/mL (IQR, 1.7–5 ng/mL) and 3.05 ng/mL (1.8–10.7 ng/mL), respectively. Grade 1–2 AEs were observed in 21 patients (68%) and grade 3 AE occurred in 1 patient (4%), designated unrelated to rapamycin. No grade 4–5 AEs occurred. The number of AEs were similar between groups (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">online supplemental table 2</xref>). The most common Grade 1 AEs were hematuria, dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplemental table 1</xref>). Two patients (one receiving placebo and one receiving 2.0 mg rapamycin) experienced moderate (grade 2) mouth ulcers and/or sores, and were taken off treatment. Notably, AE severity was not associated with measured rapamycin blood concentration and no difference in moderate (grade 2) AEs was observed between groups (p=0.59). No difference was found in tolerability based on urinary function or bother during initial 4 weeks of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A–C</xref>) or bowel function or bother among all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D, E</xref>).</p>

Recurrence-free survival was similar between groups (p=0.35, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). However, post-BCG induction of urinary cytokines, especially IL-2 and IL-8, is associated with a favorable response to BCG and is used as an early measure of treatment efficacy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–25</xref> No significant change in urinary IFN-γ occurred in any treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Post-BCG urinary IL-8 levels progressively increased for all study groups, but this trend was statistically significant only for the rapamycin 2.0 mg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). In this group, IL-8 increased from an average level of 1025 pg/mL (week 1) to 2659 pg/mL (week 2), and then 4205 pg/mL at week 3 of BCG therapy (p=0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). In addition, a significant increase in post-BCG urinary TNF-α was observed for patients receiving 2.0 mg rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, a progressive decrease in urinary IL-2 over time was observed for all groups and this trend was significant for patients receiving 0.5 mg rapamycin; this group had a substantially higher initial (week 1) urinary IL-2 compared with the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).</p>

However, patients treated with rapamycin at either 0.5 or 2.0 mg daily experienced a significant increase in urinary γ9δ2 T cells compared with patients receiving placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). Compared with other lymphocytes in the urine, γ9δ2 T cells are rare—the mean percentage is less than 0.01% even after BCG restimulation. However, these cells were significantly increased in patients treated with rapamycin. The average percentage of urinary γ9δ2 T cells were 4–5-fold higher than placebo (0.05% in 0.5 mg rapamycin group and 0.06% in 2.0 mg rapamycin group). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving 0.5 mg of rapamycin showed an approximate fivefold increase in the average percentage of activated CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD107a<sup>+</sup> degranulating (ie, functionally active) urinary γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). CD107a<sup>+</sup> mean fluorescence intensity of degranulating γδ T cells, which is proportional to the number of exocyted granules per cell, was also significantly increased in the rapamycin 0.5 mg group compared with the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C, D</xref>). Because γδ T cells can regulate natural killer (NK) cell antitumor function,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> we examined effects of rapamycin on NK cells. While rapamycin did not appear to affect the number of urinary NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>), the NK cell activation marker CD56 was significantly increased in its expression on urinary NK cells from patients treated with 2.0 mg of rapamycin in contrast to CD44 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4E, F</xref>). These data indicate that rapamycin largely induces innate effector immunity in the bladder environment, including γδ T cell proliferation/activation and NK cell activation, without significant effects on bladder CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, rapamycin at a dose of 0.5 or 2.0 mg daily for 4 weeks, was tolerated when given in combination with intravesical BCG in patients with high-grade NMIBC. Rapamycin-related side effects were generally mild in severity and the AE profile was not unexpected based on contemporary clinical studies of intravesical BCG monotherapy.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The study met its primary endpoint in demonstrating a greater increase in peripheral blood BCG-specific γδ T cells in subjects receiving 2.0 mg rapamycin compared with subjects receiving placebo. Further, the effects of rapamycin on circulating immune cells were analogous to changes observed in the local bladder environment, including γδ T cell proliferation and activation without significant effects on conventional T cell immunity. Importantly, rapamycin boosted BCG-specific immunity in patients during the maintenance phase of BCG treatment, indicating that rapamycin could help provide sustained BCG-specific immunity for patients with bladder cancer.</p>
              <p>The safety and tolerability of rapamycin demonstrated in this patient population form the foundation for further study in this indication. At the low doses tested (ie, ≤2.0 mg daily), oral rapamycin was well-tolerated with no treatment-related grade ≥3 AEs noted. We specifically measured patient-reported urinary and bowel bother and function with genitourinary- and bladder cancer-specific validated questionnaires, which were not adversely affected in subjects receiving rapamycin compared with placebo. One subject receiving rapamycin discontinued treatment due to stomatitis, but this toxicity may be mitigated by strategies such as dexamethasone mouthwash.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> These data support the tolerability and feasibility of a short-course of rapamycin co-administered with BCG.</p>
              <p>In addition to enhancing γδ T cell function, rapamycin could enhance bladder NK cell activity, either directly or via γδ T cell induction. γδ T cells regulate antitumor NK cell function,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> including against human bladder cancer.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Both γδ T cells and NK cells are required for BCG’s antitumor efficacy.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 37</xref> We reported that bladder-infiltrating NK cells expressing high levels of CD56 had increased functional capacity than their CD56<sup>dim</sup> counterparts.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Although rapamycin had no effect on the number or percentage of urinary NK cells, rapamycin did increase the CD56 expression on NK cells, which supports a favorable NK cell phenotype in bladder tumors.</p>
              <p>Given these data on the favorable immune modulation, safety, and tolerability of rapamycin coadministered with BCG, further studies of this combination are indicated in NMIBC. Future studies should assess the durability of immune cell modulation, including effects on γδ T cells and NK cells in the absence of ongoing rapamycin therapy. In murine models, low-dose intermittent rapamycin has been shown to increase lifespan and contribute to cancer prevention.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> Reducing the dose of rapamycin and restricting the dosing to a more intermittent regimen may improve its safety profile. For example, intermittent rapamycin dosing decreased its negative effects on glucose metabolism and the immune system relative to daily rapamycin treatment.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>
              <p>Because rapamycin enhances BCG antigen peptide processing and presentation,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> initiating rapamycin earlier in the course of BCG therapy (ie, during BCG induction) could enhance BCG-specific immunity even further. Additionally, there may be a role for rapamycin coadministered with BCG in patients who have already experienced BCG failure, where the current standard is radical cystectomy. There are numerous strategies currently being investigated to salvage patients BCG unresponsive NMIBC. Rapamycin plus BCG may be studied as an alternative or in combination with such approaches.</p>
              <p>We observed a high variability of rapamycin blood levels in treated patients. Further improvement in tolerability is possible with rapamycin dose adjustment based on measuring whole blood trough levels as is currently done for transplant patients or by using microencapsulated rapamycin which protects the agent from stomach digestion.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> While this trial was not designed to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of rapamycin combined with BCG, based on our prior work showing that the antitumor effect of BCG is mediated through γδ T cells, the urinary cytokine and immune cell changes observed with this combination are promising. Another limitation of the study was the absence of information on pretreatment urinary immune cells and cytokine levels, which are important measures as internal controls. Incorporation of pretreatment urinary data in future studies will aid the ability to correlate both baseline and BCG-induced immune parameters with clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>In summary, rapamycin had an acceptable safety profile in patients with high-grade NMIBC at doses 0.5 or 2.0 mg daily for 4 weeks. The immunomodulatory effects of rapamycin in blood and urine were encouraging and further plans for phase II testing of long-term eRapamycin plus intravesical BCG are underway (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04375813).</p>
