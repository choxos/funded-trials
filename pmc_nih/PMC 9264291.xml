                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Schools increasingly provide mental health services to students, but often lack access to implementation strategies to support school-based (and school professional [SP]) delivery of evidence-based practices. Given substantial heterogeneity in implementation barriers across schools, development of <italic>adaptive implementation strategies</italic> that guide which implementation strategies to provide to which schools and when may be necessary to support scale-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) of high schools across Michigan was used to inform the development of a school-level adaptive implementation strategy for supporting SP-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). All schools were first provided with implementation support informed by Replicating Effective Programs (REP) and then were randomized to add in-person Coaching or not (phase 1). After 8 weeks, schools were assessed for response based on SP-reported frequency of CBT delivered to students and/or barriers reported. Responder schools continued with phase 1 implementation strategies. Slower-responder schools (not providing ≥ 3 CBT components to ≥10 students or &gt;2 organizational barriers identified) were re-randomized to add Facilitation to current support or not (phase 2). The primary aim hypothesis was that SPs at schools receiving the REP + Coaching + Facilitation adaptive implementation strategy would deliver more CBT sessions than SPs at schools receiving REP alone. Secondary aims compared four implementation strategies (Coaching vs no Coaching × Facilitation vs no Facilitation) on CBT sessions delivered, including by type (group, brief and full individual). Analyses used a marginal, weighted least squares approach developed for clustered SMARTs.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">SPs (<italic>n</italic> = 169) at 94 high schools entered the study. <italic>N</italic> = 83 schools (88%) were slower-responders after phase 1. Contrary to the primary aim hypothesis, there was no evidence of a significant difference in CBT sessions delivered between REP + Coaching + Facilitation and REP alone (111.4 vs. 121.1 average total CBT sessions; <italic>p</italic> = 0.63). In secondary analyses, the adaptive strategy that offered REP + Facilitation resulted in the highest average CBT delivery (154.1 sessions) and the non-adaptive strategy offering REP + Coaching the lowest (94.5 sessions).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The most effective strategy in terms of average SP-reported CBT delivery is the adaptive implementation strategy that (i) begins with REP, (ii) augments with Facilitation for slower-responder schools (schools where SPs identified organizational barriers or struggled to deliver CBT), and (iii) stays the course with REP for responder schools.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par21">Depression and anxiety disorders impact approximately 15% and 30% of school-aged youth, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and are increasing. Several evidence-based practices (EBPs), including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can improve clinical outcomes for adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but barriers to care limit access, with less than one in five teens receiving any kind of evidence-based care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Barriers include cost, stigma, and a limited number of behavioral health providers, particularly in rural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More than half of mental disorders begin during school-age years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Untreated, these illnesses can impair development and academic performance and lead to poor physical and mental health outcomes, including suicide, self-injury, and substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] at substantial social and economic cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Given barriers to community-based care, schools have increasingly served as <italic>de facto</italic> providers of mental health care services. Schools provide a low stigma, convenient, and sustainable setting to overcome treatment barriers. Youth spend a great deal of time in school, and most have daily access to school professionals (SPs; social workers, counselors, psychologists) who can provide mental health and substance use support at no additional cost to families, in a familiar environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Students are also more willing to access mental health services in school than community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Between 2012 and 2015, nearly 60% of students receiving mental health services reported receiving some in school, and nearly 40% reported receiving services in schools exclusively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Students receiving care exclusively in schools were disproportionately lower income, underrepresented minorities, and/or on public insurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Schools, however, face their own barriers to providing effective mental health care. SPs rarely have access to training in mental health EBPs, such as CBT, or the support they need to provide EBPs sustainably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and have reported low confidence in their ability to deliver treatments like CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Organizational barriers, including competing demands on SP time, lack of (or barriers to accessing) space or other school resources, and lack of support by school or district administrators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], also impede SP ability to provide CBT or other EBPs in schools.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Implementation strategies—or theory-based techniques “used to enhance the adoption, implementation, or sustainability of an [EBP]” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]—hold potential for improving SP delivery of EBPs like CBT in schools. Replicating Effective Programs (REP), Coaching, and Facilitation are three promising school-level implementation strategies that have the potential to mitigate barriers to SP-delivered CBT. REP, detailed below, is a relatively low-burden, low-cost, readily scalable strategy that packages EBP training with on-demand technical assistance (TA) to customize the EBP to local users’ (e.g., schools’) needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. REP addresses fundamental barriers to school-based EBP delivery and has been shown to improve the uptake of psychosocial EBPs in community-based settings across different community organizations and health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, REP’s low intensity may prove inadequate for schools where SPs require substantial skills training or where organizational barriers are significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. As such, some schools may require REP augmentations that provide more intensive support. For skills-related barriers, a Coaching model that provides SPs with more intensive post-training support through skills modeling, practice, and feedback has shown promise for promoting EBP delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For organizational barriers, Facilitation—based on the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] framework—provides schools with ongoing consultation from an expert in strategic thinking and EBP implementation to garner administrative support, solve logistical challenges, and build community buy-in. In several community-based cluster-randomized trials, Facilitation has been shown to improve mental health EBP uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and to be highly cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Given that there is substantial heterogeneity in terms of implementation barriers at schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and in how different schools might respond to different combinations of strategies, there is a need to develop and evaluate effective <italic>adaptive implementation strategies</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. An adaptive implementation strategy is a sequence of decision rules used to guide implementers in selecting which combination of implementation strategies (e.g., REP, Coaching, Facilitation) to offer and when, including considerations of a school’s changing needs. An example of a higher-intensity adaptive implementation strategy is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Example of a higher-intensity adaptive implementation strategy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2022_1211_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par26">However, there is currently no research that evaluates the effectiveness of this type of adaptive implementation strategy for improving CBT delivery in schools. Perhaps more fundamentally, there is no research to inform (i) the effectiveness of starting with REP vs. REP + Coaching, (ii) the effectiveness of augmenting with Facilitation vs. not among schools that are slower to respond to REP or REP + Coaching, or (iii) whether additional school factors ought to be taken into consideration when making decisions, e.g., to start with REP vs. REP + Coaching, or to augment with Facilitation vs. not among slower-responder schools.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The current study (R01MH114203)—The Adaptive School-based Implementation of CBT (ASIC) Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]—used a clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] to inform the development of a school-level adaptive implementation strategy for adopting and scaling up SP delivery of CBT. ASIC was done in partnership with TRAILS (Transforming Research into Action to Improve the Lives of Students) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], a program that aims to implement CBT in high schools across the state of Michigan.</p>
              <p id="Par28">This manuscript reports the results of ASIC’s primary research aim, which was to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive implementation strategy shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> versus providing REP alone (not adaptive, no Coaching, no Facilitation). The primary outcome is the <italic>total number</italic> of SP-reported CBT sessions delivered to students by SPs over the 18-month study period. Secondary outcomes are the number of CBT sessions delivered by <italic>type of session</italic>: group vs. individual brief vs. individual full. We hypothesized that, compared to REP alone, the adaptive implementation strategy in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> would lead to a higher total number of CBT sessions delivered, on average, over 18 months.</p>
              <p id="Par29">We also present outcomes for two other implementation strategies embedded within ASIC: REP + Coaching from the start for all schools (not adaptive, no Facilitation), and REP that is augmented with Facilitation for slower-responder schools and continued REP for responder schools (REP + Facilitation; adaptive, no Coaching).</p>

                  <p id="Par49">All schools were offered REP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. REP, based on Rogers’ diffusion model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and social learning theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], is a low-intensity strategy designed to enhance EBP uptake through development of customized intervention materials appropriate for the specific implementation setting, didactic training, and provision of low-level TA. Prior to ASIC, TRAILS developed customized CBT materials designed to address common symptoms of depression and anxiety, tailored for school-based delivery by SPs. All materials were made available to SPs through the TRAILS website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trailstowellness.org">http://www.trailstowellness.org</ext-link>). Materials included standardized screening tools SPs could use to identify students appropriate for CBT, an overview of CBT components, session agendas for providing CBT to individual students or groups, talking points for teaching students about CBT, and CBT handouts, worksheets, and resources for use with students. TA to support SP delivery was provided by a PhD-level clinical psychologist board-certified in CBT and included a monthly newsletter with information on TRAILS resources, a monthly opt-in TA call, and contact information for as-needed support via phone or email.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">REP also included a daylong, in-person didactic training. TRAILS staff clinicians (PhD- and LMSW-level practitioners) offered the training at several locations across Michigan. The training covered screening and identification of students, CBT core components, and theoretical underpinnings. Training strategies included didactic instruction, videos and live demonstrations, role-plays with feedback, and facilitated small group discussion.</p>

Schools were categorized as “slower-responders” if any SPs reported not providing ≥3 CBT components to ≥10 students <italic>OR</italic> if SPs reported, on average, &gt;2 barriers to CBT delivery. Slower-responder schools thus included (i) schools where any SPs struggled to deliver CBT and (ii) schools where SPs were delivering CBT but endorsed barriers potentially precluding long-term delivery or sustainability. Finally, (iii) schools where any SPs failed to complete the monitoring assessment were also considered slower responders.</p>
                  <p id="Par52">The responder/slower-responder definition was based on pilot data with non-ASIC SPs that found that SPs tended to report no barriers or 3+ barriers, and those reporting barriers had poor prognosis for implementation without access to a strategy (like Facilitation) designed to address these barriers. From this pilot data, schools identified as “responders” were not thought to be in need of Facilitation; schools identified as “slower-responders” were thought to <italic>potentially</italic> benefit from Facilitation.</p>

                  <p id="Par53">The Coaching implementation strategy, used by TRAILS in more than 20 Michigan high schools prior to ASIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], was derived from the school-based Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) model of coaching for individual development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. A comprehensive, operationalized coaching protocol guides TRAILS Coaches to support SP learning and CBT delivery. In addition, the Coaches were expected to attend ~12 SP-delivered CBT student group sessions, during which Coaches would observe SP CBT delivery, provide feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], and, as appropriate, model the use of CBT components to improve SP competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Each school was assigned a Coach with whom they were to arrange weekly Coaching visits for a minimum of one semester. TRAILS then administered a short, objective CBT competency assessment to all SPs; Coaches completed standardized ratings of their assigned SPs. Schools were provided with either a second semester of in-person Coaching (when SPs showed gaps in competency) or a stepped-down version (when SPs demonstrated sufficient competency). Coaches were required to complete weekly logs, documenting interaction with their assigned SPs and utilization of specific coaching techniques.</p>
                  <p id="Par54">Coaches were recruited and trained by TRAILS. Coaches were typically licensed community mental health (CMH) providers (e.g., Licensed Clinical Social Workers) serving in child- or family-treatment roles and were recruited through professional networking or contacts made to CMH clinical directors. To be eligible to serve as a Coach for ASIC, Coaches had to complete an initial didactic training in CBT and mindfulness, 15 weeks of one-to-one consultation with a TRAILS staff clinician, and a second didactic training focused on the TRAILS Coaching Protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p>

All SPs at schools assigned to Facilitation had the opportunity to engage in regular phone calls with the Facilitator for up to 24 weeks (the duration of phase 2).

                  <p id="Par67">At each phase (1, 2a, 2b, and 3), a separate regression model was fit for the CBT delivery outcome, as follows: The phase 1 regression included an intercept and a contrast coded (+1/−1) indicator for phase 1 strategy. The phase 2a, 2b, and 3 regression models included an intercept, a contrast-coded indicator for phase 1 strategy, a contrast-coded indicator for phase 2 strategy, and the interaction between phase 1 and phase 2 strategies. All models included the following pre-specified, school-level baseline covariates: school size (&gt;500 or ≤ 500 students), location of school (rural or urban), percentage of students on free/reduced lunch program (≥ 50% or &lt;50%), and pre-randomization CBT delivery (any vs. none), as well as school-aggregated SP education and job tenure.</p>
                  <p id="Par68">Phase 1 outcomes cannot be impacted by strategies offered in the future (i.e., in phase 2), whereas phase 2a, 2b, and 3 outcomes can be impacted by the sequence of strategies offered in phases 1 and 2; the fitted regression models reflect this feature of the SMART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par69">Standard least squares was used to estimate the phase 1 regression model. Weighted and replicated generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the regression models in phases 2a, 2b, and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. As slower-responder schools were randomized twice with probability 1/2, they had a 1/4 chance of following their assigned sequence of strategies, whereas responder schools, randomized once with probability 1/2, had a 1/2 chance of following their assigned strategy sequence. Weighting is used to account for this known under-representation of slower-responder schools. Specifically, data for SPs in slower-responder schools were assigned a weight of 4, whereas data for SPs in responder schools were assigned a weight of 2. In addition, since each group of responder schools is consistent with two strategies (i.e., schools in cell A are consistent with REP only and REP + Facilitation and schools in cell D with REP + Coaching and REP + Coaching + Facilitation; see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the data for these schools was used twice (i.e., replicated) to facilitate a more efficient comparison of the four strategies.

                  <p id="Par70">All models used bootstrapped standard errors (based on 1000 samples) to account for (i) clustering of SPs within schools, (ii) multiple observations per SP, (iii) sampling variation in the unknown distribution of the weights, and (iv) replication.</p>

To facilitate the comparison of the strategies using a single-number summary, for each of the four strategies, the phase-specific averages were summed to calculate “average total CBT delivery.” As phases varied slightly in length, in secondary analyses, we also computed average weekly delivery during each phase by dividing average delivery during each phase by the number of phase-weeks (results are provided in <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Appendix C</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par84">This study compared four different implementation strategies on the total number of SP-reported CBT sessions delivered. The REP and REP + Coaching strategies were non-adaptive, offering the same types of support to all schools across all phases; the REP + Facilitation and REP + Coaching + Facilitation strategies were adaptive, augmenting with Facilitation in phase 2 for slower-responder schools. With respect to our primary aim hypothesis, we found no evidence of differences in average total CBT delivery between REP and REP + Coaching + Facilitation. In secondary aim comparisons, we found that across the four strategies, the adaptive REP + Facilitation strategy resulted in the highest average CBT delivery (154.1 sessions per SP) and the non-adaptive REP + Coaching strategy the lowest (94.5 sessions per SP). Examining CBT delivery by type, however, most differences across strategies reflected higher vs. lower reports of brief (≤15 min) individual CBT sessions.</p>

                <title>Harnessing schools and school professionals for improving adolescent mental health</title>
                <p id="Par85">This manuscript adds to the growing literature supporting the potential for SPs to help fill gaps in adolescent access to mental health care by offering mental health EBPs, like CBT, in schools. Indeed, all strategies, including the low-intensity REP alone strategy, showed high levels of CBT uptake, with more than 90% of participating SPs (i.e., that completed training) reporting CBT delivery at least once (relative to CBT adoption rates of 35–40% elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]). Combined, SPs delivered more than 20,000 CBT sessions over 43 weeks. Furthermore, as our secondary trend analyses show (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Appendix C</xref>), under all strategies CBT delivery remained consistent or increased across all study phases, including the maintenance phase, which followed discontinuation of Coaching and/or Facilitation.</p>
                <p id="Par86">This study also provides support for the feasibility of organizations like TRAILS offering adaptive implementation strategies in schools. As noted, TRAILS was exclusively responsible for monitoring response status after phase 1 and, as applicable, adapting implementation support in phase 2.</p>

                <title>Explaining differences across implementation strategies</title>
                <p id="Par87">Although prior research has drawn attention to potential shortcomings of offering intensive implementation support, especially in lower-resourced settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], our team was nonetheless surprised to not find support for our hypothesis that, for our primary outcome of average total CBT delivery, the most intensive strategy (REP + Coaching + Facilitation) would outperform the least intensive strategy (REP). Also surprising was that the REP + Facilitation strategy, which adapted phase 2 support based on response to phase 1, differed markedly from the non-adaptive REP + Coaching strategy for three of the four outcomes. Note, however, that these analyses focus on SP-reported CBT delivery; future analyses will examine other outcomes, including CBT fidelity and change in student mental health outcomes. However, these initial findings raise several potential explanations.</p>
                <p id="Par88">While future analyses will examine mechanisms more systematically, we postulate that much of the benefit of REP + Facilitation is due to the fact that Facilitation was provided only to schools identified as slower responders, i.e., in context of a recognized need. The salience of the targeted barriers and/or the perceived appropriateness of Coaching and Facilitation strategies may also have differed. SPs may have had concerns about Coach attendance at student CBT sessions risking student privacy or confidence or may have felt they did not need further CBT skill development. Facilitation, which has proven effective in other implementation trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], also provides support that is highly tailored to specific school needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] by “bundling” other discrete implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], and generally addresses barriers that were more external and jointly identified with the SP, thus not risking SP concerns regarding student privacy or perceptions of help-seeking. Prior TRAILS’ Coaching studies have not reported such concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; however, these studies largely recruited SPs motivated to receive Coaching. In contrast, ASIC recruited a more heterogeneous sample of SPs interested in receiving support for implementing CBT, but not necessarily via Coaching.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Lower SP engagement also suggests that Coaching may have led to greater real or perceived burden by SPs, relative to Facilitation. Coaching is typically offered in the context of CBT groups, which requires SPs to identify and coordinate student CBT groups and align group delivery with Coaching visits. As both SPs and Coaches were balancing many time commitments, this coordination may have lessened SP engagement with Coaching. Facilitation also includes some scheduling burden, but is done primarily over the phone and was also not dependent on student CBT group coordination. Furthermore, Facilitation’s scheduling burden may have been more acceptable to SPs given their awareness that Facilitation was offered based on a recognized need for further support.</p>
                <p id="Par90">Facilitation was also provided by a single Facilitator, ensuring strategy consistency and fidelity, while Coaching was provided by 42 existing providers across Michigan who were employed by other local agencies near the schools they served. While Coaches were required to complete Coach training through TRAILS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], there was likely variability in the quality of Coaching provided, as well as in Coach commitment to their schools given other responsibilities.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par91">First, our results rely on SP self-reported CBT delivery. Self-report of implementation outcomes like adoption, reach, and even fidelity is common in implementation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], especially in lower-resourced settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], including schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. As clinicians (e.g., social workers, counselors, psychologists), SPs were also accustomed to documenting mental health services, and the process for documenting CBT delivery was identical across arms. However, it is possible that SPs assigned to Coaching could have reported a lower number of CBT sessions if Coach feedback led to different perceptions of what counted as CBT, given Coaching’s explicit focus on improving CBT knowledge and expertise. However, we took proactive steps to protect against this, including (i) clearly explaining to all SPs prior to randomization how we were defining (and how they should be reporting) CBT delivery for research purposes and (ii) having SPs “practice” reporting CBT during the pre-randomization REP-only phase to ensure their comfort and consistency prior to offering any additional support (e.g., Coaching, Facilitation). SPs’ reporting CBT components delivered each week (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) also likely protected against SPs reporting <italic>any</italic> mental health-focused interaction as CBT. Finally, as reported above, weekly CBT response rates did not vary across Coaching vs. no Coaching study arms.</p>
                <p id="Par92">Second, generalizability is limited to schools in Michigan that had a TRAILS Coach in their vicinity, but nonetheless included a diverse group of urban, suburban, and rural communities.</p>

We will also examine moderators of effectiveness for Coaching and (among slower-responder schools) Facilitation, including different definitions of “slower-responders” for purposes of deciding how to best tailor Facilitation (vs. no Facilitation). These analyses will help to inform a more fully tailored adaptive implementation strategy for efficiently scaling up SP-delivered CBT in schools by matching implementation strategies to identified barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] or short-term implementation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Qualitative interviews and strategy (e.g., Facilitation) tracking data will also be used to investigate mechanisms of effectiveness (e.g., strategy burden, need, adaptability), whether strategies addressed intended barriers (e.g., CBT knowledge, organizational barriers), and sustainability of SP-delivered CBT during and after COVID-19.</p>

              <p id="Par94">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shed light on the role schools and SPs play in student mental health, questions abound as to which implementation strategies are most effective at addressing barriers to offering EBPs like CBT at scale. Our findings suggest that, among the four strategies examined, the most effective strategy for increasing average SP CBT delivery is a two-phase adaptive implementation strategy that (i) offers REP (a low-intensity, low-cost strategy) in phase 1 to all schools and, in phase 2, (ii) augments REP with Facilitation for slower-responder schools and (iii) continues REP for schools that respond to REP.</p>
