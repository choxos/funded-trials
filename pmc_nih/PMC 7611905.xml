                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="P2">Test anxiety (TA), defined as the emotional, physiological, and behavioural responses surrounding situations involving formal evaluation of performance, is a relatively common occurrence, and, when present, can be a disruptive factor in students’ academic careers. Research indicates that working memory, in particular, affective working memory, is impaired in individuals with TA. The current study therefore explored whether training the application of working memory in affective contexts could reduce TA and associated cognitive and affective impairments.</p>

                  <p id="P3">60 Iranian university students (50% female; 19-22 years) with TA symptoms were randomized to receive 20 sessions of affective working memory training (aWMT), neutral working memory training (nWMT) or to a no-training control group.

                  <p id="P4">Compared to the control group, both the aWMT and the nWMT groups demonstrated improved cognitive and affective functioning from pre- to post-training.

            <p id="P6">Testing has become an integral part of most education systems (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal, 2004</xref>). Performance on these tests is thought to reflect student achievement and dictates individuals’ progression throughout their schooling years and beyond to tertiary education access. Yet, there are some students who are so afflicted by anxiety as a result of the testing experience, that they are unable to perform to their full potential (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Rothman, 2004</xref>). Test anxiety (TA), defined as the emotional, physiological, and behavioural responses surrounding situations involving formal evaluation of performance (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Zeidner, 1998</xref>), is a relatively common occurrence (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Von Der Embse et al., 2013</xref>). In studies of university student populations, it has been estimated that 20-40% of students suffer from functionally impairing TA (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Gerwing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Naveh-Benjamin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Zeidner, 1998</xref>), with research demonstrating negative associations between TA and academic performance (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cassady &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Chapell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Naveh-Benjamin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Zeidner, 1998</xref>; for a review see <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">von der Embse et al., 2018</xref>). TA has also been shown to predict changes in subjective well-being over time (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Steinmayr et al., 2016</xref>). Given the relatively high prevalence of and negative consequences associated with TA, the development of <italic>scalable</italic>, translational interventions is imperative.</p>
            <p id="P7">Within the literature, there is consensus that TA comprises two dimensions: worry, which constitutes cognitive concerns and ruminations about performance; and emotionality, which is manifested in physiological responses, such as dizziness or nausea, experienced during evaluative situations (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cassady &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Liebert &amp; Morris, 2016</xref>). Research suggests that working memory (WM; a limited capacity cognitive storage system required to maintain and manipulate information (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley, 2003</xref>)) may play an important role in TA, particularly the cognitive component. For example, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Owens et al. (2012)</xref> found that, in a group of typically developing 12- to 13-year-olds, WM capacity mediated the link between worry (the cognitive component of TA) and academic performance. Similarly, in a sample of 11-year-olds, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Lee (2015)</xref> observed a direct and detrimental effect of trait TA on WM.</p>
            <p id="P8">WM capacity is an important individual-difference variable that has been shown to account for a significant proportion of variance in general intellectual ability (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Conway et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Engle, 2002</xref>), as well as being central to the processing of goal-relevant information in the face of goal-irrelevant distraction (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Barrett et al., 2004</xref>). WM capacity also appears to play an important role in mental health outcomes. Numerous studies have shown impaired WM in depression (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Davidovich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Demeyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Joormann et al., 2011</xref>), anxiety (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Amir &amp; Bomyea, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Ladouceur et al., 2005</xref>), and post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer &amp; Dalgleish, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In mental health disorders, the ability to control the access and inhibition of negative material to and from WM appears especially impaired (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">de Voogd et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P9">A recent meta-analysis suggested that it may be <italic>affective</italic> WM capacity, in particular, that is impaired in individuals suffering from mental health difficulties (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2019</xref>). Results showed that, in psychologically healthy individuals, affective information had a negligible impact on WM performance, whereas in those suffering from mental health difficulties, the presence of affective material led to impaired WM performance. Day-to-day cognition, particularly in those with mental health difficulties, typically requires the updating, inhibition, and manipulation of affectively-laden rather than affectively-neutral information in WM. For example, a young person afflicted with TA who is attempting to complete a university entrance exam might simultaneously struggle to set aside intrusive and distressing thoughts about failing the exam.</p>
            <p id="P10">Few studies have explored affective WM capacity in individuals with TA. However, one recent study provides support for the postulation of impaired affective WM capacity in such individuals. <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. (2014)</xref> adapted a modified reading span task from <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer &amp; Dalgleish (2011)</xref> designed to assess affective WM capacity, by making stimuli specific to TA. Participants high and low in TA were required to perform simple tasks with neutral material (remembering lists of letters) over short intervals while simultaneously dealing with emotionally-laden intrusive thoughts and feelings (processing sentences describing dysfunctional test-related thoughts) relative to neutral facts about the world. Shi and colleagues observed a particular difficulty employing WM in test-related contexts in high TA participants compared to low TA participants. That is, participants’ ability to remember letter lists in the context of test-related sentences, relative to neutral sentences, was poorer in high TA individuals. Training affective WM capacity, then, may be a means of ameliorating TA.</p>
            <p id="P11">Recent years have seen a proliferation of research exploring the impact of WM training on various outcomes, including mental health symptomatology. The aim of traditional forms of WM training, which incorporates neutral stimuli, is to increase WM capacity and for these improvements to be transferable to real-world contexts (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">du Toit et al., 2020</xref>). However, a series of meta-analytic reviews concluded that WM training does not appear to lead to significant far transfer effects (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Au et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Morrison &amp; Chein, 2011</xref>). That is, the effectiveness of WM training does not extend beyond the process (i.e., WM) trained. Findings from studies of the impact of neutral WM training (nWMT) on affective processes and clinical outcomes have similarly been mixed (for a review see <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Motter et al., 2016</xref>). For example, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Hadwin &amp; Richards (2016)</xref> observed reduced anxiety symptoms, increased inhibitory control, and reduced anxiety-related attentional biases in adolescents with elevated anxiety symptoms following nWMT. These effects were comparable to the effects the authors found in a comparison group that underwent Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. Similarly, nWMT, compared to control training, led to increased attentional control and reduced anxiety in high trait anxious individuals (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sari et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, in individuals with elevated rumination (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Onraedt &amp; Koster, 2014</xref>) and individuals with depression or anxiety (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Wanmaker et al., 2015</xref>), nWMT did not produce any differential effects on rumination, depression, or anxiety, compared to control training. Given the evidence reviewed suggesting that symptoms of anxiety and depression are associated with affective WM difficulties, training the application of WM in affective contexts may lead to more reliable benefits when targeting affective symptoms, such as TA symptoms.</p>
            <p id="P12">In support of this notion, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated that both aWMT and nWMT led to transfer gains on another WM task, however, only aWMT training produced transferable gains to improved affective control. Compared to control training, aWMT also led to improved regulation of emotional distress and altered recruitment in the brain regions underlying the successful control of affective information and states (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>). Beneficial effects of aWMT in clinical populations have also been observed (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">du Toit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Krause-Utz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2017</xref>; however see <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">de Voogd et al., 2016</xref>). aWMT then appears to be a promising avenue for improving affective control and symptoms of emotional disorders, such as TA.</p>
            <p id="P13">Given the promising findings surrounding aWMT and the affective WM deficits observed in individuals with TA, the current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of aWMT compared to nWMT and a passive control group on TA and related cognitive and affective functions (i.e., WM, cognitive control and emotion regulation). The sample included university students with high TA from a middle-income country. Running the study in a middle-income country demonstrates the potential for disseminating these types of trainings globally at very little cost, in settings where educational attainment is a key determinant of well-being (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Graetz et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P14">The aWMT paradigm used for training was adapted from <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al. (2017)</xref> and required participants to update and maintain visual and auditory information in working memory. In this adapted version of the task, the stimuli were replaced to reflect the TA-specific concerns of individuals high in TA. That is, the generic negative facial expressions and words were replaced with TA-related images, e.g., an exam classroom, and TA-related words, e.g., “exam”. The nWMT was identical but included only neutral information (i.e., words and images unrelated to testing such as the word “water” and an image of a mountain). The nWMT group was included to compare the relative effectiveness of training WM in affective versus neutral contexts on improving cognitive and affective functioning, whereas the waitlist control group was included to control for changes due to development and any test-retest effects.</p>
            <p id="P15">The design allowed us to explore the following hypotheses. First, it was hypothesised that individuals with high TA would be able to train on the aWMT and nWMT paradigms. That is, performance on their respective training tasks at the end of training would be better compared to performance at the start of training (H1: <italic>training hypothesis</italic>). It was also hypothesised that following training, the training groups would show greater gains compared to the control group in WM and cognitive control, as measured on an untrained digit span and GoNogo task, respectively (H2: <italic>cognitive transfer hypothesis</italic>). Finally, it was predicted that only individuals who received aWMT, but not the nWMT or control groups, would show improvements in affective functioning, in the form of enhanced emotion regulation, and reduced levels of TA symptoms (H3: <italic>affective transfer hypothesis</italic>).</p>

A cut-off score of 50 was chosen to ensure that participants had a greater than average level of TA. <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Spielberger (1980)</xref> reported males and females to have an average score of 38.48 (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.43) and 42.79 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.70) on the Test Anxiety Inventory, respectively. All participants additionally completed a clinical interview (conducted by ZS), in which their TA symptoms were further assessed. The clinical interview contained open-ended questions on the basis of DSM-IV criteria and lasted approximately 10 minutes. Participants were asked about the feelings and anxiety symptoms they experience during exams, the conditions under which they experience such test-related feelings and anxiety, and whether they are currently receiving any intervention for their TA. No participants reported receiving any interventions. The main purpose of the clinical interview was to confirm that TA was present amongst all participants.</p>

Participants pressed a button to indicate whether either or both stimuli matched the stimuli presented <italic>n</italic>-trials back any time from the onset of the stimuli to 2500ms, after which the next word-image pairing appeared. For an auditory match to occur, the word had to be an exact match to the word presented <italic>n</italic>-trials back. In contrast, for a match to occur in the visuospatial modality, an image had to appear in the same location as the image <italic>n</italic>-trials back. That is, the content shown in the image was task-irrelevant and had to be inhibited. Participants were required to only attend, maintain and respond to the location of the images that were presented. The training then trained both engagement (auditory modality) and disengagement (visuospatial modality) with affective information.</p>

Specifically, participants were shown a series of test-related words and images and rated their level of anxiety to the stimuli on a scale from 1 (<italic>minimum anxiety</italic>) to 10 (<italic>maximum anxiety</italic>). The 10 stimuli that received the highest anxiety ratings, on average, were subsequently included in the aWMT.

The study was single-blind, such that participants were unaware of their assigned training condition, however the experimenter (ZS) was not blind to study condition. The control group did not receive any training. At the post-training assessment session (two days after completion of training), which included all the measures and tasks administered at pre-training, participants were debriefed and compensated with a movie voucher. All computer-based testing and training was done in groups, on a 15-inch laptop and under the supervision of a psychology researcher.

Given the number of univariate comparisons, a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of 0.01 (0.05/4 [four cognitive and four affective outcomes]) was applied to all analyses.</p>

              <p id="P41">The current study aimed to explore the impact of aWMT on cognitive and affective functioning in university students with TA. Significant improvements from pre- to post-training on the training task were observed only in the aWMT, but not the nWMT group. Despite the lack of training related improvement in the nWMT, compared to the no training control group, both aWMT and nWMT led to improved cognitive and affective functioning. Affective transfer effects, however, were greater in the aWMT group compared to the nWMT group. Specifically, the aWMT group demonstrated a greater reduction in overall TA symptoms and emotionality symptoms of TA and a greater increase in cognitive reappraisal from pre- to post-training, compared to the nWMT group. The two forms of training did not have a differential impact on worry symptoms of TA or on suppression. When investigating the impact of time on affective outcomes in the two training groups separately, we observed decreased TA symptoms, including both emotionality and worry symptoms of TA, and increased cognitive reappraisal in both groups from pre- to post-training. However, only the aWMT group showed decreased suppression from pre- to post-training.</p>
              <p id="P42">The results of the study suggest that WM training, in particular, aWMT, may be an effective means of reducing symptoms of TA, as well as associated cognitive and affective impairments. To combat emotionally-laden thoughts and feelings in everyday life, both healthy populations as well as individuals with emotional disorders, such as TA, require affective WM (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). However, the literature suggests that affective WM capacity is impaired in individuals with mental health difficulties (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2019</xref>), including in individuals with TA (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). The finding that affective WM can be trained in individuals with TA, then, is particularly promising. Also encouraging, was the finding that aWMT produced both cognitive and affective transfer effects, specifically, improved working memory, cognitive control, TA symptoms, and emotion regulation. This is consistent with previous research, showing improved cognitive control over affective information and an increase in adaptive emotion regulation in psychologically healthy individuals following aWMT (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) as well as a study finding improved emotion regulation and PTSD symptoms in adolescents following aWMT (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P43">aWMT arguably offered participants the opportunity to practice the mental manipulation of <italic>emotional</italic> stimuli, perhaps making it easier for these participants to mentally engage or disengage from or shift attention towards or away from negative emotional material (such as negative test-related thoughts or feelings), and consequently resulting in overall better mental control over such emotional stimuli (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">du Toit et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, affective WM shares the same frontoparietal neural circuitry as emotion regulation capacity; circuitry which has demonstrated improved efficiency following aWMT (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>). Given that TA can have a detrimental impact on an individual’s academic performance, implementing such simple and cost-effective cognitive training procedures as aWMT in educational settings may enable students to overcome symptoms of TA and perform to their highest potential in evaluative situations.</p>
              <p id="P44">The finding that participants who received nWMT also demonstrated improved TA symptoms and emotion regulation following training was contrary to our hypotheses, though nonetheless a promising finding and in line with Motter and colleagues′ (2016) review of the literature on neutral cognitive training. Given that we did not include an active control group, we cannot rule out the possibility that the beneficial effects we observed following training were an impact of placebo effects associated with study participation, such as regular interpersonal interaction with the research team or participants expecting to improve as a result of training. Alternatively, perhaps the training sessions were somewhat akin to exposure, such that participants were repeatedly exposed to test-like settings, where their performance on the training task was being evaluated by a researcher. If there were indeed any effects of exposure, this effect would likely have been potentiated in the aWMT group. This is because one of the study’s strengths was that the aWMT included TA-related stimuli that were rated as most distressing by the participants prior to the training. In order to rule out these alternative explanations, future research comparing aWMT and nWMT should also include a placebo task, including the same affective stimuli as the aWMT, but excluding the WM training component.</p>
              <p id="P45">Further contrary to our hypotheses, the impact of training on affective outcome variables was not mediated by changes in cognitive control or emotion regulation. These findings are in contrast with previous studies showing training gains to be mediated by improved affective and cognitive control (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We may have failed to observe this expected relationship as we did not include a measure of <italic>affective</italic> control. It may be that the improved affective functioning we observed following training, particularly in the aWMT group, was a result of improved affective control, rather than cognitive control <italic>per se</italic>. Future studies would benefit from including a measure of affective control, such as the affective GoNogo task or affective Stroop task, in order to assess this hypothesis.</p>
              <p id="P46">The failure of the nWMT group to show training-related improvement on the training task was surprising. Although the two training groups did not significantly differ in mean <italic>n</italic>-back achieved at Day 1 of training, the mean for the nWMT group was nonetheless slightly higher, suggesting that perhaps there was less room for improvement in this group. The mean <italic>n</italic>-back achieved at pre-training for the nWMT group also exceeded that observed in previous <italic>n</italic>-back studies (e.g., <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">du Toit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the range of <italic>n</italic>-back scores at pre-training for the nWMT group was greater (range: 1 – 6) than the range of scores for the aWMT group (range: 1 – 4). It is possible that the nWMT group included participants who performed at ceiling on this task at pre-training, which may account for the non-significant training improvement in this group.</p>
              <p id="P47">While the findings from the current study are promising, they must be interpreted within the context of the limitations of the study. First, while the inclusion of both an aWMT group and nWMT group was beneficial, the study was limited by the inclusion of a passive rather than active control group (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Redick, 2019</xref>). Future studies would benefit from the inclusion of a placebo-training task, which is similar in duration and structure to the active training task, to allow for greater confidence that any significant results observed are not merely an impact of participants expecting to benefit from training. However, meta-analytic evidence suggests that the type of control group (active vs. passive) does not moderate the impact of training on transfer effects (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Au et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Soveri et al., 2017</xref>). Second, allowing participants to complete training at home on personal devices represents a further limitation to the study. Not only may this be seen as avoidance on the participants’ behalf, but it also reduces control over training settings. However, the controlled training setting also limits applicability to more naturalistic environments. Future research in which all training is conducted in the same setting will be important to replicate effects, followed by more naturalistic training studies, to determine applicability to real-life contexts. Third, we did not collect arousal ratings pre- and post-training. These ratings would help to determine whether the two training settings, which are somewhat similar to test settings, differentially served as an anxiety induction. If they did indeed induce anxiety, training may by extension potentially have served as exposure, which in turn could account for the beneficial effects of the training. A fourth limitation was the single-blind nature of the study, with the same experimenter, who was aware of training condition, conducting the clinical interviews and the pre- and post-assessments. Fifth, the current study does not include task reliability for the cognitive transfer task as the data was not available at the review stage. However, the GoNogo task has been shown to have good reliability when at least 50-80 trials are included (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Williams &amp; Kaufmann, 2012</xref>). Here we included 100 trials, increasing the confidence in the psychometric adequacy of the task. Finally, the current study was limited by a small sample size. Consequently, the results we obtained are likely to represent an overestimation of the effect in the general population (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Redick, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies with larger sample sizes will be important to determine the replicability of the effects reported. Longer-term follow-ups are also needed to determine whether any beneficial effects of aWMT or nWMT persist beyond post-training assessments. Such studies would also allow for investigation of whether transfer effects following WM training extend beyond cognitive and affective functioning to more practical outcomes, such as improved academic performance.</p>
              <p id="P48">The current study adds to the existing literature by providing evidence that both aWMT and nWMT can lead to improved cognitive and affective functioning in university students with TA, though the impact on affective functioning appears to be greater following aWMT. Given the ease and cost-effectiveness of administering cognitive training, our findings highlight the potential of aWMT as a promising avenue for improving symptoms of TA, which may allow students to perform to their full academic potential in evaluative situations.</p>

                <p>This figure depicts a block of Affective Working Memory Training, where <italic>n</italic> = 1. Trials depicted with a yellow background represent target stimuli. Participants respond with a button press to indicate whether either or both stimuli match the stimuli presented <italic>n</italic>-trials back any time from the onset of the stimuli to 2500ms, after which the next word-image pairing appears. For an image match to occur, the image must be presented in the same location as the image <italic>n</italic> trials back, while for an auditory match to occur, the word has to be an exact match to the word presented <italic>n</italic>-trials back.</p>
