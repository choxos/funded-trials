                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">What, when, how, how much, and how often infants are fed have been associated with childhood obesity risk. The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the effect of a responsive parenting (RP) intervention designed for obesity prevention on parents’ infant feeding practices in the first year after birth.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Primiparous mother-newborn dyads were randomized to the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) Study RP intervention or child safety control. Research nurses delivered intervention content at home at infant age 3–4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, and at a research center at 1 year. RP feeding guidance advised feeding that was contingent (i.e., feed in response to hunger and satiety signs, alternatives to using food to soothe), and developmentally appropriate (i.e., delaying introduction of solids, age-appropriate portion sizes). Infant feeding practices (i.e., bottle use, introduction of solids, food to soothe) were assessed by phone interviews and online surveys and dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">RP mothers were more likely to use of structure-based feeding practices including limit-setting (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and consistent feeding routines (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) at age 1 year. RP group mothers were less likely to use non-responsive feeding practices such as pressuring their infant to finish the bottle/food (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and using food to soothe (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), propping the bottle (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) assessed between 4 and 8 months, and putting baby to bed with a bottle at age 1 year (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Few differences were seen between groups in <italic>what</italic> specific foods or food groups infants were fed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Anticipatory guidance on RP in feeding can prevent the use of food to soothe and promote use of more sensitive, structure-based feeding which could reduce obesity risk by affecting how and when infants are fed during the first year.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par9">Epidemiological and laboratory findings point to early modifiable risk factors to prevent rapid weight gain and overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] including what, when, and how much an infant is fed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. What infants are fed in the first 24 months shapes their growth and subsequent dietary patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but how infants are fed can also influence early growth and development. There is evidence that US infants are often overfed, exceeding their estimated energy requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Using a larger volume bottle to feed (i.e., &gt; 6 oz) is associated with greater formula intake and rapid weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Controlling feeding practices, including pressuring the infant to finish the bottle and using feeding as the default response to any infant distress, reduced opportunities for infants self-regulation and can promote excessive weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In sum, how parents shape children’s early experiences with food and eating, by teaching the child food rules and expectations, impacts child taste preferences, food choice, appetite regulation, dietary intake and obesity risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">The theoretical framework for the <italic>I</italic>ntervention <italic>N</italic>urses <italic>S</italic>tart <italic>I</italic>nfants <italic>G</italic>rowing on <italic>H</italic>ealthy <italic>T</italic>rajectories (<italic>INSIGHT</italic>) trial is based on responsive parenting (RP). RP is defined as responding to the infant promptly, contingently, in ways that are developmentally appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous findings indicate that RP is associated with a range of positive child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. INSIGHT’s central hypothesis was that responsive infant feeding guidance, focused on how to recognize and respond to infant hunger and fullness signs, could promote infant self-regulation, while also reducing the use of less responsive feeding practices (e.g., using feeding as the default response to any infant distress or promoting bottle emptying) would reduce risk for overeating and overweight among first-born infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is based in part on evidence that feeding in response to infant hunger and fullness cues supports the development of appetite regulation (i.e., eating in response to hunger cues and not eating beyond satiation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In contrast, use of non-responsive, coercive and controlling feeding practices, characterized by parents providing few opportunities for children to make choices about food and eating and to develop self-regulatory skills (e.g., feeding to quiet a distressed infant who is not hungry), can promote overfeeding, rapid weight gain and obesity risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The INSIGHT curriculum included guidance on feeding, including how to recognize and distinguish hunger from other distress, taught parents to accurately identify fullness signs to prevent overfeeding, instructed parents on a variety of alternative soothing strategies to manage infant crying (e.g., swaddling, non-nutritive sucking) to prevent the use of food as a first response to crying, and provided parents active learning opportunities to practice these skills with a trained nurse. Infants randomized to the INSIGHT RP intervention had slower weight gain during the first 6 months after birth and a reduced prevalence of overweight at 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The aim of this secondary analysis was to assess the proximal effects of the RP INSIGHT intervention on parent feeding styles and behaviors during the first year after birth. The hypothesis for this analysis was that responsive feeding practices would be more prevalent among mothers randomized to the RP group relative to control.</p>

                <p id="Par13">Mothers and newborns were recruited into the INSIGHT study from one maternity ward in central Pennsylvania between January 2012 and March 2014. Mothers were eligible for the study if they were primiparous, English-speaking, and ≥ 20 years of age, and if their newborns were full-term (≥37 weeks gestation), singleton, and weighed ≥2500 g at birth. Using a computer-generated algorithm, mother-infant dyads were randomized 2 weeks after delivery to either an RP intervention or a safety control group, stratified on birth weight for gestational age (&lt;50th percentile or ≥ 50th percentile) and intended milk-feeding type. A baseline survey was administered to mothers electronically. Further details on study design, recruitment/eligibility, and a CONSORT diagram have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">Following randomization, preliminary intervention materials were mailed to all participants. As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], research nurses were trained in administering both the RP and safety control interventions at home visits conducted at child age 3–4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, and research center visit at 52 weeks. 291 mother-infant dyads were randomized. 279 mother-infant dyads completed the first home visit at 3–4 weeks and are considered the study cohort for all outcomes and analyses as specified prior to study initiation. At 28 and 52 weeks, 269 (96.4%) and 253 (90.7%) dyads remained in the study, and there was no significant difference in attrition by study group.

                <title>RP intervention feeding-related components</title>
                <p id="Par15">The INSIGHT intervention focused on RP in four domains of infant behavior: drowsy, sleeping, fussy, and alert and calm. A more detailed description of the RP and control curricula has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Feeding guidance during infancy included (1) recognizing and responding appropriately to infant hunger and satiety cues; (2) age-appropriate, bottle-feeding practices (i.e., bottle size, nipple flow, transition off bottle); (3) delaying introduction to solids until 4–6 months; (4) promoting acceptance, liking, and intake of developmentally appropriate foods such as vegetables through repeated exposure; (5) serving age appropriate portions of healthy foods; and (6) using structure-based, non-controlling feeding practices that allow the infant to affect intake through shared control of the initiation and termination of feedings. Major themes of the feeding curriculum at each time point are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. RP guidance for fussy infants in the first year involved teaching parents to recognize hunger and distinguish hunger from other infant distress, and to how to use alternatives to feeding (e.g. swaddling, swinging, offering pacifier) to soothe/calm a fussy infant to promote healthy self-regulation development, including learning to self-soothe. The control group received an intervention that was similar in intensity, but focused on home safety. Feeding-related messaging in the safety curriculum was focused on food safety and choking prevention.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Feeding messages in the responsive parenting intervention curriculum</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Intervention component</th><th colspan="4">Child age in weeks</th></tr><tr><th>3–4</th><th>16</th><th>28</th><th>40</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">What to feed</td></tr><tr><td> Only breastmilk or formula for first 4–6 months</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> No cereal in bottle</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Avoid/limit fruit juice</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Portion sizes for complementary foods</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Fruits and vegetables</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Foods to limit</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Water</td><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Snacking</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Cow’s milk</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">When to feed</td></tr><tr><td> Introducing solids at 4–6 months</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Introducing cup at 6–9 months</td><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Weaned from bottle by 1 year</td><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Introducing a spoon</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">How to feed</td></tr><tr><td> Bottle size &amp; nipple type</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Hunger and fullness cues</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Do not put to bed with bottle/cup</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Alternatives to using food to soothe</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Do not pressure child to eat</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Repeated exposure to new foods</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Modeling positive eating behavior</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Shared responsibility of feeding</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Mealtime routines</td><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Family meals</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Eating away from home</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Do not use food to reward/control behavior</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr><tr><td> Purchasing and access to unhealthy foods</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

In this analysis, results for the pressuring (pressure to finish, α = 0.81; pressure with cereal, α = 0.83; pressure to soothe, α = 0.79) restrictive (restrictive amount, α = 0.74; restrictive diet quality, α = 0.69), and responsive satiety (α = 0.77) feeding styles are presented.

This scale was modified to include contexts and situations when a mother could use feeding to soothe. An unweighted least squares exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was completed for the 21-item survey, using an equamax rotation (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Items were iteratively removed based on loadings that were &lt; 0.4 producing a factor structure with 2 eigenvalues &gt; 1. Restricting the EFA to 2 factors gave factor loadings with simple structure, with two feeding-to-soothe factors: contextual (6 items, α = 0.79) and emotional (6 items; α = 0.90). Higher contextual feeding-to-soothe scores indicate greater use of feeding to soothe or quiet a distressed child in a variety of contexts (i.e., in a doctor’s waiting room, in the car, before bed), without regard for whether hunger was the source of infant distress. Higher emotional feeding-to-soothe scores indicate greater use of feeding to soothe in response to either the infant’s distress, or maternal stress, frustration, or anger. Mothers also rated the effectiveness of using feeding to soothe their infant on a scale of 1 (does not work) to 4 (works all of the time).</p>

                <p id="Par26">In both the RP and control groups, the most common first food was infant cereal (71/124 (57.3%) in the RP group and 72/124 (58.1%) in control introduced cereal first), but among those who offered a different first food, mothers in the RP group were more likely to introduce vegetables first (50/124 (40.3%)) compared to control (31/124 (25.0%)). Mothers in the RP group reported introducing solids to their infant later than those in the control group (mean 22.0 ± SD 3.9 weeks vs. 21.0 ± 4.2 weeks, difference 1.0 (95% CI: 0.04–1.98) weeks, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04); however, the majority of mothers in both groups introduced solids between 4 and 6 months (17–26 weeks) (RP = 113/140 (80.7%), control = 117/139 (84.2%)), consistent with current guidance. Introduction before or after 6 months did not differ significantly between groups.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par30">Results provide support that the RP intervention influenced how first-time mothers were feeding their infants, and to a lesser extent <italic>what</italic> infants were fed. The RP mothers reported both less frequent use of non-responsive feeding practices that could promote excessive intake (i.e., feeding to soothe, pressuring to finish a bottle) and more frequent use of structure-based feeding (i.e., limit-setting, consistent feeding routines). Compared to control mothers, RP mothers also reported that feeding was less effective at soothing their infant. This may be because mothers were using alternatives to using food to soothe (e.g., swaddling swinging, pacifier), instead of using food as a first response to crying. Combined with evidence of the RP intervention’s effects on infant sleep health and dietary intake patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], data from this study contribute to identification of modifiable parenting behaviors associated with less rapid infant weight gain from birth to 28 weeks and lowered risk of overweight at 1 y as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. INSIGHT was designed as a multicomponent RP intervention based on the perspective that infant feeding is a key aspect of early caregiving related to infant arousal (i.e., fussing and crying), sleep, and active social play. Although our RP approach is novel with respect to early obesity prevention, these findings provide one more piece of evidence that RP guidance can promote beneficial parenting and child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">INSIGHT RP guidance focused on feeding in response to infant hunger and fullness, and on alternative soothing strategies to calm a non-hungry, distressed infant. Early in infancy, when exclusively milk-fed, infants are learning which cues are associated with initiation and termination of eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Infants need to learn to discriminate hunger from other distress, requiring sensitive parenting. In other words, parents should feed in response to hunger, but use other non-food approaches with distress that is not hunger-related (e.g., tired, scared, overstimulated). Repeated use of feeding to soothe a distressed, non-hungry infant pairs feeding with removal of non-hunger distress cues has been shown to influence infant weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although the mechanism is not clear, preschool children whose mothers report greater use of food to regulate their infant’s emotions have infants who are more likely to develop emotional eating styles and poorer diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">In this study, relative to the control, RP mothers reported that feeding was a less effective way to soothe their infant, which could have persistent effects on how mothers use food to manage child behavior as the child develops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Using food to soothe infant distress could result in conditioned eating in response to negative emotions, a characteristic of emotional eaters that is associated with obesity in older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. More evidence is needed, but is it possible that children are learning to eat in response to emotional cues. Pressuring the infant to finish the bottle can also increase infant intake and perhaps affect the extent to which infants attend to or ignore fullness cues in determining meal termination. Over time this can affect learning by shaping the extent to which internal fullness cues and amount of food remaining affect amount consumed, and ability to self-regulate. Serving children larger portions promotes increased intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and other experimental research with young children has shown that pressuring children to eat in order to finish consuming food on their plate can promote greater intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">RP intervention parents were less likely to report that they used feeding as the immediate, default response to infant crying and reported less frequent use of feeding to soothe. Compared to control, mothers in the RP group reported that both milk and solid foods were less effective at soothing their infant. This may because RP mothers had learned to use alternative approaches to soothing the infant, or they paid closer attention to their infant’s signals, using soothing techniques to calm a distressed infant, although direct evidence on this point is lacking. Infants cry for many reasons, hunger being just one. A potential explanation is that the RP group may just be less dependent on using food for non-nutritive soothing. Together, findings from this study provide support that an early parenting intervention can affect <italic>how</italic> and in what contexts infants are being fed, at least among first-time parents, and that how infants are fed can impact growth and weight outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Although The INSIGHT RP curriculum also targeted <italic>what</italic> foods infants consumed by providing traditional nutrition education to parents on age-appropriate foods and portions, results indicate that the RP intervention had very limited effects on what drinks and foods were consumed; the INSIGHT RP intervention did not affect the extent to which infants were offered fruit juice, sugar sweetened beverages, sweet foods, or fried foods at age 1 year. We previously reported differences in dietary <italic>patterns</italic> at 9 months between RP and control, particularly among formula-fed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, it is plausible that by age 1 year, most infants had nearly completed the transition to consuming diets very similar to those of other family members. Given this and the few observed group differences on diet quality, novel family-based interventions targeting the home food and eating environment may be needed to impact the family diet during this critical developmental period when the infant is transitioning to the adult diet. It is unlikely that interventions can impact “what” foods infants and toddlers are exposed to without also changing what their parents are eating.</p>
              <p id="Par35">A study limitation is that all feeding behavior and food intake data were self-reported; RP mothers may have provided socially desirable responses. However, differences between treatment groups were much less evident for what was fed (e.g., sugar sweetened beverages, sweet and salty foods, fruits and vegetables), despite the fact that it is common knowledge that some foods are considered to be healthy for children (e.g., vegetables) and others are not (e.g., SSBs, fried foods). Mothers may have systematically under-reported the “unhealthy” foods. In addition to INSIGHT guidance on feeding, parents receive messages about what to eat and what not to eat from many other sources, including their pediatricians, the Special Supplemental Nutrition program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), in addition to pervasive marketing. This provides additional evidence for including 0–2 years in the Dietary Guidelines. Given the INSIGHT findings and national data, novel interventions targeting the family eating environment may be needed to impact the family diet when the infant is transitioning to the adult diet. Lastly, our sample was relatively demographically homogenous and is not nationally representative, limiting the generalizability of our findings.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par36">The INSIGHT RP intervention affected maternal feeding practices. During the first year, RP mothers were consistently less likely to report using feeding to soothe their infant for reasons other than hunger, and less likely to report that feeding was an effective strategy for soothing their infant. Because RP mothers learned that alternative soothing strategies could be effective in soothing their infant, they may have been less likely to feed in response to contextual or emotional cues. RP mothers were also encouraged to terminate feedings in response to infant cues. RP mothers were less likely to report trying to get their infant to finish a bottle or other food. In contrast, RP mothers were more likely to use structure and routines in feeding. Taken together, these early differences in maternal feeding suggest that RP and control infants may have had different early experiences with feeding; in particular, the extent to which environmental or internal cues predicted the onset and termination of feedings, affecting the extent to which infants eat in response to hunger or in response to other distress. Findings support the view that providing anticipatory guidance on RP in feeding can promote use of more sensitive, structure-based feeding, which could reduce obesity risk by affecting how and when infants are fed. These findings, in combination with others from INSIGHT indicate that the RP intervention can affect multiple outcomes including feeding, sleeping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and early growth and obesity risk in infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
