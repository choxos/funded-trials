                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Serious invasive infections in newborns are a major cause of death. Lack of data on etiological causes hampers progress towards reduction of mortality. This study aimed to identify pathogens responsible for such infections in young infants in sub-Saharan Africa and to describe their antibiotics resistance profile.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Between September 2016 and April 2018 we implemented an observational study in two rural sites in Burkina Faso and Tanzania enrolling young infants aged 0–59 days old with serious invasive infection. Blood samples underwent blood culture and molecular biology.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In total 634 infants with clinical diagnosis of serious invasive infection were enrolled and 4.2% of the infants had a positive blood culture. The most frequent pathogens identified by blood culture were <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, followed by <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>. Gram-negative isolates were only partially susceptible to first line WHO recommended treatment for neonatal sepsis at community level. A total of 18.6% of the infants were PCR positive for at least one pathogen and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were the most common bacteria detected. Among infants enrolled, 60/634 (9.5%) died. Positive blood culture but not positive PCR was associated with risk of death. For most deaths, no pathogen was identified either by blood culture or molecular testing, and hence a causal agent remained unclear. Mortality was associated with low body temperature, tachycardia, respiratory symptoms, convulsions, history of difficult feeding, movement only when stimulated or reduced level of consciousness, diarrhea and/or vomiting.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>While <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, as well as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> were pathogens most frequently identified in infants with clinical suspicion of serious invasive infections, most cases remain without definite diagnosis, making more accurate diagnostic tools urgently needed. Antibiotics resistance to first line antibiotics is an increasing challenge even in rural Africa.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Children are at highest risk of dying in their first month of life- the risk being consistently greatest (36%) within the first 24 hours after birth, 37% during the remaining first week of life, and 28% for the first month across regions [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although child mortality has halved since 1990, progress in neonatal mortality is slow in highest-burden countries, and especially in Africa which is the only region with no decline in neonatal mortality between 1990 and 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] leading to predictions that most sub-Saharan African countries will miss their Sustainable Development Goal target for neonatal mortality [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition to immediate mortality, survivors of severe invasive neonatal infections are at risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment and disability with excess mortality after the neonatal period [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Infections are responsible for approximately 37% of the 2.9 million neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and although the management of severe infections can reduce deaths by 84%, it is calculated that successful management has the greatest number of bottlenecks [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Rapid detection and immediate treatment are essential to save life. There are an estimated 6.9 million annual serious neonatal bacterial infections needing treatment, and one-third occur in sub-Saharan Africa, despite evidence of 25% reductions in all-cause neonatal mortality with immediate antibiotic treatment [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The microbiological etiology of infections in young infants has been described in very few studies, mostly hospital based [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A study in African infants under 2 months of age brought to facilities showed that probable or definite pathogens in children requiring admission were identified in 10.6% of patients [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a large multi-country Asian study, only 2.1% of blood cultures (102/4859) were able to identify a responsible pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of invasive bacterial infections in neonates found <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella</italic> spp., <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, the most frequent pathogen identified in culture positive sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Information on the burden of antibiotic resistance contributing to poor outcomes in neonates is lacking. Assessing the resistance profile of pathogens is important to ensure optimal treatment, avoid excessive and unnecessary antibiotic use and prevent further increases in antimicrobial resistance. Blood culture, the gold standard for diagnosis, has several limitations. Limited blood volume sampled in young infants, intermittent bacteriemia, and prior use of antibiotics in the mother at delivery can reduce blood culture yield. Consequently, molecular diagnosis is seen as a promising alternative for pathogen identification.</p>
              <p>We conducted an observational study to identify microbiological causes of severe invasive infection in young African infants, using blood culture and molecular testing to identify possible causal pathogens. We also documented antibiotic resistance profiles for pathogens identified by blood culture. Finally, we assessed the association of clinical signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, with episode outcome.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>This was an observational study implemented between 2016 and 2018 in two rural sites in sub-Saharan Africa to identify pathogens causing severe invasive infections in young infants aged 0–59 days old.</p>
                <p>In Burkina Faso the study took place in a rural catchment area of approximately 62,000 inhabitants, a demographic surveillance site served by 8 peripheral healthcare centers at which a nurse is located, and by the district hospital Centre Médical avec Antenne Chirurgicale Saint Camille de Nanoro, located in Central West Burkina Faso. Within the catchment area, the “Agents de Santé Communautaire” trained by the District Sanitaire (part of the Ministry of Health) followed newborns.</p>
                <p>In Tanzania, the study took place in Haydom Lutheran Hospital (HLH) catchment area, situated in the north-central part of Tanzania, approximately 300 km from Arusha the nearest city and covering 74 villages and a population of 295,581 persons. The population in this catchment receives regular reproductive, clinical and nutritional care provided by the HLH Reproductive and Child Health Section (RCHS) through monthly mobile outreach clinics.</p>

                <title>Community-based surveillance of pregnancy and newborns</title>
                <p>Prior to study initiation, surveillance in the communities was strengthened to enable all pregnancies to be identified. Eligible participants were pregnant women and live-born babies in the community catchment area. Consenting pregnant women were registered during their third trimester of pregnancy by Field Workers (FWs) or Community Health Workers (CHWs) or nurses trained to assess and manage young infants with signs of invasive infection using the young infant component of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) training package. FWs and CHWs conducted home visits to support antenatal care, help women prepare for birth, encourage skilled delivery and motivate the family to follow optimal newborn care practices immediately after birth. They also followed all women and newborns (by phone or home-visits) as early as possible after delivery. After birth, the mother-child pairs were visited at home several times until the baby reached 2 months old usually on days 1 (or as close as possible to the date of delivery), 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 21, 28, 42, 59, following WHO/UNICEF recommendations on newborn surveillance. Any young infant identified with danger signs was to be referred to the hospital for further assessment and possible enrollment.</p>

                <p>Infants aged 0–59 days, presenting with clinical suspicion of invasive infection were enrolled either at the Centre Médical Saint Camille de Nanoro, the referral hospital of Nanoro district in Burkina Faso, or the Centre Médical Saint Louis de Temnaoré, another district hospital, or at Haydom Lutheran Hospital (HLH) the referral hospital for 3 districts and 2 regions in Tanzania. Signs and symptoms used to identify clinical suspicion of invasive infections were any of the following: history of difficult feeding, movement only when stimulated, fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 C) or low body temperature (axillary temperature &lt; 35.5 C), respiratory rate &gt; 60 breaths per minute, severe chest indrawing and history of convulsions.

                <p>The primary objective of the study was to describe the etiology of invasive severe infections in infants &lt; = 59 days of age. We aimed to enroll 300 infants at each site (600 infants in total)—of which at least 50% were to be aged 0–7 days. It was anticipated that this number of children with an equal proportion of children in each age group would have a 95% CI of +/- 4% and based on a minimum of 5% positive rate in blood culture estimated from previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], might yield 30 positive blood cultures results.</p>

                <p>At the hospital, detailed data on medical history, date and mode of delivery, prematurity, delivery complications, and use of antibiotics by the mother during labor were systematically collected in addition to clinical presentation including temperature, weight, height, appearance/coloration, respiratory rate, pulse, oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, chest indrawing, signs of dehydration, cord infection, tonus and evident birth defects. An abdominal, liver, spleen and chest examination was carried out at enrolment and daily if the child was admitted.</p>
                <p>Results of laboratory assessments carried out (e.g. haemoglobin, white blood cells, or C-reactive protein measurement, culture of cerebrospinal fluid or urine culture), and treatment administered at the clinician’s discretion, were recorded. Any information on clinical evaluation and treatments provided were recorded on the Case Record Form. No attempt was made to influence clinical management and treatment which followed the local standard of clinical care. Use of antibiotics prior to hospital admission was not recorded.</p>
                <p>All admitted patients were monitored daily during hospitalization until discharge and then at 7 and 28 days after discharge to ascertain clinical outcome, defined as either death or survival.</p>

                <title>Collection of samples</title>
                <p>The study protocol allowed for study physicians to obtain blood samples on all infants with suspected severe invasive infection, irrespective of whether admission was later declined. Blood samples were taken upon enrollment and before treatment when possible, after a consultant neonatologist had trained clinical and laboratory staff on neonatal sampling. Up to 2 ml (for infants 0–7 days old), or up to 2.5 ml (for infants 8–59 days) venous blood was collected following standard procedures in place in hospital. Hemoglobin and glucose were measured upon admission on capillary blood, and venous blood collected for immediate blood culture and later PCR analysis. Blood samples were collected on EDTA tubes for molecular testing and stored at -20°C or—80°C until analysis.</p>
                <p>In Burkina Faso, as the area is hyperendemic for malaria, malaria rapid tests (HRP-2 based antigen test) and microscopy (for patients with rapid test positive results) was performed upon enrollment.</p>
                <p>In some cases, following routine patient care procedures, other blood testing (e.g. full blood count, C-reactive protein) were collected upon physician’s judgement, although not required as part of the protocol.</p>

                <p>At hospital, all sick infants enrolled presented one or more of the criteria for clinical suspicion of severe invasive infection: fever or hypothermia (79%), history of difficult feeding (33%), elevated respiratory rate &gt; 60 per minute (23%), severe chest indrawing (11%), movement only when stimulated (9%) and history of convulsions (8%).</p>
                <p>When clinically examined, about 2/3 of the infants had fever, and 11% presented with hypothermia (axillar temperature &lt; 35.5°C). Only 3% had tachycardia (defined as &gt; 180 beats per minute), but 26% had increased respiratory rate and 23% had low oxygen saturation. Altered consciousness was present in 12%, and coma in 1% (Tables <xref rid="pone.0264322.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0264322.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The study was designed to provide information on pathogens in young infants with clinical presentation of invasive infections. We found an overall blood culture positivity rate of 4.2% in infants enrolled with clinical presentation of invasive infection although the positivity rate was higher (13.3%) in the infants who died. The low yield, despite attempts to shorten the time between sample collection and culture, corresponds with previous literature in a similar population, including the large multi-country ANISA study [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but limits any correlation between antibiotics resistance, treatment administered and outcomes. A few studies have obtained 10–13% positivity rates [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and even 37% [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but these were studies generally conducted in infants qualifying for intensive care or where larger blood volumes were sampled for blood culture. Direct PCR on blood increased detection substantially, yielding a bacterial pathogen in ~11%, a viral pathogen in 7%, and Plasmodium in 2%. Therefore, like previous studies, it was not possible to attribute a definite causal pathogen for most patients, even those who died.</p>
              <p>The study provides new insights on the role and limitations of current molecular diagnosis tools for laboratory confirmation of etiological causes of invasive infections. While molecular analysis yielded higher positive rates than blood culture (18.6% of positivity for molecular detection of pathogens in blood), the yield remained low for confirmation of clinical suspicion of sepsis. A major challenge of blood culture or quantitative PCR in neonates or young infants is the low sample volume which can safely or ethically be drawn. In our study we limited total sampling volume to that required for immediate management (haematology and biochemistry testing) and blood culture and molecular analysis to 2–2.5 ml, which meant that the volume retained for identifying pathogens was usually ≤ 1 ml. Larger blood draws might have improved sensitivity of blood culture and molecular analysis [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and indeed, we noticed that infants with higher available blood had higher PCR detection rates, suggesting blood volume is an important determinant.</p>
              <p>Molecular tests alone cannot yet be used to replace hemoculture and guide a therapeutic decision reliably, but they have become valuable in concert with other modalities to understand epidemiological causes of childhood illness and death. For example, the CHAMPS network uses molecular tests among many other diagnostic techniques to detect pathogens, however these data are combined with multiple other modalities to attribute final etiologies [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Clinical judgement remains essential as molecular tests may identify pathogens that have no clinical consequences [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Overall, while molecular testing has the potential to widen the diagnostic spectrum and provide rapid diagnosis compared to blood culture, PCR still has limitations in clinical practice in addition to cost.</p>
              <p>As expected, the study confirms a concentration of deaths in the first week of life [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While admissions in the study were balanced between infants aged 0–7 days and 8–59 days, 48 out of 60 deaths occurred in infants aged 0–7 days at admission. Age at death was not the same as age of admission and 37/60 deaths occurred in the first week of life, 17/60 deaths occurred in infants aged 8–28 days, and only 6/60 deaths occurred in infants aged more 29 days, confirming the first week of life as particularly vulnerable for survival. Mortality in hospitalized infants with positive blood culture was 3 times higher than in infants with negative blood culture, confirming previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although the sample size was small, the pathogens most frequently detected in blood culture were <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, corresponding with previous results from sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although both study sites were in rural areas, there were differences in pathogens. All <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> were detected in Tanzania; this may either reflect a difference in geographical variation of pathogens or reflect the occurrence of a local outbreak since 6 out of 8 cases were detected over a period of three to four weeks. While the temporal presentation may reflect a cluster of cases, the cases included infants born in the hospital and at home, and it was not possible to identify any links between the cases.</p>
              <p>The role of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus agalactaie</italic> seems relatively minor in our cohort. However, despite a careful follow up of pregnancies and newborns, some deaths occurred very prematurely at home for which we have no information, and therefore the importance of Group B <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> may be underestimated by the lack of information on those cases of deaths at home before referral.</p>
              <p>As per WHO recommendations when referral is not possible, empiric treatment for severe invasive infection can be initiated with amoxicillin or ampicillin plus gentamicin. While this treatment covers most infections, it was not appropriate for some gram-negative infections where resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin was considerable (e.g., 8/8 of <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> isolates resistant to ampicillin and gentamycin).</p>
              <p>Standard treatment administered to sick infants varied between the two sites, with ceftriaxone being used more frequently in Burkina Faso (in about 50% of the cases treated with systemic antibiotics) than in Tanzania (in &lt;10% of the cases), and gentamicin was used much less in Burkina Faso (42% of cases treated with systemic antibiotics) than in Tanzania (97% of cases). While ceftriaxone is not used as first line treatment in Tanzania, we detected high rates of resistance to this antibiotic for some pathogens, with 100% of the <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> identified in Tanzania as drug-resistant. In general, antimicrobial resistance was important in Tanzania, where <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> was resistant to several common antibiotics including ceftriaxone, suggesting extended spectrum beta lactamase use.</p>
              <p>Respiratory symptoms, tachycardia, low body temperature, history of difficult feeding or reduced level of consciousness, but also diarrhea and/or vomiting and to a lesser extent fever were all associated with poorer outcomes. This is consistent with previous findings correlating symptoms with severe illness and poor outcomes in young infants [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Limited numbers did not permit a correlation analysis of signs and symptoms and blood culture positivity.</p>
              <p>Several study limitations were identified. The inclusion and exclusion criteria captured a higher number of infants suspected to be severe invasive infections. However, they did not exclude important co-morbidities such as birth asphyxia, preterm birth or severe congenital anomalies which are related to neonatal morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and made it difficult to ascertain the role of a potential pathogen compared with other risk factors on the clinical presentation and outcome of these cases.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the low yield of blood culture in identification of pathogens may have been influenced by the administration of antibiotics prior to blood sampling. As mentioned above, about half the enrolled infants received the first dose of antibiotics on admission, prior to sampling and antibiotic treatment prior to admission was not systematically documented.</p>
              <p>Third, diagnosis is limited to blood culture and molecular testing on blood for specific pathogens. Other large studies [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] using additional sample types or diagnostic methods, were able to attribute the presumed bacterial infection to bacteria in 16% of the cases when using a combination of blood culture and molecular testing in blood and respiratory samples.</p>
              <p>Fourth, the study did not have a control group to compare PCR results. This omission complicates the interpretation of the PCR results given the findings of prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0264322.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0264322.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] which have shown that certain target pathogens (such as CMV, <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pyogenes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">oxytoca</italic>) were detected by molecular testing in blood of control infants without clinical symptoms. While the overall positivity rate of the PCR yield was higher than blood culture yield, it was also less strongly associated with poor outcomes. For example, infants that were culture positive for <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pneumoniae</italic> showed a 42% mortality, while those that were PCR positive for these pathogens showed only a 5% mortality. It is plausible that this mortality difference is due to the detection of living versus dead bacteria. On the other hand, detection by PCR of <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aureus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pneumo</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">pyogenes</italic> all showed a higher 20–50% mortality, arguing that these PCR detections are clinically significant.</p>
              <p>Fifth, while the study, based on close follow up and integrated community case management (iCCM), was designed to rapidly detect clinical deterioration in newborns and neonates, some deaths occurred at home before hospital referral, particularly immediately after birth. We therefore missed information on a certain number of the neonatal deaths which occurred before hospital referral/admission could be achieved.</p>
              <p>Finally, the sample size was small, and in addition to a low blood culture positivity rate and the lack of a control group for PCR testing, the number of laboratory-confirmed invasive infections for the whole study was low and limited analysis of blood culture results and clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>However, this is one of the very few reports of data on etiological causes of invasive infections in very young infants in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The study was conducted in remote areas, where efforts had been made to reflect what happens in rural communities and ensure that lab component of the study was optimally designed and implemented. The study was based on an extensive surveillance at community with rapid referral to hospital from the communities and blood sampling, handling, and culture occurring within a very short timeframe. The teams were fully trained for neonatal blood sampling and had research experience. This study provides hitherto missing data on etiological causes of infection and levels of antibiotic resistance in treating neonatal invasive infections in rural sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
