                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>Hypertension is the most important modifiable stroke risk factor, but blood pressure (BP) remains poorly controlled after stroke, especially among Black and Hispanic patients. We tested the feasibility of TASC (Telehealth After Stroke Care), a post-acute stroke care model integrating nurse-supported home BP telemonitoring, tailored infographics, and multidisciplinary team video visits.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Acute stroke patients with hypertension were randomized at discharge to usual care or usual care with TASC. Usual care patients received video visits with primary care and stroke. TASC included a tablet and monitor to wirelessly transmit BP data to the electronic health record, with telenursing support, tailored infographics to explain BP readings, and pharmacist visits. Outcomes assessment was blinded. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, randomization, adherence, and retention. Systolic BP from baseline to 3 months after discharge was evaluated using generalized linear modeling.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Fifty patients (64±14 years; 36% women‚ 44% Hispanic, 32% Black, 54% ≤high school education, 30% private insurance), and 75% of all eligible were enrolled over 6.3 months. Baseline systolic BP was similar in both (TASC n=25, 140±19 mm Hg; usual care n=25, 142±19 mm Hg). At 3 months, adherence to video visits (91% versus 75%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.14) and retention (84% versus 64%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.11) were higher with TASC. Home systolic BP declined by 16±19 mm Hg from baseline in TASC and increased by 3±24 mm Hg in usual care (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.01). Among Black patients, systolic BP control (&lt;130 mm Hg) improved from 40% to 100% with TASC versus 14% to 29%, and among Hispanic patients, from 23% to 62% with TASC, versus 33% to 17% in usual care.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Enhancing post-acute stroke care with home BP telemonitoring is feasible to improve hypertension in an underserved setting and should be tested in a definitive randomized clinical trial.</p>

            <p>Projected increases in stroke prevalence vary by racial and ethnic category, with the largest increases expected in Hispanic and Black populations.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Systems of care for secondary prevention need to be developed with concerted efforts to address racial/ethnic disparities in stroke outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The post-acute stroke period offers a valuable target for focused attention with highest risk of recurrent stroke.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Small reductions (5 mm Hg) in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after stroke are associated with a greater than 20% reduction in recurrent stroke risk.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, hypertension remains poorly controlled after incident stroke in up to 55% of survivors.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Patient factors including Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and low health literacy have been associated with poor BP control.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Up to a third of stroke patients report poor adherence to antihypertensive medications.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, Black and Hispanic stroke patients have less access to care and medications compared to White patients with differences in health insurance coverage.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These factors are amplified in underserved settings with increased workload from life demands, and reduced capacity poststroke due to physical and mental disabilities that affect access, utilization, and self-management when considering the Cumulative Complexity Model.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Multi-faceted interventions that seek to improve poststroke BP control, expand access to poststroke care, reduce therapeutic inertia of clinicians, and improve patient self-efficacy for hypertension management are needed to effectively address these disparities. As visually communicated health information, tailored infographics can make medical information more accessible among patients with varying levels of health literacy and enhance patients’ decision-making capabilities.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The scientific premise is that building knowledge can lead to improvement in patient-reported outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Telemedicine has gained a role in access to care since the pandemic ensued, but apparent disparities among vulnerable populations need to be addressed to provide equitable care.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> BP telemonitoring has shown promise in reducing BP,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and integrated team-based care through multidisciplinary collaborations among nursing, pharmacy and physicians has been shown to be most potent approach in the general population.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> More recently, community-based efforts have addressed disparities among Black and Hispanic patients with home BP telemonitoring and nurse care management.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
            <p>In post-acute stroke care, home BP monitoring with tailored infographics and multidisciplinary telehealth visits inclusive of pharmacists have not been studied in healthcare systems serving urban underserved communities. We developed a multidisciplinary team-based model including nursing, pharmacy, and physicians (TASC [Telehealth After Stroke Care]), integrated with home BP monitoring (HBPM) and BP education in the form of patient-tailored visual information. Our goal was to establish feasibility of the intervention, in empowering self-management by providing accessible integrated services, equipment, and educational materials.</p>

Data transmission relied on cellular networks, without need for preexisting health technology, or Wi-Fi at home. Nurses telephoned patients every 2 weeks and for severely elevated BP (&gt;180/110 mm Hg). They assessed for concerning symptoms and notified the physician who could decide whether additional intervention was needed by team members, who were also on the communication list. Tele nurses also reinforced changes to antihypertensive medication regimens made. Data from the tablet BP monitoring results and patient reported surveys were completed on the electronic tablet and wirelessly transmitted to our electronic health record (EHR) systems (EPIC Systems, WI) and to a web-based platform (eCare Coordinator) available for the telehealth nurses and the patient’s treating clinical team to see. If patients failed to measure BP data at home for 2 weeks, they were contacted by the call center nurse. Remote technical assistance was also provided.</p>

              <p>In this feasibility study of enhanced post-acute stroke care in patients with hypertension returning home after discharge, we demonstrated that it is feasible to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing TASC plus usual care versus usual care in our health care system. We found a high rate of participation among eligible patients inclusive of a large percentage of Black and Hispanic individuals with lower literacy levels. We also demonstrated that the multicomponent TASC intervention was highly acceptable to patients. While exploratory, we showed promising impact of home BP monitoring, multidisciplinary visits, and tailored infographic-driven education from discharge to outpatient care at 3 months. to improve SBP control remotely. TASC may be a feasible poststroke care model and facilitate clinical improvement in BP outcomes in an underserved setting.</p>

SBP was reduced by 6.1 mm Hg compared to 3.4 mm Hg in usual care over 36 months.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In our trial, the magnitude of change over the first 3 months, when risk of recurrent stroke is greatest, suggests an additional benefit with our team-based intervention with telemonitoring and visits even amongst vulnerable US populations with lower education levels. Home blood pressure monitoring with nursing support has been conducted among stroke survivors in underserved communities,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and in nontraditional health outreach settings with pharmacist support in the general population<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> among patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In our study, patients in usual care who were controlled at baseline were more likely to be uncontrolled at 3 months. This suggests value in including all hypertensive post-acute stroke patients in further study, both those uncontrolled and controlled at the time of discharge (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041020" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>Transition of Care With Multidisciplinary Teams in an Underserved Setting</title>
                <p>Our study was designed to promote transitions of care among post-acute stroke participants returning home in an underserved setting with outpatient multidisciplinary care. Transitions of care should include optimal communication and co-ordination of services, as the initial return to home is a vulnerable period for stroke patients. Effective hospital planning and outpatient follow-up within 1 month has been related to reduced risk of short-term hospital readmission.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In Canada, consolidated post-discharge outpatient stroke care has been demonstrated to improve mortality and reduce cost per person for stroke care outside the hospital when compared to the standard of care.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
                <p>When considering utility of multidisciplinary visits, in Australia, the ICARUSS study (Integrated Care for the Reduction of Secondary Stroke) with bidirectional feedback between primary care and specialists demonstrated within goal SBP at 12 months in the intervention alone<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> suggesting utility of combined primary care and stroke specialist services in the post-discharge period.</p>
                <p>Adherence to the first visit was highest in both arms, and complete in the retained intervention patients. This suggests importance of the first transitions of care visit in engaging participants.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Further, care provided by NP at the first visit post-discharge to explain infographics and prescribe medications to address transitions of care may have supported patient follow-up and adherence. COMPASS (Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services), a randomized pragmatic trial in North Carolina developed a NP-driven transitional care model. Although 35% of patients at intervention hospitals attended a clinic visit and the primary findings were not statistically significant, it did show a trend favoring self-reported home BP monitoring among intervention patients.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> We found a favorable response to home-based BP monitoring with telenursing support soon after discharge with higher adherence to visits. It suggests that an approach targeting BP control may be a promising outcome for proximal health behavior change and facilitate transitions of care among post-acute stroke patients.</p>
                <p>In our study, tele-pharmacy visits were not adhered to by most participants, probably because of the burden of individual appointments and unfamiliar role of clinical pharmacists in patient care. Although twice as many medications-related interventions were made in the intervention arm, most were outside of these visits in response to elevated BP readings monitored by the physicians. There may still be utility in engaging pharmacists in the poststroke care team. In a randomized clinical trial conducted among patients with recent minor stroke or transient ischemic attack‚ comparing monthly outpatient follow-up with a pharmacist case manager (intervention) or nurse (active control) over 6 months, there was substantial improvement in SBP in both arms, but greater benefit with active pharmacist case management. Benefit may be related to their ability in some locations to prescribe medications in a collaborative agreement with treating physicians according to the treatment algorithms rather than escalating to physicians.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> This lends credence to the idea that adding pharmacists to the multidisciplinary team post-discharge would help in such teams with a focus on outpatient care.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is evidence that pharmacist-led hypertension management with blood pressure telemonitoring can be effective in a primary care setting and may be cost-effective in high-risk patients.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Integrating tele-pharmacists early post-discharge as part of multidisciplinary team visits with other providers may reduce patient burden of recurring visits, and reduce clinical inertia through collaborative drug therapy management for stroke patients.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In addition to race, education, income, zip code poverty, health insurance, social isolation, and residence have been reported as social determinants affecting incident stroke.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> We found these to be prevalent in our population, among intervention and usual care arms. In a study in California among chronic stroke patients, SUCCEED (Secondary Stroke Prevention by Uniting Community and Chronic Care Model Teams Early to End Disparities) aimed to compare poststroke outcomes in ethnic minorities with a multimodal coordinated care intervention, but only 14.5% participants completed intervention delivery, less than a third presented to the clinic, and there was no significant change in SBP.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> In our study, among the intervention arm those retained were more likely Hispanic and with low education levels. This suggests that providing appointments to stroke patients before discharge, identifying and engaging informal caregivers in the immediate post-event period, and introducing the post-care clinical team with language-concordant instructions served to facilitate continuity of care after discharge and better adherence to the treatment protocol. Including culturally sensitive and language concordant measures in our design may have assisted in patient engagement. As a large proportion of our local population is Hispanic,<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> multigenerational family living is common and support harnessed by identifying and involving caregivers in the family before discharge may have utilized these cultural strengths.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Infographics</title>
                <p>As these were not previously utilized in patient care as a clinical communication tool for engagement, sharing these tailored infographics was a new approach integrated into the patient’s first post-discharge visit.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> A motivational interview centered around BP control and goal measurements with education regarding hypertension was feasible through video visits. The tailored infographics discussed at the first visit may have aided in improved adherence but there is need to further examine these as a clinically meaningful strategy for attending to health disparities among those with varying levels of health literacy.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>Limitations included the study sample size such that between group differences should be interpreted cautiously. Given feasibility of this approach, an adequately powered trial will be planned with a goal to study adequate BP control with enhancement in self-management. Differences in completeness of outcome data collection in the 2 arms may have been due to bias in the TASC patients who were initiated into home BP monitoring early after discharge as opposed to usual care at 3 months. There were more dropouts among patients discharged home without BP medications, particular to the usual care group, suggesting that these individuals may not have identified with a diagnosis of hypertension (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041020" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link>). This may be considered as an exclusion criterion in future study. There were some expected imbalances between the 2 arms in terms of baseline BP control. However, sensitivity analysis by BP control at baseline did not alter the clinical outcome of SBP control at 3 months (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041020" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>Generalizability to patients with severe stroke impairments and higher socioeconomical status populations may be unclear. However, we found our approach feasible among vulnerable patient populations that are often excluded from interventional trials. Our participants had a distribution representative of our Northern Manhattan population that is like underserved populations across the country that bear the greatest burden of stroke and uncontrolled hypertension. The Hispanic population in Northern Manhattan is mostly of Dominican descent and may differ from Hispanic populations in other parts of the US.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Future Directions</title>
                <p>There is need for qualitative methods to understand the patient experience, as well as discussions with stakeholders pertaining to implementation barriers with a focus on cost and sustainability. Identifying most important specific components within the TASC intervention will help to inform the optimized intervention, consisting of optimal doses of the selected components for eventual evaluation in a standard confirmatory randomized controlled trial.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p>

              <p>The data provides feasibility of the TASC approach, and its application through a telehealth-based platform. Enhancing post-acute stroke care with home BP telemonitoring is a promising approach to improving hypertension control in an underserved setting that should be tested in a definitive powered trial for the most effective strategy.</p>
