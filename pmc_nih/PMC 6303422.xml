                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a dismal prognosis. Nearly all will relapse with no clear standard of care for recurrent disease (rGBM). Approximately 50% of patients have tumors harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) amplification. The antibody–drug conjugate depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m) binds cells with <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification, is internalized, and releases a microtubule toxin, killing the cell. Here we report efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of depatux-m + temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified rGBM.</p>

                  <p>M12-356 (NCT01800695) was an open-label study encompassing patients with newly diagnosed or rGBM across 3 treatment arms. Results are reported for adults with <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified, measurable rGBM who received depatux-m (0.5–1.5 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15, and TMZ (150–200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on days 1–5 in a 28-day cycle.

                  <p>There were 60 patients, median age 56 years (range, 20–79). Fifty-nine patients previously received TMZ. Common adverse events (AEs) were blurred vision (63%), fatigue (38%), and photophobia (35%). Grades 3/4 AEs were split between ocular and non-ocular AEs, occurring in 22% of patients each. Systemic PK exposure of depatux-m was dose proportional. The objective response rate was 14.3%, the 6-month progression-free survival rate was 25.2%, and the 6-month overall survival rate was 69.1%.</p>

                <title>Importance of the Study</title>
                <p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor, with extremely poor prognosis and high unmet need for novel therapies. Approximately 50% of patients have tumors with <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification, presenting an attractive therapeutic target. Depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m) is an antibody–drug conjugate that specifically targets tumor cells expressing EGFR, and has demonstrated efficacy in recurrent GBM. Here we present further data showing efficacy of depatux-m in combination with temozolomide in recurrent GBM. These findings indicate that further study of depatux-m in glioblastoma is justified. Global, randomized trials for <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM are ongoing.</p>

            <p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in adults. Prognosis is poor, with a median overall survival (OS) ranging 14–16 months, and a 24-month survival of approximately 30%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Few patients survive 5 years from diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Relapse after initial therapy almost always occurs, and there is currently no clear standard of care for recurrent GBM (rGBM). Lomustine monotherapy is a commonly used approach,<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and temozolomide (TMZ) rechallenge can be used to manage rGBM, at times with an alternative dosing schedule employed, which is thought to overcome resistance.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Bevacizumab is also routinely used at recurrence, but no studies have definitively shown a benefit in OS in rGBM.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Currently, there is no treatment that impacts OS in rGBM, and this continues to be an active area of investigation in clinical trials.</p>
            <p>Amplification of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) gene is observed in approximately 50% of GBMs<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref></sup> and presents an attractive tumor-specific target. About 50% of <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified tumors also harbor the variant III mutation (<italic>EGFRvIII</italic>),<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a deletion of <italic>EGFR</italic> exons 2–7 that has a distinct conformation and is tumor specific and constitutively active. Approximately 80% of cases with <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification at diagnosis retain amplification at recurrence.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref></sup> Approaches employing inhibitors of EGFR signaling, such as the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, have been disappointing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15–20</xref></sup> Similarly, naked EGFR-directed antibodies such as cetuximab have also failed to improve survival in the GBM population.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m, formerly ABT-414) is an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) that uses <italic>EGFR</italic> as an entry point to deliver a toxic payload directly to tumor cells. Dysregulated EGFR activation in tumor cells leads to a unique conformation of EGFR that allows binding by the EGFR-specific, monoclonal antibody depatuxizumab (depatux, formerly ABT-806). Efficacy of depatux treatment in GBM is limited.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, conjugation of receptor-directed antibodies to toxins in order to form ADCs have been successful approaches in other cancers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>Thus, cysteine (cys) residues on depatux were conjugated to the anti-microtubule agent monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), a potent toxin, via a noncleavable linker<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> to generate the ADC depatux-m. Depatux-m binds the EGFR epitope on the surface of the cell exposed in the active receptor conformation, either wild-type or EGFRvIII mutant. Depatux-m is then internalized and releases the toxic payload cys-mcMMAF (cys-mafodotin), which in turn binds to the microtubule network, arresting proliferation and killing the cell. The dose-limiting toxicities of depatux-m are distinct from those typically associated with EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In addition, depatux-m has very limited binding of EGFR in normal tissues.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Finally, preclinical studies demonstrated antitumor activity with and without TMZ in GBM cell lines and mouse xenograft models,<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> leading to interest in strategies such as the trial described here.</p>
            <p>Previously, we reported tolerable safety data and the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of depatux-m in newly diagnosed GBM when combined with radiotherapy and TMZ, and rGBM as monotherapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Furthermore, we have shown encouraging efficacy in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified, rGBM treated with depatux-m monotherapy, and that <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification enriches for response.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Therefore, we now present efficacy, safety, and PK data in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified rGBM treated with depatux-m in combination with TMZ in a multicenter, international phase I clinical trial.</p>

              <title>Materials and Methods</title>
              <p>Study M12-356 (NCT01800695) was a multicenter, phase I, open-label study composed of 3 treatment arms designed to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and PK of depatux-m alone or in combination with other treatments in patients with GBM.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In the arm presented here, we treated patients with rGBM with depatux-m in combination with TMZ in a dose escalation cohort, and then a dose expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Results from the other arms of the trial have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref></sup> This study was performed in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All patients or appropriate surrogates provided written informed consent prior to enrollment according to national regulation; the study design was approved by the institutional review board/ethics committee of each participating institution.</p>

                <p>Trial eligibility criteria were described previously,<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> comprising, in brief, adults with recurrent/progressive GBM defined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria,<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> who were bevacizumab naïve, with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of at least 70, and normal end-organ function. We previously demonstrated that responses to depatux-m, either alone or with TMZ, occurred exclusively in <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Therefore, the trial was amended during accrual to require centrally confirmed <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification as an eligibility criterion for the dose expansion cohort; accordingly, the current analysis describes results among patients with centrally confirmed <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified rGBM treated at any dose of depatux-m in combination with TMZ pooled from the dose expansion and dose escalation cohorts (results with depatux-m monotherapy in <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified rGBM were reported separately<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>). Among this cohort of 60 patients, 9 were treated in the dose escalation cohort (out of a total of 29, the remainder of whom did not have <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified disease, as previously reported<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>) and 51 in the expansion cohort (46 of whom were enrolled under an amendment that required progressive disease [PD] &lt;3 mo after the most recent dose of TMZ). Of note, eligibility criteria for the expansion cohort were more restrictive than the escalation cohort, requiring primary “de novo” rather than secondary GBM (clinical criteria<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>) and measurable disease, and prohibiting prior bevacizumab, nitrosourea, and EGFR-directed therapy (such as rindopepimut).</p>

                <title>Pharmacokinetics</title>
                <p>To evaluate the effect of depatux-m on TMZ PK in the arm B dose escalation cohort, depatux-m infusion in cycle 1 was administered on day 2 instead of day 1. Plasma concentrations of TMZ were collected prior to TMZ dosing (0 hour) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after TMZ dose administration under fasting conditions on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2. Serum samples for determination of depatux-m and total depatux concentrations and plasma samples for determination of cys-mafodotin concentrations were collected before and at multiple timepoints after depatux-m administration in cycles 1 and 2. In the arm B expansion cohort, PK samples were collected before and/or immediately after depatux-m administration in cycles 1 and 2.</p>
                <p>Serum samples for determination of antidrug antibody (ADA) were collected once every 2 weeks before each depatux-m infusion up to day 1 of cycle 3, and once every 4 weeks before depatux-m infusion in subsequent cycles. When possible, ADA samples were collected approximately 35 days after the last depatux-m infusion. At each timepoint that ADA was determined, PK samples for depatux-m, total depatux, and cys-mafodotin were collected.</p>
                <p>Depatux-m serum concentrations and ADA titers were determined using validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Cys-mafodotin and TMZ plasma concentrations were determined by validated liquid chromatography methods with tandem mass spectrometric detection. PK parameters, including peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), and clearance (CL, if applicable) were determined using noncompartmental methods.</p>

                <p>We determined the objective response rate (ORR = partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) among patients with RANO-defined measurable disease at baseline (required for eligibility in the expansion cohort). We also estimated the 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS6), with PFS (defined as the time from the first dose of depatux-m to RANO-defined disease progression or date of death from any cause), OS (determined from the time of first dose of depatux-m to death due to any cause), safety, and tolerability of depatux-m. The 95% CI was constructed for the estimated ORR (determined from the exact binomial distribution), PFS, and OS. For PFS and OS, Greenwood’s formula was used to calculate confidence limits for the quartiles of survival distribution. Descriptive statistics were provided for patient demographic variables. Safety/toxicity summaries were provided for all patients who received at least one dose of depatux-m.

As discussed previously,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> the ability to determine median time to resolution of ocular side effects was severely limited by a high censoring rate, in part because follow-up beyond 35 days after last dose was not required. Based on limited data available, median time to resolution was 15.4 weeks (95% CI = 15.4, 22.6).</p>

The 90% CI of the ratios of the geometric means of dose-normalized C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of TMZ between the 2 dosing conditions were within 0.80–1.25, suggesting that depatux-m has no significant effect on TMZ PK.</p>

                <p>Low-titer positive ADA was detected in only 2 samples at baseline and 1 sample after depatux-m treatment in cycle 1 among all samples from the 60 patients. The patient who had a positive ADA sample after depatux-m treatment also showed positive ADA at baseline. For the patients able to return to the clinic for a 35-day follow-up visit (<italic>n =</italic> 14), no positive ADA was detected from any sample. The data suggest that depatux-m does not cause resistance by generating circulating antidrug antibodies.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study of <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified, mainly TMZ-refractory rGBM, no new safety events were observed from combined depatux-m and TMZ compared with other arms of the study (arm A, concurrent RT, TMZ, and depatux-m; arm C, depatux-m monotherapy). Depatux-m did not appear to significantly worsen the common side effects that would be expected from TMZ, with the possible rare exception of thrombocytopenia. Ocular side effects were the most common AEs, as seen in other depatux-m arms,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> but did not cause any patients to permanently discontinue study treatment and always improved with dose delays or reductions. Nine patients remained on treatment for more than 9 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that depatux-m treatment was tolerated for an extended time period, and ocular side effects did not preclude prolonged therapy. Of note, the frequency of ocular side effects observed here was similar to that observed in other cohorts treated at lower doses.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Reductions in tumor size were observed in 27 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>The patient with long-standing, durable response provided an opportunity for extensive longitudinal monitoring of ocular side effects and their resolution. This patient developed primarily grade 3 ocular AEs (photophobia, blurred, vision, foreign body sensation in the eye, with the exception of grade 4 keratitis) after 15 months of treatment, which recurred despite subsequent dose delays and dose reduction. Treatment was interrupted again after 23 months on study due to recurrence of grade 3 ocular side effects. Ocular side effects improved to grade 1 by month 25 on treatment but a decision was made not to rechallenge with drug at that time due to ongoing near complete response. All ocular side effects had fully resolved by month 27 of study enrollment, which was 4 months after permanent cessation of depatux-m. The patient remains without evidence of residual ocular symptoms.</p>
              <p>An ORR of 13.8% and a 45% SD rate per RANO criteria were observed with depatux-m + TMZ treatment. The ORR and PFS6 in the current analysis are comparable to those observed in the depatux-m monotherapy arm.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Of note, among 15 patients with a ≥50% decrease in tumor size of any duration (8 of whom were formal RANO-defined responses durable for at least 4 weeks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), 12 were TMZ refractory, including 5/6 with a 100% decrease in tumor size, and 2 were from the escalation cohort treated at less than 1.25 mg/kg depatux-m.</p>
              <p>As above, histology of tissue resected in 5 patients for presumed PD demonstrated necrosis, raising the possibility that the reported ORR, PFS6 rate, and median PFS were underestimated. This observation also suggests that depatux-m may contribute to pseudoprogression, and as a consequence in ongoing trials, patients with ambiguous imaging findings are permitted to remain on therapy at the discretion of the treating investigator. To further elucidate this phenomenon, a study investigating the correlation between histological and radiographic evidence of PD after treatment in patients is ongoing.</p>
              <p>Limitations of the study include its small size and overall design, which is not typical of a phase Ib study, but was intentional in order to more easily develop a new drug for treatment in a population with high unmet need. Furthermore, as the study lacked an active comparator, outcomes were difficult to interpret. In some cases, a lack of archival tumor tissue also prevented further analyses with regard to biomarker status and how that may correlate with outcome. However, we observed in this international, multicenter study that depatux-m in combination with TMZ administered in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-amplified rGBM showed encouraging efficacy and manageable side effects, supporting further trials. An open-label, phase I/II study in Japan (M13-714, INTELLANCE J, NCT02590263) of patients with newly diagnosed or rGBM is currently ongoing. The phase III INTELLANCE 1 (NCT02573324) study in newly diagnosed GBM is also ongoing.</p>
