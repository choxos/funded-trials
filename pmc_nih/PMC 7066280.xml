                <title>Summary</title>
                <p id="Par1"><italic>Background</italic> Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/IDH2) enzymes produce the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Ivosidenib (AG-120) is a targeted mutant IDH1 inhibitor under evaluation in a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of IDH1-mutant advanced solid tumors including cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and glioma. We explored the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of ivosidenib in these populations. <italic>Methods</italic> Ivosidenib was administered orally once (QD) or twice (BID) daily in continuous 28-day cycles; 168 patients received ≥1 dose within the range 100 mg BID to 1200 mg QD. PK and PD were assessed using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays. <italic>Results</italic> Ivosidenib demonstrated good oral exposure after single and multiple doses, was rapidly absorbed, and had a long terminal half-life (mean 40–102 h after single dose). Exposure increased less than dose proportionally. Steady state was reached by day 15, with moderate accumulation across all tumors (1.5- to 1.7-fold for area-under-the-curve at 500 mg QD). None of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors assessed affected ivosidenib exposure, including patient/disease characteristics and concomitant administration of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers. After multiple doses in patients with cholangiocarcinoma or chondrosarcoma, plasma 2-HG was reduced by up to 98%, to levels seen in healthy subjects. Exposure-response relationships for safety and efficacy outcomes were flat across the doses tested. <italic>Conclusions</italic> Ivosidenib demonstrated good oral exposure and a long half-life. Robust, persistent plasma 2-HG inhibition was observed in IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma. Ivosidenib 500 mg QD is an appropriate dose irrespective of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. <italic>Trial Registration</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02073994).</p>

Mutant IDH enzymes are not catalytically inactive, but rather possess a novel enzymatic activity, catalyzing the reduction of α-KG to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In normal cells, 2-HG is present at low levels. However, in cells with IDH1/IDH2 mutant enzymes, the accumulation of 2-HG alters a number of downstream cellular activities, causing epigenetic dysregulation and consequently a block in cellular differentiation, leading to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par3">Ivosidenib (AG-120) is a selective, potent inhibitor of the mutant IDH1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Preclinical studies showed that treatment with ivosidenib decreased intracellular 2-HG levels in IDH1-mutant AML cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and resulted in 2-HG inhibition in tumors in an IDH1-mutant xenograft mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These data were used to predict the exposure required for efficacy in humans. The inhibition of 2-HG production by ivosidenib translated well from preclinical models to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a phase 1 study, ivosidenib 500 mg once daily (QD) was shown to have an acceptable safety profile, and was associated with durable remissions in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, including relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and myelodysplastic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On the basis of data from that study, ivosidenib received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par4">Ivosidenib is also being investigated in an ongoing phase 1 study that enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The safety and efficacy data from this study are reported in separate publications (manuscripts in preparation).

The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of ivosidenib in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring an <italic>IDH1</italic> mutation. Secondary objectives included the characterization of ivosidenib PK and the PK/PD relationship of ivosidenib and 2-HG.</p>
                <p id="Par6">The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by the appropriate review boards at participating sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p>
                <p id="Par7">In the dose escalation portion, patients with 1) glioma and 2) non-glioma solid tumors were enrolled into sequential cohorts using a standard 3 + 3 design. Patients with glioma received 100 mg twice daily (BID), or 300, 500, 600, or 900 mg QD ivosidenib in continuous 28-day cycles. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and other solid tumors received ivosidenib 100 mg BID, or 300, 400, 500, 800, or 1200 mg QD in continuous 28-day cycles. At least 3 patients in each cohort also received a single dose 3 days prior to the start of multiple dosing (i.e., day −3).

Other key inclusion criteria for dose escalation included histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors that had recurred or progressed following standard therapy, and evaluable disease by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for patients with glioma, or by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 for patients with other solid tumors. For expansion, patients with cholangiocarcinoma had to have a stage II, III, or IV intra-hepatic, extra-hepatic, or perihilar tumor that was not amenable to curative resection, transplantation, or ablative therapies (tumors of mixed histology were not allowed), and must have progressed following a gemcitabine-based regimen; patients with chondrosarcoma had to have a tumor that was either locally advanced or metastatic and not amenable to complete surgical excision (any subtype was permitted); patients with non-enhancing glioma had to have a tumor that had progressed within 12 months or less and was solely non-enhancing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and have had no prior surgery or radiation therapy within 6 months of enrollment. Patients with other solid tumors in the expansion portion had to have a tumor that was refractory to conventional therapy or be unable to tolerate conventional therapy.</p>

These samples were optional for any further patients enrolled in these cohorts. Further blood samples were collected from all patients up to 10 h postdose on cycle 1, day 15 and cycle 2, day 1. A subset of samples was also used for evaluation of plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-OHC) and 4β-OHC:cholesterol ratios. Blood samples for assessment of 2-HG only were also collected at screening.</p>
                <p id="Par11">In the expansion portion, blood samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of ivosidenib and 2-HG were collected from all patients predose, and at 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h (±10 min) postdose on cycle 1, day 1 and cycle 2, day 1.

                <p id="Par13">Plasma ivosidenib was measured using two validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.00 ng/mL (low-range assay) or 50.0 ng/mL (high-range assay). The two methods were cross-validated and found to deliver comparable results with acceptable limits. Plasma 2-HG concentrations were measured using a qualified LC-MS/MS method with an LLOQ of 30.0 ng/mL. Concentrations of 2-HG in tumor biopsy samples were quantified using qualified LC-MS/MS methods with an LLOQ of 7.5 μg/g for brain tumor homogenate, 100 ng/g for liver tumor homogenate (low-range assay), and 30 μg/g for liver tumor homogenate (high-range assay). Plasma 4β-OHC and cholesterol were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The LLOQ was 5 ng/mL for 4β-OHC and 25 μg/mL for cholesterol in human plasma.</p>

Accumulation ratio (R<sub>acc</sub>), based on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC, was also assessed during the dose escalation portion. PD (2-HG) parameters included baseline-effect value, area under the effect concentration-time curve (AUEC<sub>0-10h</sub> for the dose escalation portion, or AUEC<sub>0-8h</sub> for the dose escalation and expansion portions), percent change from baseline in AUEC (%BAUEC<sub>0-10h</sub> for the escalation portion, or %BAUEC<sub>0-8h</sub> for the dose escalation and expansion portions), average plasma concentration (C<sub>avg</sub>), and percent inhibition for C<sub>avg</sub> (%BC<sub>avg</sub>). For the dose escalation portion, the time-matched ratios of 4β-OHC to cholesterol were calculated. Box plots of 2-HG AUEC<sub>0-8h</sub> and C<sub>avg</sub> versus three categories of ivosidenib dose level (&lt;500 mg, 500 mg and &gt; 500 mg) were plotted at each timepoint to assess trends in the dose range studied (for dose escalation and expansion combined).</p>

Dose proportionality after multiple dosing was tested using data from the QD dose regimens without the 100 mg BID dose group. To assess dose proportionality, the confidence interval (CI) for the slope was estimated, with each natural logarithm (ln)-transformed PK parameter as the dependent variable and the ln-transformed dose as the fixed effect. Analysis was performed using PK parameter estimates at day −3, cycle 1, day 15, and cycle 2, day 1.

Continuous factors assessed included age, body weight, body mass index, baseline creatinine clearance (CL<sub>cr</sub>), baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and markers of hepatic function (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], bilirubin, total protein, and albumin). CL<sub>cr</sub> was calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault equation and eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease – National Kidney Disease Education Program equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Categorical factors assessed included sex, ethnicity, race, disease status, concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitor and inducer status, baseline hepatic and renal function category, and tumor type. Renal function was categorized as normal (CL<sub>cr</sub> ≥ 90 mL/min or eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), mild impairment (CL<sub>cr</sub> ≥ 60–89 mL/min or eGFR ≥60–89 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), moderate impairment (CL<sub>cr</sub> ≥ 30–59 mL/min or eGFR ≥30–59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), and severe impairment (CL<sub>cr</sub> ≥ 15–29 mL/min or eGFR ≥15–29 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).

Selected adverse events were identified based on safety signals observed within the ivosidenib clinical development program: grade ≥ 3 adverse events, serious adverse events, grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal events (i.e., nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), hepatic enzyme elevations (i.e., newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities of all grades, and grade ≥ 2 elevations in ALT, AST, or bilirubin), grade ≥ 2 decreases in lymphocytes, and grade ≥ 3 increases in ALP. The efficacy endpoint of interest was best response. The exposure-response analyses used modeled nominal steady-state C<sub>max</sub> (C<sub>max,ss</sub>) or AUC (AUC<sub>ss</sub>) as predictors for safety and efficacy variables in the two subgroups of tumor types described earlier. The association between ivosidenib exposure and the selected endpoints was demonstrated by 1) exposure versus adverse event or clinical best response, with vertical boxplots showing exposure distributions, and 2) adverse event probability versus exposure plots showing the event probability for exposure quartiles and logistic regression fit based on the individual data.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par35">Ivosidenib demonstrated rapid oral absorption and was eliminated slowly, with a long half-life. Ivosidenib exposure increased with increasing dose; however, the increases were less than dose-proportional after both single and multiple doses. After multiple doses (cycle 2, day 1), AUC<sub>0-tau</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> increased approximately 6-fold and 4-fold, respectively, for a 12-fold increase in dose (100 mg BID to 1200 mg QD across all tumor types). A doubling of dose translates approximately to a 40% increase in ivosidenib exposure for patients with glioma and a 70% increase for patients with non-glioma solid tumors, across the dose range tested. The solubility, permeability, and dissolution characteristics of ivosidenib have been characterized according to the FDA Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) guidance. Ivosidenib is considered to be a BCS Class II compound (i.e., low solubility, high permeability) (Agios data on file), and hence solubility-limited absorption may contribute to the non-proportionality observed after single and multiple dosing.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The estimated PK parameters for ivosidenib in patients with solid tumors (i.e., cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, or glioma) exhibited time-dependency. Based on the mean t<sub>1/2</sub> of 56 h and 64 h after a single dose of 500 mg in patients with glioma and cholangiocarcinoma/chondrosarcoma, respectively, the anticipated accumulation ratio would be approximately 4-fold after multiple dosing with 500 mg QD, whereas the observed accumulation ratios at cycle 2, day 1 were 1.5 and 1.7, respectively, suggesting an approximate 2.5-fold increase in CL/F after multiple dosing. Ivosidenib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and induces CYP3A enzyme activity as suggested by increases in 4β-OHC:cholesterol ratios. On the basis of these data, it is plausible that autoinduction of ivosidenib metabolism may play a role in the observed increase in apparent clearance. However, the magnitude of autoinduction appears to be moderate, and approximately 1.5-fold accumulation was observed at steady state on day 15.</p>
              <p id="Par37">At the 500 mg QD dose level, AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> in patients with glioma (enhancing and non-enhancing) were lower than in patients with cholangiocarcinoma/chondrosarcoma. A comparison at the recommended clinical dose of 500 mg QD indicates that the AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> at steady state of ivosidenib are approximately 33% and 29% lower, respectively, in patients with glioma as compared with patients with cholangiocarcinoma/chondrosarcoma. Interindividual variability appears to be lower in patients with glioma than in patients with cholangiocarcinoma/chondrosarcoma. The lower exposure in glioma patients may reflect baseline patient-specific factors or disease characteristics in this population, such as lower age, less frequent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, more frequent use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine and phenytoin), and adequate renal/hepatic function, as compared with patients with cholangiocarcinoma/chondrosarcoma.</p>
              <p id="Par38">The determination of the clinical dose of ivosidenib for the expansion portion of the study was based on PD (2-HG inhibition), PK, safety, and efficacy data from the dose escalation portion. Data from the combined dose escalation and expansion portions confirmed that the dose regimen of 500 mg QD ivosidenib appears appropriate for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with an IDH1 mutation.</p>
              <p id="Par39">In patients with cholangiocarcinoma/chondrosarcoma, after multiple doses of ivosidenib, plasma 2-HG levels were substantially reduced (by up to 98%), to concentrations similar to those seen in healthy subjects, at all dose levels tested. No additional 2-HG inhibition was observed at doses &gt;500 mg QD compared with 500 mg QD, while doses &lt;500 mg QD appeared to be associated with lower levels of inhibition (although the sample size precluded statistical comparison). Continuous treatment with 500 mg QD was shown to provide persistent 2-HG inhibition, with no decrease in 2-HG inhibition over the whole treatment period. Unlike other solid tumor indications, plasma 2-HG does not appear to be a robust PD marker in the glioma population, which may be due to the anatomical location of the tumor. A perioperative study in patients with non-enhancing, IDH1-mutated, low-grade gliomas is being conducted to determine the concentration of ivosidenib and 2-HG in tumors following presurgical treatment with ivosidenib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT03343197). This study is ongoing and aims to confirm the optimal dose of ivosidenib in future glioma studies.</p>
              <p id="Par40">None of the intrinsic patient factors assessed, including renal and hepatic function, had an effect on ivosidenib exposure. Concomitant administration of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors or weak CYP3A4 inducers did not appear to affect the plasma clearance of ivosidenib. These results suggest that dose adjustment based on intrinsic patient factors or concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers is not required.</p>
              <p id="Par41">The PK/PD analyses reported here indicate that ivosidenib has flat exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships within the dose range tested. There was no observed effect of exposure on the incidence of any of the adverse events or safety endpoints assessed, and the exposure distribution was similar across all clinical response categories.</p>
              <p id="Par42">As reported elsewhere, ivosidenib has demonstrated encouraging preliminary clinical activity at a dose of 500 mg QD among the cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and non-enhancing glioma populations and is generally well tolerated, with an acceptable toxicity profile and few dose reductions or discontinuations owing to adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The data reported here demonstrate that ivosidenib has a favorable PK profile in patients with IDH1-mutated solid tumors, with robust suppression of plasma 2-HG in patients with cholangiocarcinoma or chondrosarcoma. The exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety results, combined with the consistency of the clinical benefit observed, suggest that ivosidenib 500 mg QD is an appropriate dose for the treatment of patients with IDH1-mutant advanced solid tumors.</p>
