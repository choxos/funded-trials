                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Research is needed to investigate preventive strategies to reduce mental health burden and assess effective implementation among immigrants. Problem management plus (PMP) is a low-intensity multicomponent psychological intervention developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) that trained laypeople can deliver. PMP has been adapted as a prevention intervention and developed as PMP for immigrants (PMP-I), including psychoeducation, problem-solving, behavioural activations and mindâbody exercise, to address immigrantsâ multiple stressors. This pilot trial aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PMP-I and provide a preliminary estimate of the difference between PMP-I versus community support services pamphlets on the primary outcomes of interest (stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms) to inform the design of a large-scale intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The feasibility and acceptability of PMP-I will be assessed by measuring recruitment, session attendance, retention rates, programme acceptability and the fidelity of intervention delivery. This pilot trial will test preliminary effects of PMP-I vs community support services pamphlets in a randomised controlled trial (N=232 participants from 116 families (2 members/family); 58 families randomised to condition intervention or control) on stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes), chronic physiological stress assessed in hair cortisol (secondary outcomes), and coping, family conflict resolution, and social networking (targets), with assessment at baseline, postintervention and 3-month postintervention. Eligibility criteria for the primary study participants include Bhutanese â¥18 years resettled in Massachusetts with a score of â¤14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. All family members will be invited to participate in the family-based intervention (one session/week for 5âweeks). Multilevel modelling will compare the longitudinal change in outcomes for each treatment arm.</p>

                  <p>Whereas existing mental health interventions for immigrants are primarily based on treatment models to improve the access and quality of care for those with diagnosed mental health problems, this study is focused on developing, implementing, and pilot testing the effect of a culturally tailored preventative behavioural intervention to reduce stress and prevent mental health problems among immigrants.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>This study includes culturally tailored psychoeducation, behavioural activation, problem-solving and mindâbody interventions that could help to address multiple psychosociocultural stressors through revitalising resources at the individual, family and community levels.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>The proposed intervention will be delivered to participants in their family environment by interventionists from the same community they trust and understand their language and problems from their cultural lens.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>This study will be among the first to link a preventive intervention with both biomarkers of stress (hair cortisol) and perceived stress and, using longitudinal data, to examine change over time in stress.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>Though clinical diagnosis is the gold standard, such an approach is not feasible in community-based studies, so this study relies on self-report measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>

              <p>Refugees resettled in USA are vulnerable to mental health problems,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> such as anxiety and depression due to stress resulting from integrating into a new culture.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â5</xref> Refugeesâ risk for mental health problems increases during their acculturative process due to exposure to multiple stressors, such as adjustment to a new culture with limited language and sociocultural skills, perceived discrimination, and a lack of culturally mediated and protective social support resources.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Although mental health treatments are available to help alleviate the intrapersonal, social, and economic costs of mental disorders, refugees greatly underuse these services.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7 8</xref> Thus, evidence-based, culturally tailored preventative mental health interventions are needed for the growing number of refugees in USA.</p>
              <p>Existing interventions are focused explicitly on treatment models to provide quality care for those with diagnosed mental health problems<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> that do little to help reduce stress and prevent mental disorders for those who have not yet developed diagnosable symptoms. For prevention, a culturally tailored intervention that addresses multiple psycho-socio-cultural stressors, including social and cultural integration, holds good promise.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Community-based preventative interventions that promote positive impacts of social and cultural behaviours on mental health outcomes by protective resources are needed for the growing number of refugees dealing with life complexities.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> A review of community-based mental health interventions in refugees resettled to USA suggests<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> that counselling, health promotion and skill-building workshops facilitated by refugee peers<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15â17</xref> are helpful to reduce the psychological distress of many refugees who may be struggling with individual or family difficulties. Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using a non-clinical, community support approach to prevent mental illness among refugees resettled in USA.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
              <p>Problem management plus (PMP) is a low-intensity evidence-based psychological intervention developed by the WHO that trained laypeople can deliver.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> PMP systematically teaches four strategies: stress management through mindâbody exercises,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21â24</xref> problem-solving,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> behavioural activations<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26â33</xref> and skills to strengthen social support for individuals with psychological distress. PMP has been proven successful in reducing depression for women with mental disorders in Pakistan in a group setting.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We have adapted PMP to develop our PMP for immigrants (PMP-I) following a successful result of a pilot social and emotional well-being intervention. The pilot intervention included psychoeducation, mindâbody exercise, problem-solving and social support and reduced more than 50% prevalence of anxiety and depression from preintervention to postintervention among Bhutanese refugees when delivered in either a group<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> or a family setting.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> While promising, these pilot results were drawn from only those receiving the treatment; no control group was available for comparison. Thus, this study is to apply the adapted PMP in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This study is indicated for several reasons: our intervention model demands integration of social and emotional stressors; promising results of PMP in a non-controlled pilot study; the need to test the efficacy of PMP using the more rigorous RCT study design; strong evidence of family and community ties in healthcare process; and growing consensus among community, scientists and policy-makers on the need for family-based care models that are sustainable.</p>

Our central hypothesis is that PMP-I will reduce stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms. We will test preliminary effects of PMP-I versus community support services pamphlets in a randomised pilot trial (N=232 participants from 116 families (2 members per family); 58 families per intervention and control) on perceived stress,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> anxiety and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> chronic physiological stress assessed in hair cortisol (secondary outcome) and self-efficacy,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> coping,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> family conflict resolution,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> family satisfaction,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> social support<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and social networks (targets)<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> with assessments at baseline, postintervention and 3-month postintervention.</p>

                <p>This study will be conducted among resettled Bhutanese adults living in Massachusetts. Since 2008, Bhutanese people have been resettled in various states of the USA and are one of the largest groups of South Asian refugees (about 90 000).<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> They bear a high burden of mental health problems both in the nation (depression: 20%; suicide rate: 21.5 per 100 000)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and in western Massachusetts (depression: 24.0%; anxiety: 34.2%).<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Given the importance of family relationships, communication, and coping in mental health,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> the preventative social and emotional well-being intervention was designed for resettled Bhutanese adults in western Massachusetts using a community-based participatory research approach.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>

At baseline, we will use a screening tool to identify individuals without significant depressive symptoms, as we aim to evaluate the effect of our intervention to prevent depression rather than treat depression. Eligibility criteria for our primary study participants include Bhutanese adults 18 years or older (both parents and children of each family) resettled in Massachusetts with a score of 14 or below on the PHQ-9, a screening questionnaire for depression. Our statistical analysis will focus on data from primary study participants only with baseline PHQ-9 scores 14 or below. However, all other interested adult family members, both parents and their adult children, regardless of PHQ-9 score, will be invited to participate in the intervention. The PHQ-9 scores of participants will not be disclosed to anyone to maintain individual confidentiality. Besides, individuals with PHQ-9 screening scores â15â19â (moderately severe depression) and â20â27â (severe depression) will be provided with feedback on their screening questionnaire outcomes confidentially. They will be encouraged to consult their primary healthcare providers.</p>

                <p>The goal of the pilot project is to estimate the magnitude of the difference between the preventive intervention and the education control on the primary outcomes of interest to inform the design of a large-scale intervention. We conducted a power analysis to detect an effect size (ES) as small as ES=0.30 with alpha=0.05âand power of 0.80. We may find a larger effect in our pilot, but our understanding is that power estimates should be based on the smallest effect we want to detect rather than the size of the effect that we expect.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Analyses were performed using Optimal Design<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> by accounting for the intra-correlation among family members of 0.10 and alpha=0.05, we would have 80% power to detect a standardised difference of ES=0.30 between two treatment groups of 116 families (58 per treatment arm) with an equal probability of being randomised to each of our two intervention arms.</p>

                <p>We will randomly allocate selected families into intervention and control groups using a random sampling method after the baseline survey. RAs are unaware of which group the family will be randomised to when collecting baseline data. We will randomly assign 116 interested families (58 families per intervention and control) using a random number table. For random allocation, first, the PI will prepare the sampling frame that lists interested families, then assign a number to each family in the sampling frame, and finally select 116 numbers using a table of random numbers. We will assign a random number selected at the first attempt for intervention and the second attempt for control.</p>
                <p>Procedures are in place for tracking the participants for intervention and follow-up (eg, contact address and phone). RAs will visit selected families and brief them about study procedures, informed consent, and procedures to protect human subjects. Two adult members of the selected families who meet the inclusion criteria and give informed consent will be recruited for the study. We will follow up with all families randomised to either study arm. We will not follow up with participants if they decide to end their participation at a particular time point of our study. But, we will include their already collected data in our analysis. Given our strong community networks and mobilisation of community RAs, we anticipate low attrition rates in practice.</p>

                <p>PMP-I is a 5âweek, peer-led, culturally tailored mental health promotion programme that includes psychoeducation, problem-solving, behavioural activation (90âmin), breathing exercises, and yoga (90âmin) in a family setting. PMP-I will use a structured approach, including once-a-week face-to-face sessions, yoga practice, breathing exercises, homework that includes practice activities, rebuilding individual skills, or learning new skills to reduce stress.</p>
                <p>Our intervention aims to develop skills in coping adaptively in a new culture, seeking help and support for mental health problems, and other life skills opportunities that can improve their quality of life. Module 1: Managing stress includes yoga, breathing exercise, stress-management sessions, and practice exercises to develop coping strategies that are most helpful to reduce stress and then plan a strategy to carry out those solutions. Module 2: Managing problems includes practice exercises to identify the problems causing the most concern, develop solutions that are most helpful in addressing the problem, and then plan a strategy to carry out those solutions. Module 3: Behavioural Activation includes communication skill sessions and practice exercises to identify pleasant activities (time to yourself; connecting with others; self-care), breaking down the task into smaller steps and schedule tasks, and then plan a strategy to carry out those tasks. Module 4: Strengthening social support includes social skills sessions and practice exercises to identify at least one person or service from whom the participant feels comfortable getting some support, and to plan exactly what the participant is going to do, and then schedule a day to carry out the tasks. Module 5: Staying well includes practice exercises to make a plan that helps to create a supportive family environment.</p>
                <p>Community interventionists (CIs) are trained community members with at least a high school level of education, and no formal training or prior experience with mental health will deliver the PMP-I. Dr. Christopher Martell, board-certified in behavioural and cognitive psychology and clinical psychology and a Massachusetts Licensed Psychologist, will provide 12 days of training to the interventionists in collaboration with the PI and Dr. Steven D. Hollon (Professor of Psychiatry, Psychology and Human Development) following the WHO PMP Helpersâ Training Guide<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> adapted for PMP-I. Classroom training includes information about stress, depression, mental health problems, the rationale for each intervention strategy, necessary helping skills, practice plan formulation, role-plays, peer observations, and group discussion related to core intervention concepts, practices and supervision skills. Supervision involves discussing participantsâ progress and difficulties experienced when delivering strategies and role-playing on managing problems or practising skills. They will use the PMP-I intervention manual to provide PMP-I to community members in family settings under field supervisors and PIâs supervision. We will conduct a formal evaluation of the interventionists' readiness to implement/supervise the PMP-I intervention, such as using the manual, answering questions, managing time, using a fidelity checklist, practising exercise and role play to provide feedback as necessary.</p>
                <p>A licensed yoga trainer will provide 4âhours of breathing exercises and 16 hours of yoga to CIs and field supervisors using a mindâbody exercise training manual. Classroom training includes theoretical and practices to guide participants in mindâbody exercises for attention to breath, body sensation, emotional awareness, and mental function on different postures of yoga practices such as Pranayama (3 poses) and Asana (21 poses). Training will include practice assessment at the end to ensure that all field staff is trained, using a checklist, practice exercise and role-plays.</p>

Using these standard tools, we will evaluate session-by-session classroom and in-field based competencies of CIs and field supervisors and provide them feedback as needed using supervision forms, role-plays, group discussion and training.</p>
                <p>At the field level, field supervisors will monitor intervention sessions delivered by CIs using standard checklists. Items include adherence to the manual, per cent of intervention content administered, proper use of time/materials and adequate response to participantsâ questions. They will also monitor participantsâ engagement, acceptability and satisfaction via brief questionnaires with participants and interventionists during and after intervention completion. Moreover, CIs will be asked to complete a structured checklist on the attendance, compliance and satisfaction towards intervention components immediately after each session.</p>
                <p>The PI will conduct an FGD in the Nepali language with interventionists, supervisors, and participants separately to collect information on barriers and facilitators of intervention, perceptions about whether the intervention met participants' needs, and feedback on how effectively the programme team worked with participants. Interviews and FGD will be documented verbatim in a written transcript for subsequent analysis. All qualitative data will be analysed using thematic content analysis.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Feedback provided by the field staff will be reviewed and coded to identify recurrent themes regarding the interventionâs acceptability. Fidelity data will be used to assess intervention content and transmission.</p>

                <p>We expect approximately 2â4 members for each of the 58 families in each treatment arm, and the correlation among family membersâ responses will be accounted for in the model. Hierarchical or multilevel modelling is suited to these data as it accounts for the clustering of members within families and unbalanced designs (ie, different family sizes).<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> This will be an intention-to-treat type of analysis, as multilevel modelling allows retention of all participants irrespective of the number of sessions attended (multilevel modelling uses maximum likelihood estimation, one of the recommended ways of handling missing data). The analysis will estimate endpoint outcomes based on repeated measures (level 1) within individuals (level 2) within families (level 3). Separate models will be created to evaluate the relationships between mediators (targets) and outcomes and explore mediators (eg, coping) of intervention-outcome relation.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study reports an RCT protocol that tests PMP-Iâs feasibility, acceptability and preliminary outcomes with trained community facilitators. This study is built on prior research that has shown the effectiveness of social and emotional well-being intervention, including psychoeducation, problem-solving, social support and mindâbody exercises, to reduce stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bhutanese adults resettled in MA at a group<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and family settings<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> using a pre-test and post-test intervention design. Our project designed for Bhutanese immigrants includes evidence-based interventions of specific relevance to this community, such as psychoeducation,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> problem-solving,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> behavioural activations,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26â33</xref> mindâbody exercises,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21â24</xref> and strengthening social support to address identified social (eg, social isolation, language difficulties) and emotional (eg, lack of self-esteem or self-efficacy)<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> stressors by strengthening protective factors (eg, resilience or coping).<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 58</xref> This study is innovative as it will be the first culturally tailored, preventive, family-based, multicomponent behavioural intervention driven by the community to reduce stress. We will have pilot-tested a preventative mental health intervention for Bhutanese adults on completion. This study can be expected to impact reducing stress and promoting immigrantsâ mental well-being.</p>
              <p>Our project is likely to be replicated with other immigrant communities with minimal adaptation over the long term for three reasons. First, our intervention is guided by a strengths-based approach in which we plan to include community strengths. This principle can be applied to capture and integrate the strengths of any community. Second, our programme prioritises the training of community members as interventionists, as these are individuals whom the community trusts, who share the same cultural lens as the community and thus can well understand language and specific challenges, and who have a vested interest in the strength and resilience of their community. This aspect of our intervention design is easily adaptable to other populations. Finally, intervention is designed to be delivered in family settings where participants are most comfortable and family members can support each other throughout their lives. This component is crucial in collectivistic societies where family bonds and group identity are strong. Thus, our family-based strategies could be replicable in other immigrant groups, where there are similarities in social and emotional stressors, challenges, community strengths (coping, resilience, social support), strong family support, and cultural preference of native community counsellors for their mental health consultation. Our strength-based and peer-led strategies promote community engagement and make the intervention sustainable.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59â61</xref>
</p>
              <p>Although our study design has several strengths, it also has some methodological limitations. We measured anxiety and depressive symptoms using the HSCL-25 scale, which was validated with clinical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-4 (DSM-IV) diagnoses of major depressive disorder<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> among refugees in Nepal<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> and other countries.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Although clinical diagnosis is the gold standard; such an approach is not feasible in community-based studies. We have started implementing an intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic, so we may need to be flexible in the time frame for conducting surveys and implementing intervention sessions while waiting for participants to recover from COVID-19 infections they might have contracted during the study period.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our trial will provide information on the feasibility of PMP-I among the immigrant population and ES estimate to design a larger-scale RCT intervention study.</p>
