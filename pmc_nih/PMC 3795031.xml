                <p>The study of HIV-infected “controllers” who are able to maintain low levels of plasma HIV RNA in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may provide insights for HIV cure and vaccine strategies. Despite maintaining very low levels of plasma viremia, controllers have elevated immune activation and accelerated atherosclerosis. However, the degree to which low-level replication contributes to these phenomena is not known. Sixteen asymptomatic controllers were prospectively treated with ART for 24 weeks. Controllers had a statistically significant decrease in ultrasensitive plasma and rectal HIV RNA levels with ART. Markers of T cell activation/dysfunction in blood and gut mucosa also decreased substantially with ART. Similar reductions were observed in the subset of “elite” controllers with pre-ART plasma HIV RNA levels below conventional assays (&lt;40 copies/mL). These data confirm that HIV replication persists in controllers and contributes to a chronic inflammatory state. ART should be considered for these individuals (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01025427).</p>

                <p>HIV-infected “controllers” are rare individuals who are HIV-seropositive but are able to maintain low levels of plasma HIV RNA in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). There has been intense interest in characterizing these unique individuals because they have been considered as a potential model for a “functional cure” of HIV. Previously, our group has shown that controllers have elevated levels of T cell activation and accelerated atherosclerosis, suggesting that very low levels of viral replication may lead to disproportionately high levels of immune activation. However, the degree to which viral replication contributes to these outcomes is not known. We therefore conducted the first, prospective study of ART initiation in a cohort of asymptomatic HIV-infected controllers, in order to determine the virologic and immunologic effects of treating controllers with ART. Controllers had a significant decreases in ultrasensitive plasma HIV RNA, rectal HIV RNA, and markers of T cell activation/dysfunction in blood and gut mucosa with ART. Similar reductions were observed in the subset of “elite” controllers with extremely low pre-ART plasma HIV RNA levels (&lt;40 copies/mL). These data suggest that HIV replication persists in controllers and contributes to a chronic inflammatory state.</p>

              <p>HIV-infected “controllers” are individuals who are HIV-seropositive but are able to maintain low levels of plasma HIV RNA in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Deeks1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These individuals are rare, comprising less than 1–7% of the HIV-infected population, depending upon the plasma HIV RNA criteria that are used to define the group <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hubert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Madec1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Lambotte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Most controllers have evidence of strong host immune responses, which have been widely assumed to be responsible for durable viral control. Because knowledge regarding these protective immune responses might lead to novel interventions aimed at preventing or curing HIV infection, there has been intense interest in further characterizing these unique individuals.</p>
              <p>Multiple groups have examined how HIV is controlled by these individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Betts1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-SaezCirion1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Lichterfeld1" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hersperger1" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1003691-Tomescu1" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. More recently, our group has focused on defining the potential clinical consequences of long-term, host-mediated, virologic control. We and others have shown that: (1) the vast majority of controllers have stable low-level viremia <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hatano1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Pereyra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; (2) controllers have elevated levels of microbial translocation and T cell activation compared to HIV-negative and ART-suppressed individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hunt2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; (3) a minority (7–10%) of controllers with high levels of T cell activation progress immunologically to AIDS despite preservation of virologic control <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; and (4) controllers have accelerated measures of atherosclerosis compared to HIV-negative individuals, even after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hsue1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Pereyra2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Collectively, these data suggest that very low levels of viral replication may lead to disproportionately high levels of immune activation in HIV-infected controllers, which may lead to an increased risk of AIDS- and non-AIDS defining events. However, the degree to which viral replication contributes to these outcomes is not known. No prospective ART studies have been performed in controllers, because it has generally been assumed that most controllers do not need ART due to their ability to control plasma viremia to very low levels.</p>
              <p>We therefore conducted the first, prospective study of antiretroviral therapy in a cohort of asymptomatic HIV-infected controllers, in order to determine the virologic and immunologic effects of treating controllers with ART. We also measured changes in biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation. Multiple biomarkers (e.g., high sensitivity C-reactive protein and D-dimer) remain elevated in both untreated and treated non-controllers <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Neuhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and have been shown to be strongly predictive of morbidity and all-cause mortality in ART-treated non-controllers <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Kuller1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Boulware1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Duprez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We therefore examined whether ART initiation led to a reduction in biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation in controllers, in order to assess whether low-level viral replication has any potential immunologic and clinical consequences in these individuals.</p>

                <title>Study Participants</title>
                <p>Sixteen asymptomatic controllers were prospectively treated with open-label raltegravir+tenofovir/emtricitabine for 24 weeks. Controllers were defined by the following inclusion criteria: (1) HIV-seropositive; (2) ART untreated; and (3) plasma HIV RNA &lt;1,000 copies/mL for ≥12 months. Exclusion criteria included: (1) known rheumatologic conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), because of the potential for biologic false-positive testing on HIV antibody tests; (2) known kidney disease; (3) known bone disease, including pathologic fractures; (4) chronic hepatitis B infection, because of the potential risk of liver abnormalities after starting and stopping tenofovir/emtricitabine in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection; (5) serious illness requiring hospitalization or parental antibiotics within the preceding 3 months; and (6) pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>
                <p>Subjects were seen every four weeks. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and detailed interviews were conducted at the majority of visits. Thirteen out of 16 subjects consented to undergo 3 serial colorectal biopsies at weeks −2, 6, and 22. Five out of 16 subjects also underwent leukapheresis at weeks −4 and week 21 in order to obtain large PBMC samples for measurement of integrated HIV DNA. Adherence to study drug was measured at every study visit by self-report and pill-count. An independent Data Monitoring Committee comprised of three individuals from the scientific community met at 12, 24, 48, and 60 weeks after the enrollment of the first subject, and at 60 weeks after the enrollment of the last subject.</p>

                <p>Antiretroviral therapy was well tolerated and all subjects completed 24 weeks of ART. No significant adverse events occurred during the study. The majority of controllers (11/16) elected to continue ART after the 24-week study period. Five out of 16 subjects elected to discontinue ART after the 24-week study period at various times (median 10.0 weeks, interquartile range [IQR] 1.0 to 19.0 weeks) after the end of the treatment study. They have subsequently been followed for a median 63.0 (IQR 47.4 to 66.3) weeks after discontinuing ART, and at the time of last follow-up the plasma HIV RNA level using a standard assay (Abbott Real Time assay, lower limit of detection &lt;40 copy/mL) was a median &lt;40 (IQR&lt;40 to 73) copies/mL. Of the 5 subjects who elected to discontinue ART after the end of the treatment study, 4/5 of the subjects had an “undetectable” pre-ART plasma HIV RNA level at baseline using a standard assay (Abbott Real Time assay, lower limit of detection &lt;40 copy/mL).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this first prospective study of antiretroviral therapy initiation in asymptomatic HIV-infected controllers, 24 weeks of ART was safe and well-tolerated. Despite being able to maintain very low plasma HIV RNA levels in the absence of ART, controllers had readily measurable levels of HIV RNA and DNA in the gut. Antiretroviral therapy led to statistically significant decreases in ultrasensitive plasma HIV RNA levels, HIV antibody levels, rectal cell-associated HIV RNA, and immune activation in the blood and gut. Collectively, these data suggest that HIV in most controllers is replication-competent <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Blankson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Lamine1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Mens1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and that host rather than virologic factors account for the remarkable degree of viral control in these unique individuals. We also observed a statistically significant decrease in levels of integrated HIV DNA with ART, while total HIV DNA levels remained stable. These findings may be due to an excess of unintegrated HIV DNA in controllers, as previously reported by our group <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Graf1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
              <p>We observed that measures of immune activation/dysfunction decreased as measures of virologic burden and HIV antigenic stimulation decreased with ART. We also observed a trend towards a decrease in hsCRP (a measure of systemic inflammation) with ART; similar trends were observed with IL-6, sCD14, and D-dimer. These biomarkers have been shown to be strong, consistent, and independent predictors of increased morbidity and mortality in HIV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Boulware1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Duprez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Morse1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Because the confidence intervals were wide, however, we cannot assess with certainty whether the observed decrease in hsCRP levels has any clinical relevance; it would be important to pursue these findings in future, larger studies. Taken together, however, these data suggest that there may be immunologic consequences to even very low levels of viral replication. This latter finding may have important implications for HIV-infected non-controllers as well <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Buzon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Yukl2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Llibre1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Massanella1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hatano2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Importantly, our study also shifts the field's working definition of a “functional cure.” On one hand, our data suggest that a complete block of viral replication is not necessary to achieve long-term virologic control. However, natural long-term virologic control appears to be coming at an immunologic and/or clinical “cost,” at least as defined by increased levels and manifestations of immune activation. Thus, although further study of controllers is warranted, untreated HIV-infected controllers may not represent the best model of a functional cure, if we believe that a cure should require a disease-free (and not just treatment-free) state.</p>
              <p>Several limitations of our study deserve comment. First, this was a small pilot study and our findings should be replicated in a larger study of HIV-infected controllers with a longer duration of follow-up. In our study of controllers who had relatively high baseline CD4+ T cell counts, 24 weeks of ART did not appear to confer a CD4+ T cell count benefit. In studies of HIV-infected non-controllers, a greater absolute decrease in plasma HIV RNA levels during the early period after ART initiation has been shown to be a consistent predictor of an early increase in CD4+ T cell counts (with much of the increase assumed to be due to redistribution) <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Autran1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In our study, although we did observe a significant decrease in ultrasensitive plasma HIV RNA levels with initiation of ART, the absolute change was small compared to that observed in HIV-infected non-controllers; this may have partially accounted for the limited changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell counts. It is possible that with a much longer duration of follow-up, an increase in CD4+ T cell count may have been observed. Second, there was a trend towards a decrease in the percentage of Gag-specific IFNγ+IL2+ CD8+ T cell responses in PBMCs, although a similar trend was not observed in the rectum. This observation raises the possibility that initiation of ART in controllers may reduce host mechanisms of virologic control, leading to rebound in viremia if ART is discontinued. However, in the 5 subjects who elected to discontinue ART after the 24-week study period, there was no evidence of rebound in plasma viremia after discontinuation of ART. Nevertheless, the long-term safety of ART in controllers should be confirmed. Third, we enrolled a relatively heterogeneous group of controllers. As we and others have shown, however, controllers are a heterogeneous group with varying levels of steady-state viremia; there appears to be a continuum of viremia across controllers <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Deeks1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hatano1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, . In order to determine whether there is a differential effect of ART on a spectrum of controllers, we enrolled individuals whose baseline plasma HIV RNA levels spanned from nearly 0 to 1000 copies RNA/mL for at least 12 months (median duration of HIV diagnosis 10 years, IQR 4.5 to 24 years). Thus, our study included controllers who had both low-level but detectable and undetectable pre-ART plasma HIV RNA levels using conventional assays. Remarkably, however, even amongst the latter group of “elite” controllers who had undetectable pre-ART plasma HIV RNA levels at baseline, we observed a statistically significant decrease in ultrasensitive plasma HIV RNA levels and HIV antibody levels, and a trend towards a decrease in immune activation with ART. Fourth, although 24 weeks of ART significantly decreased levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, it did not normalize them to levels observed in HIV-uninfected individuals <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hunt4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, at least in HIV-infected controllers, low-level viral replication is unlikely to be the only factor contributing to immunologic disease. The potential role of other factors that might contribute to immune activation—including co-infections and substance abuse—could not be addressed in this pilot study, but might be addressed in future studies with larger cohorts. It would also be important to systematically assess the individual and potentially synergistic contributions of ART and lifestyle modifications towards decreasing inflammation, immune activation, and clinical disease in HIV-infected controllers <xref rid="ppat.1003691-Hsue1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Finally, it is worth noting that there may be multiple pathways to virologic control, some of which may represent an appropriate model of a “functional cure” and may not receive an additional benefit from ART.</p>
              <p>In summary, 24 weeks of ART was safe and well-tolerated in chronically HIV-infected controllers. Antiretroviral therapy in controllers led to significant decreases in ultrasensitive plasma and rectal HIV RNA, HIV antibody levels, and markers of immune activation/dysfunction in blood and gut, confirming that HIV replication persists in controllers and contributes to a chronic inflammatory state. We acknowledge that this was a small pilot study and that our findings would be ideally replicated in a larger, randomized, clinical-endpoint study. However, the relative rarity of HIV-infected controllers may make such a study impractical, if not impossible. In the absence of such a study, clinicians will need to weigh the potential benefits of ART (suggested by the changes in immune activation and biomarkers observed in our study) with the potential risks and costs associated with long-term antiretroviral therapy.</p>
