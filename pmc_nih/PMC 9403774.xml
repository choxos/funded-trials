                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>What are surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists’ perspectives on the omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in women 70 years and older with early-stage hormone receptor–positive breast cancer?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi220807-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews of 29 surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists, the decision to omit SLNB involved nuanced patient- and disease-level factors. Wide variation was observed in oncologists’ perspectives on SLNB omission recommendations and supporting data, and participants’ statements suggest that the multidisciplinary nature of cancer care may increase oncologists’ anxiety regarding omission of SLNB.</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi220807-3">
                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>This study’s findings suggest that interventions aimed at educating physicians, facilitating preoperative multidisciplinary conversations, and improving patient-physician communication may help to appropriately decrease SLNB rates.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Randomized clinical trial data have demonstrated that omission of surgical axillary evaluation does not affect overall survival in women 70 years and older with early-stage (clinical tumor category 1 [cT1] with node-negative [N0] disease) hormone receptor (HR)–positive and erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (<italic>ERBB2</italic>; formerly <italic>HER2</italic>)–negative breast cancer. Therefore, the Choosing Wisely initiative has recommended against routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in this population; however, retrospective data have revealed that more than 80% of patients eligible for SLNB omission still undergo the procedure. Multidisciplinary factors involved in these patterns remain unclear.</p>

                  <p>This qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to explore the factors involved in oncologists’ perspectives on providing care to older women who were eligible for SLNB omission. Purposive snowball sampling was used to recruit a sample of surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists representing a wide range of practice types and number of years in practice in the US and Canada. A total of 29 oncologists who finished training and were actively treating patients with breast cancer were interviewed. Interviews were conducted between March 1, 2020, and January 17, 2021.</p>

                  <p>Among 29 physicians (16 women [55.2%] and 13 men [44.8%]) who participated in interviews, 16 were surgical oncologists, 6 were medical oncologists, and 7 were radiation oncologists. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. Participants had a range of experience (median [range] years in practice, 12.0 [0.5-30.0]) and practice types (14 academic [48.3%], 7 community [24.1%], and 8 hybrid [27.6%]). Interviews revealed that the decision to omit SLNB was based on nuanced patient- and disease-level factors. Wide variation was observed in oncologists’ perspectives on SLNB omission recommendations and supporting data. In addition, participants’ statements suggested that the multidisciplinary nature of cancer care may increase oncologists’ anxiety regarding SLNB omission.</p>

              <p>More than 30% of new breast cancer diagnoses in the US are among women 70 years and older,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> with approximately 80% having hormone receptor (HR)–positive erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (<italic>ERBB2</italic>; formerly <italic>HER2</italic>)–negative disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Randomized clinical trial data have demonstrated that omission of surgical axillary staging in women 70 years and older with early-stage (clinical tumor category 1 [cT1] with node-negative [N0] disease) HR-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative disease does not result in a survival disadvantage.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220807r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220807r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Three clinical trials have specifically explored this area: (1) the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 clinical trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> which randomized patients 70 years and older with cT1N0 estrogen receptor–positive disease to receive radiotherapy and tamoxifen vs tamoxifen only, with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) omitted in more than 60% of participants in both arms; (2) the International Breast Cancer Study Group 10-93 clinical trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> which was originally designed to evaluate disease-free survival equivalence among women 60 years and older with cN0 operable breast cancer who did vs did not receive ALND; and (3) a clinical trial conducted by Martelli et al,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> which randomized women aged 65 to 80 years with cT1N0 cancer undergoing quadrantectomy and radiotherapy to receive ALND vs no ALND. None of these clinical trials showed a survival difference between the 2 arms, and axillary recurrence rates among women who did not receive ALND ranged from 3% to 6%.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220807r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220807r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition, although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is viewed as a relatively low-risk procedure, bleeding, infection, increased operative time, seroma, persistent paresthesia, and lymphedema risks persist.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the Choosing Wisely initiative recommends against the use of routine SLNB in this patient population,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but use rates remain higher than 80% in Canada and the US.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220807r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The reasons for the lack of appropriate deescalation of local therapy have not been well studied. Nodal status has traditionally played an important role in adjuvant treatment decisions among medical and radiation oncologists, and a previous study<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> of SLNB omission in older adults identified multidisciplinary dynamics as a possible factor involved in persistently high SLNB rates. Despite these findings, it remains unclear how the different perspectives of 3 important physician stakeholders in these discussions (surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists) play a role in SLNB rates among this patient population. The objective of this qualitative study was to understand these subspecialists’ perspectives on SLNB omission and to identify specific practice factors that may be involved in deimplementation of SLNB in women 70 years and older with cT1N0 HR-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative breast cancer.</p>

                <p>To broadly explore oncologists’ attitudes regarding omission of SLNB in patients 70 years and older with cT1N0 HR-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative breast cancer, this qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews among a sample of surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists in the US and Canada. Oncologists were eligible for participation if they had finished training and were actively treating patients with breast cancer. The semi-structured interview guide was developed using domains described by the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases checklist,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a screening tool used to identify clinical practice factors; the interview guide was customized for the specialties of interest (<xref rid="note-ZOI220807-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>). This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. All participants provided verbal informed consent, including consent to use their quotes for publication, before they were interviewed. The study followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/coreq/" ext-link-type="uri">COREQ</ext-link>) reporting guideline for qualitative studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>

                <p>The first participants identified were surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists who had practiced in academic, community, or hybrid settings in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute network within the past 5 years. A snowball strategy was used to recruit additional participants. All participants were recruited via email. Purposive snowball sampling was used to ensure participants were diverse with respect to length of time in practice, practice location, and practice type (<xref rid="zoi220807t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interviews continued until thematic saturation (the point at which new themes infrequently emerged and code definitions remained stable) was reached.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Interview Procedures</title>
                <p>Interviews were conducted via telephone between March 1, 2020, and January 17, 2021, by the principal investigator (C.A.M.), a female surgical oncologist with training in qualitative methods. The interviewer had previous professional relationships with 2 participants. All participants knew the interviewer’s professional background. The domains from the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases checklist<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> included in this study were guideline factors; social, political, and legal factors; professional interactions; individual health professional factors; and patient factors. Because this study was designed to focus on different multidisciplinary perspectives, separate interview guides were developed for surgical oncologists (eAppendix 1 in the <xref rid="note-ZOI220807-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>) and medical or radiation oncologists (eAppendix 2 in the <xref rid="note-ZOI220807-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>). The 2 interview guides were developed over several iterations, with input from a qualitative research expert (A.C.R.) and oncologists (R.A.F., T.A.K., and E.A.M.), to ensure content and face validity and to evaluate the approximate time for interview completion. The interview guides were also pilot tested among 3 physicians (1 surgical oncologist, 1 medical oncologist, and 1 radiation oncologist), with minor resultant modifications. No changes to the guides were made during the subsequent interviews. Interviews were digitally recorded, with a mean duration of 15.7 minutes (range, 7.0-47.0 minutes). Demographic information regarding participant sex and practice characteristics were obtained at the beginning of each interview. Notes taken during each interview were also documented by the interviewer. Incentives in the form of $50 gift cards were provided, although they were not accepted by all participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Digital audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and deidentified. After all data were collected and reviewed, thematic analysis was conducted using an iterative, multistage process that incorporated both inductive and deductive coding. We applied deductive codes based on the domains of the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases checklist,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> then expanded the codebook to include inductive codes that emerged from the data. The initial codebook was created and refined by 3 team members (C.A.M., A.F.B., and A.C.R.). Each transcript was then coded by 2 team members (C.A.M. and A.F.B.) using NVivo software, version 12.5.0 (QSR International); these team members (C.A.M. and A.F.B.) met frequently to resolve areas of disagreement and reach consensus in coding. After all data were coded, the research team (C.A.M., A.F.B., and A.C.R.) met to discuss the salience of emergent themes. Codes were analyzed both within and across subgroups (ie, surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists).</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>Over the study period, 51 surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists were identified as potential participants by colleagues; of those, 29 oncologists consented to participate. Of the 22 physicians who did not respond to the invitation to participate, 12 were surgical oncologists, 6 were medical oncologists, and 4 were radiation oncologists.</p>
              <p>Of the 29 oncologists who chose to participate, 16 (55.2%) were surgeons, 6 (20.7%) were medical oncologists, and 7 (24.1%) were radiation oncologists (<xref rid="zoi220807t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 16 participants (55.2%) were women, and 13 participants (44.8%) were men. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. Most surgical oncologists (13 physicians [81.3%]) and medical oncologists (6 physicians [100%]) had fellowship training, whereas none of the radiation oncologists had fellowship training, which reflects the nature of their specialty. Overall, participants had a range of experience (median [range] years in practice, 12.0 [0.5-30.0]) and practice types (14 academic [48.3%], 7 community [24.1%], and 8 hybrid [27.6%]). Years of experience ranged from 6 months to 36 years (median [range] for surgical oncologists: 13.0 [0.5-33.0] years; medical oncologists: 8.5 [4.0-20.0] years; radiation oncologists: 18.0 [4.0-36.0] years). All 3 specialties were represented in each region, with the exception of medical oncologists in the Midwest and Canada. Each specialty had academic practice representation (7 surgical oncologists [43.8%], 4 medical oncologists [66.7%], and 3 radiation oncologists [42.9%]), and 2 specialties had community practice representation (5 surgical oncologists [31.3%] and 2 medical oncologists [33.3%]). The estimated percentage of physicians’ practices comprising patients with breast cancer diagnoses ranged from 10% to 100% among surgical and radiation oncologists and from 20% to 100% among medical oncologists.</p>

                <title>Factors Involved in the Decision to Omit SLNB</title>
                <p>Participants identified a variety of factors integral to the decision to omit SLNB in this patient population. Tumor characteristics associated with worse prognosis (eg, larger tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion, low estrogen receptor positivity, or higher grade) and higher likelihood of a positive node discouraged SLNB omission; better prognostic factors and lower likelihood of a positive node encouraged SLNB omission (<xref rid="zoi220807t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The likelihood that a patient would receive adjuvant systemic therapies (eg, endocrine therapy adherence or chemotherapy receipt) was also important to oncologists’ comfort level with SLNB omission.</p>

                <p>Important patient-level factors included geriatric-specific concerns, such as comorbidities and physiological age. Across specialties, older physiological age and presence of comorbidities encouraged SLNB omission; however, despite the importance oncologists placed on consideration of geriatric-specific concerns, validated geriatric screening tools were used by only 1 participant. Participants stated that they relied on “eyeball” assessment. Perspectives on chronological age were a major subtheme, with many participants stating that 70 years was too young a cutoff to automatically omit SLNB. There was a lack of consensus regarding a more reasonable threshold, with ages 75 years, 80 years, and 85 years mentioned as potential alternatives.</p>
                <p>Patient preference was also perceived as an important consideration, but there was a wide range of understanding of patient views regarding SLNB omission. Although some participants thought that “less is more” with regard to SLNB use among older patients, others believed that most older women would want to receive SLNB either because they wanted to be treated like younger patients or they wanted peace of mind. Oncologists perceived patient educational level, views of family and friends, and patient anxiety level as being potentially influential for patients’ views.</p>
                <p>Although all participants agreed that SLNB omission did not have consequences for survival, several radiation oncologists expressed anxiety regarding regional recurrences. In addition, radiation oncologists commented that, although SLNB omission may not necessarily change their decision regarding whether to provide treatment with radiotherapy, omission might change the type of radiotherapy (eg, addition of high tangents, addition of comprehensive nodal radiotherapy, or whole breast vs partial breast radiotherapy) they would provide. Surgical oncologists were concerned about the potential consequences of SLNB omission for systemic therapy decisions; however, medical oncologists said they did not experience undue difficulties in making chemotherapy recommendations without SLNB results. Factors that were disease specific and external to the patient, such as legal or financial issues, were mentioned; however, participants disagreed about whether these factors had any substantial implications for decision-making.</p>

                <p>Participants across disciplines stated that the Choosing Wisely recommendation led them to consider SLNB omission; however, perspectives varied regarding the lack of specificity of the recommendation (which states, “do not routinely use SLNB in clinically node-negative women ≥70 years of age with early-stage HR+, <italic>HER2-</italic> invasive breast cancer”<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="zoi220807t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Although some participants approved of the wording because it reflected the complexities inherent in medical decision-making, 1 surgical oncologist said that the “wishy-washy” nature of the wording left too much open to interpretation. Institutional guidelines that addressed this lack of specificity (eg, integration of tumor size and grade into rules for SLNB omission or practice of unconditional SLNB omission among those aged ≥75 years) were identified by a subset of participants.</p>

Although several surgical oncologists were able to cite the randomized clinical trial data supporting the Choosing Wisely recommendation, most participants thought the recommendation was supported by retrospective data. Those who were unfamiliar with the clinical trial data but supported SLNB omission cited an overall understanding that omission was reasonable based on what was already known about the lack of survival benefit of axillary surgical procedures among those with node-negative breast cancer. As 1 surgeon said, “It’s sort of like lap choles…you don’t need a randomized clinical trial to let you know that…the patients recover much more readily than those who have an open cholecystectomy.”.</p>

As some participants described, it is possible that patient preference for SLNB is strong, similar to the sentiment that underlies persistently high rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It is possible that 1 reason for the successful deescalation of axillary surgical procedures (in accordance with the findings of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 clinical trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> in which patients who underwent breast conservation procedures after receipt of only 1 or 2 positive SLNB results did not benefit from completion ALND) is that completion ALND is not routinely offered as a shared decision, whereas SLNB in older adults with early-stage HR-positive cancer may be.<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is also possible that, even though oncologists described engaging in the shared decision-making process, patients may not have perceived that they had a choice. Several studies<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220807r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> have reported that older patients with breast cancer did not remember being presented with a choice in treatment and instead only remembered that a recommendation was made. Additional conversational nuance occurs when addressing patient age in this clinical context. Many participants acknowledged the importance of physiological age yet continued to use chronological age in decision-making. Integration of objective geriatric assessments into clinical practice may aid with this problem. However, as 1 surgical oncologist noted, “I find myself awkwardly talking around the life expectancy issue,” suggesting that training physicians in the skillful incorporation of shared decision-making and conversations about physiological age may also be needed to aid deimplementation efforts.</p>
              <p>The variation noted in oncologists’ perspectives on SLNB omission recommendations and supporting data also revealed targets for intervention. Although 1 theme was “supporting data are perceived as being weak,” the relatively low level of oncologists’ knowledge of the clinical trial data supporting the Choosing Wisely recommendation, even among participants who supported SLNB omission, suggests this is an area to be addressed. Although some participants thought the recommendation was supported only by retrospective data, randomized clinical trial data support the omission of axillary surgical procedures in older patients with low-risk disease. Participants who supported SLNB omission without knowing the clinical trial data mentioned what was historically known about the utility of axillary evaluation, ostensibly referring to the general principle proposed in large clinical trials such as the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-04 study,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which demonstrated that axillary evaluation among patients with clinically node-negative cancer did not affect survival. However, this lack of specific knowledge pertaining to the practice of SLNB omission in women 70 years and older with cT1N0 HR-positive disease may have implications for treatment conversations between physician and patient. Although we only captured physicians’ perspectives regarding the ways in which this issue is discussed, it is possible that the lack of awareness of data supporting SLNB omission hinders physicians’ ability to facilitate discussion regarding this nuanced issue. Physician distrust of data supporting SLNB omission was also captured in a qualitative study by Smith et al,<sup><xref rid="zoi220807r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which assessed multiple Choosing Wisely recommendations; however, the current study found that the disbelief in data may actually be based on a lack of reliable knowledge. If included as part of a multifaceted approach to deimplementation, educational efforts focused on disseminating the existing clinical trial data to physicians, with endorsement by medical and radiation oncologists, may address this barrier. However, the proportion of physicians who would deem the existing data sufficient to completely accept SLNB omission remains unclear.</p>
              <p>The third important finding highlighted the difficulties of navigating multidisciplinary cancer care. Surgical oncologists acknowledged that they did not know whether their surgical decision would ultimately have consequences for adjuvant decision-making and whether medical oncologists would communicate to patients that they should have undergone SLNB. Despite this uncertainty, the medical oncologists in our study did not express undue concern about making systemic treatment recommendations in the absence of nodal staging, suggesting that some surgeons’ anxieties may have been unfounded. However, radiation oncologists stated that a lack of surgical nodal staging might increase regional recurrence risk and could have implications for their treatment planning (eg, keep them from offering partial breast radiotherapy). Participants who did not express concerns about the consequences of SLNB omission for adjuvant treatment planning referred to the importance of preoperative conversations. Although increasing preoperative communication can be readily addressed when practitioners can easily access one another, it is difficult in cases in which patients travel for their surgical care but return to their local communities to receive systemic treatment and radiotherapy consultations. Finding successful and efficient ways to facilitate preoperative treatment conversations could be an important part of a greater deimplementation effort.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several limitations. First, the study was only designed to capture the physician perspective; without the patient perspective, the findings may misrepresent certain aspects of the physician-patient interaction. This issue will be addressed in future work. Second, respondent bias may have been inherent because oncologists who were unaware of the data supporting SLNB omission or noncommittal about the omission of SLNB in the patient population of interest may have been less likely to participate in an interview, thereby skewing our results. Although we were careful to use purposive sampling to ensure a range of years in practice and practice types, we were unable to explore whether the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the physician or patient mix were involved in physician perspectives. Third, although we reached saturation of theme, surgical oncologists were overrepresented in this sample, possibly giving a greater voice to surgeons. However, analysis within and across subspecialties highlighted differences and similarities when present.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This qualitative study found that oncologists viewed omission of SLNB in women 70 years and older with cT1N0 HR-positive, <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative breast cancer as a nuanced decision that was based on multiple disease- and patient-level factors and that the multidisciplinary nature of current cancer care may be a complicating factor in surgical decision-making. Interventions aimed at educating physicians, improving patient-physician communication, and facilitating preoperative multidisciplinary conversations may help to decrease SLNB rates in a meaningful and appropriate way.</p>
