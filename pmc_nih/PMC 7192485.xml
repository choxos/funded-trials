              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans are routinely used in clinical practice for monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with macular edema. Central retinal thickness measurements obtained from OCT are a key outcome measure for clinical trials; however, central retinal thickness is not considered a biomarker or a predictor for visual recovery because of its weak correlation with visual acuity (VA).[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The ellipsoid zone (EZ), previously named the photoreceptor inner segment-outer segment junction, is visualized as a hyperreflective layer in the outer retina on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] SD-OCT enables <italic>in vivo</italic> high-resolution, cross-sectional imaging of the retina, permitting qualitative and quantitative assessment of EZ integrity, which has been correlated with VA in multiple retinal diseases,[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232494.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] including retinal vein occlusion (RVO).[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p>
              <p>Many studies examining the EZ layer are qualitative, describing abnormalities of the layer based on signal intensity.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232494.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Current methods for quantitative assessment of the EZ involve segmentation of the retinal layers using manual or semi-automated techniques.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232494.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This generates EZ layer thickness measurements with an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid. An alternative and more intuitive method would be to assess the area of EZ defect or loss using <italic>en face</italic> thickness maps created from the segmented layers.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The <italic>en face</italic> maps are two dimensional and present areas of EZ absence, i.e. very low thickness areas are dark regions against a brighter background of normal EZ thickness. Manual segmentation of the EZ is laborious and time intensive.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, we sought to utilize accessible, machine-learning methods to facilitate the identification of these regions. We trained a classifier model using the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] of Fiji [<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232494.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], an open-source image processing software package specifically designed for scientific image analysis, to detect the areas of EZ defect. Using this trained classifier, we then applied it within a novel, customized workflow using the open-source software platform Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME)[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to evaluate the EZ assessed by SD-OCT generated <italic>en face</italic> thickness maps in eyes with macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (HRVO).</p>

All participants provided written informed consent. The SCORE2 design and methods have been previously described in detail.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In summary, 362 participants were randomized to receive either intravitreal bevacizumab or aflibercept. The study visits were conducted per protocol with treatment provided per protocol from baseline through month 12, and then at the discretion of the investigator thereafter. Inclusion criteria were center-involved macular edema defined as central subfield thickness of ≥300 μm (or ≥320 μm if measured with Heidelberg Spectralis Machine).</p>
                <p>Seventy-five participants were randomly selected from the SCORE2 baseline dataset, which represented approximately 20% of the total number of trial subjects. Participants were stratified based on baseline VA into three groups, including good (73–59 letters: 20/40-20/63), moderate (58–49 letters: 20/80-20/100), and poor (48–19 letters: 20/125-20/400). Twenty-five subjects were randomly selected from each stratum.</p>

This tool is a Fiji plugin that combines a collection of machine-learning algorithms with a set of selected image features to produce pixel-based segmentations.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Default segmentation settings in TWS were applied, though the maximum sigma was set to 32.

                <p>For manual measurements, the EZ boundary was manually traced within the KNIME workflow, and only the areas of EZ defect within the CSF were quantified. CSF xy coordinates were exported from the custom MATLAB software and used to overlay the CSF regions unique to each image (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). All thickness maps and area measurements were generated via the same methods for both automatic and manual approaches. The only difference between the semi-automated and manual workflows was the segmentation method applied (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). The KNIME workflow allowed visual inspection of all segmented regions with image overlays of the area of EZ defect on the <italic>en face</italic> thickness map (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>). All images were analyzed and reviewed by two masked graders and study authors (T.E. and C.P.). Graders reviewed images independently and were masked to segmentation results. Inter-rater reliability and agreement were assessed for manual EZ defect measurements.</p>
                <p>The minimum area of EZ defect was defined as 0.004 mm<sup>2</sup> and the maximum area of EZ defect was 0.78 mm<sup>2</sup> (based on the area of the CSF). The minimum area was selected based on the lowest limit of area measurability used within reading center grading protocols (e.g. drusen circle C<sub>0</sub> established by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) Research Group).[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we developed a customized workflow that began with a semi-automated segmentation method for defining the EZ layer using nonproprietary software. These layer coordinates were used to then automatically generate <italic>en face</italic> thickness maps in eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO or HRVO in a randomly selected subgroup of SCORE2 subjects for both manual and semi-automatic segmentation of areas of EZ defect using the open-source software platform, KNIME. This semi-automated approach took advantage of machine-learning methods via the open-source Fiji[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] plugin Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS)[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and demonstrated excellent reliability and agreement when compared to manual measurements. These data suggest that our semi-automatic and open-source approach can be efficiently and reliably applied to similar workflows quantitatively assessing SD-OCT derived retinal morphology.</p>
              <p>Quantitative assessment of the EZ commonly use manual measurements via the <italic>en face</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232494.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] method, which consists of creating conforming segmentation lines along the upper and lower boundaries of the EZ band. The B-scan intensities through the segmented boundaries are projected to form an <italic>en face</italic> image with enhanced contrast between intact and absent EZ.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The EZ boundary is then traced to create a geographic representation. Manual measurement of the EZ is time intensive,[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] particularly in clinical trials with high volume data. Therefore, we sought to utilize accessible machine-learning tools to facilitate the identification of these regions.</p>
              <p>The ability to measure the EZ is dependent on the visibility of the EZ layer. In the acute stages of RVO, evaluation of the EZ is impaired by the presence of hemorrhage and edema that reduces the outer retinal signal intensity.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] At baseline, &gt;90% of images were ungradable due to the presence of confounding hemorrhage and edema. Initial qualitative grading of the EZ was performed by expert graders at the SCORE2 central reading center (Fundus Photograph Reading Center, University of Wisconsin). The EZ was qualitatively deemed ungradable when the RPE was not visible due to signal blockage by hemorrhage and edema (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). After intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, 72% of available study eyes were gradable at month 1 for the evaluation of EZ integrity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). Similar approaches to evaluating EZ integrity exclude patients with severe edema, which has been defined as a CSF thickness greater than 600 μm.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although we did not use this threshold, we did exclude EZ defect area measurements less than or equal to 0.004 mm<sup>2</sup>. Area measurements less than this value were considered absent. We reviewed all data points outside the 95% CI of the LOA comparing the manual versus semi-automated measurements. Discrepancies between area measurements in all cases were due to poor image contrast as a result of impaired signal intensity from multiple factors, including media opacity, hemorrhage, and edema. These data suggest the semi-automated measurements did not disagree with those obtained by the manual approach, and semi-automated measures performed as well as manual outlines by expert graders (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>).</p>

              <p>This study has several limitations. We compared the manual to semi-automated area measurements of EZ defect using the mean area measurement and not by colocalizing the EZ defect areas generated from the two methods. This comparison does not capture the differences in position, orientation, and shape between the EZ boundary measurements. This measurement is impaired by the fact that similar EZ areas may have dissimilar EZ boundaries. Despite this limitation, the mean area measurement is similar to the difference in widths that have been used in reliability studies of EZ defect from individual B-scans in other disease processes, namely retinitis pigmentosa.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Additionally, because our study is limited to a smaller region of the CSF, we expect this difference to be minimal (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232494.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>). The selection of scans for analysis of the EZ was performed by expert graders and was based on the SCORE2 SD-OCT grading protocol. However, all scans deemed of sufficient quality for EZ assessment (i.e. the RPE was visible) were evaluated by both the semi-automated and manual approaches. Future studies may examine the application of machine-learning for image selection. This analysis did not examine the correlation between the area of EZ defect with VA and other clinical data. Validation of our approach and association of EZ defect area measurements with clinical data will be performed on the entire SCORE2 cohort upon study completion. Studies have examined the association of EZ integrity at baseline as a predictor of future visual acuity.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] However, these studies included eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion, which presents with significantly less hemorrhage and fluid compared to central and hemi-retinal vein occlusion, especially within the CSF.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] These studies also utilized high resolution SD-OCT scans, whereas the SCORE2 trial did not to improve the generalizability to the study methods and results. Although post-image processing to remove shadowing cast by hemorrhage and fluid has been performed,[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232494.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] these studies have also utilized high resolution SD-OCT scans from a single SD-OCT device. Our method combined multiple SD-OCT machines. Finally, we examined EZ disruption in macular edema secondary to CRVO or HRVO. Future studies applying our methods to diabetic macular edema and other diseases may be beneficial.</p>
              <p>There are many strengths of our approach. Our workflow combines multiple steps in the generation of EZ absence area measurements, such as EZ segmentation, export of files containing segmentation coordinates, generation of <italic>en face</italic> thickness maps that highlight the contrast between intact and absent EZ, and automatic delineation and quantification of EZ defects. The analysis utilized a classifier that acts as a computer-generated grader that can, once fully trained, measure regions of EZ defect, adding precision and high-throughput speed beyond that of manual tracing. Manual identification of EZ defect is time-consuming and error prone. In a study comparing methods of EZ boundary identification in retinitis pigmentosa, the average time required to delineate and trace the EZ boundary, not including segmentation of the EZ layer, was 4.1 minutes for the <italic>en face</italic> method.[<xref rid="pone.0232494.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Our semi-automated process is rapid, permitting the analysis of SD-OCT scan in seconds in a reliable and reproducible manner. Differences between manual EZ defect tracing times between the previously reported study and ours were likely due to area measurements only within the CSF.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We developed a customized workflow using open-source software that applied manual and semi-automated methods for quantifying the area of EZ defect assessed by SD-OCT derived <italic>en face</italic> thickness maps in eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO or HRVO. Semi-automated EZ defect area measurements were obtained through machine-learning and demonstrated excellent agreement and reliability when compared to manual measurements, suggesting that our workflow may be applied to other quantitative assessments of SD-OCT derived retinal morphology. Our semi-automated approach will be validated in the entire SCORE2 cohort upon study completion.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: 1. A very well structured manuscript, technically sound, with data that support the conclusions.</p>
              <p>2. The statistical analysis described is thorough.</p>
              <p>3. The lack of EZ assessment at baseline scans defeats the purpose of using EZ integrity as a prognosticator of final visual outcome:</p>
              <p>As described in the introduction, one of the reasons why EZ integrity is often assessed is its potential use as a predictive factor of the final visual outcome. In the present study, by converting cross sectional images into en face, hemorrhage or edema-associated signal blockage prevented the assessment of EZ integrity at baseline. (&gt;90% of baseline images were ‘ungradable’)</p>
              <p>Hence, as described, EZ integrity of only SD-OCT images at months 1, 6, and 12 was assessed, analysed and quantified in this study. Consequently, if a semi-automated machine learning system is used for the assessment of EZ integrity in en face images, the only prognostic information one can derive comes from the EZ integrity after intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment (at 1st month)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The paper by Tyler Etheridge et al. entitled 'A Semi-Automated Machine-Learning Based Workflow for Ellipsoid Zone Analysis in Eyes with Macular Edema: SCORE 2 Pilot Study' is an interesting study on the evaluation of the combination of a customized workflow with KNIME and machine learning tool for Fiji plugin: Trainable Weka Segmentation. The authors developed the customized workflow with semi-automated optical coherence tomography measurements and examined its agreement and reliability. And then, they found their new approach was reliable and time-saving. The study is well constructed. The obtained results will be of interest to researchers in the field. Their handy method using KNIME and Fiji plugin could be applied to other retinal diseases at a low cost. And I think the study has great potential not only in academic research but also in daily clinical practice.</p>
              <p>I have few concerns,</p>
              <p>(1) Page 7, line 170-172; what kind of dataset did the authors use for the learning process? From entire SCORE2 data? Or other normal subject data? And how much data did the authors use for training? Did the authors check if the performance reached the plateau or not?</p>
              <p>(2) Page 11, line 247-255; how long did it take for the training process?</p>
              <p>(3) Page 9, line 210-218; how did the authors judge whether each image could go through the analysis or not. Manually by graders or semi-automated with a program? Did 'gradable' mean manually measured? Did only images that could be manually measured go through semi-automated measurements? If the judgment is done by a human, not by a semi-automated program, then I suggest discussing this essential process in terms of the semi-automated approach limitation.</p>
              <p>(4) Page 10, line 231-233 (Figure 3A); the authors evaluated the reliability with Bland-Altman plot in addition to intraclass correlation coefficient. But, I guess intraclass correlation coefficient is enough to evaluate both the reliability and agreement (ref. Terry K. Koo, Mae Y. Li. A Guideline of Selecting and Reporting Intraclass Correlation Coefficients for Reliability Research. J Chiropr Med. 2016 Jun; 15(2): 155–163.

              <p>(5) For the researchers and clinicians who want to use the workflow and semi-automated methods in their settings, is it possible to show the link of the programs or training dataset? If it's possible, it must be helpful for our fields.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>1. A very well structured manuscript, technically sound, with data that support the conclusions</p>

              <p>Reply: No changes were made. Please see the discussion section (page 13, line 282-298). The inability to accurately assess the EZ on en face thickness maps due to reduced outer retinal signal intensity from blockage by hemorrhage and fluid is an inherent challenge in retinal vein occlusion. Without histopathological correlates it is difficult to know whether EZ defects on SD-OCT are artifacts resulting from signal blockage or loss of photoreceptors secondary to disease. However, our approach of assessing month 1 EZ integrity with subsequent visual acuity matches other studies referenced in the manuscript: </p>

              <p>Reply: No changes were made. Please see the methods section (page 8, line 175-179). The authors selected en face thickness maps that represented the inherent variability of the total dataset analyzed (184 scans). We chose approximately 10% of the dataset (12 en face thickness maps) for classifier training. Areas of normal EZ and EZ defects were manually traced using the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin of Fiji as described by Arganda-Carreras et al.*. The authors sought to maximize the classifiers identification of regions of interest and minimize non-region of interest (false-positive) identification. A reliable and accurate classifier was trained with the initial 12 thickness maps, more would have been used if necessary, as is customary in such training protocols. </p>

              <p>(2) Page 11, line 247-255; how long did it take for the training process?</p>
              <p>Reply: No changes were made. The authors did not time the classifier training. However, after generation of the en face thickness maps and selection of images representing the heterogeneity of the image dataset, the training of the classifier required minimal time compared to manual annotations (20-30 minutes to obtain the first, most-reliable classifier with appropriate settings). </p>
              <p>(3) Page 9, line 210-218; how did the authors judge whether each image could go through the analysis or not. Manually by graders or semi-automated with a program? Did 'gradable' mean manually measured? Did only images that could be manually measured go through semi-automated measurements? If the judgment is done by a human, not by a semi-automated program, then I suggest discussing this essential process in terms of the semi-automated approach limitation.</p>
              <p>Reply: The following changes were made (page 14, line 308-312). “The selection of scans for analysis of the EZ was performed by expert graders and was based on the SCORE2 SD-OCT grading protocol. However, all scans deemed of sufficient quality for EZ assessment (i.e. the RPE was visible) were evaluated by both the semi-automated and manual approaches. Future studies may examine the application of machine-learning for image selection.” </p>
              <p>(4) Page 10, line 231-233 (Figure 3A); the authors evaluated the reliability with Bland-Altman plot in addition to intraclass correlation coefficient. But, I guess intraclass correlation coefficient is enough to evaluate both the reliability and agreement (ref. Terry K. Koo, Mae Y. Li.

              <p>Reply: No changes were made. The authors sought to perform a rigorous comparison of the two approaches and subtle differences exist between reliability and agreement, which is described by Kottner et al.*.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors opted to make no changes on comment #3. Regarding their answer:</p>
              <p>1. In their article entitled Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) patterns and response to intravitreal bevacizumab therapy in macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, Kang et al found that the integrity of the EZ before treatment could not be evaluated in cross sectional OCT scans in 8 of 67 patients with BRVO-ME.</p>
              <p>Herein the authors by converting cross sectional images into en face report &gt;90% of baseline images were ‘ungradable’. This is vastly different from the ungradable percentages in cross sectional OCT. Thus it seems the inability to accurately assess the EZ is not an inherent challenge in RVO (as the authors response to the comment suggests) rather an inherent limitation of en face images, which should be clearly stated in the limitations.</p>
              <p>2. A prognosticator available at 1 month is not as useful to clinicians and patients as baseline prognosticators for long term functional outcomes in cases those exist. In BRVO the EZ integrity at baseline is a well established prognosticator that the en face approach seems to fail to offer.</p>
              <p>All 3 articles that the authors cite in their response refer to cross sectional OCT studies and 2/3 actually did evaluate EZ disruption at baseline with no mention on the potential effect of macular edema. Hence, it seems that the en face transformation of cross sectional OCT images limits the ability to assess the EZ integrity due to macular edema and/or haemorrhage.</p>
              <p>3. Further, the authors reply to the comment suggesting that histopathological studies would be needed to determine whether EZ defects on SD-OCT are artifacts resulting from signal blockage or loss of photoreceptors secondary to disease. However the article by Kanakis et al they are citing in the relevant part of their discussion (lines 282-298) describe the development of ‘a method of en face representation of the ellipsoid zone, along with the removal of shadows, to evaluate the ellipsoid layer disruption’ using ‘a MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA) implementation of the algorithms for shadows removal’ concluding that ‘It could be assumed that the defects at the level of photoreceptors could be the result of the coexisting macular edema. However, the concordance of the ischemic area as shown in FA with the area of ellipsoid disruption at the en face reconstruction of the OCT makes this hypothesis unlikely.’</p>
              <p>Good quality images are crucial in Machine Learning. The authors herein employed Machine Learning and transformed the cross sectional images to en face ending up &gt;90% of baseline images were ‘ungradable’in terms of the main parameter the authors seek to study. To make their study stronger, and given their machine learning expertise, I would suggest the authors should embrace a similar approach as the en face OCT article by Kanakis et al they are citing and supplement their methods by developing an algorithm for artifact removal so that the quality control of the images they are feeding the Machine Learning is improved.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Almost all my concerns are answered clearly.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors opted to make no changes on comment #3. Regarding their answer:</p>
              <p>1. In their article entitled Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) patterns and response to intravitreal bevacizumab therapy in macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, Kang et al found that the integrity of the EZ before treatment could not be evaluated in cross sectional OCT scans in 8 of 67 patients with BRVO-ME.</p>
              <p>Herein the authors by converting cross sectional images into en face report &gt;90% of baseline images were ‘ungradable’. This is vastly different from the ungradable percentages in cross sectional OCT. Thus it seems the inability to accurately assess the EZ is not an inherent challenge in RVO (as the authors response to the comment suggests) rather an inherent limitation of en face images, which should be clearly stated in the limitations.</p>
              <p>Reply: Thank you for the comment. Both central and hemi-retinal vein occlusion have significantly more hemorrhage and fluid than branch retinal vein occlusion, making a comparison between the disease processes problematic. The SCORE2 study data were obtained from eyes with macular edema secondary to central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion. To further emphasize the challenge inherent in evaluating the ellipsoid zone on SD-OCT scans in central and hemi-retinal vein occlusion, regardless of cross sectional or en face evaluation, the authors have include a new figure (Figure 3 lines 217, 286, 288, and 478-481) depicting a representative cross sectional B-scan at baseline with significant hemorrhage and fluid blocking the outer retinal signal intensity to the point of being unable to identify the retinal pigment epithelium. The figure also includes a follow-up month 1 cross sectional image after resolution of a majority of hemorrhage and fluid with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and gradable ellipsoid zone. </p>
              <p>Change made to manuscript: Figure 3. (A) Representative center point SD-OCT scan deemed ungradable at baseline for ellipsoid zone (EZ) assessment. EZ was considered ungradable when the retinal pigment epithelium was not visible due to signal blockage by hemorrhage and edema. (B) Month 1 follow-up SD-OCT scan after single intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. EZ considered gradable. </p>
              <p>2. A prognosticator available at 1 month is not as useful to clinicians and patients as baseline prognosticators for long term functional outcomes in cases those exist. In BRVO the EZ integrity at baseline is a well established prognosticator that the en face approach seems to fail to offer.</p>
              <p>All 3 articles that the authors cite in their response refer to cross sectional OCT studies and 2/3 actually did evaluate EZ disruption at baseline with no mention on the potential effect of macular edema. Hence, it seems that the en face transformation of cross sectional OCT images limits the ability to assess the EZ integrity due to macular edema and/or haemorrhage.</p>
              <p>Reply: Thank you for the comment. The studies by Chan et al, Tang et al, and Fujihara-Mino et al included eyes with central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion. As stated above, comparing the two distinct disease processes is problematic owing to the significant difference in hemorrhage and fluid in central retinal vein occlusion compared to branch retinal vein occlusion. In addition, these studies used high resolution SD-OCT scans, whereas the SCORE2 clinical trial did not to add generalizability to the study methods and results. This has been included in the discussion of our studies limitations. </p>
              <p>Change made to manuscript ( line 324): Studies have examined the association of EZ integrity at baseline as a predictor of future visual acuity.However, these studies included eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion, which presents with significantly less hemorrhage and fluid compared to central and hemi-retinal vein occlusion, especially within the CSF.</p>
              <p>3. Further, the authors reply to the comment suggesting that histopathological studies would be needed to determine whether EZ defects on SD-OCT are artifacts resulting from signal blockage or loss of photoreceptors secondary to disease. However the article by Kanakis et al they are citing in the relevant part of their discussion (lines 282-298) describe the development of ‘a method of en face representation of the ellipsoid zone, along with the removal of shadows, to evaluate the ellipsoid layer disruption’ using ‘a MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA) implementation of the algorithms for shadows removal’ concluding that ‘It could be assumed that the defects at the level of photoreceptors could be the result of the coexisting macular edema. However, the concordance of the ischemic area as shown in FA with the area of ellipsoid disruption at the en face reconstruction of the OCT makes this hypothesis unlikely.’</p>
              <p>Good quality images are crucial in Machine Learning.

              <p>Reply: Thank you for the comment. Similar to the studies by Chan et al, Tang et al, and Fuijihara-Mino et al, the aforementioned study by Kanakis et al was performed using high resolution SD-OCT scans not obtained for use by clinical trials or clinical practice. The SCORE2 SD-OCT scans were not high-resolution. In addition, the study by Kanakis et al only utilized Spectralis SD-OCT machine. The SCORE2 trial utilized Spectralis and Cirrus SD-OCT machines. Therefore, our methods permitted the use of either imaging device. This limitation is included in the discussion (lines 320-321).</p>
              <p>Change made to manuscript: These studies also utilized high resolution SD-OCT scans, whereas the SCORE2 trial did not to improve the generalizability to the study methods and results. Although post-image processing to remove shadowing cast by hemorrhage and fluid has been performed,these studies have also utilized high resolution SD-OCT scans from a single SD-OCT device. Our method combined multiple SD-OCT machines.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Almost all my concerns are answered clearly.</p>
              <p>Just to be sure, please let me confirm it.</p>
              <p>(1) Methods section (page 8, line 175-179). "Total dataset" comes from SCORE2 data. So, it didn't have normal subject data. Is it correct?</p>
              <p>Reply: Thank you for the clarification. The total dataset comes from SCORE2 data and therefore does not include data from “normal” or “healthy” subjects. This clarification was made in the methods (lines 177-179). </p>
              <p>Change made to manuscript: All scans were obtained from the SCORE2 dataset and were therefore from eyes affected by either CRVO or HRVO.</p>
