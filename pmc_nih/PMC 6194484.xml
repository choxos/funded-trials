                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Index case testing (ICT) to identify HIV-infected children is efficient but has suboptimal uptake. Financial incentives (FI) have overcome financial barriers in other populations by offsetting direct and indirect costs. A pilot study found FI to be feasible for motivating paediatric ICT among HIV-infected female caregivers. This randomised trial will determine the effectiveness of FI to increase uptake of paediatric ICT.</p>

                  <p>The Financial Incentives to Increase Uptake of Pediatric HIV Testing trial is a five-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial that determines whether FI increases timely uptake of paediatric ICT. The trial will be conducted in multiple public health facilities in western Kenya. Each HIV-infected adult enrolled in HIV care will be screened for eligibility: primary caregiver to one or more children of unknown HIV status aged 0–12 years. Eligible caregivers will be individually randomised at the time of recruitment in equal 1:1:1:1:1 allocation to one of five arms (US$0 (control), US$1.25, US$2.50, US$5.00 and US$10.00). The trial aims to randomise 800 caregivers. Incentives will be disbursed at the time of child HIV testing using mobile money transfer or cash. Arms will be compared in terms of the proportion of adults who complete testing for at least one child within 2 months of randomisation and time to testing. A cost-effectiveness analysis of FI for paediatric ICT will also be conducted.</p>

                  <p>This study was reviewed and approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board and the Kenyatta National Hospital Ethics and Research Committee. Trial results will be disseminated to healthcare workers at study sites, regional and national policymakers, and with patient populations at study sites (regardless of enrolment in the trial). Randomised trials of caregiver-child FI interventions pose unique study design, ethical and operational challenges, detailed here as a resource for future investigations.</p>

              <p>Perinatally acquired HIV infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While prompt initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces mortality and morbidity and promotes growth and development,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref> delayed diagnosis and treatment until a child is severely ill limits the benefits of ART.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> Global scale-up of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) systems has markedly reduced the number of new infant HIV infections.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, many older HIV-infected children remain undiagnosed, either through PMTCT dropout or due to infant infections attributable to incident maternal infection during pregnancy or postpartum<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> when HIV incidence is high<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and repeat maternal HIV testing is low.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Infant infections due to incident maternal infection are often missed by traditional prevention and early infant diagnosis systems.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>Index case testing (ICT), where the children of an HIV-infected adult (the ‘index case’) receiving HIV care are tested for HIV, is an efficient approach to case detection with high prevalence among children tested, but uptake remains suboptimal.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> In a previous study in Nairobi, only 14% of adults offered systematic paediatric ICT had their child tested for HIV<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; in this study, barriers to paediatric HIV testing included structural, interpersonal, emotional, logistical and financial issues.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Previous studies have addressed interpersonal and emotional barriers through assisted disclosure and support group interventions,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> system-level barriers through medical record flags<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and logistical barriers through offering a choice of home-based or clinic-based testing.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> However, these approaches may be expensive and rely on additional healthcare workers. In the context of limited health resources, approaches that minimise costs and maximise uptake are needed. A recent randomised trial showed that small financial incentives (FI) (US$2) were successful in increasing uptake of HIV testing among children and adolescents aged 8–17 years, using a community-based recruitment approach.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our team recently completed a feasibility pilot study of small FI to motivate uptake of paediatric ICT,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> but there have been no studies to date that have evaluated the effectiveness of FI to increase the uptake of paediatric ICT.</p>
              <p>There are several unique ethical, logistical and analytic challenges in designing a study to assess the effectiveness of incentivising caregivers to complete HIV testing for their children. Ethical concerns, including randomising a person of authority to act on another’s behalf, assessing child–caregiver relationships to avoid inadvertent disclosure of maternal HIV status, ensuring child’s well-being is not compromised and reducing risks of social harms, have been addressed elsewhere.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Logistically and analytically, there are unique challenges in managing FI randomisation and disbursement, minimising the drop-off between recruitment and randomisation, minimising contamination effects leading to presentation of ineligible individuals and accounting for competing interventions in the region.</p>
              <p>This study—Financial Incentives to Increase Uptake of Pediatric HIV Testing (FIT)—is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that determines whether FI increases uptake of paediatric ICT, and determines the cost-effectiveness of various levels of FI. This paper details the study protocol and describes design considerations specific to trials incentivising paediatric testing.</p>

                <p>FI may motivate parents who are willing to test to take action to test by either offsetting costs or by motivating more prompt action. Unwilling parents, who face extreme fear or real dangers from revealing their HIV status, may not be motivated by FI to take action to test. Social services—including enhanced counselling and peer support groups—may help parents move from unwilling to willing. <italic>Hypothesis</italic>: We hypothesise that the proposed FI intervention will primarily move willing parents from ‘Willing to test’ to ‘Taking action’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Conceptual framework. Financial incentives (FI) may motivate caregivers who are willing to test to move to take action to test. However, they are unlikely to motivate caregivers who are unwilling to test to take action. Social services (SS) interventions may be needed to move those parents who are unwilling to test to take action.</p>

                <p>A pilot study (NCT02931422) was conducted between October 2016 and January 2017. In the pilot study (N=60), values of US$5, US$10 and US$15 were tested; these were based on cost data from a previous paediatric ICT study conducted by the same team in Nairobi.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The lowest incentive value reflected the 75th percentile of direct non-medical costs (transportation, childcare and food/drink outside the home), the middle value reflected the 75th percentile of direct non-medical and indirect costs (lost wages from paid and unpaid work), and the highest value reflected the direct costs, indirect costs and a second day of lost wages.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

                <p>The FIT trial is a five-arm, unblinded, individual-level, superiority RCT of FI. Eligible individuals will be randomised using a 1:1:1:1:1 allocation to no incentive, US$1.25, US$2.50, US$5.00 or US$10.00 (2016 US$) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Randomised individuals can redeem the value of their incentive upon completing testing with study staff within 2 months of randomisation. The study will employ a roving, multisite model in which multiple clinic sites run concurrently, but each site will only be active for recruitment for 2 months. This model was selected to limit the extent to which clients at the facilities became aware of the FI opportunity through word of mouth, to limit the number of clients screened more than once (as most clients visit the clinic every 3 months) and to allow for sampling approximately proportional to facility size.</p>

                  <title>Design considerations</title>
                  <p>Alternative study designs that included historic and lead-in control periods, as well as cluster randomisation were considered, but ultimately not selected. Historic and lead-in control periods from within the same study sites could have suffered from depletion of susceptibles, in which the virtually fixed target population of index cases decreases over time as the most susceptible individuals experience the outcome of interest (eg, complete ICT for their children). While new individuals are diagnosed with HIV each day, the rate at which those individuals are added to the population in care is slow relative to the number of individuals active in care at the beginning of a study. Additionally, there are many events—rapid HIV testing campaigns, school holidays, guideline changes—that could have occurred during either the control or intervention periods and led to temporal trends that could not be robustly controlled for. A concurrent control arm was considered to limit the extent to which these temporal and epidemiologic trends would impact the estimation of the effect of FI on testing.</p>
                  <p>A cluster RCT (cRCT) was also considered, which would have limited contamination; in the context of this study, contamination would have been the extent to which individuals within a clinic became aware of the other values of FI being offered and discouraged by receiving less than the maximum FI value. However, a cRCT design for a five-arm trial would have required a prohibitively large number of clinics to detect meaningful differences in uptake, which was not feasible.</p>

                  <title>Trial incentive values</title>
                  <p>Incentive values were determined using results from the FIT pilot study described above.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Uptake of testing in the pilot study was high and comparable between the three arms (75%, 70% and 75% across arms, respectively).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Because it was unclear whether uptake was similar across the pilot study FI values because we had reached the top of the demand curve (eg, where even higher FI would yield no increase in testing) or whether we were clustered in the middle of a demand curve (where higher or lower values would provide further differences in testing uptake), we decided to widen the range of FI values to remove the highest value and include lower values.</p>
                  <p>The trial incentive values will be US$1.25, US$2.50, US$5.00 and US$10.00, and a control with no FI (US$0). Participants will be compensated and additional US$3.00 for transportation costs regardless of arm; this reimbursement will be included to ensure more equitable benefit for those in the control arm for research participation, and will not be described to participants prior to the testing visit in order to not act as an additional incentive.</p>

                  <title>Incentive considerations</title>
                  <p>Alternative formats of incentives were considered, including lottery-based incentives and non-FIs such as household items or agricultural items. Lottery-based incentives were considered less acceptable by some co-investigators due to a perception that this was similar to gambling, which has a negative connotation for some religious groups in Kenya. Agricultural and household items (and non-financial commodities in general) were felt to be more attractive for those living in rural settings, but had additional costs involved in procurement, distribution and tracking of commodities, which would increase programme costs. Cash or mobile money transfer was thus adopted as the most fungible, widely acceptable, accountable and low-cost FI format to deliver in the context of an intervention.</p>

Study team members will simultaneously operate up to three sites, and then relocate to new sites following 2 months of recruitment. Facilities will be selected 1–2 months in advance and approved by the county health director’s office and facility heads. Sites will be selected based on high volume of adults in HIV care and relatively low penetration of recent paediatric ICT campaigns or programmes. A full list of study sites will be provided in the trial results manuscript.</p>

                <title>Recruitment processes and eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Index adult clients attending the HIV care clinics will be screened by study staff to determine eligibility: being HIV infected and having one or more children of unknown HIV status aged 0–12 years. Children will be considered of unknown status if they have never been tested for HIV or tested negative during infancy but did not complete confirmatory negative testing after 18 months or following cessation of breastfeeding. Index client caregivers will be allowed to test any child formally in their care, both biological children and children to whom they serve as guardian. This decision was made to address the high burden of undiagnosed HIV infection among orphans and vulnerable children, and the ethical obligation to include them in potentially beneficial interventions. There are no restrictions regarding concomitant care or interventions for caregiver participation.</p>
                <p>For male index cases, an additional eligibility criterion is that the child’s mother is HIV infected. For male clients who do not know the status of the child’s mother, the index will not be randomised until maternal testing has been offered. Male clients with children whose biological mother has died are eligible.</p>

                  <title>Design considerations</title>
                  <p>Recruitment staff will aim to screen every client who passes through the clinic to accurately measure the true absolute and relative denominator of eligible adults. All approached clients will be invited to provide oral informed consent for eligibility determination and randomisation. Eligibility (number of children and child HIV test history) will be assessed at recruitment, before potential participants are informed about the incentives, in order to reduce the likelihood of caregivers bringing in children of known HIV status or children who are not their own. No instances of inappropriate testing or deception were uncovered in the pilot study.</p>

                <p>Caregivers will be randomised immediately following determination of eligibility in order to minimise bias associated with the attrition between referred and enrolled participants, which is common in RCTs. Caregivers will be invited to select a scratch card from an opaque bag and to scratch the metallic strip to reveal their randomisation arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). This randomisation allocation technique has been used previously in this setting.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Minimal optional data will be collected at the time of randomisation, which link scratch cards from origin to testing, including caregiver age and sex, number of children and telephone contact number. Caregivers will be invited, but not required, to provide these data at the time of randomisation; data will be collected to link caregivers to their randomisation values in case the scratch card is lost. Caregivers will be called up to three times after randomisation to schedule/reschedule enrolment and testing visits.</p>

Scratch cards were manufactured by Scratch Off Systems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.scratchoff.com">www.scratchoff.com</ext-link>); 800 cards were created in batches of 15 (three cards with each of the five randomisation arms per batch). Fixed size batches were selected instead of variable size batches to allow for batches to be fully used at each facility site to ensure relative balance of the five study arms within a site, and therefore balance of the sites between the five arms.</p>

We hypothesise that sites with fewer eligible clients will have lower levels of uptake across incentive values than sites with a greater proportion of eligible clients. This is hypothesised because sites with a lower proportion of eligible index cases have likely already benefitted from interventions to motivate those individuals who are ‘willing to test’ to ‘take action’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>), leaving a disproportionate number of index cases who are ‘unwilling to test,’ a population that is less susceptible to an FI intervention.</p>

The study team engaged in discussions with Kenyan paediatricians and other healthcare workers, Kenyan programme implementers and with Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics (Seattle Children’s Hospital) in the USA.

This slight delay occurred as we initially attempted to register both the pilot and trial phases of the study as two protocols under one record, but this was ultimately deemed infeasible and confusing, so the trial phase was registered as a separate record. A data monitoring committee will not be convened due to no planned interim analyses and minimal risk potential of the intervention.

It is important to assess whether this intervention is effective to promote timely uptake of paediatric ICT in sub-Saharan African settings where HIV-related morbidity and mortality remain high for undiagnosed children. This study is the first that we are aware of to test FI to improve uptake of ICT for children.</p>
              <p>The pilot study conducted by this team evaluated three levels of FI and saw high, but flat, uptake of testing across the study arms.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, the larger trial will evaluate a wider and lower range of FI, including a non-incentivised control arm. This five-arm RCT with a concurrent control arm will enable inference about the effect of FIs generally, and at various levels, to promote timely uptake of paediatric ICT.</p>
              <p>This study has faced several operational challenges to date. The Kenyan public health system has faced two large nationwide healthcare worker strikes (doctors’ strike from December 2016 to February 2017; nurses’ strike from May to November 2017), which limited the number of patients presenting for services. Additionally, there was a contested presidential election in August 2017 and a contested repeat election in October 2017, which produced widespread disruption of service provision. To overcome these challenges, the study increased the number of sites enrolling concurrently to achieve the desired sample size.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>The study sites represent one geographical region in Kenya, which may not be generalisable to other settings with lower HIV prevalence or different social dynamics, including HIV-related stigma. Clinics will be chosen to maximise the number of clients enrolled, and therefore will represent mostly high-volume sites; volume of clinic is not expected to influence uptake of testing, but any bias that might occur as a result of clinic selection would likely apply equally to all five randomisation arms, influencing absolute but not relative estimates of uptake. Kenya has had widespread ICT campaigns nationwide in the past 4 years, leaving relatively few individuals in care with undiagnosed children in their care; the impact of FI might be expected to differ in a population of HIV-infected caregivers who were ICT naïve. This trial does not include qualitative work to investigate the mechanism of FI. Finally, this intervention targets children aged 0–12 years for testing; however, many HIV-infected adults report having adolescent children (age ≥13) of unknown HIV status at home,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> who were not eligible for the current trial. Alternative strategies to target and provide acceptable and accessible HIV testing services to adolescents are critically needed.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In summary, this large multisite RCT will produce robust data on the effect and cost-effectiveness of varying levels of FI on uptake of paediatric ICT. Additionally, this paper describes design considerations and lessons learnt that can be broadly informative in the design of paediatric HIV trials as well as the design of FI trials.</p>
