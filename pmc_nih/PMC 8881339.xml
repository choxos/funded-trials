                <p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic has potentially increased the risk for adolescent depression. Even pre-pandemic, &lt;50% of youth with depression accessed care, highlighting needs for accessible interventions. Accordingly, this randomized-controlled trial (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04634903" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04634903</ext-link>) tested online single-session interventions (SSIs) during COVID-19 in adolescents with elevated depression symptoms (N=2,452, ages 13-16). Adolescents from all 50 U.S. states, recruited via social media, were randomized to 1 of 3 SSIs: a behavioural activation SSI, an SSI teaching that traits are malleable, or a supportive control. We tested each SSI’s effects on post-intervention (hopelessness, agency) and 3-month outcomes (depression, hopelessness, agency, generalized anxiety, COVID-related trauma, restrictive eating). Versus control, both active SSIs reduced 3-month depressive symptoms (ds=0.18); decreased post-intervention and 3-month hopelessness (ds=0.16-0.28); increased post-intervention agency (ds=0.15-0.31); and reduced 3-month restrictive eating (ds=0.12-17). Several differences between active SSIs emerged. Results confirm the utility of free-of-charge, online SSIs for high-symptom adolescents, even in the high-stress COVID-19 context.</p>

          <body>
            <p id="P3">In the early months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic swiftly and profoundly transformed the lives of youths nationwide. School closures affecting &gt;50 million students led to isolation and disruption of educational and social-emotional supports; simultaneously, families grappled with collective trauma and economic recession.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Together, these stressors might increase risk for adolescent depression—already the world’s leading cause of disability in young people.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Even before the pandemic, fewer than 50% of adolescents with depression accessed services;<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> among those who did, 40-65% have failed to respond.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Newfound financial strain may further preclude families’ capacity to afford treatment for their children. Thus, a generation of youth exposed to unprecedented psychosocial adversity is poised to fall through the cracks of the mental healthcare system. It is critical to identify effective, scalable strategies to reduce adolescent depression, both during and beyond COVID-19. Accordingly, in a nationwide randomized-controlled trial, we tested whether two self-guided, online, single-session interventions for adolescent depression—one teaching growth mindset of personality, the belief that personal traits and symptoms can change, and another teaching behavioral activation, the practice of managing one’s mood via engagement in valued, enjoyable activities—could reduce hopelessness, strengthen perceived agency, and mitigate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-related trauma in high-symptom youth, versus a supportive control.</p>
            <p id="P4">Well-powered trials of brief, focused, and rapidly-scalable interventions may overcome longstanding challenges to reducing adolescent depression—namely, the challenges of limited potency of existing treatments, and of low accessibility in predominant modes of care. Difficulties underlying limited treatment potency are thought to reflect depression’s heterogeneity.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Diagnostic criteria for depression place youths with 5 of 9 diverse symptoms (such as activity withdrawal, fatigue, and hopelessness) into a single category including &gt;1,400 possible symptom combinations.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This heterogeneity has spurred the creation of interventions that target widely-ranging difficulties, some of which may be unrelated to an individual’s needs—suggesting the utility of highly-focused, targeted interventions, rather than those characterized by “extreme comprehensiveness” (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Large-scale trials can rigorously and definitively gauge the promise of treatments that are designed for brevity, containing just one or two treatment elements rather than 10+ separate modules.</p>
            <p id="P5">Separately, large trials of brief interventions may reveal solutions to the low accessibility of many depression interventions. This low accessibility stems from the formats of predominant treatments, which span many weeks and are intended for delivery in brick-and-mortar clinics by highly-trained clinicians, creating major dissemination barriers.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Further, up to 59% of youths who do access mental health treatment drop out prematurely, compounding challenges posed by provider scarcity.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Testing brief treatments deliverable by flexible means is a key component of solving this access-to-care crisis.</p>
            <p id="P6">The need for accessible, brief, and targeted adolescent depression interventions has grown during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, research demonstrated that environmental stress, family instability, and social isolation can compound risk for youth depression—and each of these stressors has intensified since the pandemic’s emergence.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Thus, it is possible that risk for youth depression may increase in upcoming years, yet access to effective services remains scarce. It is as critical as ever to rigorously evaluate rapidly-scalable, low-cost strategies to reduce youth depression.</p>
            <p id="P7">Single-session interventions (SSIs) for youth depression may offer a sustainable path toward this goal. SSIs include core elements of evidence-based treatments, but their brevity makes them easier to disseminate to diverse settings.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a meta-analysis of 50 randomized trials, SSIs reduced diverse youth mental health difficulties (mean <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>=0.32), including self-administered SSIs (e.g., web-based SSIs; mean <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>=0.32).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> To date, systematic and narrative reviews have identified two types of SSIs have reduced adolescent depression symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The first is a growth mindset (GM-)SSI, an online program teaching that personal traits are malleable, which has prevented and reduced adolescent depression in multiple trials.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As examples, a GM-SSI led to 9-month depression symptom reductions in high-symptom adolescents, versus a supportive control (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>s=0.60, 0.32 per parent and youth reports).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In two school-based randomized trials, GM-SSIs reduced adolescent depressive symptoms versus active controls from 4-to-9-month follow-ups.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The second, a behavioral activation (BA)-SSI, promotes values-based activity engagement to elicit pleasure and accomplishment.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In randomized trials, therapist-guided BA-SSIs have reduced depressive symptoms in moderately-depressed adolescents across 2 weeks (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=1.61) and 1 month (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.57).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Further, in an open trial, high-symptom adolescents reported increases in perceived problem-solving ability and agency after completing an online, self-guided BA-SSI; they also endorsed the BA-SSI’s overall acceptability and helpfulness.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Notably, the GM- and BA-SSIs are the only two fully self-guided, single-session, digital interventions that have shown acceptability and (at minimum) short-term utility among U.S. adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms. However, their relative effectiveness has yet to be rigorously assessed, creating a need to understand their potentially-differential promise as widely-scaled supports for youth depression and related difficulties.</p>
            <p id="P8">During the pandemic, large trials of multiple online SSIs can elucidate their relative utility for depression, as well as for other mental health difficulties, such as COVID-19-related trauma or anxiety symptoms. Indeed, proximal targets addressed by both the BA and GM SSIs, such as hope,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> relate to depression and anxiety alike. Likewise, interventions designed to increase perceived agency<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and active problem-solving<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> have reduced both anxiety and depression in youth. Thus, SSIs targeting agency and hope, like the BA-SSI and GM-SSI, may help reduce depression symptom severity, anxiety symptoms, and trauma symptoms linked to COVID-19—and potentially other forms of psychopathology not directedly targeted by the SSIs (e.g., restrictive eating). SSIs circumvent many common treatment access barriers: they require no therapist, are completable from any location, and are &lt; 30 minutes in length, eliminating premature drop-out concerns. Moreover, online SSIs hold advantages even over other digital interventions, which tend to require sustained effort and repeated use, leading to low engagement and rapid dropout.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Thus, online SSIs offer a unique opportunity for rapid-large scale tests of accessible depression interventions while the pandemic remains underway.</p>
            <p id="P9">We therefore conducted a nationwide randomized-controlled trial comparing the utility of online SSIs for adolescent depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=2,452 youth with elevated depressive symptoms, ages 13-16). The trial had three primary aims. Aim 1 was to test whether online, self-guided SSIs improved proximal, clinically-relevant targets (e.g., hopelessness and perceived agency, which have predicted longer-term SSI response<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>) and 3-month depressive symptoms (primary outcome), relative to an active control. Aim 2 was to test whether the GM-SSI versus the BA-SSI—currently, the only two self-guided, digital SSIs that have shown high acceptability in youths experiencing depressive symptoms—proved more impactful in this context. Aim 3 was to test whether either SSI improved secondary, clinically-relevant outcomes (COVID-related trauma, hopelessness, agency, generalized anxiety) versus the control across 3 months. We also conducted post-hoc, exploratory analyses to test intervention impacts on difficulties not directly targeted by the SSIs (restrictive eating). Adolescents recruited from across the U.S. via social media were randomized to one of three self-guided SSIs: a BA-SSI, designed to address activity withdrawal and low agency; a GM-SSI, designed to target hopelessness; or a supportive control. We tested each SSI’s relative benefits, versus the control, across 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (November 2020-March 2021). Notably, the trial took place approximately 8 months after school closures and social distancing mandates were first imposed in the United States, but before the COVID-19 vaccine was publicly available. Thus, the trial took place at a time when pandemic-related conditions were still evolving and unpredictable in many U.S. regions, and also when some adolescents might have begun to adjust to lifestyle changes and norms.</p>

                <p id="P18">To test the robustness of our results, <bold>w</bold>e ran two sets of additional analyses using alternative approaches to handling missing data for all pre-registered analyses. Both of these were “completers-only” analyses; one used listwise deletion for participants lacking follow-up data, and the other used multiple imputation to estimate follow-up outcomes for all participants, but excluded participants who did not complete their assigned SSI. Code and results from these analyses are available on Open Science Framework (<ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/8mk6x/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/8mk6x/</ext-link>). Compared to the control SSI, overall effects of the GM-SSI and BA-SSI on depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, post-intervention and 3-month hopelessness, post-intervention and 3-month perceived agency; 3-month generalized anxiety symptoms) were generally unchanged using alternative missing data approaches. Only a few minor differences emerged from pre-registered imputation analyses, exclusively with respect to secondary outcomes.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P19">In a nationwide randomized trial, we tested whether two half-hour, self-administered single-session interventions (SSIs) teaching behavioral activation (BA-SSI) and growth mindsets of personality (GM-SSI), respectively, reduced hopelessness, improved perceived agency, and lessened symptoms of depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-related trauma in high-symptom adolescents. Compared a supportive control SSI, both active interventions led to significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms from baseline to 3-month follow-up (BA-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.18; GM-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.18). Additionally, both active interventions led to greater decreases in hopelessness at post-intervention (BA-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.26; GM-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.28) and follow-up (BA-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.17; GM-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.16), and increases in perceived agency at post-intervention (BA-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=−0.31; GM-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=−0.15) and follow-up (GM-SSI <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.17), relative to the control. Regarding differential intervention effects, the GM-SSI (but not the BA-SSI) reduced three-month generalized anxiety symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.10) and COVID-19-related trauma symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.10) relative to the control. The BA-SSI led to greater post-SSI increases in perceived agency than did the GM-SSI (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=.16), whereas the GM-SSI led to greater 3-month reductions in generalized anxiety symptoms than did the BA-SSI (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=.10). Furthermore, exploratory post-hoc analyses revealed that both the BA-SSI and the GM-SSI significantly reduced restrictive eating from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up, compared to the control. Sensitivity analyses using two alternative approaches to handling missing data yielded similar patterns of results, lending confidence to observed outcomes for pre-registered tests. Indeed, effect sizes observed for the BA-SSI and the GM-SSI’s effects on depressive symptoms were identical to meta-analytic estimates of single-session interventions’ effects on youth depressive symptoms (e.g., Schleider and colleagues (2017) identified a meta-analytic effect on depressive symptoms of <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>=0.18<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>).</p>
              <p id="P20">Both active SSIs yielded modest reductions, on average, in adolescent depressive symptoms. Effect sizes were small, reflecting mean 3-month reductions of 2.64 points on the CDI-Short Form. Nonetheless, for several reasons, results hold clinical and practical importance. First, before and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents experiencing depression have remained unlikely to access <italic toggle="yes">any</italic> mental health treatment—let alone evidence-based support—due to structural and logistical barriers. Many of these barriers, such as poverty, proximity to providers, and insurance status, are impossible to modify absent large-scale policy intervention. Thus, even modest overall clinical improvements produced by cost-free, 20-to-30-minute, self-guided interventions suggest their promise to enable efficient clinical benefits, which could be multiplied at the population level. Moving forward, research might focus less on how to strengthen the <italic toggle="yes">average</italic> magnitude of these SSIs’ impacts and more on identifying subsets of “best-responder” adolescents, guiding tailored dissemination based on individual odds of benefit.</p>
              <p id="P21">Second, this trial represents a confirmatory extension of prior work suggesting the promise of SSIs for adolescent mental health. The use of an active control (which itself produced significant within-group decreases in depression symptoms), three-month follow-up, large sample, and high reproducibility (due to pre-registration and open-access intervention materials, data, and analytic code) strengthen confidence in results. Indeed, effects of many SSIs fall to near-zero after multi-month follow-up periods, and the effects of most adolescent mental health treatments reduce substantially when tested against active (versus no-treatment) controls.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Further, the average number of participants in randomized trials of youth psychotherapies to date has been 68.69 participants, rendering many trials underpowered for robust effectiveness tests.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> This study is among the largest U.S.-based randomized-controlled trials of any psychosocial treatment for adolescent depression to date.</p>
              <p id="P22">Third, this study supports acceptability and effectiveness for brief, self-guided depression interventions among highly diverse adolescents. The sample included population-congruent representation of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American youth in the United States; participants included youths living in all 50 U.S. states; and 80% of participants identified as sexual minorities. Although sexual minority youths were arguably over-represented in this study, most youth psychotherapy trials routinely include samples that are &gt;90% White and seldom assess sexual orientation.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Thus, this sample’s diversity extends the youth mental health knowledge-base, filling gaps in our knowledge of the youth intervention literature that have long remained unaddressed.</p>
              <p id="P23">Fourth, positive effects on depressive symptoms are notable because (1) both active interventions yielded significant benefits, even in the high-stress context of a global pandemic; and (2) results address the need for more potent adolescent depression interventions. In fact, overall effect sizes across all trials of youth depression treatments have decreased from 1960 to the present.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The SSIs in this trial might help improve population-level youth depression symptoms and outcomes, if disseminated broadly.</p>
              <p id="P24">Both active SSIs yielded improvements in post-intervention hopelessness and perceived agency, although the BA-SSI increased agency more than the GM-SSI. These results align with evidence that many psychotherapy change-mechanisms may be more similar than different across programs, even when those programs are thought to target distinct mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Further, both SSIs are designed per a common set of components<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> including neuroscience-based psychoeducation, narratives from peers, and opportunities to provide advice to others. These shared elements may promote a common set of adaptive thinking styles—perhaps reflected by the SSIs’ equivalent impacts on hopelessness. By contrast, the BA-SSI’s larger impacts on short-term perceived agency may reflect its unique elements, such as creating a personalized action plan for engaging in valued activities. Creating this plan may strengthen adolescents’ confidence in their ability to solve future mood-related problems, at least in the short-term. Indeed, items included in this study’s assessment of agency (e.g., “There are lots of ways around problems I am facing right now”) map more directly onto the BA-SSI than the GM-SSI.</p>
              <p id="P25">Notably, per pre-registered analyses, the GM-SSI reduced 3-month generalized anxiety and COVID-19-related trauma versus the control, but the BA-SSI did not. This pattern fits with intended content specificity (or lack thereof) of each SSI. The BA-SSI provides psychoeducation specific to depression and low mood, whereas the GM-SSI is intentionally not diagnosis-specific; its message is that everyone has potential for change across multiple domains, including abilities to cope with anxiety <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> depression. Prior studies testing the GM-SSI in high-symptom adolescents have also found program benefits for both depression and anxiety symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Future work may test the prospect of matching youth to the BA- or GM-SSI based on individual clinical needs and the strengths of each intervention.</p>
              <p id="P26">Post-hoc exploratory analyses revealed that both the GM-SSI and the BA-SSI significantly reduced restrictive eating behaviors at 3-month follow-up, relative to the control. This result was unanticipated but aligned with research suggesting close ties between mood problems and disordered eating,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> with interventions targeting restrictive eating often yielding improvements in mood.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> However, few youth depression-focused intervention trials have evaluated restrictive eating as a secondary outcome. Present results support the utility of including such outcomes in depression treatment studies, including trials of SSIs. Given the dearth of treatment resources available to youths experiencing eating disorder symptoms<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and the inherent accessibility of the interventions in this trial, the potential for SSIs to mitigate restrictive eating directly merits future study.</p>
              <p id="P27">How might these SSIs fit into broader youth mental healthcare ecosystems? In considering possibilities, it is crucial to note that SSIs are not panaceas. Overall effects were modest, some adolescents will still require longer-term services, and policy changes remain needed to improve youth access to higher-intensity treatments in addition to brief, immediately-accessible resources. Nonetheless, the SSIs in this trial may offer rapidly-scalable, evidence-based support for all youths with depressive symptoms—many of whom would otherwise access no support at all. Given the brevity and flexibility of these programs, they may be offered within diverse youth care systems (e.g., primary care, emergency rooms, and schools), complementing existing support structures while retaining potential to benefit youths unable to access further care.</p>
              <p id="P28">A notable feature of this study is adolescents’ ability to “self-refer” into SSIs. In many U.S. states, adolescents aged ≥12 may consent, without a parent/guardian, to mental and physical healthcare. These laws were enacted to increase adolescents’ likelihood of seeking and obtaining care. For myriad reasons, allowing youth participation in minimal-risk online SSIs without requiring parental consent may be a critical path toward increasing youth treatment access and use. This study suggests that adolescents can safely participate in online SSIs, and that SSIs may reduce both short- and longer-term mental health difficulties. Requiring parent/guardian approval for adolescents to try these online activities could prevent thousands of youth from receiving minimal-risk, free, evidence-based support.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Unfortunately, requiring parent permission may pose disproportionate barriers for sexual minority, gender minority, and racial/ethnic minority youth, for whom concerns about caregiver stigma or dismissal (linked to rejection of one’s identity, beliefs about mental health treatment-seeking, or both) often prevent youth from disclosing treatment needs to family.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Although not all states have yet adopted these guidelines, SSIs tested here pose minimal risk to safety and may offer a common-sense path to increasing access to mental health support among adolescents.</p>
              <p id="P29">Some study limitations warrant consideration and suggest directions for future work. First, eligibility screening relied on adolescents’ interest in completing an online study and required internet access. Some adolescents may require support from adults to access mental health treatment, some may lack Internet access, others may not have the time for this type of study, and other still might speak languages other than English (the SSIs were not available in other languages at the time of this trial). Thus, findings may not apply uniformly across adolescents. However, most prior trials of psychosocial interventions for adolescents have required parent referral and consent; by eliminating this barrier, this study may have included adolescents under-represented in prior clinical trials, such as adolescents who are not open with caregivers about mental health difficulties.</p>
              <p id="P30">Second, attrition at follow-up was ~40%. Missing data were addressed via a rigorous approach that has shown utility with higher missing data rates than observed here, and sensitivity analyses using alternative data approaches yielded similar patterns of results<sup>.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although results may have been influenced by these missing data, this rate is comparable to those observed in previous randomized trials of youth depression interventions (e.g. The Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Future investigations might formally compare methods for increasing participant retention across longer-term study periods.</p>
              <p id="P31">Third, some groups of youth were potentially over-represented in our sample (e.g., sexual minority youth), whereas others were underrepresented (e.g., boys). These sample characteristics are unlikely to reflect our Instagram-based recruitment approach, as 72% of teens ages 13-17 actively use Instagram, nearly half of whom are boys.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Thus, our sample may reflect youths most readily drawn to taking part in online self-help activities. Focus group-based and mixed-methods research, geared toward gathering youth feedback and guidance, may forward efforts to engage adolescent boys in digital, mental health-focused SSIs.</p>
              <p id="P32">Fourth, although SSI did not predict attrition at 3-month follow-up, youths randomized to the BA-SSI were more likely than those in the GM-SSI and control conditions to complete their assigned intervention (although completion rates were very high across conditions, &gt;80%, compared to the majority of self-guided digital mental health programs<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>). It is possible that the greater interactivity of the BA-SSI (e.g., creation of an action plan) contributed to this higher completion rate, but tests of engagement-enhancing components of online SSIs remains a key direction for future work.</p>
              <p id="P33">Lastly, we did not formally assess youths’ use of other mental health supports during the study period. Notably, SSIs may function best as complements to (rather than replacements for) other forms of care. Indeed, a prior randomized trial demonstrated no effect of external mental health treatment (e.g., psychotherapy and/or medication) on response to the GM-SSI, versus a placebo control, across a 9-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Future trials might collect data to capture the role of SSIs in the context of youths’ full range of formal and informal mental health supports.</p>
              <p id="P34">In sum, results suggest that free-of-charge, 20-to-30 minute online interventions can reduce depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and anxiety and strengthen perceived agency across three-months in high-symptom adolescents, even in the context of a global pandemic. Although differences across the active interventions emerged, these brief supports could be made freely available for adolescents to complete anytime, from any location, regardless of traditional barriers to mental health care.</p>

After all data collection was complete, the researchers learned each youth’s condition assignment, and both active interventions were offered to all participants. Additionally, participants received a resource list of hotlines, textlines, and online psycho-educational resources to facilitate engagement with additional mental health supports, if desired.

We also included a handful of additional, exploratory secondary outcomes, as noted in our <ext-link xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> registration. These were: 3-month restrictive eating; presence of lifetime suicidal ideation; 3-month approach-based coping; and post-intervention implicit theory of personality. Because no analyses were pre-registered regarding these outcomes, results of post-hoc analyses testing intervention effects on these variables are detailed in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 8</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">11</xref>. Additionally, we include results for one of these variables (restrictive eating) in the main text due to unanticipated, significant intervention effects revealed in post-hoc analyses. Lastly, also in the supplemental materials (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 12</xref>), we list all measures collected as part of the trial, defined as primary, secondary, or ‘other’, as well as the time-points at which they were administered to participants (including baseline-only, exploratory “other” measures for which no analyses were pre-registered and no descriptive statistics are reported in this manuscript).</p>
                <p id="P43">Adolescent depressive symptoms (primary outcome). Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) 2 - short form (CDI-SF), a reliable, valid measure of youth depression severity.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Twelve items are scored from 0-2, with higher summed scores reflecting greater overall depression symptom severity. Changes in CDI-SF scores from pre-SSI to three-month follow-up was the primary study outcome. Alphas were 0.77 and 0.85 at baseline and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="P44">Adolescent anxiety symptoms. Generalized anxiety symptom severity was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), which includes 7 items asking respondents how often, during the last 2 weeks, they were bothered by various anxiety symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Items are rated on a 0-3 scale and averaged to yield an overall score. Changes in GAD-7 scores from pre-SSI to follow-up was a secondary outcome. Alphas were 0.89 and 0.90 at baseline and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="P45">COVID-19-related Trauma Symptoms. Child Trauma Screen—Reaction Scale (CTS-RS) was administered at pre-SSI and 3-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> The CTS-RS is a reliable, valid self-report measure of traumatic stress symptom severity, including event-related somatic symptoms, intrusive memories, avoidance, sleep problems, and mood and behavioral changes. Here, instructions read: “For many, the COVID-19 (or ‘coronavirus’) pandemic has been scary or very upsetting. Sometimes, events that are scary or upsetting can affect how people think, feel, and act. The next questions ask how you have been feeling and thinking recently.” Youth rated the frequency of 6 types of traumatic stress symptoms, per past-month frequency, based on a 0-3 scale; ratings were averaged to yield an overall severity score. Changes in CTS-RS scores from pre-SSI to follow-up was a secondary outcome. Alpha was 0.73 at both baseline and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="P46">Perceived Agency. The “agency” subscale of the State Hope Scale (SHS) is a reliable, valid 3-item self-report measure of youth’ perceived ability to generate plans and work towards one’s goals.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Pre- and post-intervention, youths rated their agreement with 3 statements reflecting how they felt about themselves “right now” on an 8-point scale. Alphas were 0.82, 0.83, and 0.80 at pre-SSI, post-SSI, and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="P47">Hopelessness. The Beck Hopelessness Scale-4 (BHS-4) is a reliable, shortened version of the 20-item scale used to measure hopelessness in youth.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>-<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Pre- and post-intervention and at follow-up, participants rated their agreement with 4 statements reflecting their sense of hopelessness “right now, in this moment” on a 0-3 Likert scale. Alphas were 0.84, 0.87, and 0.88 at pre-SSI, post-SSI, and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="P48">Intervention Acceptability. The Program Feedback Scale (PFS) asks youth to rate agreement with 7 statements indicating perceived acceptability of an SSI (e.g. “I enjoyed the program”) on a 5-point Likert scale (1=“really disagree”; 5=“totally agree”).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> We pre-registered that scores of ≥3.5/5 on any given PFS item would reflect an “acceptable” rating on that item.</p>
                <p id="P49">Restrictive (disordered) Eating. Restrictive eating behaviors were measured at pre-intervention and 3-month follow-up using The Dietary Restriction Screener (DRS-2).<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The DRS-2 is a 2-item measure evaluating restrictive eating behaviors. The 2 items ask participants whether or not they have engaged in restrictive eating in the past year or in the past 3 months (0=no; 1=yes). The DRS-2 was administered at pre-SSI and 3-month follow-up. Given the timing of the assessments in this study, we examined intervention effects on the presence of past-month restrictive eating only.

SSI condition was a categorical predictor in these models, and parallel linear regressions were conducted to assess intervention effects on secondary and other exploratory study outcomes. We imputed participant-level missing data using the expectation-maximization and bootstrapping algorithm implemented with Amelia II in R,<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> allowing more conservative intent-to-treat analyses than other approaches (e.g., listwise deletion; last-observation carried-forward). We imputed as many datasets as there were percent of missing data for an outcome, rounding to the next-highest percentage (e.g., If 5.4% of data was missing on an outcome, we created 6 imputed datasets), allowing us to retain high power despite missing data. Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> and 95% confidence intervals for analyses were calculated using <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-values for treatment effects obtained from analyses with the MOTE package in R.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> The false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to identify potential false-positive results.<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Results from pre-registered tests described above were considered significant if FDR-corrected <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.05, and all tests were two-tailed.
