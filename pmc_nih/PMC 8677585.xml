                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created unique stressors for caregivers of persons with dementia living in long-term care (LTC) facilities. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the challenges associated with caring for a relative with dementia in LTC during the pandemic, as well as resources, strategies, and practices caregivers found helpful in coping with COVID-19.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>This study was conducted within the context of an ongoing randomized controlled trial of a psychosocial intervention to support caregivers. Open-ended survey responses (n = 125) and semistructured interviews with a subset of the sample (n = 20) collected between June 2020 and June 2021 explored caregivers' experiences during COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Setting and Participants</title>
                  <p>Participants included 125 family caregivers of persons with dementia living in residential LTC.</p>

                  <p>Thematic analysis was used to identify themes capturing caregivers' experiences.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In addition to concerns about COVID-19 infection, participants reported key challenges such as the difficulty of maintaining contact with relatives because of visiting restrictions, lack of information about relatives' health and well-being, worries about overburdened LTC staff, impossibility of returning relatives home from the LTC facility, and fears about relatives dying alone. Participants also identified resources, strategies, and practices that they perceived as helpful, including effective infection prevention within the LTC facility, good communication with LTC staff, and creative strategies for connecting with their relatives.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
                  <p>This qualitative analysis informs recommendations for practice within LTC facilities, as well as supports that may help caregivers manage stressful situations in the context of COVID-19. Vaccination and testing protocols should be implemented to maximize family caregivers' opportunities for in-person contact with relatives in LTC, as alternative visiting modalities were often unsatisfactory or unfeasible. Informing caregivers regularly about individual residents' needs and status is crucial. Supports for bereaved caregivers should address complicated grief and feelings of loss.</p>

</p>
            <p id="p0015">Though the effects of COVID-19 among LTC residents have received substantial attention, the experiences of family caregivers of LTC residents with dementia have not been sufficiently examined up to this point. Although not providing round-the-clock care, caregivers continue to play a critical role after the transition to LTC.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> They generally remain actively involved as coordinators and advocates for their relative's care, and regularly provide social interaction and assistance with activities such as feeding, bathing, and cleaning.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption and added stress for caregivers, as their relatives are at greater risk of infection and mortality and opportunities to interact with residents have been limited.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Family caregivers of LTC residents also face unprecedented end-of-life scenarios and bereavement without usual supports.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Anecdotal evidence has revealed multifaceted challenges for caregivers of LTC residents with dementia at this time.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Though some literature has documented effects of COVID-19 on dementia caregivers, most research has focused on caregiving in community contexts, not LTC.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Good-quality LTC care relies on a partnership between families and LTC facilities, and those partnerships have been strained and in some cases broken during the pandemic. Understanding the perspectives of LTC caregivers is critical for formulating LTC policy as the pandemic continues.</p>
            <p id="p0020">Most literature on caregiving for a relative with dementia in LTC during COVID-19 is limited to commentaries from experts, rather than empirical work with caregivers.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>

<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Their recommendations provide helpful guidance, but it is crucial to systematically incorporate the perspectives of caregivers themselves into recommendations for LTC policy and procedures during COVID-19. Caregivers may disagree with experts about what practices are most beneficial to their relatives, and through firsthand experience, may identify problems with existing protocols that experts may not be aware of. The need to acknowledge family caregivers and include them as active partners in care planning has long been recognized as a critical unmet need in dementia care.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Now more than ever, incorporating family caregivers' perspectives into research and practice is necessary to optimize care for the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
            <p id="p0025">To address this important gap in the literature, we investigated caregivers' perspectives on the challenges they have experienced while assisting a relative with dementia in LTC during COVID-19, and the supports they have found helpful. Our analysis focused on 2 key questions:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0030">What challenges did caregivers of a relative with dementia living in LTC experience during the COVID-19 pandemic?</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0035">What resources, strategies, and practices did caregivers perceive as helpful for addressing these challenges?</p></list-item></list>

                <p id="p0050">Open-ended survey questions addressed caregivers' satisfaction with how their LTC facility handled COVID-19, changes in communication with their relatives, discussions with their relatives on advance care planning and goals of care, and general thoughts on how COVID-19 has affected their relatives and their caregiving experience. These open-ended survey items were administered beginning in June 2020 and ending in August 2021.</p>
                <p id="p0055">A subset of 20 participants, a sufficient sample size for interviewing,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> was selected for in-depth semistructured interviews. Participants were purposively selected to capture a diverse range of experiences and contexts relevant to the pandemic (eg, large and small LTC facilities; care recipients who were infected with COVID-19 and those who were not; high and low levels of satisfaction with the facility's response). Interviews addressed how LTC facilities handled the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in caregiving routines, and resources that caregivers found helpful. Interview questions were developed based on emerging research and ongoing discussions in LTC communities about COVID-19 in spring 2020.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>

The group reconvened to compare interpretations and refine the coding framework. Each author then coded a subset of the qualitative data in NVivo 12 using the final code framework (step 3). Coded data were reviewed holistically to identify broader themes (step 4), which were further refined and named (step 5). The codes were then applied to all available data. Each interview transcript was double-coded, and discrepancies were resolved via group discussion. A portion of the open-ended survey responses (20%) were coded twice in order to evaluate interrater reliability; average Kappa across categories was 0.84 and average percentage agreement was 96%.

                  <title>Visiting restrictions</title>
                  <p id="p0070">Caregivers frequently discussed difficulty with visiting restrictions (79% of surveys, 100% of interviews). They missed the sense of closeness that came from face-to-face visits and physical contact: “You had moments that seemed like you could connect on some level with the simple things, like walks, activities, meals and that is so limited now. We were able to hug and hold hands and can't do that now” (ID214a, daughter-in-law, age 64 years).</p>
                  <p id="p0075">Furthermore, caregivers noted that alternative modalities such as video and window visits were inadequate substitutes. Staff were often unable to assist with arranging calls owing to time constraints. Residents had difficulty using new technology or did not understand the need to avoid in-person contact, and failed attempts to communicate led to frustration or helplessness:<disp-quote><p>With the “remote” visits, I felt very distant and that my mother probably didn't really know I was there . . . I have to admit, I did window visits and [Z]oom visits less and less since it was depressing and since I wasn't sure it had any effect.(ID223, daughter, age 54 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p id="p0080">Even after reopening, many caregivers felt frustrated by restrictions that limited their ability to interact with their relative. Social distancing measures still interfered with closeness and warmth, and scheduling constraints presented barriers to visiting:<disp-quote><p>Due to my full time work schedule and my relative’s decline in cognition during the afternoon and evening, I feel much of the scheduling is working against me. I am restricted by the schedule only allowing a limited number of visitors in each area of the nursing facility.</p><attrib>(ID43, daughter, age 49 years)</attrib></disp-quote>

Similarly, residents had difficulty adapting to changes in their typical daily routines as a result of COVID-19:<disp-quote><p>The entire pattern changed at the facility. . . .

Such concerns included fear that relatives might become infected, fear that staff may introduce COVID to the facility by violating safety protocols or avoiding vaccines, and fear about inadvertently exposing residents to infection themselves. As one participant stated, “It was just constant, like, ‘I hope he doesn't get it. I hope he doesn't get it. I hope he doesn't get it.' You know, ‘Please let him be safe!'

Without opportunities to observe, caregivers found themselves wishing for detailed, day-to-day information on their relative's status. As one participant expressed, “I have missed being able to visit my husband and check on how he is doing. I haven't been able to monitor his cleanliness and the cleanliness of his room, or check on what he needs to have me bring him” (ID79, wife, age 81 years).</p>

For instance, one caregiver noted that several residents' cognitive status seemed to have worsened substantially:<disp-quote><p>I noticed that my mom really had sort of declined cognitively from where she was before . . . a lot of [residents] had a severe decline, and it's hard to tease out whether it's the dementia itself or if it was the lack of stimulation from visitors.</p><attrib>(ID164, daughter, age 65 years)</attrib></disp-quote>

These strains on staff were perceived as negatively affecting residents as well. As one participant stated:<disp-quote><p>Staff was short. At one time, 15 staff members were out with COVID.

Participants described feeling that they had lost precious time with their care recipient. One caregiver noted that the pandemic “just robbed me of so much time with her, and I don't know how the end would've played out.

Caregivers often felt frustrated that others could visit their relatives at other LTC facilities, when they were unable to do so:<disp-quote><p>I see how differently different places have handled visits or the lack thereof, and it's hard not to be jealous sometimes . . . if she had lived at [other nearby LTC facility], they have a completely different category of caregivers now . . . that can come in for up to three hours at a time.</p><attrib>(ID213, daughter, age 54 years)</attrib></disp-quote>

              <p id="p0165">This study represents an important contribution to understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on family caregivers of LTC residents with dementia. The findings emphasize the need to better integrate family members’ perspectives and input into formal care delivery in LTC. COVID-19 laid bare how family caregivers are simply not acknowledged as key facets of LTC delivery in residential settings, as was evident in participants' discussions of disrupted care routines, lack of information and opportunities to interact, and residents' health deteriorating as a result.</p>
              <p id="p0170">A significant contribution of the current study is that families themselves emphasize a number of potential recommendations that could bridge this chasm. Notably, the resources, strategies, and practices that caregivers identified were aligned with the challenges they reported. The areas of (1) visitation and communication with care recipients, (2) protection from COVID-19 infection, and (3) communication and support from LTC staff emerged as underlying dimensions across our themes. Caregivers' experiences ranged on a spectrum across these dimensions, with many reporting significant challenges in these areas, and a smaller set reporting resources, strategies, and practices that helped them cope with such challenges.</p>
              <p id="p0175">Current advice from clinicians and experts did not always align with caregivers' recommendations. For example, several published commentaries have emphasized alternative visiting modalities,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>

Our findings concur with expert advice to keep families informed about LTC residents' care.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> LTCs should communicate at least weekly about their processes regarding resident care and visitations by families.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Importantly, LTCs should also have consistent individual communication with families discussing their relative's health status and needs to the greatest extent possible. We encourage facilities to strive to provide regular, individualized communication, recognizing that such communication during pandemic conditions may be difficult in many cases and impracticable in some. Nonetheless, given families’ emphasis on the importance of regular, personalized communication, this would benefit residents and families presently and post-pandemic.</p>
              <p id="p0185">These findings also reinforce expert commentaries highlighting the challenges of bereavement during COVID-19,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> which were mentioned by a minority of participants (13% in surveys), but with intense emotionality among those who were affected. Pandemic conditions may exacerbate families' perceptions of neglect and lack of respect for residents at the end of life, factors that strongly influence satisfaction with end-of-life care.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> The loss of a relative under conditions of isolation and quarantine can contribute to severe and prolonged grief.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>

              <p id="p0190">Most participants were highly educated, affluent, and White; therefore the concerns reported here may not reflect the perspectives of caregivers with diverse backgrounds. Indeed, recent research suggests that the effects of COVID-19 are more severe for low-income caregivers.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Further research on the experiences of diverse caregivers is critically needed.</p>

              <title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
              <p id="p0195">The challenges and strategies reported by participants may inform improved support for caregivers throughout the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis, and in the LTC context more broadly. The discrepancies we found between caregivers' and experts' perspectives highlight the need to create more robust, family-centered models of LTC where caregivers are effectively integrated into policy development and care. Such models would help avoid adverse consequences not only in the current crisis but also beyond the pandemic when caregivers' perspectives are potentially neglected in LTC.</p>
