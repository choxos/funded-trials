                <p id="Par1">Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a rare, disabling skeletal disease for which there are no established treatments. Growing evidence supports inhibiting the osteoclastogenic factor receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand (RANKL) as a potential treatment strategy. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying RANKL inhibition in FD tissue and its likely indirect effects on osteoprogenitors by evaluating human FD tissue pre- and post-treatment in a phase 2 clinical trial of denosumab (NCT03571191) and in murine in vivo and ex vivo preclinical models. Histological analysis of human and mouse tissue demonstrated increased osteogenic maturation, reduced cellularity, and reduced expression of the pathogenic GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variant in FD lesions after RANKL inhibition. RNA sequencing of human and mouse tissue supported these findings. The interaction between osteoclasts and mutant osteoprogenitors was further assessed in an ex vivo lesion model, which indicated that the proliferation of abnormal FD osteoprogenitors was dependent on osteoclasts. The results from this study demonstrated that, in addition to its expected antiosteoclastic effect, denosumab reduces FD lesion activity by decreasing FD cell proliferation and increasing osteogenic maturation, leading to increased bone formation within lesions. These findings highlight the unappreciated role of cellular crosstalk between osteoclasts and preosteoblasts/osteoblasts as a driver of FD pathology and demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of denosumab in the treatment of bone disease.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a rare mosaic disorder that can lead to fracture, pain, and physical disability. Somatic gain-of-function GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variants are acquired during embryogenesis, altering skeletal stem cell differentiation and leading to expansile lesions of highly proliferative, partially mineralized fibro-osseus tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> In the craniofacial skeleton, FD lesion expansion causes facial asymmetry and functional deficits, such as vision and hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Lesions in weight-bearing bones can fracture and deform, leading to pain and ambulation impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> There are no approved treatments, and there is a critical need for targeted therapies.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The development of effective treatments for FD has been hindered by knowledge gaps in the interplay between lesional cell populations. Abnormal osteogenic cells harboring pathogenic GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variants constitute the dominant lineage and lead to signature histopathological features, including fibrosis, altered bone formation, and loss of hematopoietic/fatty marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Osteoclasts are prominent in FD tissue; however, their role in FD pathogenesis is unknown. Growing evidence suggests that targeting receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a cytokine that promotes osteoclastogenesis, is a promising potential treatment strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> RANKL released by osteoprogenitors and other cell types binds to RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursors and elicits osteoclastogenesis, and these committed cells fuse and form mature, multinucleated active osteoclasts that seal the exposed mineralized matrix and form a resorption pit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Our group recently reported results from a phase 2 trial of denosumab, a RANKL monoclonal antibody, in adults with FD, demonstrating potent inhibitory effects on FD lesions as measured by circulating bone turnover markers and <sup>18</sup>F-NaF in PET/CT lesional activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> This clinical improvement was associated with a reduction in the proliferation of FD osteoprogenitors and increased mineral formation within the lesions. Recent work in murine models also supports the notion that RANKL inhibition enhances lesional mineralization and limits its expansion, in part through attenuation of osteoclast resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Understanding the effects of RANKL inhibition on FD cellular behavior and lesion composition therefore has the potential to inform understanding of FD and its management and the interplay between osteoclastic and osteoblastic lineages in health and disease. Here, we characterized the effects of RANKL inhibition in human FD tissue and in preclinical models to define the cellular effects on FD osteoprogenitors.</p>

                <p id="Par5">We assessed the abundance of GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C/H</sup>-expressing cells in FD tissue before and after treatment with denosumab via the novel technique Basescopeâ¢ using biopsies from a phase 2 clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> First, in collaboration with ACD, we used cultured bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from FD patients harboring the GNAS p.R201C and p.R201H variants and from healthy wild-type (WT) volunteers to select, optimize and validate probes specific for the WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub>, GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> and GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201H</sup> mRNAs (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Then, we evaluated the expression of these variants in FD tissue before and after denosumab treatment using a dual-color duplex system in which WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub> mRNA molecules are labeled with green dots and GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> or GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201H</sup> mRNA molecules are labeled with red dots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As positive controls, we used mRNA probes to detect both weakly and abundantly expressed housekeeping genes (<italic>POLR2A</italic> and <italic>PPIB,</italic> respectively; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), and a probe detecting the bacterial gene <italic>dapB</italic> was used as a negative stain control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The number of cells expressing GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> or GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201H</sup> mRNA in each section was counted as the number of nuclei within the immediate region of red dots divided by the number of cells expressing only WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub> mRNA,- considered as nuclei within the immediate region of green dots but not red dots. Treatment with denosumab reduced the relative frequency of GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> - or GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201H</sup>-mRNA-expressing cells by 25% in all patients in the present study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Denosumab treatment decreased GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C/H</sup> mRNA expression in human FD tissue. <bold>a</bold> Representative images of GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> (red dots, right image) and GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201H</sup> (red dots, left image) mRNA staining before and after denosumab treatment compared to that of WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub>. <bold>b</bold> Positive control mRNA staining of POLR2A (red dots, low expression) and PPIB (green dots, high expression) in the matching field of sections consecutive to those in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>c</bold> Negative control mRNA staining of the bacterial gene dapB in the matching field of sections consecutive to <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>. <bold>d</bold> Ratio of cells expressing GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C/H</sup> mRNA with respect to cells expressing only WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub> mRNA in each FD biopsy before and after denosumab treatment, calculated as the number of nuclei in the immediacy of red dots (GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C/H</sup> mRNA) with or without the presence of green dots (WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub> mRNA) divided by the number of nuclei in the immediate area of only green dots (WT GÎ±<sub>s</sub> mRNA)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41413_2023_311_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e474"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par6">FD tissue cellularity was assessed via H&amp;E staining of human biopsies before and after denosumab treatment, and a lower FD cell density was observed in all patients after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), consistent with a previously reported decrease in proliferation markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> To evaluate the impact of osteoclast ablation, we assessed TRAP enzymatic activity and performed RANK immunodetection.

                <p id="Par7">To overcome the replicability limitations of the study of human biopsies and expand our observations of RANKL inhibition in FD, we modeled the treatment course using an inducible FD mouse model in which the human transgene GÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> is expressed in the appendicular skeleton while the mice are given doxycycline. This model has proven to show highly reproducible mosaic-like and site-specific FD lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

Four weeks after FD induction, the mice developed lesions in their appendicular skeleton, and Î±RANKL or isotype control antibodies were administered for four additional weeks. Mice were euthanized on Day 56, two days after the last injection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Disease progression analysis revealed a reduction in the Î±RANKL-treated mice compared to the IgG2A-treated controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The bone turnover markers Trap5b and P1NP increased above baseline levels one week after disease induction and decreased after Î±RANKL treatment, remaining lower than baseline levels from weeks one to three after treatment started (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Î±RANKL treatment decreased the disease burden in mice with FD and increased lesional mineralization. <bold>a</bold>â<bold>c</bold> Longitudinal data showing the experimental scheme, longitudinal disease progression and effect of Î±RANKL therapy in mice with FD. <bold>a</bold> An X-ray-based skeletal disease burden tool was developed to assess disease activity in mice.

                <p id="Par8">As FD lesions progress in mice, bone is first resorbed (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3c, d</xref>) and then gradually replaced by low-density fibro-osseous tissue, which also invades the soft tissue marrow space (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3e, f</xref>, middle panel in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), leading to an overall decrease in bone mineral density (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). To investigate this process in more detail, we plotted the ÂµCT voxel density distribution of FD tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) within a volume of interest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, dotted lines). In these distributions, we identified tree shoulders corresponding to soft tissue (&lt;350âmg HA/cc), partially mineralized tissue (350â600âmg HA/cc) and mineralized tissue (&gt;600âmg HA/cc) and calculated their relative volumes within the volume of interest (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Untreated FD tissue showed no changes in soft tissue content but developed an almost 4-fold increase in partially mineralized tissue, with a corresponding decrease in mineralized tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, g</xref>). In lesions from animals treated with Î±RANKL, these changes were reversed, as the average BMD and content of partially mineralized tissue were similar to those of normal bone. Interestingly, the soft and ossified tissue contents were lower and greater, respectively, in these mice than in WT mice, revealing an overall increase in bone content at the expense of the intramedullary marrow space (observable in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, left image).</p>

Consistent with the findings of previous reports in human tissue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> analysis of demineralized H&amp;E sections of murine FD lesions revealed increased bone matrix content and decreased cellularity as a result of RANKL inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which was associated with a decreased prevalence of Mcm2<sup>+</sup> proliferating fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

                <p id="Par10">To identify novel genes involved in FD pathogenesis and the effects of Î±RANKL therapy, we performed mRNA sequencing of human and mouse FD tissues. Although the transcriptomic principal component analysis (PCA) of human FD tissue showed limited segregation between baseline and post-denosumab biopsies in the PCA space, as shown by the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), significant changes in 1â296 genes were found (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Transcripts from Î±RANKL-treated murine FD tissue were better segregated from control FD tissue receiving the isotype IgG2A antibody and overlapped with those from unaffected murine bone, indicating a normalizing effect on the bone tissue expression profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This change reflected a significant difference in the expression of 3â324 genes between FD control tissue and site-matched unaffected tissue and 2â596 genes between Î±RANKL-treated FD tissue and FD control tissue but only 65 genes between Î±RANKL-treated FD tissue and unaffected tissue (Tables <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>â<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S6</xref>).

                <p id="Par11">By filtering the 276 (out of the 3â324) genes with Â±4-fold differential expression in murine FD tissue, we were able to define an FD tissue transcriptomic signature. Of these, 202 genes had an identified human ortholog (Tables <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Of the genes identified in this FD genetic signature, 36 were significantly modulated in human FD biopsies following denosumab treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The expression of most of these genes was opposite to that observed in the comparison between IgG-treated FD and wild-type mice. Changes in 34/36 of these genes were detected in Î±RANKL-treated mice, which exhibited similar expression patterns.</p>
                <p id="Par12">FD transcriptomes were investigated using the publicly available âGene Ontology: Biological Processâ genetic expression dataset. Unsupervised clustering by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) demonstrated strong segregation of human and mouse samples according to treatment status and strong associations with signatures related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>). Similarly, a number of genes related to osteoclast differentiation and activity were strongly downregulated upon RANKL inhibition in mice and human FD (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5a, b</xref>). Further analysis of representative osteogenic differentiation markers revealed negative changes in early/mid-differentiation markers (<italic>RUNX2, SP7</italic>, and <italic>ALPL</italic>) but strong increases in <italic>SOST</italic> and <italic>BGLAP</italic> (osteocalcin) in human samples and <italic>Sost</italic> in mouse samples, supporting the increase in the amount and maturation of FD lesional bone observed after Î±RANKL treatment (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5c, d</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the expression of well-known osteoclast-osteoprogenitor crosstalk genes in these datasets, most of which were upregulated in FD tissue compared to WT bone (Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The expression of most of the genes encoding factors released by osteoprogenitors and that act on osteoclast progenitors did not change after Î±RANKL treatment, except for <italic>SEMA3A</italic> and <italic>TNFSF11</italic> (which encode RANKL) in human tissue, which were significantly decreased by denosumab administration (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5e, f</xref>).

                <p id="Par15">RANK-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been proposed to constitute a major mechanism by which osteoclasts control osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation to modulate bone formation after bone resorption in a process known as remodeling coupling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> In our study, following the formation of osteoclasts, abundant EVs were readily detected in the media, as confirmed by the expression of the EV marker TGS101 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). These EVs contained RANK, indicating an increase in this osteoclast-osteoprogenitor EV-mediated coupling mechanism upon FD induction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>). Under these conditions, an increase in the DNA content of single cells from these cultures was observed, as measured by BrdU incorporation, supporting the increase in BMSC proliferation observed in human and murine FD tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). Moreover, the increase in BrdU incorporation was completely blocked by RANKL inhibition. To assess whether the increase in cell proliferation observed was due to elevated BMSC/osteoprogenitor proliferation, we assessed our cultures via immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that Runx2<sup>+</sup> osteoprogenitors exhibited elevated Ki67<sup>+</sup> expression (a marker of cell proliferation) and a gross increase in cellularity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, d</xref>). RANKL inhibition via Î±RANKL in FD cultures normalized the increase in the levels of some of the osteoprogenitor-released osteoclastogenic factors in the media (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6aâc</xref>), and multinucleated osteoclasts were no longer observable or active (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e-g</xref>).

              <p id="Par16">In this study, RANKL inhibition induced marked effects on FD osteoprogenitors beyond its expected antiresorptive action, demonstrating the importance of osteoclast activation and perturbed coupling as key drivers of FD pathogenesis. These results support a model in which inhibition of RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis promotes lesional bone formation by inhibiting the proliferation of FD osteoprogenitors, thus enabling their maturation. These alterations likely represent clinically relevant changes because FD cell proliferation is associated with increased lesional activity and expansion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and mineralization defects are associated with bone weakness, deformities, and fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Taken together, the findings from this study support the targeting of osteoclasts through RANKL inhibition as a mechanistically driven treatment strategy.</p>
              <p id="Par17">For the first time, we report a reduction in gain-of-function GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variant expression in human tissue after denosumab treatment using a novel variant-specific mRNA staining technique using probes we previously validated in human FD BMSC cultures. Tissue RNAseq analyses supported these findings, revealing a 20% average decrease in the frequency of mutant alleles, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, these RNA-based techniques cannot discern whether the detected decrease in GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variant expression in treated patients was due to an antiproliferative effect that more robustly impacted mutant cells than WT cells within FD tissue or to a drug-induced decrease in the expression of mutant versus wild-type GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variants by mutation-bearing cells. We also observed a decrease in the expression of this transgene in our mice after treatment with Î±RANKL (Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S5</xref>); however, because GÎ±<sub>s</sub> expression is controlled by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, this is not an ideal model for investigating its potential regulation by RANKL. Taken together, our findings suggest that the antiproliferative effects of RANKL inhibition may preferentially impact GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variant-expressing osteoprogenitors compared with wild-type cells. Interestingly, a decrease in the proportion of variant-bearing cells has been proposed as a potential mechanism for the established age-related reduction in FD lesion activity, which is associated with reduced skeletal complications in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> This finding suggested that targeting GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variant expression is a potential therapeutic strategy for FD and may contribute to the clinical improvements observed with denosumab treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the mechanisms by which denosumab affects GÎ±<sub>s</sub> expression.</p>
              <p id="Par18">FD histopathological and RNAseq analyses in both humans and mice demonstrated a broad pattern of Î±RANKL-driven osteogenic maturation. Both human and mouse FD tissue samples demonstrated high expression of early-to-mid-osteogenic differentiation markers, including RUNX2 and ALP; however, only murine tissue samples exhibited decreased RUNX2 and ALP staining upon RANKL inhibition. Interestingly, the mRNA level of the mid-stage differentiation marker osteocalcin was decreased in mouse FD amples but increased in human FD samples, and in both cases, the late-stage differentiation marker sclerostin was dramatically upregulated after RANKL inhibition. Taken together, the findings from both human and mouse tissues demonstrated that RANKL inhibition results in consistent movement toward a more differentiated state. The discrepancies in the expression of early-to-mid-osteogenic maturation markers between species likely reflect the overall greater bone content in mouse versus human FD tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a vs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This greater mineralization status observed in mice may reflect an inherent, species-dependent limitation of this model. The findings may also be confounded by size effects: while a complete long bone section was analyzed in mice, a very small biopsy in relation to the complete bone was analyzed in humans.</p>
              <p id="Par19">A comparison of mouse FD and wild-type tissue provided the opportunity to generate an FD transcriptional signature composed of 202 strongly modulated genes that had human orthologs. Of these, 36 demonstrated significantly altered expression after denosumab treatment in humans. Most changes were opposite to those observed in the comparison of FD vs. wild-type bone in mice, suggesting that denosumab likely induces a more ânormalizedâ genetic expression profile in human FD tissue. The changes in the Î±RANKL-treated mice were strikingly similar, with 34/36 of these genes exhibiting similar expression patterns. These findings support the robustness of the murine model for identifying RANKL inhibitory effects in humans and the potential utility of this genetic signature for further exploring the biology of FD in future studies.</p>
              <p id="Par20">When we assessed the associations of osteoprogenitors-osteoclast crosstalk factors in our models, we observed that, in addition to RANKL (the Tnfsf11 gene), some additional osteoclastogenic factors were mildly increased in FD compared to WT cells or tissue (Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6aâd</xref>). Î±RANKL therapy normalized the levels of a subset of the genes. Interestingly, the expression of M-CSF, an essential factor for osteoclastogenesis, was only moderately increased in murine FD tissue (Csf1 gene; Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) and not in FD tissue culture; moreover, M-CSF expression was not affected by Î±RANKL therapy. Among the pro-osteogenic factors produced by osteoclasts (also known as bone remodeling coupling factors), <italic>Dpp4</italic> was strongly upregulated in mouse FD tissue compared to that of WT bone (Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), and most of these factors were dramatically decreased after Î±RANKL treatment. Interestingly, in contrast to those in human FD tissue, <italic>Dpp4</italic> levels in mouse FD tissue increased after treatment with Î±RANKL. In addition, while RANK/RANKL signaling during bone remodeling has been broadly characterized as a pro-osteoclastogenic pathway, growing evidence suggests that signaling may actually have a bidirectional role in which vesicular RANK secreted from osteoclasts may promote osteoblast differentiation and bone formation through interaction with membrane-anchored RANKL on preosteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Using an ex vivo FD lesion model, we demonstrated that osteoclast formation was accompanied by the release of RANK-containing extracellular vesicles and increased osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, changes that were inhibited by Î±RANKL treatment. Taken together, these findings identify osteoclast-osteoblast lineage crosstalk as an essential mechanism for FD pathogenesis that can be targeted by RANKL inhibition. Additional studies building upon this work may provide further opportunities to capitalize upon these coupling pathways and identify novel therapeutic targets in FD.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Denosumab efficacy is transient, and discontinuation of treatment is associated with rapid loss of therapeutic efficacy, which resulted in severe increased bone turnover and hypercalcemia in one subject in our clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> However, additional studies are needed to further understand and develop mitigating strategies for this rebound phenomenon in FD patients, including the potential utility of preclinical models. The findings from our current study offer insights that may inform the development of future mitigating strategies. Bisphosphonates are antiresorptive medications that incorporate into hydroxyapatite and lead to long-term inhibition of osteoclastogenesis; however, previous studies have shown that bisphosphonates do not improve FD lesion activity or composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> This phenomenon may result from the paucity of mineralized tissue within FD lesions, and it is possible that the increased mineralization generated by denosumab may subsequently enable lesional incorporation of bisphosphonates. If this is the case, bisphosphonate use prior to denosumab withdrawal, while new bone is forming, may offer a therapeutic advantage by providing sustained antiresorptive effects. Bisphosphonates have shown partial efficacy in mitigating post-denosumab rebound in other disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; however, in FD, they potentially offer the additional advantage of preserving denosumab-induced lesional mineralization. Further studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of potential cotreatment regimens, as well as optimal dosing strategies for FD.</p>
              <p id="Par22">This study builds upon two previous reports exploring the effects of RANKL inhibition on murine FD models, reporting increased lesion mineralization and density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Liu Z et al. also observed decreased ALP expression and increased OCN<sup>+</sup> mature osteoblasts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> providing the first evidence that RANKL inhibition may impact osteogenesis. Our findings expand upon these findings and include novel investigations in denosumab-treated human tissue, which enabled the first detailed analyses of osteogenic cell differentiation and GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variant expression patterns. Further research is needed to determine the implications of the timing of RANKL inhibition on disease development. Using a constitutive rGÎ±<sub>s</sub><sup>R201C</sup> model, Palmisano et al. demonstrated that RANKL inhibition in young mice prevented the development of additional lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> A phase 2 trial in children investigating the effect of denosumab on FD lesion progression is ongoing (NCT05419050).</p>
              <p id="Par23">The strengths of this study include the following: (a) This is the first report of in situ detection of pathogenic and wild-type GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variants in FD and, to our knowledge, in any mosaic disease. This novel technique is invaluable for understanding the cellular dynamics and microenvironment of cancer and other mosaic diseases. (b) Systematic collection of pre- and post-treatment bone specimens as part of a prospective clinical trial provided a unique opportunity for detailed histopathological and molecular characterization of human tissue, a critical step in defining the role of RANKL and its inhibition in FD pathogenesis and treatment. (c) Investigations were integrated across patient specimens and model systems, allowing detailed inquiry into the inhibitory effects of RANKL on clinically relevant cellular processes. The <italic>Prrx-1</italic> inducible mouse model notably replicates key structural and histopathological features of human FD, and the ex vivo FD lesion model uniquely interrogates osteoclastâosteoblast coupling pathways. Decreased proliferation and increased osteogenic maturation in FD osteoprogenitors were thus demonstrated via multiple lines of inquiry, establishing a novel mechanism for targeting RANKL inhibition in FD. (d) mRNAseq analyses revealed the first comprehensive signature of genes significantly regulated in FD tissue. Comparison of mouse and human tissues verified this signature and revealed a robust list of genes normalized by Î±RANKL therapy, which may help identify new targetable pathways in FD. (e) This study involved the development of imaging assessments for murine studies, including an in vivo disease burden scoring system that shares similarities with the validated clinical method widely used in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and advanced postmortem ÂµCT analyses to detect differentially mineralized skeletal tissue. These sensitive tools will support future interventional studies in mice with FD.</p>
              <p id="Par24">This study also needs to be considered in the context of its limitations, which include the following: (a) Despite recruitment efforts, all subjects in the phase 2 clinical trial were women, and most had MAS-associated ovarian involvement. There is no pathophysiologic reason to expect sex-based differences in response to denosumab in patients with FD; however, it is possible that hormonal differences may have influenced bone turnover and gene expression patterns. Equal numbers of male and female mice were used in all groups without evidence of sex-based response differences, supporting the notion that the clinical study was likely not confounded by sex hormone effects. However, future clinical studies should prioritize the inclusion of diverse phenotypes, particularly men. (b) Analyses are subject to the inherent limitations of preclinical models. While the <italic>Prrx-1</italic> inducible model replicates key features of human FD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> there are subtle but relevant differences, including a higher baseline proportion of bone content within fibro-osseous lesions and the inability to use this transgenic model to investigate the effects of RANKL inhibition on the regulation of FD GÎ±<sub>s</sub> expression. (c) Bulk tissue for RNAseq can contain traces of unaffected tissue. It is possible that traces of neighboring hematopoietic marrow, which is highly proliferative, could have contributed to the lack of a detectable effect of RANKL inhibition on proliferation-related gene signatures in mice, despite histopathologic analyses, which conversely showed robust effects on cellularity and MCM2 expression in areas of FD.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In conclusion, this study demonstrated that in addition to its expected antiresorptive effects, denosumab reduces FD lesion activity by reducing the expression of pathogenic GÎ±<sub>s</sub> variants in FD, decreasing FD cell proliferation and increasing osteogenic maturation, leading to increased lesional bone formation. These findings provide a new understanding of FD pathogenesis driven by unbalanced crosstalk between osteoclasts and preosteoblasts/osteoblasts and support the use of denosumab as a mechanistically driven treatment strategy.</p>

An FD tissue genetic signature comprising 276 genes was derived by comparing WT versus Gnas R201C-expressing mice; the genes had aâ&gt;â2 log<sub>2</sub>-fold change and were significantly (adjusted <italic>P</italic> valueââ¤â0.05) differentially expressed between the two groups. This gene signature was converted to human genes based on homology scores using the Biomart service, which reduced the number of genes to 202.
