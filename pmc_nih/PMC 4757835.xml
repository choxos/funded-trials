                <p>To identify computer extracted imaging features for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers on dynamic contrast en-hanced (DCE)-MRI that are correlated with the low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories. We collected 96 ER-positivebreast lesions with low (&lt;18, <italic>N</italic> = 55) and high (&gt;30, <italic>N</italic> = 41) Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores. Each lesion was quantitatively charac-terize via 6 shape features, 3 pharmacokinetics, 4 enhancement kinetics, 4 intensity kinetics, 148 textural kinetics, 5 dynamic histogram of oriented gradient (DHoG), and 6 dynamic local binary pattern (DLBP) features. The extracted features were evaluated by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier in terms of their ability to distinguish low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories. Classification performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (Az). The DHoG and DLBP achieved Az values of 0.84 and 0.80, respectively. The 6 top features identified via feature selection were subsequently combined with the LDA classifier to yield an Az of 0.87. The correlation analysis showed that DHoG (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and DLBP (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.83, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) were significantly associated with the low and high risk classifications from the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX assay. Our results indicated that computer extracted texture features of DCE-MRI were highly correlated with the high and low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories for ER-positive cancers.</p>

          <body>
            <p>In the United States, approximately 70% of all breast cancer patients are diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive primary tumors, and many of these women will receive hormonal therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Identifying patients who can be treated with hormonal therapy alone would limit toxicity to those most likely to benefit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Currently, the selection of individualized therapy for patients with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative early stage breast cancers is guided by the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX gene expression assay (Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, which produces a recurrence score between 0–100 to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence with tamoxifen and improves the oncologist’s ability to estimate benefit from adjuvant hormonal and chemotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX assay is performed on tissue biopsy specimens and involves additional tumor handling and shipping of tissue, and delays in time to treatment, all of which add costs and anxiety for patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
            <p>Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been previously used with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the breast to predict the presence or absence of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. These CAD tools aim to increase the accuracy of diagnosis of breast cancer on MRI while also aiming to reduce inter-observer variability. However, more recently a number of groups have begun to focus on identifying computer extracted features on MRI that might be associated with underlying biology molecular subtype and risk of recurrence of the tumor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. A radiogenomic approach presented by Yamamoto <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> found a significant correlation between breast MRI (1.5 Tesla) features and a number of important breast cancer related gene sets. Correlation studies by Vassiou <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and Chang <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> showed that DCE-MRI (1.5 Tesla) based imaging features, such as tumor margin, enhancement pattern, and kinetic characteristics, were associated with pathological prognostic factors for the prediction of clinical outcome during treatment of breast cancer. A recent study conducted by Sutton <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> showed that two MRI (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla) derived statistical image features were significantly correlated with the median Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores with a range of 0–45. Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> presented a method for identifying correlation between computer-extracted morphologic and kinetic features from DCE-MRI sequences obtained at a 1.5T magnet with validated prognostic gene expression profiles of breast cancers. In addition, Agner <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> presented an approach called textural kinetics (TK), which involved measuring dynamic changes in breast lesion texture during contrast uptake. These TK features were able to separate different molecular subtypes of breast cancers (triple negative, ER-positive, HER2-positive, fibroadenoma) on DCE-MRI obtained at either 1.5T or 3T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the ability of TK features on DCE-MRI to distinguish ER-positive breast cancers between low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories (i.e., Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence score &lt;18 and Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence score &gt;30). Our approach is different from the work presented by Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, in which dynamic features were computed based on the estimation of parameters on time-intensity curve, e.g., peak enhancement, wash-in and wash-out slop. Our approach is also different from the work published by Sutton <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, in which the image features (i.e., morphological, static first-order, and Haralick texture features) were extracted from breast lesions on pre- and three post-contrast MR images. In this study, we focus on TK features that allow for characterization of dynamic texture changes, specifically texture involving dynamic histograms in tumors on 1.5 Tesla DCE-MRI. Also our TK features are different from the approach by Agner <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, in that it involves quantification of kinetic texture in a new way - dynamic histogram of oriented gradients (DHoG) and dynamic local binary patterns (DLBP).</p>
            <p>The histogram of oriented gradients (HoG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, local binary patterns (LBP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and their spatio-temporal representations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> are image texture features that have been previously employed for detecting breast masses on mammographic images<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Unlike the approach in Agner <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> which attempted to fit a single parametric curve to explain the changes in lesion texture during the contrast wash-in and wash-out, the DHoG and DLBP approaches allow for construction of a unique lesion signature that captures the frequency of occurrence of different spatio-temporal textural patterns.</p>
            <p>In this study, we evaluate the ability of the DHoG and DLBP features extracted from DCE-MRI at 1.5 Tesla, via a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to distinguish low and high risk ER-positive breast cancers, risk having been established via the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX assay.</p>

              <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> shows the best two identified features in each feature class (shape, PK, EK, IK, TK, DHoG, DLBP) associated with Az, PPV, NPV, <italic>ρ</italic> (correlation coefficient), RSD, and <italic>err</italic> (error rate of classification). The numbers of bins used in the DHoG and DLBP features were {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and {8, 16, 33, 64, 128, 256}, respectively. Higher <italic>ρ</italic> value indicates a stronger relationship between risk stratification via the features and Onco<italic>type</italic>DX. The post-hoc power analysis revealed no significant difference between features identified from imaging data acquired at Sites I and II which were found to discriminate high versus low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories. The heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) shows the values of all the features listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> for all the patient studies. The values of best two identified features in each feature class and the six top performing features obtained from the LDA based feature selection method are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> online.</p>

                <p>The feature compactness used to measure the speculation of tumor margin yielded the best discriminability among the computerized shape features. The lower values of compactness for the high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX breast cancers (−20.76 ± 7.32) compared with the low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX cancers (−19.05 ± 9.14) appears to suggest that higher Onco<italic>type</italic>DX score cancers tend to be associated with more speculation compared to cancers with low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk scores. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> appears to suggest that shape features are less useful for differentiating between low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score ER-positive lesions compared to pharmacokinetic and textural kinetic features (i.e., PK, EK, IK, TK, DHoG, and DLBP).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We presented a computerized image analysis framework for identification of breast MR imaging markers to distinguish between low and high risk ER-positive breast cancers via a correlation of computer extracted DCE-MRI attributes and the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX assay. Although tumor margin, tumor size, rim enhancement on DCE-MRI have been previously correlated with pathological factors and have been reported to be associated with disease outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the association between textural kinetic features on DCE-MRI with Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores for ER-positive breast cancers. This is important because the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX is an assay with proven clinical utility that has been shown to be both prognostic and predictive in ER-positive breast cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Hence by demonstrating computer extracted imaging features on DCE-MRI can predict the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk category of the lesion, we might be able to non-invasively identify which patients would benefit from adjuvant therapy. This could pave the way for non-invasive risk assessment of the lesion even prior to biopsy. Furthermore, this is the first systematic comparison of various kinetic (PK, EK, IK, TK, DHoG and DLBP) and shape features, to discriminate high and low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX categories of ER-positive breast lesions.</p>
              <p>There has been recent interest in identifying radiogenomic correlates of breast lesions on MRI. In<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, Agner <italic>et al.</italic> showed that textural kinetic features extracted from routine clinical DCE-MRI appeared to be associated with the biologic heterogeneity and molecular subtype of breast cancers. Giger <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> computed enhancement kinetic features, such as time to peak, uptake rate, maximal uptake, from a characteristic time curse curve to distinguish benign and malignant breast masses. Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> also utilized curve-based kinetic features to construct breast DCE-MRI phenotypes and showed their correlation with the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX assay.</p>
              <p>In this study, we attempted to identify whether there was an association between textural kinetic features extracted from ER-positive breast lesions on 1.5 Tesla DCE-MRI and their corresponding Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories. While Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> focused on the association between lesion shape, contrast kinetic features and spatial heterogeneity features and the continuous Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores, our approach was focused on evaluating the ability of quantitative image features and spatio-temporal patterns within the lesion to distinguish between the low (&lt;18 risk score) and high (&gt;30 risk score) Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories. Additionally in conjunction with a LDA classifier, the textural kinetic features yielded an Az = 0.84 in distinguishing low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk category lesions, compared to Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> where the Az was 0.77.</p>
              <p>Our approach was also different from that of Agner <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> in that we employed two new textural kinetic features, DHoG and DLBP, which unlike EK, IK and TK features, seek to capture contextual textural changes during contrast uptake by considering changes in spatial intensity patterns within divided grid cells in the lesion ROI. Unlike the approach in Agner <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> which attempted to fit a single parametric curve to characterize the temporal changes in lesion texture, the DHoG and DLBP approaches capture the frequency of occurrence of different spatio-temporal textural patterns within the lesion.</p>
              <p>A systematic and quantitative analysis of different computer extracted features demonstrated that curve-based kinetic features (i.e., EK, TK, IK) were less discriminating compared to the other three feature classes (i.e., DHoG, DLBP, PK) in distinguishing high and low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score ER-positive cancers. Consistently, the feature combination identified through the feature selection process contained the important features from 4 feature classes (DHoG, DLBP, PK, and TK). While the PK features showed moderate correlation, lesion shape features were even less correlated with the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk categories for the lesions evaluated. The DHoG and DLBP appeared to be the most discriminative features in differentiating low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score ER-positive breast lesions on DCE-MRI. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref> which show the normalized mean DHoG and DLBP curves plotted as a function of contrast uptake, appear to illustrate a high degree of heterogeneity in high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score cancers compared to low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score cancers. The corresponding color-coded DHoG and DLBP feature maps at peak enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>) also suggest that high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score breast cancers may appear to be more heterogeneous at peak contrast compared to low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score cancers. The Spearmen’s rank correlation test showed that DHoG and DLBP are significantly correlated (DHoG: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; DLBP: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.83, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) with the high and low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk score categories. These results are consistent with the findings of Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, who showed that DCE-MRI based heterogeneity kinetic features were correlated with Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.71, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However unlike Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic> where image data from only a single institute was considered, our approach included image data from two different clinical sites.</p>
              <p>Our study did have its limitations, and as such, it is important to acknowledge that this is a preliminary study with need for additional independent validation of our initial findings. Additionally, we only included those patients having low (&lt;18) and high (&gt;30) Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores and excluded intermediate risk scores (&gt;18 and &lt;30) as the contrast was greatest between these categories and further work is needed to evaluate the intermediate category. Further, the extracted features were computed based on the automated segmentation method due to lack of precise lesion boundary for the data from Site II. Owing to the limited size of the dataset considered in this study, we did not conduct multiple statistical tests of comparisons on the features. We also did not explicitly quantify the inter-observer variability in segmentation of the dominant masses between multiple readers. One problem was the fact that we were identifying imaging markers correlated with a surrogate of outcome (Onco<italic>type</italic>DX) instead of actual outcome itself- unfortunately this information was not available for the patients considered in this study.</p>

                <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
                <p>We identified a set of computer extracted image texture features on DCE-MRI that appear to be able to segregate high and low Onco<italic>type</italic>DX risk scores in ER-positive breast cancers. The texture features so identified may allow for non-invasively predicting which ER-positive patients might benefit from adjuvant hormonal and chemotherapy.</p>

All the cases were anonymised. In Site I, women patients who presented with a suspicious breast lesion on screening mammogram, then had diagnostic MRI, were recruited to a large study of MRI in the staging, diagnosis, and screening of breast cancer. In Site II, women whose pathology revealed node-negative, ER-positive invasive breast cancer who participated in a large breast cancer case-control study were utilized for this study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. All the DCE-MRI images at 1.5T were obtained within 3–7 days after diagnostic biopsy. The lesion diagnosis for both cohorts was confirmed by ultrasound guided core needle biopsies or MRI guided biopsies, followed by the histopathologic examination of 3–10 specimens obtained by core biopsy sampling. A total of 89 patient studies were collected from the Site I, and only 17 patients with both pathology reports and available low or high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX scores were included in this study. From the Site II, we acquired 101 ER-positive stage I-III female breast cancer patients. Of those, 79 patients had both associated pathology reports and available low and high Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores. Patients with intermediate Onco<italic>type</italic>DX recurrence scores (18–30) were deemed to not be informative of cancer risk and hence excluded from the analysis. Three patient studies and one patient study from the Site I had two and three separate lesions respectively. All other patients only had a single lesion. For each patient, the Onco<italic>type</italic>DX test was performed for the dominant mass (index lesion), hence only the index lesion in the case of the patient with multiple masses was considered. The patient selection criteria for our study are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>.</p>

For each grid cell, we calculated the cell histograms by counting the number of occurrences of gradient values in the histogram channels that were evenly distributed from 0 to 360 degrees. An orientation histogram was obtained by aggregating all the cell histograms.
