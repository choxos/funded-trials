                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>This phase Ib trial was designed to evaluate the safety and early efficacy signal of the combination of imatinib and binimetinib in patients with imatinib-resistant advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>This trial used a standard 3 + 3 design to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Additional patients were enrolled on an expansion cohort at the RP2D enriching for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GISTs to explore potential efficacy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>The trial enrolled nine patients in the dose-escalation cohort and 14 in the dose-expansion cohort including six with SDH-deficient GISTs. Imatinib 400 mg daily with binimetinib 45 mg twice daily was established as the RP2D. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was asymptomatic grade 4 creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation. The most common non-DLT grade 3/4 toxicity was asymptomatic CPK elevation (69.6%). Other common ≥grade 2 toxicities included peripheral edema (17.4%), acneiform rash (21.7%), anemia (30.4%), hypophosphatemia (39.1%), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase (17.4%). Two serious adverse events occurred (grade 2 dropped head syndrome and grade 3 central retinal vein occlusion). No unexpected toxicities were observed. Limited clinical activity was observed in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic>-mutant GIST. For SDH-deficient GISTs, one of five had confirmed RECIST1.1 partial response (PR). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) in patients with SDH-deficient GIST was 45.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 15.8–not estimable (NE)]; the median overall survival (mOS) was not reached (95% CI, 31.6 months–NE). One patient with a refractory metastatic SDH-deficient GIST had an exceptional pathologic response and durable clinical benefit.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>The combination of imatinib and binimetinib is safe with manageable toxicity and has encouraging activity in SDH-deficient but not imatinib-refractory <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-mutant GISTs. The observed clinical benefits provide a motivation for a larger trial of the combination strategy in SDH-deficient GISTs.</p>

              <p>Combined targeting of the lineage-specific master transcription factor, ETV1, and signaling factor, KIT, by the combination of KIT and MEK inhibitors, is synergistic in preclinical gastrointestinal tumor (GIST) models. This phase Ib clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety, determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and early efficacy signal of the combination of imatinib and binimetinib in patients with refractory advanced <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-mutant and <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> wild-type GISTs including SDH-deficient GISTs. This study showed that the imatinib/binimetinib combination was safe with manageable side effects and determined the RP2D. We observed durable and excellent pathologic responses in a small cohort of patients with SDH-deficient GISTs in the phase Ib expansion at RP2D. The promising clinical activity of the combination treatment in SDH-deficient GISTs observed here is worthy of further clinical investigation. A phase II study of the imatinib and binimetinib combination in patients with treatment-naïve advanced GISTs has met its prespecified primary endpoint based on the best objective response rate by RECIST1.1 and is reported separately.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, occurring primarily in the stomach and small intestine and less frequently in the large intestine, rectum, and esophagus. The majority of GISTs are characterized by activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic>. Approximately 15% of GISTs lack mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> and are designated as <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> wild-type (WT) GISTs. The majority of WT GISTs harbor genetic or epigenetic alterations that specifically inactivate the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) pathway (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>). SDH-deficient GISTs occur primarily in the pediatric and young adult population and in patients with the heritable Carney–Stratakis syndrome or the nonhereditary Carney triad. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-mutant GISTs, SDH-deficient GISTs confer primary resistance to imatinib, the first-line standard-of-care (SOC) systemic therapy in advanced GISTs. They are also relatively insensitive to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; refs. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 4</xref>), and currently, there are no SOC therapeutic options for advanced SDH-deficient GISTs.</p>
              <p>SDH is a component of both the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, and SDH deficiency leads to succinate accumulation, metabolic defects and a global genomic hypermethylation phenotype in SDH-deficient GISTs (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>). Although SDH-deficient GISTs lack <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> or other druggable oncogenic driver mutations, they share with other GISTs a common precursor, the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and their shared lineage-specific dependency on KIT signaling for oncogenesis (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). ETV1, an ETS family transcription factor, has been uncovered as a lineage-specific survival factor in GISTs and its precursor ICCs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">ETV1</italic> is required for the growth and survival of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GISTs <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and GIST initiation and maintenance <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. ETV1 and mutant KIT/PDGFRA form a positive-feedback circuit in GIST pathogenesis, where active MAPK signaling downstream of active KIT/PDGFRA signaling stabilizes ETV1, and stabilized ETV1 enhances <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> expression (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>). The fact that <italic toggle="yes">Etv1</italic> is required for normal ICC lineage-specification and development and GIST tumor initiation in mouse models suggests that all GISTs regardless of genetic alterations, including the SDH-deficient GISTs, depend on <italic toggle="yes">ETV1</italic> for growth and survival. Consistently, all human GISTs, including <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-WT GISTs, express high levels of <italic toggle="yes">ETV1</italic> (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), indicating that ETV1 may be a novel therapeutic target for all GISTs. Preclinical studies showed that the combination of an MEK inhibitor (e.g., binimetinib) with a KIT inhibitor (e.g., imatinib) is synergistic and can durably inhibit the ETV1 protein level by simultaneously blocking the downstream MEK/ERK signaling and the feedback reactivation of the upstream KIT/PDGFRA signaling in GISTs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9, 12</xref>). Furthermore, the Pea3 family ETS factors (ETV1/4/5) have been shown to directly regulate the homeostasis of the MAPK signaling pathways in multiple cancer types, including GISTs; and they are the critical mediators of early adaptive responses to MAPK pathway targeted therapies and subsequent development of therapeutic resistance (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>).</p>
              <p>Based on these preclinical studies, we initiated a phase Ib/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of targeting ETV1, using the combination of imatinib and an MEK inhibitor, binimetinib, in patients with advanced GISTs (NCT01991379). This is also a signal finding study to see whether targeting ETV1 protein stability can be an effective strategy for both the <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-mutant and the <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-WT GISTs including SDH-deficient GISTs. Initial results of the phase Ib portion of the study have shown that this combination is safe with manageable side effects (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We have since accrued a small cohort of patients with SDH-deficient GISTs in the phase Ib expansion. Here, we report the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy and efficacy signal in SDH-deficient GISTs from the phase Ib study. The phase II portion of the trial is reported separately (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>

                <p>Adult patients (age ≥18) who had histologically confirmed advanced GISTs, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 1, who had progressed on imatinib, and had adequate end-organ function were eligible to consent and participate. Additional key inclusion criteria were patients with measurable lesion(s) by RECIST1.1 and were able to take oral medications and sign informed consents. Key exclusion criteria included severe and/or uncontrolled medical diseases, active brain metastasis, history of retinal degenerative disease or central serious retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neuromuscular disorders associated with elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK; e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy). Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in the study protocol. The phase Ib study (dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts) was initially designed to accrue up to 18 patients. After observing an exceptional response in a patient with SDH-deficient GIST, the phase Ib expansion cohort was amended to accrue an additional five patients with SDH-deficient GISTs.</p>

                <p>The study was performed in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and local laws. The protocol, protocol amendments, and informed-consent documents were approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York, NY).

                <title>Study design, treatment, and endpoints</title>
                <p>This was a single-center (MSKCC), single-arm phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and tolerability and define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and early efficacy signal of imatinib and binimetinib combination in patients with advanced, imatinib-resistant GISTs. It consisted of two cohorts: (i) a dose-escalation cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9) and (ii) a dose-expansion cohort at RP2D (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14) enriched for SDH-deficient GISTs (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6).</p>
                <p>Dose-escalation was performed in standard <italic toggle="yes">3 + 3</italic> design (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The standard dose of single-agent imatinib is 400 mg once daily. The single agent RP2D of binimetinib in phase II and III studies is 45 mg twice daily (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Thus, the dose-escalation portion consists of three dose levels (−1, 1, 2) with the starting dose (level 1) of the combination at imatinib 400 mg once daily and binimetinib 30 mg twice daily; once the RP2D was determined, the phase Ib expanded at the RP2D to accrue a total of 24 patients, with a focus on SDH-deficient GISTs.</p>
                <p>In the dose-escalation phase Ib portion, all eligible patients received imatinib 400 mg daily and binimetinib at the standard <italic toggle="yes">3 + 3</italic> escalation doses (see Protocol for dose-escalation table). In the phase Ib expansion cohort, all eligible patients received the RP2D (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), continuously on every 28-day cycle.</p>
                <p>Disease assessments with CT or MRI were performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks for the initial 32 weeks and every 12 weeks until surgery, disease progression, death, or withdrawal. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03) until 28 days after discontinuation of study treatment.</p>
                <p>The primary endpoint of phase Ib was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of imatinib and binimetinib, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to define the RP2D. The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the objective response rate [ORR; complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] by both RECIST1.1 and Choi criteria (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), the clinical benefit rate [CBR; CR + PR + stable disease (SD)], and correlative studies by genomics and transcriptome with available archival tissue.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The primary endpoint of the phase Ib study was to determine the MTD of binimetinib in combination with imatinib in patients with advanced GISTs. The phase Ib pursued a standard <italic toggle="yes">3 + 3</italic> format, based on toxicities encountered during the first cycle of therapy. The phase Ib portion of the study would have a minimum sample size of four patients and a maximum of 18.</p>
                <p>The dose-escalation proceeded within each cohort according to the dose-escalation schema and DLT evaluation in the study protocol. The first three patients enrolled at dose level 1. If dose level 1 was not found to be tolerable, then the next cohort would be enrolled at dose level -1. If dose level -1 was not found to be tolerable, then the study may be terminated based on discussions with the sponsor-investigator and the combination may be deemed intolerable. If zero of three patients or one of six patients experienced a DLT on dose level 2, this would be the RP2D.</p>
                <p>The secondary endpoints of the phase Ib portion included ORR defined by RECIST 1.1 and by Choi criteria, PFS, and OS. ORR would be estimated as the proportion of patients who had CR or PR for each criterion. Patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study would be censored at the time of the last follow-up. PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method.</p>
                <p>All patients who received at least one dose of the combination of imatinib and binimetinib were included in the safety and toxicity analysis. All data reflect an interim data-cut on May 1, 2021 from patients enrolled between November 18, 2013 and May 1, 2021 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Whole-exome sequencing and somatic mutation analysis</title>
                  <p>Paired-end whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumor and matched normal samples by the MSKCC Integrated Genomics Operation Facility, Marie-Josée and Henry R. Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology. Exome capture was performed using the Agilent Exon 51MB hg19 v3, and the captured DNA was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Somatic mutation detection was performed by the MSKCC Bioinformatics Core using standard algorithms. In brief, the raw sequencing reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19, build37) using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324), duplicate reads were removed, realignment around indels was performed, and quality scores were recalibrated using the GATK analysis toolkit (doi:10.1101/gr.107524.110). Single base substitution calls were generated using MuTect (doi:10.1038/nbt.2514), and small somatic indels were identified using the haplotect and haplotypecaller algorithms. Variants were subsequently annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor. To reduce the number of false positives, only mutations detected at 5% allele frequency and those identified in the MSK-IMPACT gene panel were considered for this analysis. Variant calls with tumor depth less than 20, less than three supporting reads, with more than one matching read in the normal sample, and those located in sequenced regions with low mappability as defined by ENCODE (doi:10.1038/nature11247) and the RepeatMasker (doi:10.1002/0471250953.bi0410s25) were disregarded. To remove common variants, all calls were filtered against ExAC (doi:10.1038/nature19057); a variant was considered common if its minor allele frequency was above 0.0004. To further reduce sequencing and mapping artifacts, all variants were filtered against a panel of normal and FFPE samples available in-house. All remaining indels were visually reviewed using the Integrated Genomic Viewer (doi:10.1038/nbt.1754).</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>From November 18, 2013 to May 1, 2021, a total of 24 patients were consented and enrolled in the phase Ib study; one enrolled patient had rapid clinical deterioration and discontinued the trial without receiving any study drug and therefore was removed from all analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, nine patients were enrolled and treated in the dose-escalation cohort and 14 patients in the dose-expansion cohort, among whom six patients had SDH-deficient GISTs. All evaluable patients received at least 2 days of treatment with the combination of imatinib (400 mg daily) and binimetinib [30 mg twice daily (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3, dose level -1) or 45 mg twice daily (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 20)]. The phase Ib dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts included 23 patients evaluable for safety and toxicity and 21 to 23 patients evaluable for various efficacy endpoints (Supplementary Fig. S1). The median age of the analytic cohort is 54.9 years (range, 30.2–74.6 years), 39.1% female, 82.6% patients with ECOG 0 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The median number of prior therapies was three (range, 1–6), and 17 of 23 patients had at least three prior therapies, including imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, clinical trial drugs, among others. The molecular features of the GISTs included 13 patients with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic>-mutant refractory GIST and 10 had various detectable secondary resistant mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> exons 13, 14, 17, 18; six patients had SDH-deficient GISTs confirmed by MSK-IMPACT genetic assays and/or IHC analysis of SDH complex; one patient had an NF1-deficient GIST, and one had <italic toggle="yes">BRAFV600E</italic>-mutant and concurrent NF1-deficient GIST; two patients had no mutational data due to insufficient biopsy material (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Table S2).</p>

                <p>Two serious AEs (SAEs) occurred that were considered related to the study drug. One patient developed a grade 2 dropped head syndrome requiring discontinuation of therapy with full resolution of symptoms. One patient developed a grade 3 central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) requiring discontinuation of study drug and intravitreal bevacizumab injection of the affected eye with subsequent full recovery of vision. The dropped head syndrome and CRVO are class effects of MEK inhibitors and are typically reversable with complete resolution of symptoms through dose reduction or discontinuation of drugs and appropriate medical management (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref>). The MEK inhibitor-associated CRVO has been observed to associate with hyperhomocysteinemia and MTHFR variants (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). There was no clinically significant grade 4 or grade 5 AEs at least possibly associated with study medications in this trial.</p>

                <p>This is a 32-year-old female who was initially diagnosed with an SDH-deficient, <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-WT GIST localized in the stomach at age 19, in 2003. Initial therapy included subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, followed by 1 year of adjuvant imatinib therapy in a phase II clinical trial. Recurrent and metastatic disease in the gastrohepatic lymph nodes and liver, respectively, was confirmed by biopsy 6 years after the initial diagnosis. The patient was subsequently treated with imatinib in the randomized nilotinib versus imatinib phase III trial (ENESTg1; ref. <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) until clear progression of disease within 20 months of treatment. The patient then received sunitinib with slow but clear progression of disease for the following 1 year and 5 months. She then underwent debulking surgery in November 2012, followed by RECIST disease progression on linsitinib, an IGF-1R small-molecule inhibitor, in a clinical trial within 9 months (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

                <p>The patient then enrolled in the phase Ib trial of combination treatment of imatinib and binimetinib (NCT01991379). The patient received the RP2D of the combination, imatinib at 400 mg daily and binimetinib at 45 mg twice daily and tolerated the combination therapy well with manageable mild side effects. The patient had slow but steady disease regression in multiple liver lesions. By the fifth follow-up CT scan, after approximately 11 months of combination treatment, she showed approximately 20% reduction in tumor burden by RECIST, and approximately 38% reduction in CT density [Hounsfield unit (HU)], qualifying for a partial response by the Choi criteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; ref. <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Her tumor then remained relatively stable with approximately 15% tumor burden reduction by RECIST by 22 months of treatment. At this point, one of the target lesions appeared to have slightly increased in density and size, whereas some of the nontarget lesions continued to respond with a decrease in size and CT density (HU) by imaging studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Following 22 months of the combination treatment, the patient subsequently underwent laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, removal of a peritoneal nodule, and multiple Tru-Cut biopsies of liver lesions. The pathology revealed 100% fibrosis of a peritoneal metastatic nodule (a nontarget lesion) and about 70% treatment-associated necrosis of the liver metastasis (one of the target lesions), with the residual viable component having a proliferation index of less than 10%. These pathologic responses have been confirmed independently by two expert pathologists at our institution. This dramatic pathologic response is in stark contrast to the &gt;95% tumor viability noted microscopically after sunitinib therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The patient continued the combination of imatinib and binimetinib clinical trial with stable disease for 69.0 months until disease progression.</p>

                <title>Genetic analysis of pretreatment and on-treatment tumor specimens</title>
                <p>To understand the molecular mechanisms of the exceptional pathologic response, we first performed MSK-IMPACT, a clinically validated targeted NGS assay encompassing 410 cancer-associated genes (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20, 21</xref>) and identified SDHA exon 2 p.R31* nonsense mutation in both the pretreatment and on-treatment tumor samples of the index case. We found an additional KDR p. V1334E missense mutation in the patient's on-treatment resected tumor samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The KDR p.V1334E mutation resides in the last 22 amino acids from the C-terminus outside of the tyrosine kinase domain and is a variant of unknown significance (VUS). No additional mutations or copy-number variations were found. These data confirm the SDH-deficiency by IHC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and the lack of <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> mutations.</p>
                <p>Reasoning that the breadth of MSK-IMPACT is limited and excludes genes with less established roles in cancer, but which may still modulate response to therapy, we also performed WES of the FFPE pretreatment and on-treatment patient tumor samples to explore genetic perturbations comprehensively. Consistently, WES identified the presence of the same missense mutation (VUS) in KDR with 50% allelic frequency. WES also identified a number of other genetic alterations shared between the pre- and on-treatment tumor samples, including mutations in ITGB6, STAM, OR13C3, and several genetic alterations private to one of the pre- or on-treatment tumor samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>; Supplementary Table S3). None of these genetic alterations has known functional significance. Overall, the genetic data are consistent with prior knowledge that SDH-deficient GISTs have very few genetic alterations, and SDHA/B/C/D-loss is the primary oncogenic event in the ICC context for GIST pathogenesis. These data indicate that the pathologic response is likely a result of targeting the ICC/GIST lineage-specific survival factor, ETV1, in the SDH-deficient GISTs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Lineage-specific oncogenic transcription factors [e.g., androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor, ETV1] can be excellent therapeutic targets because the toxicity is expected to be limited to the specific cell-type expressing the transcription factor. However, apart from nuclear receptors (e.g., AR), oncogenic transcription factors have been challenging to target. In GISTs, we have identified a novel therapeutic strategy to target the lineage-specific oncogenic transcription factor, ETV1, by targeting its protein stability, which depends on active MAPK signaling. Based on its critical role in ICC development and GIST pathogenesis, targeting ETV1 has the potential to bypass imatinib-resistance mechanisms that act at the level of KIT signaling. Previous studies suggest that ICC stem cells/GIST progenitors have low <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> expression and hence are intrinsically resistant to imatinib (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Yet ICCs and GIST progenitors still depend on ETV1 for survival. These characteristics might account for part of the mechanisms of both primary and secondary resistance. Targeting ETV1 may offer a new way to address the intrinsically imatinib-resistant GIST stem cell/progenitor population, and therefore, may broadly benefit patients with GISTs, whether they have <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-mutant or SDH-deficient GISTs. Preclinical studies showed that targeting of ETV1 and KIT by the combination of binimetinib and imatinib was synergistic and could durably inhibit the ETV1 protein levels and decrease adaptive resistance compared to single-agent imatinib or binimetinib (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9, 12</xref>), which motivated this clinical investigation.</p>
              <p>This phase Ib study showed that the combination of imatinib plus binimetinib at the RP2D is safe. Although no unexpected toxicity was seen, we observed two SAEs related to MEK inhibitor-associated class effects, including CRVO and dropped head syndrome. The most bothersome side effects for our patients were binimetinib-associated acneiform rash and binimetinib/imatinib-associated periorbital and peripheral edema. These were managed with prophylactic antibiotics, topical steroids, and ancillary support without the need for dose modifications. Overall, the combination therapy is reasonably tolerated with manageable toxicity.</p>
              <p>In this phase Ib study, in patients who have imatinib-resistant <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic>-mutant GISTs, the clinical activity of the imatinib and binimetinib combination therapy is limited due to the lack of an effective KIT inhibitor to suppress the binimetinib-induced feedback reactivation of the KIT/PDGFRA/MAPK signaling through the imatinib-resistant <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic>-mutant variant alleles. In contrast, we observed promising clinical activity in a cohort of five patients with molecularly and histologically confirmed SDH-deficient GISTs. Although SDH-deficient GISTs can have indolent behavior initially, they typically exhibit more aggressive behavior when TKI treatment is indicated or upon progression of TKIs (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Historically, RECIST responses are rare but can be observed upon multitargeted TKI treatments, e.g., sunitinib and regorafenib. The observed ORR ranges from 0% to 33% for a variety of TKIs, including imatinib [2.0% (1/49 patients)–8.3% (1/12 patients)] (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 28</xref>), sunitinib [0% (0/7 patients)–14.2% (1/7 patients)–18.4% (7/38 patients)] (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 29, 30</xref>), regorafenib [33% (2/6 patients)] (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and no responses were observed for vandetanib and linsitinib (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32, 33</xref>). For a subset of 12 patients with molecularly defined SDH-deficient GISTs, the mPFS was 9 months (95% CI, 3–58) in first-line imatinib therapy (400–800 mg/day; ref. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic>-WT pediatric GISTs with the majority of patients with SDH-deficient GISTs, sunitinib treatment showed a mean duration of disease stabilization around 15 months (range, 7–21 + months) in a prospective study (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and an mPFS of 15 months (range, 1–73 months) in a retrospective series (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In imatinib-resistant or refractory SDH-deficient GISTs, the mPFS was 10 months with regorafenib treatment (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Two recent trials specifically evaluating SDH-deficient GISTs with vandetanib and linsitinib showed an mPFS of 5.1 months and 10 months (95% CI, 7–25), respectively (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32, 33</xref>). Similarly, we have only seen limited RECIST responses, one of five patients (20%) had RECIST PR with most patients demonstrating RECIST SD as best response. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that the combination of imatinib plus binimetinib demonstrated an mPFS of 45.1 months (95% CI, 15.8–NE), with a CBR of 75% at 18 months in patients with SDH-deficient GISTs in this phase Ib study.</p>
              <p>We had the opportunity to examine the antitumor response to multiple TKIs in a single patient and sequential pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples for molecular analysis. The patient with a metastatic SDH-deficient GIST has previously progressed on multiple systemic therapies, including imatinib, sunitinib, and linsitinib, with each therapy lasting less than 2 years of treatment. The patient, with documented disease progression, enrolled in this phase Ib trial with imatinib and binimetinib combination therapy, which was designed to target the ICC/GIST lineage-specific survival transcription factor, ETV1. In this study, the patient showed a modest radiographic response (RECIST approzimately −15% to −20%) but had a dramatic (70%–100%) pathologic response with durable clinical benefit. It is well known that SDH-deficient GISTs can have an indolent course. As shown in this patient, she had been treated with imatinib for 20 months with slow but clear disease progression. As her disease progressed, the duration of subsequent treatment became shorter, with sunitinib treatment for 17 months and linsitinib treatment for 9 months. Despite the relative slow pace of disease progression, pathology from the debulking surgery immediately after sunitinib treatment revealed more than 95% viable tumor and little treatment response, corroborating the lack of clinical benefit of sunitinib treatment. In contrast, this patient had derived clinical benefit from the imatinib and binimetinib combination treatment for 69 months with manageable side effects. Compared with the natural history of her disease in response to prior therapies, these observations highlight the durable response and significant clinical benefit achieved with this combination therapeutic strategy.</p>
              <p>One apparent discrepancy of responses is between the modest radiographic response by RECIST (−15% to −20%) and the near-complete pathologic response (70%–100% treatment-associated necrosis and fibrosis) of biopsied metastatic tumors. These clinical efficacy differences have been previously observed and underlie the critical need to develop better modalities than CT/MRI-based RECIST to assess treatment responses in GISTs, especially SDH-deficient GISTs, which can be very hard to qualify radiographically. It is conceivable that when GISTs undergo fibrosis/hyalinization and/or treatment-associated necrosis, the residual “tumor” size cannot be used as an accurate assessment of the treatment response. Choi criteria that factor in both size reduction and changes in tumor density has been proposed as an alternative measure to assess treatment efficacy in GISTs (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and is part of the secondary endpoint of the phase Ib clinical trial. Nevertheless, pathologic response remains the gold standard of treatment response. In comparison, the responses determined by the current imaging modalities can often be an underestimation of the true treatment response.</p>
              <p>The clinical benefit and pathologic responses observed in this phase Ib trial in the SDH-deficient patients suggest that targeting ETV1 in the ICC/GIST lineage is clinically meaningful. The genetic and RNA characterization of the patient tumor specimens presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> confirms the presence of high expression levels of ETV1 and KIT. Preclinical studies using <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> models have demonstrated the specificity of targeting the MAPK pathway and ETV1 protein stability with the combination of imatinib and binimetinib in GIST (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The lack of <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> or other MAPK pathway druggable genetic perturbations (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic>) further corroborates the concept that the treatment effect is due to on-target effect of ETV1. These studies highlight the clinical usefulness of discovering and targeting the lineage-specific dependence on ETV1 in GISTs. They also posit that the KIT/MEK inhibitor combination may be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy in SDH-deficient GISTs and possibly other GISTs with different genetic permutations but similar lineage-dependence and worth exploring further in future clinical trials with larger patient cohorts and more definitive efficacy endpoints.</p>
