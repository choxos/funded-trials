              <abstract>
                <p>Mindfulness meditation may improve well-being at work; however, effects on food cravings and metabolic health are not well known. We tested effects of digital meditation, alone or in combination with a healthy eating program, on perceived stress, cravings, and adiposity. We randomized 161 participants with overweight and moderate stress to digital meditation (‘MED,’ <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 38), digital meditation + healthy eating (‘MED+HE,’ <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 40), active control (‘HE,’ <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 41), or waitlist control (‘WL,’ n = 42) for 8 weeks. Participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 145; M(SD) BMI: 30.8 (5.4) kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed baseline and 8-week measures of stress (Perceived Stress Scale), cravings (Food Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire) and adiposity (sagittal diameter and BMI). ANCOVAs revealed that those randomized to MED or MED+HE (vs. HE or WL) showed decreases in perceived stress (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic> = 15.19, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .10) and sagittal diameter (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic> = 4.59, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .04), with no differences in cravings or BMI. Those high in binge eating who received MED or MED+HE showed decreases in sagittal diameter (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .03). Those with greater adherence to MED or MED+HE had greater reductions in stress, cravings, and adiposity (<italic toggle="yes">ps</italic> &lt; .05). A brief digital mindfulness-based program is a low-cost method for reducing perceptions of stress and improving abdominal fat distribution patterns among adults with overweight and moderate stress. Future work should seek to clarify mechanisms by which such interventions contribute to improvements in health.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Obesity remains a public health crisis [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and it is highly comorbid with work-related stress [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Work stress contributes to an estimated 5–8% of annual healthcare costs in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate associations between high work stress and worse self-reported mental and physical health, including depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Mindfulness meditation may improve well-being in workplace settings [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mindfulness, in general, aims to cultivate a non-judging awareness of experiences in the present moment and promote adaptive self-regulation [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mindfulness-based psychological interventions decrease perceptions of stress in non-clinical populations [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and improve psychosocial outcomes in clinical populations with anxiety and depression [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent data indicate that mindfulness-based trainings delivered in the workplace decrease global perceptions of psychological stress in healthy adults [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, traditional in-person practice cannot be easily scaled and disseminated, making them less cost-effective than other approaches. In the current study, we used a commercially available digitally-delivered meditation platform.</p>
              <p>Overeating drive patterns, such as food cravings and binge eating, may explain the links between work stress and obesity. These eating patterns are strongly associated with obesity [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and worsened metabolic health [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] affecting up to 30% of those who seek weight-loss treatment [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Overeating drive may uniquely predict the development of cardiovascular and endocrine disorders, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes, even after accounting for obesity status [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These data support the importance of overeating drive as a behavioral target.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness-based approaches may be a promising avenue for targeting reductions in overeating drive, including food cravings, and downstream metabolic outcomes. Mindfulness-based approaches are not diet-based, thus appealing to those with overeating drive patterns, who may have had many unsuccessful dieting attempts. There is little data assessing whether mindfulness approaches promote improvements in metabolic outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It also remains unclear for whom mindfulness-based approaches are best suited. Our prior work on a weight loss intervention demonstrated that those with a tendency toward binge eating showed greater improvements in a range of weight-related factors following a mindfulness intervention compared to those without binge eating [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, mindfulness-based approaches may be a better fit for adults with obesity and overeating drive, in comparison to standard behavioral weight loss interventions.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness training delivered via a self-guided smartphone app may offer a convenient alternative to in-person treatment, though research on their efficacy is limited [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Three small studies using smartphone apps to deliver mindfulness interventions to healthy adults found benefits comparable to traditional delivery methods on subjective well-being, depressive symptoms, and compassion [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. App-based interventions also offer the benefit of standardization of instruction across participants, as well as the ability for participants to control where and when they access the intervention, and objective measures of adherence, rather than self-report. Digital mindfulness interventions demonstrate significant reductions in perceived stress and increases in subjective mindfulness, compared to a wait list condition, among non-clinical populations [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of digital occupational mental health interventions [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which included mindfulness-based programs, found small, positive effects on psychological well-being and work effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Treatment adherence to digitally-based mindfulness interventions is an understudied, yet probable moderator of treatment effects. In a recent 8-week pilot, Carolan and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found greater treatment engagement in digital programs incorporating a discussion group. It is also unknown whether digitally-based mindfulness interventions improve overeating drive or metabolic health. A recent meta-analysis [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] of in-person work-based mindfulness meditation programs found them generally effective in lowering cortisol production, heart rate, and sympathetic activity. Previous work using in-person mindfulness has shown that mindful eating training reduces abdominal fat without reducing overall body mass index [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">The Current Study</italic>: To test the effects of digital meditation on stress, cravings, and abdominal adiposity, we tested 4 conditions including an active control group with information about healthy eating, and a no treatment wait list control. The healthy eating program, which we considered to be an “active control” condition, utilized mindfulness-based and motivational approaches to improve eating behaviors. We aimed to test whether digital meditation could out-perform an active control condition that was matched for time and attention and other non-specific intervention effects [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We were interested in whether the adjunctive treatment offered from the healthy eating program would further improve outcomes compared to digital mindfulness alone.</p>
              <p>We aimed to examine the effects of treatment randomization on global perceptions of psychological distress [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and overeating drive [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Secondarily, we examined treatment effects on body mass index (BMI) and sagittal diameter. Finally, we examined the influence of treatment adherence (total minutes participants engaged in meditation on the app) on treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that mindfulness (in either form) would out-perform either control condition with respect to improvements in primary and secondary outcomes, and that treatment adherence would moderate these effects. We also anticipated that the combination of digital mindfulness + healthy eating (vs. digital mindfulness alone) would promote the greatest improvements. We also endeavored to examine the potential moderating role of binge eating presence. We hypothesized that those with binge eating would derive the greatest benefit from a mindfulness-based digital intervention, whereas those without binge eating would show no differences in outcomes across interventions.</p>

                <title>Study overview</title>
                <p>We aimed to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention vs. an active or wait list control, on subjective measures of perceived stress, food cravings, and adiposity in a sample of employees at a large university with overweight and obesity who reported mild to moderate stress (NCT03945214). We randomized participants to 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available application, Headspace), a healthy eating intervention (active control), a digital meditation + healthy eating intervention, or a waitlist control condition. We asked all participants to complete questionnaires and anthropomorphic measurements at an in-person clinic visit at baseline and week 8. Adherence to the digital meditation intervention was tracked remotely by Headspace.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Eligible participants were ≥18 years old, employed at a large academic medical center, had a BMI equal to or greater than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, reported mild to moderate levels of stress in the previous month (as determined by a Perceived Stress Scale score of 15 or higher), and had daily access to a smartphone or computer. Exclusion criteria included being an experienced meditator (defined as 3 times per week for 10 minutes or more). We obtained written informed consent from all study participants. We aimed to enroll up to 150 participants. Our prior study [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] detected effects in a sample of &lt;250 participants. We therefore expected that our sample size of 150 would be well-powered to detect improvements in our self-report measures in response to our treatment intervention. The university’s Institutional review board (IRB) approved all aspects of this study. Participants did not receive monetary compensation; however they received a one-year subscription to Headspace (value of $150), and were entered into a raffle drawing to win a 2-night expenses paid vacation in the local Bay Area.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Participants completed baseline assessment procedures, including measures of body composition and self-report assessments. Study personnel then randomly assigned participants to one of four possible conditions, using factorial assignment, on Qualtrics: (1) Meditation only, (2) Healthy Eating only, (3) Meditation + Healthy Eating, or (4) Waitlist control. The sequence of assignments was generated ahead of time with a computer script by a statistician who was not involved in running the study. Study personnel were not able to access the file containing the sequence of assignments or to see the next condition in the sequence until the moment they randomized the participant. Both participants and study staff were unblinded to the assignment after allocation. We re-assessed participants on all measures collected at baseline (body composition, self-report assessments) again at 8 weeks from randomization.</p>

                  <p>We provided participants with access to digitally-based meditation program (Headspace app- Basics + ‘Letting go of stress’ packs) and asked them to engage with the app for at least 10 minutes a day for 8 weeks. We contacted participants who completed less than one meditation in the previous 10 to 17 days via phone, in order to re-engage them with the program. Participants were expected to meditate 5 days per week over the course of 8 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Healthy eating group (‘HE’)</title>
                  <p>Within week 1, we provided participants with an in-person 50-minute counseling session with a trained health counselor geared towards developing goals to improve eating behavior, along with three 10-minute booster phone calls at weeks 1, 4, and 8. The counseling session incorporated a motivational interviewing framework to assess areas of concern around eating behavior and to establish specific and achievable eating-related goals. We also asked participants to engage with a digitally-based mindful eating program once per week for 8 weeks, and sent text message reminders 3 times per week to increase accountability towards eating-related goals. The digitally-based mindful eating program was created specifically for this study by the research team, and was primarily a secured website that included information on mindful eating, and audio tools for mindful eating practice (~3–5 minute practices). This password-secured website contained up to six different brief audio exercises using mindful eating and urge-surfing strategies. The audio exercises were scripted and recorded by the study’s first author and adapted from a number of mindful eating resources including the mindfulness-based eating awareness training (MB-EAT) curriculum [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We instructed participants to access these audios during high vulnerability times for compulsive eating. For example, for those who identify cravings as a potent trigger for problematic consumption, participants could access a brief urge-surfing exercise to learn how to ‘ride out’ a craving. Participants had a total of approximately 1.5–2 hours of contact with a counselor, and were expected to engage with the online resources 1 day per week over the course of 8 weeks. The program is adapted from several sources, including motivational interviewing for binge eating, weight management, and sugar-sweetened beverage intake (from our recently completed trial), and mindfulness-based eating awareness training.</p>

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] is a 10-item self-report questionnaire that measures a persons’ evaluation of the life stress they have experienced over the previous month, and has been extensively validated. The PSS has a total score scale range of 0 to 40, with higher values indicating more perceived stress. The PSS has demonstrated adequate reliability and validity among similar populations [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

                  <p>The Food Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire (FAAQ) measures acceptance of urges and cravings to eat or the extent to which individuals might try to control or change these thoughts [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The FAAQ is made up of 10 items, each rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = <italic toggle="yes">very seldom true</italic> to 6 = <italic toggle="yes">always true</italic>). It has a total score scale range of 10 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater acceptance of motivations to eat and greater tolerance for food cravings.

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Binge presence</italic>. We used the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns –5 (QEWP-5) to determine the presence of binge eating. The QEWP-5 [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] is a 24-item questionnaire that assesses frequency of reported binge eating and loss of control eating episodes, which has been shown to have reasonable agreement with interview-based measures such as the Eating Disorder Examination [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Binge presence was defined by the endorsement of the following: 1- <italic toggle="yes">During the last 3 months</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">did you ever eat</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">in a short period of time- for example</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">a two hour period- what most people would think was an unusually large amount of food</italic>?<italic toggle="yes">; 2- During the times when you ate an unusually large amount of food</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">did you often feel you could not stop eating or control what or how much you were eating</italic>?</p>

                  <p>Adherence to either meditation program (MED or MED+HE) was calculated by summing the total number of minutes spent meditating via Headspace over 8 weeks. The research team had access to individual user data via Headspace, in order to make these calculations. We also assessed meditation frequency with the following questions: “How often did you practice sitting meditation (for 10 min or more) in the past 8 weeks?” Participants selected of the following options: never, less than once a week, 1–3 times per month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, or every day. We used this information to ensure that those in the control conditions (active and wait list control) abstained from meditation practice throughout the intervention period.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Participants with overweight and moderate stress, who received either one of the digitally-based mindfulness programs showed expected reductions in perceived stress, thus confirming prior findings [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We also found a small, but significant treatment effect on reductions in sagittal diameter. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no treatment effect on food cravings or BMI. In an exploratory analysis, we found that meditators who also reported binge eating significantly reduced sagittal diameter.</p>
              <p>We found preliminary evidence for a moderating effect of treatment adherence on reductions in perceived stress. Furthermore, meditation frequency was positively associated with greater tolerance for food cravings and decreases in sagittal diameter. It is plausible that treatment adherence, measured by meditation frequency using the Headspace app, accounts for treatment effects in a dose-like fashion, and suggests a <underline>mechanistic</underline> pathway, promoting reductions in stress, food cravings, and abdominal fat.</p>
              <p>Few digitally-based mindfulness interventions have examined treatment effects on weight and metabolic outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We found a small but significant treatment effect on reductions in sagittal diameter, despite no reductions in BMI. In-person mindfulness interventions have improved some physiological outcomes, including blood pressure, glucose, and abdominal fat [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280808.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] despite no changes in BMI. To our knowledge, this is this first <underline>digitally</underline>-based mindfulness intervention to observe such an effect on abdominal fat distribution. Given the main effect of treatment adherence on reductions in sagittal diameter, it is plausible that this effect is mediated by stress-related pathways, including reductions in cortisol. We found that reduction in perceived stress were associated with reductions in sagittal diameter and increases in awareness of food cravings (<italic toggle="yes">ps</italic>≤.05). It is plausible that participants who received digital mindfulness may make healthier eating choices (e.g., increased mindfulness around satiety/hunger) which may contribute to downstream metabolic improvements. However, we were not adequately powered to test such a mechanistic pathway. This finding may also point to the importance of measuring abdominal fat distribution, in addition to BMI, in mindfulness-based digital trials.</p>
              <p>Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find a treatment effect on food cravings. However, the mindfulness groups reduced in binge eating (although this finding approached statistical significance). Thus, we were unable to replicate known effects of in-person mindfulness-based and mindful eating-based interventions on reductions in dysregulated eating [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further, the addition of a healthy eating program did not add a beneficial effect to our primary or secondary outcomes. Both digital mindfulness groups (alone or with healthy eating) performed equally well with regard to reductions in perceived stress and sagittal diameter.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that the healthy eating (active control) program was newly developed, and in need of further refining following feasibility and acceptability testing. Participants randomized to healthy eating showed good adherence (only 4% declined participation following the initial counseling session). The majority (73%) of participants rated the program as ‘good’ to ‘excellent’, and 91% of completers would recommend the program. Thus, while the healthy eating program, as packaged, did not reduce our measures of food craving, the feasibility data provided the necessary preliminary evidence for future refinement and testing. Qualitative data point to the potential added value of face-to-face counseling to establish health-related eating goals. It is plausible that participants first need to learn general mindfulness skills before showing eating-related improvements.</p>
              <p>Finally, while exploratory in nature, we replicated our prior findings with regard to treatment matching [<xref rid="pone.0280808.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], such that participants with baseline binge presence showed the greatest decreases in sagittal diameter in the meditation (vs. no-meditation) group. These findings suggest that mindfulness may be a better fit for adults with overweight <underline>and</underline> overeating drive, in comparison to treatment as usual. We did not actively recruit participants high in binge eating, although nearly 40% endorsed engaging in some level of binge eating. Future RCTs should specifically seek to recruit adults with both overweight and binge eating, to fully examine whether mindfulness-based digital approaches contribute to greater improvements in psychological and metabolic health among this high-risk group.</p>
              <p>This study had several strengths. We were able to deliver a primarily self-guided, scalable treatment for meditation to adults who experienced both perceived stress and overweight. We observed generally good adherence to our digital intervention, with only 11% being lost to follow-up. We had the added benefit of being able to compare our treatment (mindfulness) to what we considered to be an active control (healthy eating) matched for time and attention. However, our study was likely limited by a sample size that may have been too small to detect modest interaction effects. We were unable to truly ascertain whether participants in either control condition were accessing mindfulness programs or apps during the 8 week intervention period. Further, our measures of dysregulated eating may not fully reflect non-homeostatic eating behavior (vs. a semi-structured interview measure of eating pathology), and the scoring metrics for the FAAQ (a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6) without the option for including negative (e.g., -1, -2) response may not yield particularly meaningful arithmetic means. Finally, our sample of participants were highly educated and primarily White. Thus, our findings may not fully generalize to the US population of adults with overweight.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>A brief digital mindfulness-based intervention is a low-cost method to reduce perceived measures of stress and may have the potential to reduce abdominal fat distribution among adults with overweight and moderate stress. These findings add to the existing literature documenting salutary effects of mindfulness on reports of well-being and extends it to digital-based mindfulness interventions. Future work should seek to clarify mechanisms by which digitally-based mindfulness interventions may contribute to improvements in psychological and physiological health.</p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Important note: This review pertains only to ‘statistical aspects’ of the study and so ‘clinical aspects’ [like medical importance, relevance of the study, ‘clinical significance and implication(s)’ of the whole study, etc.] are to be evaluated [should be assessed] separately/independently. Further please note that any ‘statistical review’ is generally done under the assumption that (such) study specific methodological [as well as execution] issues are perfectly taken care of by the investigator(s). This review is not an exception to that and so does not cover clinical aspects {however, seldom comments are made only if those issues are intimately / scientifically related &amp; intermingle with ‘statistical aspects’ of the study}. Agreed that ‘statistical methods’ are used as just tools here, however, they are vital part of methodology [and so should be given due importance].</p>
              <p>COMMENTS: It is definitely a good study and is planned as well as executed nicely. However, I have few doubts [these respected actions may be correct but need explanations/clarifications/justifications. Please take them as suggestions]. The first is: ‘Why there were two control groups [active control (‘HE,’ n=41), or waitlist control (‘WL,’ n=42)] in the study?’ [You may know that ‘Permuted Block Randomization’ ensures same group sizes (not]. Role/importance/necessity of ‘waitlist controls’ in any Psychology study is well-known. However, why two control groups?</p>
              <p>Next is: Tool used to measure ‘perceived stress’ should have been mentioned in the abstract itself [as it is a Primary Outcome Measure]. In the ‘Abstract-Results’ section you said “Those with greater adherence to MED or MED+HE had greater reductions in stress [, cravings, and adiposity (ps&lt;.05)]” but not mentioned tool or table (where this change is displayed and tested). Much later in line 156, you mentioned that the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used. Is that alright?</p>
              <p>The Food Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire (FAAQ) was used to measure acceptance of urges and cravings to eat. Since the FAAQ is {made up of 10 items, each} rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1=very seldom true to 6=always true) and might have included ‘not true’ (negative) response also, which needs reverse scoring (very often). Also in this context, please note that the following {which is pasted from one standard textbook on ‘Research Methodology’ and I am sure that the authors already know these things, however, it is very essential to keep the limitations in mind while interpreting results [note that I am not asking you to change the study design]}:</p>
              <p>Whenever response options ranged from 1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree (or ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) or from 1=very bad to 3=neither good nor bad to 5=very good), while using a ‘Likert’ scale responses, recoding [like strongly disagree=-2, disagree=-1, neutral=0, agree=1, strongly agree=2] may yield correct and meaningful ‘arithmetic mean’ which is useful not only for comparison but has absolute meaning, in my opinion. Application of any statistical test(s) assume that meaning of entity used (mean, SD, etc) has a particular meaning. Though ‘α’ [alpha] or most other measures of reliability/correlation will remain same, however, use of non-parametric methods should/may be preferred while dealing with data yielded by any questionnaire/score.</p>
              <p>Further note that though the measures/tools used are appropriate, most of them yield data that are in [at the most] ‘ordinal’ level of measurement [and not in ratio level of measurement for sure {as the score two times higher does not indicate presence of that parameter/phenomenon as double (for example, a Visual Analogue Scales VAS score or say ‘depression/stress’ score)}]. Then application of suitable non-parametric test(s) is/are indicated/advisable [even if distribution may be ‘Gaussian’ (i.e., normal)]. Agreed that there is/are no non-parametric test(s)/technique(s) available to be used as alternative in all situation(s) [suitable / most desired/applicable], but should be used whenever/wherever they are available.</p>
              <p>As you know well that while reporting [findings from] ‘Clinical Trial’ one should follow CONSORT guidelines. Even important items {like How sample size was determined (Item 7a), Random Sequence generation (Item 8a), Allocation concealment (Item 9), Blinding (Item 11a)} of/in CONSORT checklist are not found [since your article type is ‘Clinical Trial’, you are supposed to cover these items in the report]. How you arrived at this sample size [with complete estimation procedure] must be described in details as ultimately you had to say (lines 371-2 that ‘our study was likely limited by a sample size that may have been too small to detect modest interaction effects’}. Fig 1. CONSORT Flow Diagram is alright but covers only about flow of cases/numbers.</p>
              <p>There are only two tables in the manuscript – one on baseline demographics and the other on baseline heath characteristics – remaining vital information [mainly comparison statistics] are put/presented in either text or figures. But remember that (in my opinion) figures are complementary and not alternatives of/to tables. One good thing is that there is no statistical comparison of baseline characteristics [read the following]:</p>
              <p>To provide a description of baseline characteristics is entirely reasonable (since it is clearly important in assessing to whom the results of the trial can be applied), however, statistical comparison of baseline characteristics is not desirable at all [because even if P-value turns out to be significant (while comparing baseline characteristics despite random allocation), it is, by definition, a false positive] as you then are supposed to be testing ‘randomization’ then, which in any single trial may not balance all baseline characteristics [particularly when sample sizes are small] because ‘randomization’ is a sort of ‘insurance’ and not a guarantee scheme.</p>
              <p>Is not it essential to adjust P-value(s) even if ‘series of Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)’ are used/applied as it a sort of multiple testing (multiple comparisons) problem/issue?</p>
              <p>Except these few points, this manuscript is alright and I have no hesitation to recommend acceptance after minor revision.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Title: The coma (,) in the randomized controlled trial shall be excluded.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Tischer,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to submit a revised version of our research article, entitled Impact of digital meditation on work stress and health outcomes among adults with overweight: A randomized controlled trial for consideration of publication in PLOS ONE. We are grateful for the reviewers’ thoughtful feedback and have included our detailed responses below. We have also highlighted changes throughout our manuscript using tracked changes.</p>
              <p>Response to Editor and Reviewer Comments: </p>
              <p>Editor’s comments:</p>
              <p>• Provision of CONSORT checklist- this is now included</p>
              <p>• Include marked up copy of manuscript with tracked changes as well as unmarked version without tracked changes- these are now included</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>• This review pertains only to ‘statistical aspects’ of the study and so ‘clinical aspects’ [like medical importance, relevance of the study, ‘clinical significance and implication(s)’ of the whole study, etc.] are to be evaluated [should be assessed] separately/independently. Further please note that any ‘statistical review’ is generally done under the assumption that (such) study specific methodological [as well as execution] issues are perfectly taken care of by the investigator(s). This review is not an exception to that and so does not cover clinical aspects (however, seldom comments are made only if those issues are intimately / scientifically related &amp; intermingle with ‘statistical aspects’ of the study). Agreed that ‘statistical methods’ are used as just tools here, however, they are vital part of methodology [and so should be given due importance]. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: Noted. We appreciate this reviewer’s keen insights with regard to statistical aspects of this study. We feel this reviewer’s feedback has greatly enhanced the quality and rigor of the manuscript. </p>
              <p>• It is definitely a good study and is planned as well as executed nicely. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for your positive feedback regarding the manuscript’s methodology.</p>
              <p>• Why there were two control groups [active control (‘HE,’ n=41), or waitlist control (‘WL,’ n=42)] in the study?’ [You may know that ‘Permuted Block Randomization’ ensures same group sizes (not]. Role/importance/necessity of ‘waitlist controls’ in any Psychology study is well-known. However, why two control groups? </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for this important question. We felt that the addition of an active control group (‘healthy eating’) which did not include a general mindfulness component, but which was matched for time and attention and other non-specific intervention effects, would allow us to test whether meditation could “out-perform” both a waitlist control (with no treatment or attention components whatsoever) and an active control (that featured some clinical attention and some general health guidelines around eating, generally thought to be a non-specific treatment component for improving eating behavior). The issue of adding an active control group to clinical trials has been receiving more and more attention in recent years, particularly in psychological intervention research, and is generally considered advantageous to a purely waitlist control condition (Kinser &amp; Robins, 2013). We have added this clarification to lines 102-103:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> We aimed to test whether digital meditation could out-perform an active control condition that was matched for time and attention and other non-specific intervention effects (Kinser &amp; Robins, 2013).</p>
              <p>• Tool used to measure ‘perceived stress’ should have been mentioned in the abstract itself [as it is a Primary Outcome Measure]. In the ‘Abstract-Results’ section you said “Those with greater adherence to MED or MED+HE had greater reductions in stress [, cravings, and adiposity (ps&lt;.05)]” but not mentioned tool or table (where this change is displayed and tested). Much later in line 156, you mentioned that the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used. Is that alright? </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for noting this oversight. We have added more specificity about primary and secondary outcomes measures to the abstract, on lines 30-31: </p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Participants (n=145; M(SD) BMI: 30.8 (5.4) kg/m2) completed baseline and 8-week measures of stress (Perceived Stress Scale), cravings (Food Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire) and adiposity (sagittal diameter and BMI).</p>
              <p>• The Food Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire (FAAQ) was used to measure acceptance of urges and cravings to eat. Since the FAAQ is (made up of 10 items, each) rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1=very seldom true to 6=always true) and might have included ‘not true’ (negative) response also, which needs reverse scoring (very often). Also in this context, please note that the following (which is pasted from one standard textbook on ‘Research Methodology’ and I am sure that the authors already know these things, however, it is very essential to keep the limitations in mind while interpreting results [note that I am not asking you to change the study design]: Whenever response options ranged from 1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree (or ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) or from 1=very bad to 3=neither good nor bad to 5=very good), while using a ‘Likert’ scale responses, recoding [like strongly disagree=-2, disagree=-1, neutral=0, agree=1, strongly agree=2] may yield correct and meaningful ‘arithmetic mean’ which is useful not only for comparison but has absolute meaning, in my opinion. Application of any statistical test(s) assume that meaning of entity used (mean, SD, etc) has a particular meaning. Though ‘α’ [alpha] or most other measures of reliability/correlation will remain same, however, use of non- parametric methods should/may be preferred while dealing with data yielded by any questionnaire/score. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for noting the limitation of the way in which the FAAQ is scored using a 6-point Likert scale, without the option for negative or not true responses. We have kept the scoring to be consistent with conventional scoring approaches for this measure (Juarascio, Forman, Timko, Butryn, &amp; Goodwin, 2011), to ensure ease of comparison of FAAQ scores across manuscripts. However, we acknowledge this scoring limitation in our discussion section, on lines 467-470:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Further, our measures of dysregulated eating may not fully reflect non-homeostatic eating behavior (vs. a semi-structured interview measure of eating pathology), and the scoring metrics for the FAAQ (a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6) without the option for including negative (e.g., -1, -2) response may not yield particularly meaningful arithmetic means. </p>
              <p>• Further note that though the measures/tools used are appropriate, most of them yield data that are in [at the most] ‘ordinal’ level of measurement [and not in ratio level of measurement for sure (as the score two times higher does not indicate presence of that parameter/phenomenon as double (for example, a Visual Analogue Scales VAS score or say ‘depression/stress’ score)]. Then application of suitable non-parametric test(s) is/are indicated/advisable [even if distribution may be ‘Gaussian’ (i.e., normal)]. Agreed that there is/are no non-parametric test(s)/technique(s) available to be used as alternative in all situation(s) [suitable / most desired/applicable], but should be used whenever/wherever they are available. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for noting the limitation of survey measures that yield data in the ordinal level of measurement (e.g., PSS, FAAQ). Per this reviewer’s suggestion, we have run non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test, instead of ANOVA) for outcome measures using ordinal level measurement (PSS and FAAQ) where possible, and yielded nearly identical findings as with our parametric tests. Due to space limitations we have not included these findings in the manuscript, but we acknowledge the following on lines 322-323, and lines 342-343:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Findings were identical when using non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis), given the ordinal nature of the PSS scoring.</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Findings were identical when using non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis), given the ordinal nature of the FAAQ scoring.</p>
              <p>• As you know well that while reporting [findings from] ‘Clinical Trial’ one should follow CONSORT guidelines. Even important items (like How sample size was determined (Item 7a), Random Sequence generation (Item 8a), Allocation concealment (Item 9), Blinding (Item 11a)) of/in CONSORT checklist are not found [since your article type is ‘Clinical Trial’, you are supposed to cover these items in the report]. How you arrived at this sample size [with complete estimation procedure] must be described in details as ultimately you had to say (lines 371-2 that ‘our study was likely limited by a sample size that may have been too small to detect modest interaction effects’). Fig 1. CONSORT Flow Diagram is alright but covers only about flow of cases/numbers. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for noting this oversight. Most of these details required by CONSORT guidelines are contained within our Supplemental CONSORT Study protocol, which has now been submitted to the editor. We have also added most of these details throughout the manuscript. For instance, on lines 133-136 and on lines 142-148, respectively, we have added the following:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> We aimed to enroll up to 150 participants. Our prior study (Bostock, Crosswell, Prather, &amp; Steptoe, 2019) detected effects in a sample of &lt;250 participants. We therefore expected that our sample size of 150 would be well-powered to detect improvements in our self-report measures in response to our treatment intervention. </p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Study personnel then randomly assigned participants to one of four possible conditions, using factorial assignment, on Qualtrics…. Study personnel were not able to access the file containing the sequence of assignments or to see the next condition in the sequence until the moment they randomized the participant. </p>
              <p>• There are only two tables in the manuscript – one on baseline demographics and the other on baseline heath characteristics – remaining vital information [mainly comparison statistics] are put/presented in either text or figures. But remember that (in my opinion) figures are complementary and not alternatives of/to tables. One good thing is that there is no statistical comparison of baseline characteristics [read the following]:</p>
              <p>To provide a description of baseline characteristics is entirely reasonable (since it is clearly important in assessing to whom the results of the trial can be applied), however, statistical comparison of baseline characteristics is not desirable at all [because even if P-value turns out to be significant (while comparing baseline characteristics despite random allocation), it is, by definition, a false positive] as you then are supposed to be testing ‘randomization’ then, which in any single trial may not balance all baseline characteristics [particularly when sample sizes are small] because ‘randomization’ is a sort of ‘insurance’ and not a guarantee scheme. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for this comment and completely agree that baseline characteristics should not include any sort of statistical comparison. We also agree with this reviewer that figures are considered complementary, and have thus included all relevant and necessary statistics pertaining to these figures within the text of the manuscript. </p>
              <p>• Is not it essential to adjust P-value(s) even if ‘series of Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)’ are used/applied as it a sort of multiple testing (multiple comparisons) problem/issue? </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for this keen observation regarding multiple comparisons using ANCOVA. Notably, all of our results remained similar when adjusting for multiple comparisons (using a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of .03 (.05/2) for each ANCOVA model). </p>
              <p>• Except these few points, this manuscript is alright and I have no hesitation to recommend acceptance after minor revision. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for your positive feedback regarding the overall quality of the manuscript, and appreciate the keen attention to statistical concerns throughout. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
              <p>• Title: The coma (,) in the randomized controlled trial shall be excluded. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We thank this reviewer for noting this oversight and have removed the comma from the title (Line 4). </p>
              <p>• Materials and Methods: </p>
              <p>• Under “Interventions”, please specify the frequency (e.g.. on a daily basis or at least N number of days per week of the 8-weeks intervention. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We have added frequency of contact/involvement for each intervention category. Lines 155-186 now say:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Meditation group (‘MED’)…Participants were expected to meditate 5 days per week over the course of 8 weeks</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Healthy eating group (‘HE’)… Participants had a total of approximately 1.5-2 hours of contact with a counselor, and were expected to engage with the online resources 1 day per week over the course of 8 weeks.</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Meditation + Healthy eating group (‘MED+HE’)… Participants were expected to meditate 5 days per week over the course of 8 weeks and they had a total of approximately 1.5-2 hours of contact with a counselor, and were expected to engage with the online resources 1 day per week over the course of 8 weeks.</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> Waitlist control condition (‘WL’)… Participants had no contact with a study counselor over the course of the 8 week intervention period.</p>
              <p>• Also, please include how the researchers have verified whether the participants had used the app in the given period.</p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: The research team had access to user data through Headspace, and were able to calculate total number of minutes spent meditating. This information has been added to lines 238-239:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> The research team had access to individual user data via Headspace, in order to make these calculations.</p>
              <p>• For HE Group, when was the counseling conducted? Was it at the beginning of the intervention?</p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: The counseling session was conducted at the very beginning of the intervention, within week one. This information has been added to line 158. </p>
              <p>• Please elaborate on the “digitally-based mindful eating program.” Include name of the app, duration of the mindful eating practice and how the usage per user was assured.</p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: The digitally-based mindful eating program was created specifically for this study by the research team, and was primarily a secured website that included information on mindful eating, and audio tools for mindful eating practice (~3-5 minute practices). These details have now been added to lines 164-166.</p>
              <p>• Did you check if the waitlist control group had already access to Headspace or other mindfulness apps like Calm? Have you also considered previous experience of (all) the participants with regard to mindfulness or other meditation practices?</p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We did not provide Headspace access codes to WL participants until after they completed a 2-month follow-up questionnaire. However, we had no way of objectively verifying whether participants already had subscriptions to other mindfulness apps. We excluded individuals who indicated they were experienced meditators (defined as 3 times per week for 10 minutes or more), and at baseline, participants reported meditating less than once a week; in fact, the majority (79%) indicated that they had never meditated, and only 4% indicated that they meditated 1-2 times per week prior to treatment randomization (Table 2). Given that so few individuals indicated prior experience with meditation, we did not examine this baseline characteristic as a treatment covariate. We have noted the limitation of being unable to objectively verify access to meditation programs for those in our control conditions to lines 465-467:</p>
              <p>�<!-- &#x0f0a7; --> We were unable to truly ascertain whether participants in either control condition were accessing mindfulness programs or apps during the 8 week intervention period. </p>
              <p>• Under “Measures”, please include the reliability and validity of the instruments used. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We appreciate this feedback, and we have now included relevant psychometric properties of each of the instruments used (PSS, FAAQ, and QEWP-5) throughout the measures section (Lines 193-231). </p>
              <p>• Discussion and Conclusion: </p>
              <p>• Please separate Conclusion as a distinct section. </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We have now created a Conclusion section that is distinct from the Discussion section (Line 473), and which highlights the clinical implications of the study.</p>

              <p>We are pleased to submit a revised version of our research article, entitled Impact of digital meditation on work stress and health outcomes among adults with overweight: A randomized controlled trial for consideration of publication in PLOS ONE. We are pleased to learn that the previous peer reviewers were satisfied with our edits and responsiveness to earlier feedback. We are grateful for your thoughtful additional feedback and have included our detailed responses below. We have also highlighted changes throughout our manuscript using tracked changes.</p>
              <p>Response to Editor Comments: </p>
              <p>Editor’s queries:</p>
              <p>• The manuscript mentions a "digitally-based mindful eating program" which was created for this study and provided to participants via a secured website. However, it is not clear what this program entailed, how it was designed and if it is intended to be provided as a commercial product. Please respond to the editor's queries regarding this issue. Please provide further information on the “digitally-based mindful eating program.” Please include in the manuscript a brief outline of the material in the digitally-based mindful eating program and how it was designed.</p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: We developed a brief mindful eating program for this study, geared towards helping participants develop goals to improve eating behavior (e.g., to reduce compulsive eating and increase mindful eating). This program was in the early, pilot stages (NCT03945214, funded through the first author’s K23: 1K23AT011048) to assess feasibility and acceptability. Given its early stages of development, the program is not intended to be provided as a commercial product. It is in need of further refinement and tailoring for specific populations who struggle with binge eating before it can be offered as a commercial product. The program included a combination of both an in-person motivational-interviewing-based counseling session, text message support, and access to a website that provided audio exercises and tools to practice eating mindfully, including tools to ride out urges to overeat. The audio exercises were scripted and recorded by the study’s first author and adapted from a number of mindful eating resources including the MB-EAT curriculum. </p>
              <p>We developed the brief mindful eating program for this study, geared towards helping participants develop goals to reduce compulsive eating and increase mindful eating. This program was in the pilot stages to assess feasibility and acceptability. The program is adapted from several sources, including motivational interviewing for binge eating,1 weight management,2,3 and sugar-sweetened beverage intake (from our recently completed trial),4 and mindfulness-based eating awareness training.5 The program is comprised of an initial one-on-one counseling session, three booster calls during the 8-week intervention period, engagement with an online mindful eating program with instruction on mindful eating practices, and text message reminders of support three times a week. During the session, trained health counselors follow a semi-structured protocol of: (1) engaging participants in a conversation about the concerns they have about their eating (2) identifying vulnerabilities for challenging eating patterns, (3) asking participants to consider why/how making changes to eating would be important for them, (4) identifying perceived barriers to changing eating habits, (5) providing psychoeducation on sugar intake, stress eating, and their links with health, (6) collaborating with participants on specific, achievable eating-related goals, (7) identifying motivational factors, (8) engaging participants to rate level of confidence and self-efficacy in making changes, and (9) guiding participants through a brief mindful eating exercise using a bite-sized snack of their choice. Participants were then given access to a password-secured website which contained up to six different brief audio exercises using mindful eating and urge-surfing strategies. They were instructed to access these audios during high vulnerability times for compulsive eating. For example, for those who identify cravings as a potent trigger for problematic consumption, participants could access a brief urge-surfing exercise to learn how to ‘ride out’ a craving. </p>
              <p>The following details about the digital component of the program have now been added to the manuscript (lines 157-163): </p>

              <p>• Are there any previous publications describing the program or research that underpins it? If so please cite them in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: The program is adapted from several sources, including motivational interviewing for binge eating,1 weight management,2,3 and sugar-sweetened beverage intake (from our recently completed trial),4 and mindfulness-based eating awareness training.5 However, the current manuscript is the first to describe the program in its current form. The following details have now been added to the manuscript (lines 165-167): </p>

              <p>• Is there any public-facing information about the program accessible to readers? If so, please add links to relevant webpages as citation(s). Guidelines for formatting references to online sources are here: hfps://journals.<ext-link xlink:href="http://plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-references" ext-link-type="uri">plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-references</ext-link></p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: This program was in the early, pilot stages (NCT03945214, funded through the first author’s K23: 1K23AT011048) to assess feasibility and acceptability. Given its early stages of development, the program is not yet accessible to readers in public-facing formats such as public webpages. </p>
              <p>• Is the program associated with a commercial provider and/or patent or is it intended to be provided commercially in the future? If so, are any of the authors associated with the commercial provider or patent? Please review PLOS's Competing Interest policy and ensure all potential competing interests are declared (hfps://journals.<ext-link xlink:href="http://plos.org/plosone/s/compeUng-interests" ext-link-type="uri">plos.org/plosone/s/compeUng-interests</ext-link>) </p>
              <p>o RESPONSE: As described previously, this program was in the early, pilot stages (NCT03945214, funded through the first author’s K23: 1K23AT011048) to assess feasibility and acceptability. Given its early stages of development, the program is not intended to be provided as a commercial product.
