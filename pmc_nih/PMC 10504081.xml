                <p id="Par1">Upper-extremity impairment after stroke remains a major therapeutic challenge and a target of neuromodulation treatment efforts. In this open-label, non-randomized phase I trial, we applied deep brain stimulation to the cerebellar dentate nucleus combined with renewed physical rehabilitation to promote functional reorganization of ipsilesional cortex in 12 individuals with persistent (1–3 years), moderate-to-severe upper-extremity impairment. No serious perioperative or stimulation-related adverse events were encountered, with participants demonstrating a seven-point median improvement on the Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment. All individuals who enrolled with partial preservation of distal motor function exceeded minimal clinically important difference regardless of time since stroke, with a median improvement of 15 Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment points. These robust functional gains were directly correlated with cortical reorganization evidenced by increased ipsilesional metabolism. Our findings support the safety and feasibility of deep brain stimulation to the cerebellar dentate nucleus as a promising tool for modulation of late-stage neuroplasticity for functional recovery and the need for larger clinical trials.

              <p id="Par3">Ischemic stroke can have devastating consequences to individuals and their families while simultaneously carrying a high social and economic burden. Major advances have been achieved in prevention and treatment of stroke by means of population-health management of risk factors and acute interventions. Innovation and development of new technologies have played a substantial role in improving outcomes in the early hours after insult, including advances in emergency healthcare delivery networks, imaging technologies and medical devices. The same cannot be said, however, for the post-acute phase where, despite substantial effort and investment, technological leaps have been slower. Even with contemporary techniques, up to 50% of survivors experience chronic disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> after stroke and often require the assistance of others to complete activities of daily living.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Neuroplasticity is a well-documented phenomenon that is associated with gradual spontaneous or therapy-driven improvements in post-stroke motor function. The extent of recovery varies considerably across individuals and is known to depend largely on lesion location and size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the timing of acute and post-acute interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, genetic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and preexisting comorbidities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Harnessing the potential of neuroplasticity and modulating its extent and timing remains a major frontier in medicine with vast upside and has been the focus of our group. A wide range of neurostimulation-based treatment approaches aimed at modulating neuroplasticity and improving outcomes are currently under exploration at preclinical and clinical phases. These include targeting ipsilesional cortex directly using noninvasive techniques or surgically implanted electrode grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> as well as efforts aimed at the peripheral nervous system that include the recently approved use of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We have proposed and investigated a new, invasive surgical approach for extending the degree and temporal window of neuroplasticity after ischemic and traumatic insults to the brain. Specifically, the approach involves continuous stimulation of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) to modulate neural activity and ipsilesional cortical excitability through activation of the robust, endogenous dentatothalamocortical pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This central hypothesis is supported by extensive invasive and noninvasive electrophysiological investigation of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway over the past decades in the feline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, rodent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and nonhuman primate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> models as well as in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The crossed, reciprocal cerebello-cortical pathways have been shown to be highly relevant to motor function and post-stroke rehabilitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, as originally evidenced by crossed-cerebellar diaschisis phenomenology and its influence on recovery of motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our prior work in preclinical rodent models of ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, corroborated by subsequent, independent work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, supports our central hypothesis that DN deep brain stimulation (DBS) can promote recovery of function and ipsilesional cortical reorganization. Behavioral improvements were further associated with increments in ipsilesional cortical excitability, synaptogenesis, reorganization of motor representation of the affected limb, and greater expression of markers of long-term potentiation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Illustrated overview of dentatothalamocortical pathway depicting a single deep brain stimulation lead implanted in the left dentate nucleus (brown).</title><p>The crossed dentatothalamic projections (blue in upper-left illustration) terminate across multiple contralateral thalamic (green) nuclei that, in turn, project (orange), to broad regions of cerebral cortex.

              <p id="Par6">Here we report a first-in-human translation of this research in a group of 12 stroke survivors with persistent, moderate-to-severe upper-extremity impairment. In this open-label, phase I clinical trial, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of surgical implantation and chronic DBS of the cerebellar DN. Overall, we found that our surgical approach and chronic stimulation was feasible and well tolerated in the target population, with no study-related serious adverse events encountered across the trial. Additionally, participants underwent a battery of secondary assessments to begin to characterize and understand the effect of therapy on upper-extremity motor impairment and function. We report significant improvements in motor function across all individuals who, at the time of enrollment, had even minimal residual distal motor function in the affected upper extremity and correlated effects on cortical metabolism. Of particular interest to stroke survivors, the magnitude of benefit was not found to depend on time after stroke, with robust improvements observed in participants who enrolled as late as 3 years after their index event. These early findings support that this new neuromodulation-based approach is safe and feasible in a moderately-to-severely impaired post-stroke population and shows promise for promoting recovery of function and influencing neuroplastic processes after cerebral ischemia, even in the later stages of disability.</p>

Each candidate had to show persistent moderate-to-severe upper-extremity hemiparesis and sufficient upper-extremity motor ability to engage in rehabilitation (<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) and meet inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A total of 11,541 individuals were assessed for eligibility, with 11,459 not having sufficient information on electronic medical records, failing to meet inclusion criteria or meeting exclusion criteria. Of the 82 individuals contacted regarding participation, 67 declined. As a result, a total of 15 individuals were enrolled, with 3 candidates subsequently classified as screen failures and exiting the study before surgery (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). The 12 remaining candidates participated in an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm trial, where individual participation spanned 20–24 months and included monthly assessments performed to record safety data and secondary metrics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Participant recruitment began on 1 June 2016. The first and last candidates for the trial were enrolled on 26 October 2016 and 6 August 2020, respectively. The final participant appointment for data collection was in November 2022. All patient appointments and data collection were performed at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus in Cleveland, Ohio. All participants underwent unilateral implantation of a single DBS lead in the contralesional DN (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) at the Cleveland Clinic between December 2016 and September 2020.

Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> depicts each participant’s FM-UE score for each monthly visit. Those data are further summarized as change scores across each of the five phases of the study in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. Overall, we recorded a median decrease of 0.5 points (not significant) on the FM-UE between the pre-surgery and post-surgery time points for the full sample of participants, supporting the safety of the surgical implant procedure. Thereafter, we observed a modest three-point (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) median improvement across the pre-stimulation, rehab-only phase followed by an additional seven-point improvement when rehabilitation was combined with DN-DBS (DBS + rehab phase; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005). During the 2-month, rehab-carryover phase, which consisted of continued physical rehabilitation as DBS was weaned (weekly 25% amplitude reductions over the first month) and then OFF (second month), no further change in FM-UE was observed (median change in FM-UE = 0; not significant). Finally, the median FM-UE score for the full cohort again remained unchanged at the end of the long-term follow-up phase, supporting the durability of the previously realized, treatment-related gains.</p>

              <p id="Par15">Data from this phase I trial of 12 individuals with chronic, moderate-to-severe post-stroke motor impairment support the safety and feasibility of chronic stimulation of the ascending cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Furthermore, it provides an in-human demonstration of significant and clinically meaningful effects of DN-DBS combined with rehabilitation on motor impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and distal motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This cohort with chronic, upper-extremity motor deficits was enrolled 1 to 3 years following their index middle cerebral artery infarction and underwent unilateral DBS targeting the contralesional cerebellar DN area without any major perioperative complications (for example, infection, hemorrhage or death). Although open-label, DN-DBS-related improvements on the FM-UE and AMAT met or exceeded established minimal CID thresholds. Finally, a post hoc analysis revealed that participants with preservation of some degree of distal motor function at enrollment showed significantly larger effects than those without such preservation.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Stroke remains the leading cause of physical disability in the industrialized world, with post-acute care costs exceeding those of acute hospital care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As most survivors are left with substantial residual impairment despite contemporary rehabilitation efforts, there is growing interest in developing adjuvant, neurostimulation-based treatments to synergistically influence mechanisms underlying rehabilitation and improve long-term outcomes. While noninvasive approaches continue to be investigated, more recent efforts have begun to explore invasive, surgical alternatives, including direct cortical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and VNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast to current noninvasive technologies, these surgically implanted options can provide more continuous, at-home or demand-based, modulatory effects. One of the earliest efforts in this realm sought to enhance chronic post-stroke upper-extremity function through direct, epidural, electrical stimulation of perilesional cortex. Despite promising preclinical rodent and nonhuman primate as well as early clinical trial data, data from the phase III trial failed to meet its intended primary end point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Reasons for this translational failure remain unclear but may in part be attributable to the overall integrity of the corticospinal pathways across participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or the limited capability of cortical surface stimulation to fully penetrate the gyrencephalic human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Finally, and more recently, a randomized-controlled trial has shown that VNS was associated with improved outcomes compared to surgical controls, albeit with modest treatment effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">We observed significant and meaningful benefits in the form of both a reduction of motor impairment and gains in motor function in this cohort. It is noteworthy that these improvements were achieved: (1) in patients with overall poor function at enrollment, evidenced by a mean FM-UE of 22.9 points, and deemed to have poor natural prognosis and (2) after participants underwent a 3-month period of supervised rehabilitation aimed at minimizing the impact of renewed rehabilitation alone on impairment and function. In line with prior reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, severity appeared to play a role in the degree of individual benefit achieved, as participants with at least minimally preserved distal motor function showed a robust, 15-point median improvement during the DBS + rehab phase. Lastly, we did not observe a correlation between time after stroke and motor improvements associated with DBS + rehab. As such, participants who were enrolled at 3 years after stroke still demonstrated effects of large magnitude, which counters the expectation that time after stroke might limit treatment-related benefit. These findings are important as they support the potential of DN-DBS to widen the therapeutic window of opportunity for stroke survivors. Overall, these observations provide encouragement for further investigation and valuable insight for refining the target population in the next, randomized-controlled, trial.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Given our prior animal model evidence that potentiation of corticomotor excitability and ipsilesional reorganization mediates the therapeutic effects of DN-DBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we applied PET as an exploratory approach to characterize treatment-related changes in cerebello-cortical physiology. In comparing pre-DBS + rehab versus post-DBS + rehab data, we observed significant group-level changes in perilesional metabolism, with subregional changes in metabolism in the majority of motor-associated cortices. In particular, changes in pre-DBS + rehab versus post-DBS + rehab PET data in ventral pre-motor cortex were found to be correlated with gains on the AMAT. Unlike FM-UE, which is a measure of gross motor impairment, AMAT is a measure of distal motor function and coordination and is therefore more physiologically dependent on the evolutionary specialization of motor cortices on distal control and finger movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Other ipsilesional motor-associated brain regions showed significant gains in pre-DBS + rehab versus post-DBS + rehab PET data that were not statistically significantly associated with functional changes. The lack of significant association between functional changes and metabolic changes in other motor areas may be consequent to effect variances in a small sample due to variabilities in stroke location or in damage along the dentatothalamocortical pathway. Overall, these findings are in line with our preclinical data and corroborate the effects of DN-DBS on ipsilesional cortical reorganization in late stages after stroke.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The study has limitations inherent to an early stage, Phase 1 investigation. Overall interpretation of the data presented is limited by the open-label nature of the design, the heterogeneity in baseline impairment level across the sample population, and, finally, the limited size of that same sample that are typical of a phase I neurological device trial. The latter two issues likely contributed to the lack of observed effects on several of the additional secondary measures applied, including the Nine-Hole Peg Test, the Bilateral Box and Block Test and the EQ-5D. Next, although we made some effort to overcome confounds related to chronic physical deconditioning before initiating DBS by including a rehabilitation-only phase, we are not able to distinguish, with certainty, the effects of rehabilitation from the effects of DBS. This is particularly the case given that structured rehabilitation has been shown to result in meaningful improvements even in chronic post-stroke stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, while the magnitude of effects observed during the rehab+DBS phase are encouraging, only a subsequent, randomized-controlled trial will truly measure the contribution of DN-DBS to chronic recovery. To that end, all analyses of secondary measures should be considered exploratory, with the primary purpose of informing subsequent trials. The duration of treatment and improvement in function are intrinsically linked in our sample, as continued improvement was a prerequisite for additional time on treatment. Notably, no patients in the non-preserved group demonstrated a level of improvement to have treatment time extended. Finally, interpretation of the PET data presented were similarly limited by the small sample size, variability in stroke lesion location, and the lack of a control group.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In summary, this phase I study presents the first evidence of safety and feasibility of DN-DBS in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis with encouraging rehabilitative effects and associated neurophysiological gains observed across the DBS + rehab phase. This emerging intervention has shown translational potential to modulate the magnitude of neuroplastic reorganization toward recovery of function and to extend its time window to late phases of disability.</p>

Participation spanned 20–24 months, with monthly assessments performed to record safety data and secondary metrics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Following enrollment, participants underwent 1 month of upper-extremity rehabilitation twice per week to rule out potential for recovery with rehabilitation therapy alone. Thereafter, each participant underwent surgical implantation of the DBS system, with the lead implanted in the DN contralateral to the stroke-affected cerebral hemisphere in light of the predominantly crossed nature of this ascending cerebello-cortical projection. After a 1-month post-operative recovery without rehabilitation, twice-weekly physical rehabilitation was resumed for an additional 2 months (rehab-only phase). The enrollment of participants who had completed rehabilitation after stroke and the additional inclusion of 3 months of structured rehabilitation before activation of DBS was aimed at establishing a baseline before activating DBS and reducing confounds related to the effects of rehabilitation alone or exercise overcoming the effects of chronic deconditioning. Participants then entered the programming phase (4–10 weeks in tandem with a once-weekly therapy visit), during which the optimal stimulation parameters were determined. Once established, participants entered the DBS + rehab phase, where DBS was delivered continuously (that is, 24 h a day) for a minimum period of 4 months (maximum of 8 months) while participants continued twice-weekly sessions of in-clinic rehabilitation combined with an at-home program. At the end of the DBS + rehab phase, each participant entered the rehab-carryover phase and was weaned from stimulation, with pulse amplitude reduced in increments of 25% per week over 1 month followed by an additional month of continued rehabilitation therapy without stimulation. If treatment-related gains did not drop by more than 50% after stimulation was discontinued, participants underwent surgical explant of the DBS hardware followed by three long-term follow-up visits at 1, 2 and 6 months after explant.</p>

                <title>Adverse events—primary outcome</title>
                <p id="Par29">Adverse events, including serious safety events, device-related events and unanticipated events were actively monitored in scheduled and unscheduled visits by the research team. The definitions for adverse events and serious adverse events followed the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines where adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in participants, users or other persons whether or not related to the investigational medical device. Adverse events included all hospitalizations and events related to the investigational device or the comparator. This included events related to the procedures involved (any procedure in the clinical investigation plan). For users or other persons, this was restricted to events related to the investigational medical device. Adverse events did not include conditions preexisting to the participant’s enrollment. Preexisting conditions were not reported as adverse events unless the condition had an increased occurrence or intensity. Serious adverse events were defined as adverse events that (a) led to a death; (b) led to a serious deterioration in health that resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, or resulted in a substantial disruption in ability to conduct normal life functions; (c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect; (d) when the event did not fit the above outcomes, but the event may have jeopardized the patient and may have required medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes. It did not include in-patient hospitalization for a planned study procedure. Serious adverse events included device deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event if (a) suitable action had not been taken or (b) intervention had not been made. A planned hospitalization for preexisting conditions, or a procedure required by the Clinical Investigation Plan, without a serious deterioration in health or to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, was not considered to be a serious adverse event. Adverse events were reviewed by the principal investigator and DMC, and recorded in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations for Medical Devices guidelines. Source documentation was provided to the study sponsors. Monthly checks of DBS hardware integrity were established by recording electrical impedance values.</p>

                <title>Efficacy assessment—unblinded</title>
                <p id="Par30">All efficacy assessments were performed, unblinded and in person, as secondary measures for this phase 1 trial. Data were collected monthly from the presurgical baseline through 4 months after the DBS + rehab phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>: month 0 through ‘+4’) followed by a final, long-term follow-up assessment 10 months after the end of the DBS + rehab phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>: ‘+10’ visit at 18–22 months after surgery). The variability in study timeline across participants was directly related to the duration of the individual participant’s DBS + rehab phase, which varied between 4 and 8 months depending upon the observed rate of recovery (see the summary of changes to protocol in the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). Secondary measures, including the FM-UE and AMAT, were included to offer estimates of treatment efficacy defined in the context of upper-extremity impairment and FA. The first motor outcome measure, used to determine inclusion/exclusion eligibility and then repeated throughout the study, was the FM-UE; a widely used, disease-specific impairment index designed to assess post-stroke hemiplegia recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The total score was derived by summing its four subsections (A, upper extremity; B, wrist; C, hand; and D, coordination/speed (maximum total = 66 points)), with lower scores indicating greater impairment. Initial assessments were performed at screening and presurgical baseline. The threshold for minimal CID was established as five points, consistent with established standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The second motor outcome measure examined was the AMAT, which serves as a measure of distal motor function and coordination. Both the functional assessment and QoM subscales were scored. Combined, the FM-UE and AMAT are considered to provide a comprehensive view of motor behavior changes that are relevant to the post-stroke population.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Several other secondary measures were collected as part of this initial phase I exploration, including the Nine-Hole Peg Test, the Bilateral Box and Block Test, the Bimanual Grip Test, the Modified Ashworth Scale, the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the EQ-5D, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. These additional secondary metrics were included to monitor for any possible (then unknown) effects of DN-DBS on non-motor domains, including effects on spasticity, anxiety and depression; however, no significant changes were observed in this limited sample.

                  <p id="Par32">Brain imaging included T1-weighted volumetric MRI of the head (Magnetom Prisma; Siemens Healthineers) performed before implantation of the DBS lead. FDG PET/CT studies were performed (Biograph TruePoint; Siemens Healthineers), adding physical therapy to the routine clinical protocol for cerebral metabolic imaging. After fasting at least 4 h, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was injected, followed by 30 min of hand physical therapy during the uptake period. PET data were acquired for 15 min, beginning with an average of 38 min (range 29–71 min) after injection. For one participant, the images acquired at the rehab-only phase had excessive motion artifact and were omitted from analyses involving this time point. For each participant, PET images were aligned with the MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and stroke lesions were manually segmented on the MRI. Cortical segmentation was performed using FreeSurfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Perilesional cortex was defined as cortical tissue within a 10-mm dilation of the lesion using FSL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The ipsilesional motor-associated cortical regions were defined using the Human Motor Area Template and consisted of primary motor, primary somatosensory, supplementary motor, pre-SMA, dorsal and ventral pre-motor regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Contralesional occipital cortex was not expected to be affected by dentate stimulation; therefore, we defined nine control cortical regions in the occipital lobe from the FreeSurfer segmentation (cuneus gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, occipital pole, calcarine sulcus, middle occipital and lunatus sulci, superior and transverse occipital sulci, anterior occipital sulcus, occipitotemporal and lateral occipital sulci). Mean SUVRs in the perilesional, ipsilesional motor-associated and control occipital cortical regions were calculated relative to the mean radioactivity of contralesional cortex, excluding the Human Motor Area Template regions. As we are reporting mean values for each region, small inaccuracies in the regional borders are not expected to have a meaningful impact on our interpretation.</p>

Due to skewed distributions, change scores are summarized using medians with interquartile ranges. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test for a significant change at each time period by comparing change scores for each phase to zero. Descriptive statistics with confidence intervals, for the full sample and for the sample stratified by functional preservation at baseline, are presented in the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>.

              <p>Raw data related to safety and feasibility, the primary endpoints of the study, can be shared upon request and review by Cleveland Clinic and the study sponsors. Secondary endpoint data and PET imaging data, analyzed or raw, may also be shared. Depending on the data that are requested, we will need to consult with the IRB and sponsors before sharing. Cleveland Clinic has regulations related to data sharing, in particular data that could be used as identifiers. The investigators and the IRB will need to verify that data sharing would be acceptable and within policy for patient protection and within the limits of the informed consent provided by participants when enrolling in the study. The investigators will also have to consult the sponsors before data sharing. Patient-related information not included in this report was collected as part of a clinical trial and may be subject to patient confidentiality.</p>
              <p>Given the restricted study population and small sample size, even though any dataset will be stripped of identifiers before release for sharing, we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of participants by unique combinations of characteristics. Therefore, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for a commitment to: (1) using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</p>
              <p>Requests for data can be sent to A.G.M. All requests will be answered within 4 weeks. We anticipate that data will be shared, if there are no risks or low risks to the participants.</p>
