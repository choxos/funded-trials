                <title>INTRODUCTION:</title>
                <p>An estimated 15%–29% of patients report new gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) while 4%–31% report new depressive symptoms. These symptoms may be secondary to gut microbiome tryptophan metabolism and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-based signaling.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS:</title>
                  <p>This study used specimens from 2 patient cohorts: (i) fecal samples from patients with acute COVID-19 who participated in a randomized controlled trial testing prebiotic fiber and (ii) blood samples from patients with acute COVID-19. Six months after recovering from COVID-19, both cohorts answered questions related to GI symptoms and anxiety or depression. Microbiome composition and function, focusing on tryptophan metabolism-associated pathways, and plasma 5-HT were assessed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS:</title>
                  <p>In the first cohort (n = 13), gut microbiome L-tryptophan biosynthesis during acute COVID-19 was decreased among those who developed more severe GI symptoms (2.0-fold lower log activity comparing those with the most severe GI symptoms vs those with no symptoms, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.06). All tryptophan pathways showed decreased activity among those with more GI symptoms. The same pathways were also decreased in those with the most severe mental health symptoms after COVID-19. In an untargeted analysis, 5 additional metabolic pathways significantly differed based on subsequent development of GI symptoms. In the second cohort (n = 39), plasma 5-HT concentration at the time of COVID-19 was increased 5.1-fold in those with GI symptoms alone compared with those with mental health symptoms alone (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>DISCUSSION:</title>
                  <p>Acute gut microbiome-mediated reduction in 5-HT signaling may contribute to long-term GI and mental health symptoms after COVID-19. Future studies should explore modification of 5-HT signaling to reduce post-COVID symptoms.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a common sequela of acute coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), with surveys suggesting a 15%–29% prevalence of at least 1 GI symptom at 6 months after infection (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The development of chronic GI symptoms after infection is not unique to COVID-19, and post-COVID GI symptoms may be understood using the framework of postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Approximately 10% of patients meet criteria for IBS 1 year after diagnosis with infectious enteritis (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The cause of PI-IBS is unknown but may be related to changes in serotonergic signaling and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) metabolism (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Anxiety and depression are established risk factors for the development of PI-IBS (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and 5-HT is a key enteric neurotransmitter, with roles in activating peristalsis and secretory functions (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>The gut microbiota influences 5-HT through the production and metabolism of tryptophan, the rate-limiting precursor of 5-HT (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Postprandial 5-HT concentrations have been associated with IBS subtypes (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and patients with IBS can have decreased nocturnal levels of tryptophan metabolites (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Furthermore, acute tryptophan depletion induces IBS-C-like symptoms and brain patterns on functional MRI in healthy controls, supporting the role of 5-HT as a modulator of the brain-gut microbiome axis (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Patients with PI-IBS have increased mucosal 5-HT containing enterochromaffin cells (EC) and also differ from healthy controls in microbiome composition (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is uncertain whether GI symptoms that arise after COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms that arise after PI-IBS from non-COVID infectious causes. There is a mechanistic rationale for considering COVID-19 as a cause of PI-IBS. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus that causes COVID-19 actively replicates within the GI mucosa (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Acute COVID-19 alters the gut microbiome (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), although it is unclear whether these alterations are caused by the receipt of antibiotics and other medical interventions or by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic> (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). At the same time, pandemic-related stress and anxiety (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)—established risk factors for IBS—are also crucial determinants of who gets long-term GI symptoms after COVID-19 (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Anxiety and depression are relatively common after COVID-19, with the frequency of depression ranging from 4% to 31% and anxiety 6%–63% (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) A prospective cohort of patients with long COVID-19 symptoms found a high prevalence of depression (15%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (22%) (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
              <p>This study investigated the hypothesis that alterations in gut microbial tryptophan metabolism during COVID-19 lead to decreased 5-HT signaling and post-COVID GI symptoms. We sought to assay both longitudinal fecal microbial samples and plasma samples for 5-HT; however, we did not have access to stool and blood samples from a single cohort. Instead, we combined data from 2 similar COVID-19 cohorts, one which provided serial fecal samples and another which provided blood samples. Both cohorts answered clinical questions related to GI and mental health symptoms at baseline and 6 months after diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>

                  <p>This was a substudy conducted within a parent double-blinded randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 assignment of patients to placebo, inulin 16 g/d, or inulin 32 g/d given in 2 divided doses for 7 days (NCT03865706). At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the parent trial was paused and patients with moderate severity COVID-19 were randomly assigned the trial intervention. Patients aged 18 years and older were included if they reported that they were free from chronic GI symptoms at baseline and required hospitalization, but not intensive care unit-level care, for COVID-19 before June 1, 2020, and received broad-spectrum antibiotics within 24 hours before enrollment. Both the parent study and this substudy were approved by the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board.</p>

                  <p>Six months after COVID-19 diagnosis, patients were contacted by telephone and asked questions evaluating Rome IV criteria for IBS. All patients completed the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), although none met formal IBS criteria (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The IBS-SSS was selected rather than competing instruments because it has been highly validated in non-COVID cohorts, and it was used to classify GI symptoms as none/mild (IBS-SSS &lt;50, which was approximately the median in the cohort), mild/moderate (IBS-SSS 50–200), or moderate/severe (&gt;200, which was the 90th percentile in the cohort). Combined symptoms of anxiety/depression were reported using the EQ-5D-5L (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) as a 4-point Likert scale (no symptoms, mild, moderate, or severe) because none of the respondents were in the most severe level 5 category.</p>

                  <p>Tryptophan is the rate-limiting precursor of 5-HT and is metabolized by the gut microbiome. The 6 major metabolic pathways related to tryptophan were designated <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> for analysis (BioCyC ID numbers 6629, TRPSYN, NADSYN, 6505, 5651, and 5655). Of these, only PWY-6629 and TRPSYN-PWY (the 2 major superpathways for L-tryptophan biosynthesis) were represented in &gt;50% of samples and were analyzed. In both pathways, decreased tryptophan biosynthesis was observed among those with increased GI symptoms (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The patient with the most severe symptoms (IBS-SSS &gt; 200) had diarrhea predominantly, but further subtyping of symptoms could not be performed because of the limited number of patients within categories.</p>

GI and depression/anxiety symptoms were classified in 13 patients at 6 months of follow-up after COVID-19. Tryptophan metabolism was imputed from 16S sequencing results from longitudinal samples gathered for up to 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. GI symptoms were classified based on IBS-SSS points and depression/anxiety symptoms based on responses to EQ-5D-5L, which characterizes depression/anxiety on a 4-point Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe). <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values are for a repeated-measures mixed model incorporating between-patients and within-patients effects.

Decreased activity within the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway was correlated with an increased severity of mental health symptoms (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 in both pathways). When GI and mental health symptoms were classified in a factorial manner, a similar pattern was seen (see Figure S1, Supplementary Digital Content 2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/CTG/A872" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/CTG/A872</ext-link>). In an untargeted analysis, there were no differential compositional features based on IBS groups but there were 5 differential metabolic pathways, all related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). All of these showed significant differences in tryptophan biosynthesis activity between the groups with the least and most GI symptoms.</p>

Six months after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis, 31% of patients reported sadness and 51% reported anxiety, with 54% reporting either symptom. The median 5-HT concentration was significantly lower among those who reported sadness (19,415 vs 27,637 pg/mL, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.028), anxiety (19,415 vs 32,553 pg/mL, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01), or either symptom (19,158 vs 32,953 pg/mL, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) compared with those who did not.

Patients were then categorized into 4 groups according to the presence of both post-COVID anxiety or sadness and post-COVID GI symptoms in a factorial manner. Plasma 5-HT concentrations were highest among those without symptoms, lowest among those with anxiety or sadness only, and intermediate among those with mixed GI and anxiety or sadness symptoms (Kruskal-Wallis test for a difference between groups <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02, Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>New GI symptoms are common after COVID-19 (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these symptoms are unknown, and 1 hypothesis likens the problem to PI-IBS. It has been postulated in PI-IBS that the gut microbiome alteration leads to persistent changes in the host—perhaps mediated through serotonergic signaling—to cause IBS-like symptoms. This study interrogated a 5-HT-based explanatory mechanism for post-COVID GI symptoms. Two distinct cohorts were used. Within the first cohort, which provided stool samples, there was decreased microbial tryptophan biosynthesis based on the subsequent development of GI symptoms. Within the second cohort, which provided blood samples, there was a decrease in plasma 5-HT concentrations associated with the subsequent development of sadness or anxiety and GI symptoms (but not GI symptoms alone). In both cohorts, there were significant differences in tryptophan biosynthesis or 5-HT concentrations when comparing patients with neither, either, or both GI and mental health symptoms, suggesting an interaction between these symptoms, which is consistent both with prior research and with the established relationship between IBS and mental health (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence for potential biological links between COVID-19 and long-term disorders of gut-brain interactions such as IBS. We view these results as a first step which may help delineate areas for future research.</p>
              <p>Our study found significant differences in microbial tryptophan biosynthesis—prespecified as the outcome of interest—comparing those with or without new GI symptoms 6 months after COVID-19. Some of these differences were large in magnitude. Previous studies have also found decreased serum tryptophan metabolites among patients with COVID-19 which may be unsurprising because COVID-19 is an inflammatory state and shunting of tryptophan toward its main metabolite, kynurenine, is a feature of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In an untargeted analysis of serum metabolites, Thomas et al. identified decreased tryptophan production as the most prominent feature distinguishing patients with acute COVID-19 from controls (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In a different cohort, the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan was highest among those with acute COVID-19, middling in acutely ill controls, and lowest in healthy controls (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Using serial samples, Ansone et al. (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) found that serum L-tryptophan levels were depleted during acute COVID-19 and recovered only 47% during 40 days of follow-up. Our results suggesting that there may be reduced gut microbial tryptophan biosynthesis in patients with more severe post-COVID GI and anxiety/depression is novel yet mesh with previous studies.</p>
              <p>We also found differences based on GI symptoms in 5 untargeted microbial metabolic pathways. Four of the 5 differentially expressed pathways were directly related to aerobic respiration through the TCA cycle (i.e., production of adenosine triphosphate [ATP]); the fifth pathway was related to thiazole biosynthesis of thiamine (vitamin B1), an essential cofactor for the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, which oxidizes glucose into the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle is closely associated with serotonin synthesis (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and all the pathways showed the same directionality (decreased activity among those with more GI symptoms). Liu et al. (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) recently reported on 106 patients with COVID-19 and identified 32 metabolic pathways that differed based on postacute COVID-19 syndrome (primarily fatigue). Interestingly, all the pathways identified in this study were associated with ATP production, which mediates intestinal injury in animal models (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). This may be a fruitful area for future studies.</p>
              <p>Serotonin is produced in intestinal EC from tryptophan and may be elevated or decreased among patients with postinfection IBS compared with controls (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In this study, we did not have blood samples from the same cohort that provided gut microbiome samples, so to address the question of plasma 5-HT concentrations, we gathered blood samples from a separate cohort of patients who similarly completed the 6-month follow-up after COVID-19 infection. Most of bodily 5-HT is synthesized within the intestinal epithelium and is stored within platelets. It is thus conceivable that plasma 5-HT concentrations reflect the local levels produced by EC cells (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Plasma 5-HT concentrations have been reported to be increased in patients with acute COVID-19 presenting with diarrhea, but there have been no previous studies evaluating the association between 5-HT and chronic post-COVID GI symptoms (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our analysis showed that 5-HT concentrations at the time of acute COVID-19 were lower in patients who later reported COVID-related sadness or anxiety; there was evidence of an interaction between sadness/anxiety and GI symptoms, and the lowest 5-HT concentrations were observed in those with COVID-related sadness/anxiety but not GI symptoms. Only 8% of patients reported significant mental health symptoms before COVID-19, compared with 54% 6 months after COVID-19, mirroring other studies which show a large increase in the mental health burden after recovery from COVID-19 (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It is unclear whether these new symptoms are due to the virus itself, the sequelae of hospitalization, the toll of other coexisting long COVID-19 symptoms, or nonmedical stressors related to the pandemic. It is likely that mental health symptoms are both a cause and an effect of chronic GI symptoms after COVID-19 infection, and the observation that patients with the lowest 5-HT concentrations had highly increased odds of reporting new anxiety or sadness 6 months later supports the role of 5-HT in mediating symptoms after COVID-19 infection. The efficacy of serotonin-modulating medications for treating COVID-related depression, anxiety, or IBS should be further investigated.</p>
              <p>This study has several key strengths. COVID-19 disease severity and antibiotic administration (in the microbiome cohort) were homogeneous. In previous studies, these 2 factors—disease severity and receipt of antibiotics—have been the main drivers of observed microbiome differences (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). This study was longitudinal, with follow-up after 6 months and, in the cohort providing fecal samples, gathered serial samples from individual patients. It interrogated a specific hypothesis, derived from prior literature on postinfection IBS, and tested this hypothesis in multiple ways (i.e., using both stool and blood samples).</p>
              <p>This study also has limitations. The sample size was small, especially in the cohort providing fecal samples. 5-HT concentrations were measured at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and were not obtained postprandially (which is when differences between IBS phenotypes and controls are most apparent), and there may be significant differences in serotonin signaling that become apparent in the months after COVID-19. The severity of GI symptoms in cohort 1 was assessed using IBS-SSS, but none of the patients met Rome criteria for IBS, and most had mild symptoms. Using the standard IBS-SSS would have meant that almost all our patients were rated as mild, leaving no groups to compare. Instead, we used the approximate median IBS-SSS score (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) to divide the cohort in half and then selected the 90th percentile of the IBS-SSS score (200) to define (relatively) severe symptoms (IBS-SSS &gt;200). Another limitation arises from the fact that 2 different cohorts were initially designed as separate studies, resulting in different methods for assessing self-reported mental health symptoms in both cohorts because the primary authors did not have input on the questionnaire for cohort 2. Therefore, cohort 2 assessed self-reported sadness and anxiety separately while cohort 1 assessed combined symptoms of anxiety/depression together. These self-reported symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of a clinical psychiatric diagnosis. Furthermore, the specific timing and use of psychotropic medications during the 6 months after COVID-19 infection were unknown, which may affect the severity of such symptoms. Finally, all the patients were unvaccinated patients from the first wave of the pandemic, and their results may not be generalizable to later waves of patients.</p>
              <p>In sum, this prospective study of patients with mild-to-moderate severity COVID-19 found decreased fecal microbial tryptophan biosynthesis and plasma 5-HT concentrations during acute COVID-19 that associated with GI symptoms 6 months later. Grouped symptoms of anxiety/depression interacted with gut microbiome tryptophan biosynthesis, and grouped symptoms of anxiety/sadness interacted with plasma 5-HT concentration. These findings are preliminary and derived from a relatively small number of patients. Nonetheless, they may help pave the way for longitudinal studies that address the role of the brain-gut axis and specifically whether serotonergic signaling mediates long COVID-19 GI and mental health-related symptomatology. Additional studies to compare serotonin levels in a larger cohort of patients meeting criteria for IBS and patients who were vs those who were not clinically diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety after COVID-19 infection, rather than relying on self-reported symptoms alone, would provide valuable additional information.</p>
