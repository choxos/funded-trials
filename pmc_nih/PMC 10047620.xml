                  <p>Implementing a health system-based hypertension programme may lower blood pressure (BP).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We performed a randomized, controlled pilot study to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a home-based virtual hypertension programme integrating evidence-based strategies to overcome current barriers to BP control. Trained clinical pharmacists staffed the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC) to remotely manage hypertension using a BP dashboard and phone “visits” to monitor BP, adherence, side effects of medications, and prescribe anti-hypertensives. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were identified via electronic health records. Enrolled patients were randomized to either vCCC or usual care for 3 months. We assessed patients’ home BP monitoring behaviour, and patients’, physicians’, and pharmacists’ perspectives on feasibility and acceptability of individual programme components.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Thirty-one patients (vCCC = 17, usual care = 14) from six physician clinics completed the pilot study. After 3 months, average BP decreased in the vCCC arm (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.01), but not in the control arm (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.45). The vCCC participants measured BP more (9.9 vs. 1.2 per week, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). There were no intervention-related adverse events. Participating physicians (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6), pharmacists (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5), and patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) rated all programme components with average scores of &gt;4.0, a pre-specified benchmark. Nine adaptations in vCCC design and delivery were made based on potential barriers to implementing the programme and suggestions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hypertension affects 1 in 3 US adults.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Intensive blood pressure (BP) control, can prevent &gt;100,000 deaths per year.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Even modest BP reductions can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Despite the benefits of BP reduction and multiple hypertension guidelines, hypertension control (defined as systolic BP [SBP] lower than 140 mmHg and diastolic BP level lower than 90 mmHg) has declined in recent years from 54% in 2013 to 44% in 2017.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Only half of hypertensive adults have adequately controlled BP.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Current processes for managing hypertension are largely based on clinic visit-based BP readings which are often inaccurate.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Limited time during clinic visits,<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> competing health conditions, long intervals between consecutive appointments, inadequate patient engagement,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and inability to monitor home BPs or adherence<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> without adding a significant burden<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref></sup> to patients and clinic staff are other barriers to achieving goal BP (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These barriers can be largely overcome by reorganizing the current model of hypertension management by leveraging new technology, implementation science, and a health system-wide team-based programme. We developed a home-based hypertension programme that combines multiple evidence-based strategies and integrates them within the clinic workflow. Through the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC) trained health system pharmacists remotely monitor and manage BP using phone visits to communicate with patients and electronic health records (EHR) to prescribe medications. Novel programme elements include automated pre-screening and identification of patients using EHR; an opt-out strategy for primary care physicians (PCPs); pharmacist-led management of hypertension in collaboration with PCPs; home BP cuffs that transfer data to a BP dashboard; pharmacist use of the dashboard to efficiently monitor home BP readings; and frequent communication with patients to promote patient education, engagement, and patient-centred individualized care. Although the elements of this programme are evidence-based, whether the vCCC package could be feasibly delivered and whether the elements of the programme would be acceptable to end users was unknown. Furthermore, the degree to which the initial EHR-based identification alerts, referral processes, dashboard monitoring, and care algorithms can be optimized was unknown.</p>

              <p>We conducted a pragmatic single-centre pilot study to assess critical implementation outcomes needed to scale up the hypertension programme (NCT04585880). The study was approved by the institutional review board.</p>
              <sec id="s7">
                <title>Patient identification and recruitment</title>
                <p>Patients aged ≥65 years with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled from six PCP clinics for a 3-month duration. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as (i) SBP &gt;140 mmHg at current visit and documented history of hypertension, (ii) SBP &gt;140 mmHg at current visit and at another visit in the last 18 months, or (iii) SBP &gt;160 mmHg at current visit. BP measured at an emergency department, inpatient, or surgical visit was not considered in determining eligibility as these readings are less likely to reflect usual BP control. We chose an age cut-off &gt;65 years as it is the age of Medicare enrolment and several outcomes for the larger study will be obtained from the Medicare data. Moreover, the reduction in cardiovascular events from BP lowering is likely to be more evident in older individuals. Using these criteria our EHR Reporting Workbench (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) identified potentially eligible patients and referred them at the point of care (i.e. in real-time) to the study team for pre-screening and enrolment. We applied broad inclusion criteria to recruit men and women, all racial and ethnic minorities, patients with multiple comorbidities, frailty, mobility limitations, and very old adults who are often excluded from explanatory studies. Patients with illness that could affect the safety or study completion, such as unstable psychiatric disorder, mental retardation, or other reasons that make them unable to sign their own consent, end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, or expected life expectancy &lt;2 years were excluded. The study was designed to be pragmatic (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) to allow transition to the real-world clinics. Clinical pharmacists from the PCP team delivered the intervention with flexible protocols. Phone visits reduced patient burden while continuing frequent contact. Potentially eligible patients were identified by the EHR. We used the EHR for initial patient identification. However, since all exclusion criteria couldn’t be done through the EHR, we had study coordinators screen and determine eligibility.</p>
                <p>Potentially eligible patients were contacted within 2 weeks of their primary care visit to determine eligibility. These eligibility criteria included access to a compatible smartphone or other devices, such as IOS, Android, or Amazon Kindle or Fire devices, sufficient fluency in English, adequate vision and hearing to complete study procedures, and interest). Informed consent was obtained remotely.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>All participants received an FDA-approved electronic BP cuff (QardioArm, Qardio Inc.) and educational material on hypertension in preparation for the baseline visit. During the baseline visit, study coordinators instructed patients on use of the BP cuff and the correct method of BP measurement. After a 5-min rest, three standardized BP measures, 1 min apart were obtained. If a BP reading was different by ≥20 mmHg from other two readings, it was discarded, and a fourth reading was taken to replace it. A symptom checklist and patient surveys were also obtained.</p>
                <p>After the baseline visit, participants were randomized to either a control group (usual care with education) or the vCCC group (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Randomization was done remotely. The study coordinator randomized the participant in the REDCap database (randomization prepared by the study statisticians) while the participant was still on the phone and provided them with instructions on how to proceed based on the study arm they were randomized to usual care with education or the virtual collaborative care clinic arm.</p>

                <title>Virtual collaborative care clinic</title>
                <p>The vCCC operated as an extension (not replacement) of care provided by PCPs. Trained, board-certified, or board-eligible ambulatory care clinical pharmacists already working for the health system staffed the vCCC. The vCCC pharmacists managed hypertension. They educated patients on home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), monitored home BP readings, adherence, and medication side effects. They used the EHR to communicate with physicians, order laboratory tests, e-prescribe medications, or make medication changes. To monitor longitudinal home BP readings, vCCC pharmacists used a BP dashboard (Qardio Inc) and a patient portal (Epic MyChart) and/or phone calls to communicate with patients. The BP dashboard used a traffic light system to organize and prioritize uncontrolled BP and individualize BP goals and alerts. The vCCC pharmacists communicated at least once a month with patients and as often as required. If a patient did not check BP regularly, pharmacists contacted the patient to address barriers to adherence.</p>
                <p>For patients randomized to the vCCC group, the vCCC pharmacist conducted a 15-min introductory phone call, reviewed current medications and BP history, and encouraged regular HBPM (at least 10 times a week, 5 in the morning and 5 in the evening). The control group was not contacted by the vCCC and continued regular follow-up with their physicians.</p>
                <p>The primary outcomes were programme feasibility and acceptability. Other outcomes included barrier and facilitator identification, safety, frequency of HBPM, and change in BP. Acceptability and feasibility of the programme were evaluated by assessing five programme components: automated referral, HBPM, pharmacist management, physician involvement, and the BP cuff. Only patients randomized to the vCCC rated pharmacist management and automated referral. Validated, 4-item scales: the Acceptability of Intervention Measure and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure were used.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. A minimum threshold of 4.0 on the Acceptability and Feasibility scales was established <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> to demonstrate acceptability and feasibility, a lower bound used in other intervention assessments.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Surveys included open-ended items. Patients evaluated programme components at the end-of-study visit while physicians and pharmacists evaluated them before enrolment and at 3 months after enrolment of the first patient. We used the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Disease (TICD) framework<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> for determinant evaluation. Like other determinant frameworks, the TICD assesses motivational, organizational, and capability domains, but also includes attributes of the intervention and focuses on guideline-based clinical care delivery. Safety was assessed by comparing the symptom checklists obtained at baseline and 3 months and reporting any new symptom or event as an adverse event. Frequencies of HBPM and home BP readings were monitored through the Qardio app.</p>

                <p>Qualitative data were coded using a combination of inductive coding and template analysis. One coder identified emerging themes among patient open-ended survey item responses and compared themes between patients randomized to the vCCC versus usual care. Qualitative data collected from pharmacists and physicians were coded to TICD domains. Data were combined, and barriers were assessed for potential intervention or study execution changes. Coded themes were reviewed by a second investigator and revised until consensus was reached. Potential changes were reported to the study team and evaluated for salience by the PAB before adaptations were made, resulting in a set of key recommendations for action.</p>
                <p>We adapted procedures so that all study operations, including recruitment, study visits, vCCC visits, PAB, and investigator meetings were done remotely for the safety of the patients, providers, and study staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

              <p>Six physicians (one from a community-based clinic, three from academic Family Medicine clinic, and two from academic Internal Medicine clinic) and five clinical pharmacists participated in the pilot study. Physicians were experienced (number of years in practice 13.3 ± 7.69), saw an average of 9 ± 0.71 patients per half day clinic, and had an average of 4.4 ± 2.30 clinics per week. All pharmacists were postgraduate year 2 ambulatory care residency trained.</p>
              <p>During the ~4.5-month recruitment period (from October 2020 to February 2021), the six physicians saw 994 patients who were 65 years or older (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The EHR Research Workbench identified 154 as potentially eligible based on BP and key demographic characteristics. Study staff review of the EHR found 62 of them to be ineligible (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) for various reasons, such as active cancer, decompensated cirrhosis, cirrhosis, significant grief from the loss of spouse with inability to complete examination, expressive aphasia, dementia, chronic hypoxic respiratory failure with significant weight loss, planned surgical procedures and memory problems due to stroke. Of the remaining 93, 42 declined participation, and 18 were not reachable. The study enrolled 32 patients; 1 patient did not get randomized as they could not complete baseline visit due to technical problems with the BP cuff; the remaining 31 patients completed the study, 17 in the vCCC arm and 14 in usual care arm.</p>

              <p>Among PAB and pharmacist interviews, we identified 15 potential barriers to implementing the hypertension programme and 9 potential facilitators across TICD domains. Adaptations in vCCC design and delivery were proposed to address barriers and aligned them with facilitators. The resulting nine key adaptations made to overcome the barriers are listed in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Most adaptations involved reframing or emphasizing existing key components of the programme in introductory and training materials, including an emphasis on co-management, rather than relinquishment of patient care to vCCC pharmacists; programme flexibility allowing the vCCC pharmacist to treat hypertension per physicians’ BP goals and medication preference; ensuring prompt call by the vCCC pharmacists after patients randomization to vCCC; and the role of the vCCC to reduce burden for both physicians and pharmacists. We changed the EHR pathway to access vCCC, improved the pharmacists reporting template, added a large BP cuff, and instituted a clinic staff notification campaign. To motivate patients to participate, we provided physicians with an EHR “smartphrase” informing patients about the programme to add to patients’ visit summary, and added information about hypertension, correct method of measuring BP, and the risks of uncontrolled hypertension to patient education materials.</p>

              <p>Qualitative results from patients were consistent with programme component ratings. Patient participants, regardless of study arm, liked the BP device and described relative advantage over other home BP devices, but did note the device’s short battery life (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Participants valued additional pharmacist involvement over usual physician care, which they also appreciated. An attribute mentioned <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> among qualitative responses was the programme’s comprehensiveness. The vCCC participants noted positive benefits, including increased knowledge, better BP management, and control.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a home-based hypertension control programme integrating multiple evidence-based strategies. We demonstrated that patients can be identified automatically from the EHR and managed by pharmacists in concert with their physicians, without safety concerns. Critical stakeholders—patients, physicians, and pharmacists—found the programme to be acceptable and feasible at a pre-specified level. The vCCC participants measured their BP more often and achieved greater reductions in BP compared to usual care participants. Although the study was not designed or powered to assess effectiveness, BP improved in the vCCC patients and not the controls, suggesting the vCCC is a promising implementation strategy and warranting confirmation in an effectiveness trial currently being conducted in two health systems.</p>
              <p>Out-of-office or home BP readings are recommended for diagnostic confirmation and management of hypertension because, if done correctly, HBPM provides more accurate BP readings than in-clinic BP readings.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Similar to other studies,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref></sup> we found that HBPM may be more effective when augmented with telemonitoring and/or counselling. Despite these data, and initiatives such as the Million Hearts initiative,<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> widespread implementation of HBPM is lacking.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref></sup> While HBPM is favoured by both patients and physicians, as in our study, implementing HBPM can be a logistical challenge without a structured programme that includes efficient ways to follow home BP readings and support for educating patients on proper techniques for measuring BP.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> While clinics are aware of “what” needs to be done, it is not clear “how” to achieve these goals. Implementation strategies are thus needed to optimize and accelerate the uptake of evidence-based strategies to manage hypertension. Whether the vCCC is effective in doing so requires additional study, such as our ongoing implementation study.</p>
              <p>For successful implementation of a programme, stakeholder involvement is critical. All stakeholders—patients, physicians, pharmacists, and hospital administration shared positive feedback and there was widespread enthusiasm for the programme. Patients liked the programme and found the programme components of HBPM, pharmacist management, and the BP cuff to be acceptable and feasible. Despite concerns about the battery life of the BP cuff, most patients liked the cuff. Patients felt that the study educated them about hypertension and the need for intensifying their medication regimen to reach goal BP. Patients also found HBPM to be doable; the vCCC arm checked their BP almost 10 times a week. To achieve control patients were asked to check BP more frequently than what may be needed for long-term management of hypertension. Once control is achieved, the frequency of BP checks could be decreased. However, more research is needed to identify how long control persists with less frequent monitoring.</p>
              <p>One way that the vCCC might improve BP measurement is through adherence and reinforcement. The vCCC programme facilitates data transfer from patients’ home to the treatment team in real time via a BP dashboard. This makes data retrieval timely and easy for the clinics and eliminates extra work of patients manually writing down BP readings. Ease of data transfer may improve patient adherence. The traffic light system used to interpret data in the Dashboard may improve provider adherence by making it easy to triage BP readings and promptly address concerning readings. Pharmacists can also monitor patient adherence to HBPM and medications, discuss reasons for non-adherence, and help patients overcome barriers to adherence. Phone visits add to the care provided by the primary care team, save time and effort for both patients and clinic staff, and provide additional opportunities for patients to discuss hypertension management. In the United States, the vCCC model is within the scope of practice for clinical pharmacists and is generalizable for large health systems as well as community practices.</p>
              <p>Our study has limitations. Although our enrolment rate is higher than traditional clinical trials, only 42 of 92 of the potentially eligible patients declined to participate (&lt;50%); for a pragmatic trial, we would like most eligible patients to be able to participate in the programme. We may be able to improve the enrolment with higher engagement of PCPs. Per feedback from our PAB members, we will be informing PCPs about the participants who were not reachable and those who declined participation. This modification will allow us to re-screen these patients if they become interested in the study. We also believe that acceptance rate and feasibility of contacting patients may be higher in real care settings when the programme is introduced by the PCP team rather than the study coordinator. We did not do a cost-effective analysis, an important factor for implementation. We are planning on a cost-effective analysis for our larger study. Even though several elements of the study were pragmatic, screening and recruitment were done by study coordinators, limiting pragmatism.</p>
              <p>Our hypertension programme provides an efficient way for health systems to follow hypertension guidelines.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The programme provides patient education, frequent follow-ups, and opportunities for patients to communicate about side effects of medications and reasons for non-adherence. Our approach differs from other studies with home blood pressure monitoring (HMBP) and pharmacy-managed BP management.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref></sup> While these studies focused on efficacy, our focus is on implementation and behaviour change. Our programme also differs from and likely complements other initiatives for improving BP control, such as the Million Hearts and their Hypertension Control Champions Toolkit<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> as we present a well-defined comprehensive and efficient model for managing hypertension.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found our home-based hypertension programme to be safe, feasible, and acceptable to stakeholders. These pilot data warrant a larger study to test effectiveness of the programme in lowering BP and hypertension-related vascular events.</p>
