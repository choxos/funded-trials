                <p id="Par2">The T cell receptor fusion construct (TRuC) gavocabtagene autoleucel (gavo-cel) consists of single-domain anti-mesothelin antibody that integrates into the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) and engages the signaling capacity of the entire TCR upon mesothelin binding. Here we describe phase 1 results from an ongoing phase1/2 trial of gavo-cel in patients with treatment-refractory mesothelin-expressing solid tumors. The primary objectives were to evaluate safety and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives included efficacy. Thirty-two patients received gavo-cel at increasing doses either as a single agent (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or after lymphodepletion (LD, <italic>n</italic> = 29). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 pneumonitis and grade 5 bronchioalveolar hemorrhage were noted. The RP2D was determined as 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells per m<sup>2</sup> after LD. Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis was seen in 16% of all patients and in none at the RP2D; grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome occurred in 25% of all patients and in 15% at the RP2D. In 30 evaluable patients, the overall response rate and disease control rate were 20% (13% confirmed) and 77%, respectively, and the 6-month overall survival rate was 70%. Gavo-cel warrants further study in patients with mesothelin-expressing cancers given its encouraging anti-tumor activity, but it may have a narrow therapeutic window.

However, with few exceptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, CAR-T cell therapies, including those targeting mesothelin, have been largely ineffectual in solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">CAR-T cell constructs include only one (CD3ζ) of the six distinct T cell receptor (TCR) subunits tethered to a co-stimulatory domain (for example, CD28 or 4-1BB) and are expressed as standalone signaling receptors in transduced T cells, physically and functionally removed from native TCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Gavocabtagene autoleucel (gavo-cel; TC-210), a T cell receptor fusion construct (TRuC), results from the fusion of the humanized, llama-derived, single-domain anti-mesothelin antibody MH1 to a 15-amino-acid flexible glycine/serine spacer (+G4S)3 and the human CD3ε subunit. The gavo-cel TRuC construct is then cloned into a lentiviral backbone, which, upon transduction into T cells, integrates into and reprograms native CD3 complexes to become activated upon recognition of tumor cell surface mesothelin in a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-independent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Leveraging the signaling capacity of the entire TCR in this manner results in improved T cell trafficking, long-term functional persistence and enhanced anti-tumor activity of the TRuC compared to CAR T cells of the same specificity in a variety of murine models of human cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par7">This trial was an open-label, first-in-human, multicenter phase 1 study in patients with treatment-refractory, mesothelin-expressing cancers. The primary objective was to evaluate safety and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of gavo-cel. Secondary objectives included efficacy, by determining overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR) and T cell kinetics. Patients with pathologically confirmed malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer or cholangiocarcinoma were eligible if they had progressive disease despite standard of care therapy; if they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and if their tumors expressed mesothelin in ≥50% of tumor cells with a 2+ and/or 3+ intensity, as determined by central immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Gavo-cel was infused at different dose levels (DLs) either as a single agent or after lymphodepletion (LD) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A detailed description of the study design and main eligibility criteria is included in the <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Between May 2019 and May 2022, 252 patients were screened at seven participating centers across the United States. The dates for the first and the last enrolled patients were 17 June 2019 and 28 February 2022, respectively. Of these, 58 eligible participants underwent large-volume leukapheresis, of whom 48 did so with the intent to receive a gavo-cel infusion in phase 1 (intent-to-treat (ITT) population). A gavo-cel product was manufactured for 56 of 58 apheresed patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, and frozen cells were shipped to a central facility for gavo-cel production by lentiviral transduction of the TRuC construct. Thirty-two patients received a single gavo-cel infusion at one of seven DLs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Participants enrolled to DL0, DL2 and DL4 did not receive LD. The remaining 29 patients received an LD regimen consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days −7 through −4 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days −6 through −4. Patients enrolled to DL3.5 received 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> transduced cells per m<sup>2</sup> in two fractions of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> transduced cells per m<sup>2</sup> given on days 0 and 3, respectively. All patients infused with gavo-cel have been followed for safety, efficacy and gavo-cel T cell kinetics for at least 12 weeks. The median follow-up time was 17.3 months (range, 3.2–28.3 months) from the start of protocol-defined therapy. The cutoff date for data analysis was 9 September 2022.</p>

                <p id="Par12">Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 25 (78%) patients, being grade 1 or 2 in 17 (53%), grade 3 in six (19%) and grade 4 in two (6%). No clear relationship was observed between tumor type and CRS incidence or severity. The median onset of CRS was 3 d (range, 0–9 d) and lasted for a median of 6 d (range, 1–55 d). CRS was managed with tocilizumab in 17 patients, including 11 patients who also required corticosteroids and two patients who required siltuximab. Eight patients with CRS did not require any anti-cytokine therapy. No grade 5 CRS was observed. Per the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, one patient developed a brief and self-limited case of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).</p>
                <p id="Par13">Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported. The first one was a grade 3 pneumonitis event experienced by a patient with mesothelioma treated at DL1, in the context of grade 3 CRS. Both complications resolved with tocilizumab and corticosteroid therapy, but several weeks thereafter, the patient developed grade 5 fungal sepsis, which was deemed unrelated to gavo-cel therapy. Because of the pneumonitis event, DL1 was initially expanded from three patients to six patients, upon which dose escalation proceeded to DL2. The second DLT was a grade 5 bronchioalveolar hemorrhage event reported in a patient with mesothelioma treated at DL5 who had previously developed CRS-related disseminated intravascular coagulation and was on prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin therapy at the time of the hemorrhagic event. Two additional deaths were reported in the study. A patient treated at DL5 developed grade 5 respiratory failure in the setting of grade 3 CRS and concomitant pneumothorax and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pulmonary infection. In addition, a patient treated at DL3.5 developed pneumonitis and grade 5 respiratory failure, possibly related to gavo-cel therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par14">A trend toward dose dependency was observed regarding incidence, severity and onset of CRS, with all three patients treated at DL5 developing grade 3 or higher CRS (reported within the first 24 h after infusion). This led the Safety Review Team to stop dose escalation at this level and to recommended de-escalation to 3 × 10<sup>8</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> (DL3.5), to be administered in a fractionated manner: 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells per m<sup>2</sup> on day 0 and 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells per m<sup>2</sup> on day 3 after LD. However, three of five patients at DL3.5 developed grade 3 or higher pneumonitis, which led the Safety Review Team to declare DL3 (1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells per m<sup>2</sup> after LD) as the RP2D. Although, numerically speaking, the dose differential between DL3 (RP2D) and DL3.5 appears moderate, the toxicity profiles observed at each of these DLs were markedly different in terms of the frequency and severity of both pneumonitis and CRS. No cases of pneumonitis were reported at the RP2D, and only two patients developed severe CRS, which was rapidly reversible in both cases. This is in contrast with DL3.5, where three of five patients developed pneumonitis, and at DL5, where all patients developed severe CRS, which developed more rapidly, lasted longer and was less responsive to anti-cytokine therapy. These data delineate a therapeutic window for gavo-cel and highlight the importance of monitoring patients for signs of CRS or pneumonitis.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Of 13 safety-evaluable patients at the RP2D, eight had grade 3/4 gavo-cel-related AEs, for a rate of 61% (95% confidence interval (CI), 44–77%), including reversible grade 3 or higher CRS in three (15%) patients after a median of 3 d (range, 2–4 d) and no pneumonitis events.</p>

                <p id="Par16">Of the 32 patients who received gavo-cel, 30 were evaluable for tumor response assessment. Two patients who experienced grade 5 AEs before their post-infusion computed tomography (CT) scan were not evaluable for response. After gavo-cel infusion, all but two patients (93%) experienced a decrease in the sum of target lesion diameters, ranging in magnitude from 4% to 80% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Target lesion regression was even deeper when assessed by volumetric analysis and was coupled with metabolic responses by positron emission tomography (PET) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Patients 1, 8 and 12, who received gavo-cel without prior LD, also experienced tumor regression, resulting in prolonged treatment-free intervals. However, greater tumor regression was observed among patients receiving gavo-cel after LD, with eight patients (five with MPM, two with ovarian cancer and one with cholangiocarcinoma) experiencing more than a 30% reduction in tumor size. Tumor regression of target lesions appeared to be independent of the pre-infusion tumor burden (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Efficacy of gavo-cel treatment.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Waterfall plot showing maximum change in target lesion size from baseline in evaluable patients (<italic>n</italic> = 30) as assessed by BICR.

Of these six patients, four had a confirmed partial response (PR) (13%; two MPM and two ovarian cancer). By local investigator assessment, the ORR was 23% (15% in the ITT population), which included one additional patient with cholangiocarcinoma who was also considered to have achieved a PR. One additional patient with mesothelioma had a gradual response, with target lesions regressing less than 30% at 3 months. The 6-month CT scan showed target lesion tumor regression of more than 30%; however, a new lesion was also identified, and, therefore, the patient was not considered to have a PR. The ORR by BICR and by local investigator assessment was 22% and 26%, respectively, among patients who received gavo-cel after LD. The median time to response (TTR) was 1.15 months (95% CI, 0.76–1.53), whereas the median duration of response (DoR) was 4.6 months (95% CI, 1.77–7.42). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.1–5.8) and 10.6 months (95% CI, 6.6–15.6), respectively, and the 6-month OS was 70.2% (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). For patients with MPM, the ORR among those receiving gavo-cel after LD was 21%. This clinical activity resulted in a median PFS of 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.1–5.8) and median OS of 11.2 months (95% CI, 6.0–15.6) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3c,d</xref>). For patients with ovarian cancer, the ORR among those who received gavo-cel after LD was 29%, with a median PFS of 5.8 months (95% CI, 1.6–6.1) and a median OS of 8.1 months (95% CI, 1.6–17.1) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3e,f</xref>).</p>

She was infused 5 × 10<sup>8</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> gavo-cel T cells (total dose, 8.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> transduced T cells) after LD. The patient manifested early signs of tumor cell killing as evidenced by increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels starting on day 5 after gavo-cel infusion that peaked on day 9 and gradually decreased thereafter (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). A CT scan on day +25 showed a significant decrease in the size of the tumor masses, which were now mostly fluid filled, coupled with a remarkable reduction of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake that subsequently almost completely resolved. Subsequent CT scans showed continuous shrinkage or complete resolution of the tumor masses, which was observed for 12 months, at which point she developed disease progression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a,b</xref>).

After LD, expansion was greatly increased with median C<sub>max</sub> of 712.9 copies per µg of gDNA (range, 50–5,900.8) at the 5 × 10<sup>7</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> dose, 14,385.45 (range, 50–100,781.9) at the 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> dose, 5,135.2 (range, 50–15,320.0) at the 3 × 10<sup>8</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> dose and 5,275.8 (range, 50–59,542.3) at the 5 × 10<sup>8</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> dose (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

Notably, the gavo-cel transgene had become undetectable in peripheral blood by day 27, and no transgene was detected in normal lung adjacent to tumor lesions. Serosal effusion samples collected after infusion from four patients showed clearly detectable levels of TRuC-T cells.

                <title>Changes in the tumor microenvironment after treatment</title>
                <p id="Par29">To gain insight into the potential impact of gavo-cel therapy on the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyzed pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies from three patients with MPM—one patient who experienced a PR (patient 3, 64% reduction in target lesion size) and two patients with a best response of stable disease (SD) (patients 18 and 21). At baseline, the TME of the responding patient was characterized by an abundance of T cells that were clearly excluded from tumor cell nests. At 8 weeks after treatment, T cells were observed to robustly infiltrate into the tumor of this responding patient. In the two non-responders, T cells were less abundant at baseline, and levels of infiltration did not notably change after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, left panel, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). Expression of the immunoinhibitory ligand PD-L1 was increased after treatment in all three patients, with the highest level of increase observed in non-responder patient 21 whose tumor showed the highest basal level of PD-L1 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, central panel, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). Interestingly, expression of a second immunoinhibitory ligand, CD155, which functionally interacts with TIGIT, was observed to be high at both baseline and post-treatment in non-responder patient 18 and was markedly upregulated after treatment in non-responder patient 21. In contrast, levels of CD155 were undetectable at baseline in the responder, with only a minor increase in staining intensity observed after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, right panel, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). These preliminary observations suggest that gavo-cel tumor infiltration may result in the remodeling of the TME, with upregulation of immunoinhibitory ligands that may represent a potential mechanism of resistance.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Furthermore, we also evaluated the kinetics of gavo-cel PD1 expression after infusion. For the nine patients in whom this was evaluated in a longitudinal manner, there was an increase in PD-1 expression on gavo-cel T cells after infusion, compared to the pre-infusion gavo-cel product. This increase in PD-1 expression was seen irrespective of tumor response (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>). These findings further support the use of gavo-cel in combination with nivolumab in the ongoing phase 2 trial.</p>

              <p id="Par33">The results of our study demonstrate the safety and feasibility of administering gavo-cel, a first-in-class TRuC-targeting mesothelin, in patients with mesothelin-expressing solid tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an engineered T cell therapy inducing clinical responses by leveraging the activation of the TCR complex in an HLA-unrestricted manner.</p>
              <p id="Par34">This study is also noteworthy because, to our knowledge, gavo-cel is the first anti-mesothelin adoptive T cell therapy to show consistent objective radiologic responses and one of few studies to show tumor regression in patients with solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Several anti-mesothelin CAR-T cell approaches have been tested in clinical trials for patients with solid tumors, including T cells engineered to transiently express an mRNA-encoded mesothelin-specific CAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> as well as T cells stably transduced with an anti-mesothelin lentiviral construct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Both strategies proved safe but had limited clinical activity. A recent trial administered anti-mesothelin CAR-T cells locoregionally through a pleural catheter or directly into the tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although no objective radiologic responses were seen in the 23 patients with mesothelioma who received these CAR-T cells after cyclophosphamide preconditioning, two patients had a PR after they were treated with pembrolizumab off protocol.</p>
              <p id="Par35">As expected, the most frequently reported AEs in this study were cytopenias related to the administration of LD. The most frequent non-hematological AE was CRS, which was reported in 78% of patients, being grade 3 or higher in 25% of patients. However, gavo-cel at the RP2D (1 × 10<sup>8</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> after LD) was associated with significant activity and a manageable safety profile, thus lending itself to a combination approach with ICIs, which is currently ongoing in the phase 2 portion of the study.</p>
              <p id="Par36">A single gavo-cel infusion resulted in radiologic tumor regression in 93% of patients, and the ORR among patients with mesothelioma or ovarian cancer receiving gavo-cel after LD was 21% and 29%, respectively, as assessed by BIRC. This is significant given that the median number of prior therapies was five, including at least one line of standard ICI therapy in 87% of patients with MPM. Notably, objective responses were observed only in patients who received gavo-cel after LD, which led to T cell expansion and persistence in a dose-dependent fashion, and induction of cytokine secretion, thus highlighting the importance of the conditioning regimen.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In addition to inducing radiological responses, gavo-cel appeared to prolong survival in a heavily pre-treated patient population. The PFS and OS in MPM were 5.6 months and 11.2 months, respectively. These results are encouraging, as patients with MPM who fail ICI therapy are typically treated with chemotherapy regimens. In the second-line setting, such approaches render an ORR lower than 10%, a PFS of ~3 months and an OS of ~10 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted with caution given the implicit selection biases built into the design of cellular therapy phase 1 clinical trials and the absence of a comparator arm.</p>
              <p id="Par38">A potential limitation of gavo-cel therapy is the fact that responses, regardless of depth, were, in some cases, of limited duration. Antigen escape and T cell exhaustion have been invoked to explain disease relapse in patients with hematological malignancies receiving adoptive T cell therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although mesothelin expression was still present in biopsies obtained 8 weeks after infusion, this may be too early a timepoint to assess antigen loss. On the other hand, an increase in PD-1 expression on gavo-cel T cells was observed during the first 28 d after infusion and may represent a harbinger of gavo-cel exhaustion, thus justifying the combination of gavo-cel with anti-PD-1 agents, similar to the experience with anti-mesothelin CAR-T cell therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Such an approach could result in increased gavo-cel persistence in peripheral blood, which, at the RP2D, was approximately 30–40 d. This could further increase gavo-cel persistence in the TME, where we showed high levels of gavo-cel T cells long after they had become undetectable in peripheral blood. Treatment-emergent T-cell-mediated anti-TRuC responses were not assessed, but they might have also limited gavo-cel persistence.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Our data strongly support the development of TRuC-based cell therapies in patients with solid tumors as well as mesothelin as a target. Given the promising preliminary results reported here, a phase 2 study is underway to evaluate the efficacy of gavo-cel in mesothelin-expressing cancers, which will allow for repeat intravenous dosing and the combination with ICI therapy as strategies to promote greater gavo-cel exposure and to prevent exhaustion of the engineered T cells.</p>

The primary objective of the phase 1 study was to evaluate safety and determine the RP2D of gavo-cel. The secondary objective was to access efficacy by determining ORR, DCR, TTR, DoR, PFS and OS. Patients with a response include those who achieved a partial or complete response, whereas non-responders are those with SD or PD. Exploratory objectives were to correlate response with gavo-cel expansion, persistence, phenotype and functionality. Gavo-cel tumor infiltration (before and after evaluation of the TME), measurement of immune cell markers and correlation with clinical response to treatment were also studied.</p>
                <p id="Par41">For the phase 1 dose-escalation part of the study, patients received a single dose of intravenous gavo-cel infusion with or without LD. The protocol-specified DLs were 1 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 3 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>8</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> transduced cells per m<sup>2</sup>. A maximum of 48 patients could be treated during the dose-escalation phase. DLs without LD required the enrollment of only one patient to proceed to dose escalation in the absence of significant toxicity, whereas DLs employing LD required the enrollment of three patients and proceeded following a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation schema. Patients were enrolled regardless of sex and/or gender, which was determined by patient self-reporting. An analysis based on sex/gender was not performed.</p>

                <p id="Par83">PBMCs were collected via leukapheresis using standardized procedures and cryopreserved following a controlled-rate freezing process. Manufacturing of a gavo-cel product was started a median of 11 d after leukapheresis (one product was started 260 d after leukapheresis collection due to the need to remanufacture after the initial product bag was found to be damaged). The manufacture of the gavo-cel product was carried out using the functionally closed CliniMACS Prodigy automated cell processing system at the Miltenyi Biotec manufacturing facility in San Jose, California. There, the apheresis blood product was attached to the CliniMACS Prodigy system through a sterile weld. After separation by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated by magnetic bead separation and activated with TransAct CD3/CD28 (Miltenyi Biotec). Then, T cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for the gavo-cel transgene, consisting of an anti-mesothelin, llama-derived, single-domain antibody (MH1) fused to the CD3ε subunit of TCR using a linker sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. T cells were then expanded in the presence of TexMACS media (Miltenyi Biotec), IL-7 and IL-15. The gavo-cel product was harvested and formulated after the cell quantity reached the required dose. Each lot underwent in-process and release testing. Upon release, patients were infused with a single dose of gavo-cel on day 0, within 4 d of completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Re-infusion was not permitted during the phase 1 part of the study. Pre-conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days −7, −6, −5 and –4 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days –6, –5 and –4. Patients treated at DLs without LD proceeded directly to gavo-cel infusion on day 0. Patients actively progressing or clinically symptomatic were allowed to receive bridging therapy during the period of gavo-cel manufacturing. The choice of bridging therapy was individualized at the investigator’s discretion based on the patient’s previous cancer therapy and clinical status.</p>

TRuC cells were enriched using biotinylated anti-camelid VHH antibody labeling (GenScript, A01995) anti-biotin MultiSort Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-256) and anti-CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-045-201). Enriched TRuC CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were incubated with plate-bound recombinant human mesothelin (10 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>, Acro Biosystems, MSN-H526x) and soluble anti-human CD28 (2 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>, 302943, BioLegend) in complete TexMACS GMP Medium for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. TRuC cells were then labeled with membrane stain (1:500 dilution, IsoPlexis) and either anti-human CD8-APC antibody (BioLegend, 301049) or anti-human CD4-APC antibody (BioLegend, 300537). Next, 30,000 live cells were loaded into a 32-plex human adaptive IsoCode Chip (IsoPlexis) Each condition was loaded in triplicate (<italic>n</italic> = 3 TRuC CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and <italic>n</italic> = 3 TRuC CD8<sup>+</sup> cells). Polyfunctionality of T cells defined as a cell co-secreting 2+ cytokines were analyzed by the IsoSpeak software across the seven functional groups: Th1 pro-inflammatory (GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-12, TNF-α and TNF-β); Th2 pro-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-13); Chemoattractive (CCL11, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-4, MIP1-α, MIP-1β and RANTES); Regulatory (IL-10, IL-15, IL-22 and TGF-β1); Th17 pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-21); Cytolytic (granzyme B and perforin); and Other (sCD40L and sCD137). The PSI of T cells was computed using a pre-specified formula, defined as the percentage of polyfunctional cells multiplied by the sum of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the proteins secreted by those cells: PSI = (% polyfunctional cells in sample) × ∑(MFI of all 32 secreted proteins of the polyfunctional cells).</p>

                <p id="Par97">MultiOmyxTM technology was used to evaluate the expression of a panel of 14 biomarkers, including TIGIT, CD155, LAG3, CD4, CD56, CD3, CTLA4, CD8, PD-L1, PD-1, FoxP3, CD68 and TIM-3 and tumor segmentation marker PanCK on ovarian, cholangiocarcinoma and mesothelioma cancer FFPE samples. FFPE slides were evaluated by pathology (at NeoGenomics) for tissue annotation and selection. The selected tumor-relevant areas by pathology were used for staining and analysis. The staining was performed using a single 5-µM FFPE slide. Within each staining round, two cyanine dye-labeled (Cy3 and Cy5) antibodies were paired together and recognized two markers. The staining signal was then imaged and followed by novel dye inactivation, enabling repeated rounds of staining. For cell classification for all individual markers, proprietary deep-learning-based workflows were applied to identify individual cells and perform individual cell classification results. These results were combined to generate co-expression summaries and compute spatial distribution statistics for phenotypes of interest. For area quantification of PD-L1 or CD155, ImageJ software (NIH) was used to measure area of fluorescent marker expression within three high-powered fields divided by the total area. For visualization of each marker, individually established fluorescent minimum and maximum values were set and applied equally across all samples using the fluorescent look-up table (LUT).</p>

                <title>ADA detection by a bridging MSD assay</title>
                <p id="Par98">In the screening assay, human plasma samples are incubated for 1 h with a sulfo-tagged MH1 reagent (MH1 is the anti-mesothelin sdAb used in the gavo-cel TRuC) and then added onto a streptavidin plate coated with biotinylated MH1. After 1 h of incubation, the plate is washed to remove unbound material and read on the MSD Imager. The imager reads the ECL signal generated by the sulfo-tagged MH1 reagent and converts it to a relative light unit (RLU). The RLU level is directly proportional to the amount of anti-MH1 antibody in the plasma sample. If samples are found to be negative in the screening assay, testing is complete. Samples found to be positive in the screening assay are tested in a confirmatory assay in the presence/absence of MH1 to confirm specificity. If samples are negative in the confirmatory assay, testing is complete. Samples found to be positive in the confirmatory assay are tested in a titration assay to determine the titer at which positive detection is lost.</p>

For box-plots, center line, box limits and whiskers represent the median, interquartile range and minima and maxima, respectively. <bold>d</bold>, Memory subset composition using the markers CD45RA and CCR7 showed variable composition of stem cell memory (T<sub>SCM</sub>) and naïve T cells, central memory T cell (T<sub>CM</sub>), T effector memory cell (T<sub>EM</sub>) and effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA (T<sub>EMRA</sub> subsets). <bold>e</bold>, Expression of the exhaustion markers TIM-3, PD-1, and LAG-3 were determined by flow-cytometry. TIM-3 expression was high, PD-1 was variable, and LAG-3 was low. (n = 22 independent patient samples) For box plots; center lines, box limits and whiskers represent the median, interquartile range and minima and maxima, respectively. <bold>f–g, Gavo-cel T cell products TCPs show robust polyfunctionality</bold>. Multiplexed assessment of cytokine production at the single cell level was performed by Isoplexis assay in isolated <bold>f</bold>, CD4+ (n = 8 independent patient samples) and <bold>g</bold>, CD8 + T cells within gavo-cel TCPs. (n = 8 independent patient samples) Polyfunctionality of T cells defined as a cell co-secreting 2 or more cytokines were analyzed by the IsoSpeak software across the seven functional groups. The polyfunctional strength Index (PSI) of T cells was defined as the percentage of polyfunctional cells, multiplied by the sum of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the proteins secreted by those cells: PSI = (% polyfunctional cells in sample) x ∑(MFI of all 32 secreted proteins of the polyfunctional cells).TCP predominantly secreted effector, stimulatory, and chemo attractive proteins Source.</p>
