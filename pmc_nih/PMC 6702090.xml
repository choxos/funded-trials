                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p id="P4">Samples from a study designed to examine Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy were used (n=359). All women were infected with schistosomiasis and randomized to Praziquantel or placebo at 16±2 weeks gestation. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were measured in maternal and infant blood. The relationship between both maternal Praziquantel treatment and etiology of anemia and infant iron status was evaluated.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p id="P5">Maternal iron deficiency anemia was associated with increased risk of infant anemia at six months of age. Infants of mothers with the lowest levels of circulating hepcidin during gestation, likely a marker for iron deficiency, had higher sTfR:SF levels and lower hemoglobin levels, particularly at twelve months of age. Maternal non-iron deficiency anemia (NIDA) did not impact infant anemia risk or iron status. Maternal treatment for schistosomiasis had no effect on infant hematologic status.</p>

                  <p id="P6">Maternal iron deficiency anemia was associated with an increased risk for anemia or iron deficiency during late infancy. We did not observe an association between maternal NIDA and increased risk for iron deficiency during infancy.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P8">Anemia affects an estimated 273 million children under the age of five years throughout the world, with a disproportionate burden in low and middle income countries (LMICs) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Maternal anemia during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of maternal and fetal mortality, poor intrauterine growth, and impaired cognitive development in affected offspring (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Importantly, in both human and animal models, short- and long-term neurodevelopmental deficits have been demonstrated to persist even after iron repletion (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Inadequate body iron is thought to account for approximately 50% of anemia in women globally (iron-deficiency anemia: IDA). Additionally, non-iron deficiency anemia (NIDA), related to other micronutrient deficiencies and/or infections with resulting anemia of inflammation (AI), is also a major contributor to anemia in this population (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P9">Due to the importance of iron in neurocognitive development (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), identifying risk factors for infant iron deficiency is critical. Though the fetus is thought to efficiency obtain iron <italic>in utero</italic>, many studies have demonstrated lower cord hemoglobin and iron levels among infants of anemic women, particularly women with severe anemia (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Maternal iron prophylaxis during gestation and newborn serum ferritin (SF) are both positive predictors of SF in infancy (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Further, in a recently published study from The Philippines, we found that maternal IDA, but not NIDA (due largely to AI), influenced newborn iron endowment (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Less is known about the longitudinal effect of maternal IDA and AI, both of which may continue to influence infant iron status. Specifically, the impact of both maternal IDA and AI on infant iron status may not become evident until after <italic>in utero</italic> stores are depleted, usually around four months of age among term breastfed infants (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and decreased iron bioavailability may continue to limit iron bioavailability in breastmilk (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). No studies have examined the role of AI on longitudinal infant iron status. Given AI causes decreased iron bioavailability, we hypothesized that this process might impact infant iron status through decreased fetal and infant iron acquisition <italic>in utero</italic> and in breast milk.</p>
              <p id="P10">Determining the etiology of maternal anemia and its impact on longitudinal infant iron status and anemia risk is important as interventions to reduce this risk differ significantly. In the context of AI, hepcidin production, driven primarily by the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-6 (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) leads to decreased iron absorption in the gut and iron sequestration in the reticuloendothelial system by causing the degradation of membrane-bound ferroportin (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the context of iron deficiency, hepcidin is typically suppressed to maintain ferroportin integrity, allowing increased iron absorption in the gut and release from macrophages (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Maternal hepcidin has also been shown to be inversely related to iron bioavailability to the fetus (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P11">In previous work conducted among children and non-pregnant adults in Leyte, The Philippines, we demonstrated that <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> infection is related to anemia risk across all infection intensities (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Importantly, the predominant cause of anemia in this context is NIDA (20% overall prevalence), primarily due to AI, with a prevalence of IDA of 12% (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Though the etiology of NIDA is multi-factorial, in those studies we found that less than 1% of individuals with NIDA had a macrocytic anemia, making B12 or folate deficiency the primary cause of NIDA, unlikely. <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection in this population is believed to lead to AI via chronic immune activation, both in response to adult worms and trapped eggs (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and as a result of microbial translocation across the gut epithelium as eggs penetrate the gut wall from the largely sterile bloodstream (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P26">In this study we evaluated the influence of maternal anemia type and gestational treatment for schistosomiasis on infant iron status and anemia risk. In our previous studies in non-pregnant subjects, we have demonstrated that schistosomiasis is associated with AI (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Though treated mothers demonstrated improved iron stores, and their newborns displayed modest improvements in iron endowment (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), in the present analysis we were unable to identify an association between maternal treatment and iron status or anemia risk during later infancy. This may in part be due to prolonged pro-inflammatory response to dying worms and eggs following Praziquantel administration (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and the improvement in hemoglobin in non-pregnant subjects after treatment does not occur for 3–6 months. (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We did, however, identify a significant relationship between maternal IDA, but not NIDA, during pregnancy and infant anemia risk at six months of age, as well as maternal iron status biomarkers and infant anemia risk.</p>
              <p id="P27">Understanding the influence of maternal anemia type on infant iron deficiency and anemia risk is critical to successfully preventing and treating anemia among young children (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Improved survival in early infancy has been shown among neonates and infants of mothers who received iron supplementation in multiple LMICs, often in a dose-responsive fashion (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Given IDA and AI require different approaches to treatment, clarifying the extent to which maternal anemia type and iron status affects infant anemia risk is therefore critical.</p>
              <p id="P28">We found that infants were more likely to be anemic if their mothers had IDA versus NIDA during pregnancy, despite the fact that all women were provided with pre-natal vitamins with iron. This association, however, is lost by twelve months of age, and overall rates of anemia in this infant population increase. It is possible that many of the infants at 12 months of age have pre-anemic iron deficiency, given demonstrated decreases in ferritin from 6 to 12 months of age without significant increase in anemia risk. Although the maternal-fetal dyad is adapted to maximize fetal iron uptake during gestation (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), infant iron stores may wane, particularly when breast milk is iron poor, by six months of age (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The relatively high rates of iron deficiency in this pediatric population at both six and twelve months may also be reflective of the relative poor nutritional quality of complementary foods introduced during infancy in this population. Alterations in iron metabolism during pregnancy as seen in AI did not impact newborn iron status or anemia risk, suggesting this mechanism does not significantly impact iron-transfer (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P29">Interestingly, we found that maternal hepcidin, but not newborn hepcidin, was related to infant iron status and hemoglobin. In addition, low maternal hepcidin was associated with a significant worsening of infant iron status from six to twelve months. Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron bio-availability, and is up-regulated in response to inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, and down-regulated in the context of iron deficiency (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It is likely that the relationship between low maternal hepcidin and increased risk for both infant iron deficiency and anemia is due to the fact that hepcidin is a marker for women with more significant iron deficiency, who may be less able to transfer sufficient iron to the fetus <italic>in utero</italic> and in breast milk to maintain stores at 12 months of age. This is further supported by the worsening iron status and hemoglobin from six to twelve months of age only among infants whose mothers had the lowest hepcidin levels. This may also be partly explained by a shared maternal-infant environment with iron-poor solid foods as the infant transitions to the addition of complementary foods.</p>
              <p id="P30">In addition, we found a high prevalence of NIDA at both six and twelve months of age. Hematologic and inflammatory biomarker dynamics may reflect the etiology of anemia among infants. The MCV, elevated in the context of megaloblastic anemias due to B12 and folate deficiency was only elevated in 0.3% of infants at six and twelve months of age, suggesting these micronutrient deficiencies were not a significant cause of NIDA. IL-6 concentrations at six and twelve months were higher among infants with NIDA, compared to IDA, and hepcidin was significantly higher among infants with NIDA compared to IDA at six and twelve months. Together, these findings suggest that NIDA in most of these infants is driven by AI.</p>
              <p id="P31">Limitations to this study include a lack of standardized definitions to define the etiology of anemia during pregnancy and infancy. We used hemoglobin and ferritin to define maternal anemia types based on bone marrow studies (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and the WHO definition for infant anemia type (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Unfortunately, we did not capture timing of the introduction of solid foods, thus limiting our ability to make conclusive statements regarding the impact of complementary foods on iron status. In addition, we did not assess infants for hemoglobinopathies which may also cause NIDA, such that we cannot determine the contribution of hemoglobinopathies or other less common causes of NIDA. Finally, we do not have a measure of maternal iron status or hemoglobin at the time of delivery. Given the importance of third trimester iron transfer, a more proximate measure of maternal iron status peri-natally might have changed maternal classification with respect to iron status and anemia type. Serum iron was also not measured in this study, although quantitation of sTfR and ferritin have been shown to be excellent markers for iron status.</p>
              <p id="P32">Iron status during infancy is likely influenced by both newborn iron endowment and the availability of iron during infancy in breast milk and complementary foods (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Indeed, other groups have shown that exclusive breastfeeding improves iron status of infants in resource poor settings (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our finding that maternal IDA continues to influence infant iron deficiency and anemia during infancy supports the importance of maternal iron nutriture and the need for improved pre-conceptual maternal iron status, better compliance with pre-natal vitamins with iron, as well as continued provision of multi-vitamins with iron post-natally. The high prevalence of AI among infants highlights the high infection and inflammatory burden experienced by these infants and its contribution to anemia.</p>
