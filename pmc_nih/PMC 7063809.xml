                  <p id="Par1">Obesity is common among kidney transplant recipients; However biological mediators of obesity are not well understood in this population. Because subcutaneous adipose tissue can be easily obtained during kidney transplant surgery, it provides a unique avenue for studying the mechanisms of obesity for this group. Although differential gene expression patterns were previously profiled for kidney transplant patients, gene co-expression patterns can shed light on gene modules not yet explored on the coordinative behaviors of gene transcription in biological and disease processes from a systems perspective.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">Obesity is a growing health concern worldwide and is associated with renal co-morbidities such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), and other kidney complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In 2011, 23% of kidney transplant recipients in the United States were obese, 9.4% were morbidly obese, and 2.1% were morbidly obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, post-transplantation weight gain in kidney transplant cohorts is common, thus exacerbating patients’ preexisting obese phenotype and decreasing the likelihood of long-term renal allograft success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Obesity is influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and as obesity prevalence increases and genetic methods evolve, there is a growing interest in studying the genetic and biological mechanisms driving weight gain. Several studies have investigated genetic mechanisms of obesity through various methodologies, including gene expression studies, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and obesity-related biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, more comprehensive systems-based genetic analyses, which could provide a more robust understanding of gene interactions, pathways, and biological functions, are underexplored. Such inquiry could provide a more robust understanding of gene interaction networks, their pathways, and biological functions. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) is one such systems-based approach that offers the ability to create modules of gene networks (groups of co-expressed genes) that are highly associated with clinical variables of interest (e.g., Body Mass Index).</p>
              <p id="Par27">In addition to underutilizing systems-based approaches to study obesity, very few researchers have conducted genetic studies in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Collecting human tissue, including adipose tissue, involves invasive procedures, making other noninvasive methods of sample collection (i.e., blood, stool, and saliva) more feasible and attractive to research participants. However, subcutaneous adipose tissue can be easily obtained during kidney transplant surgery. Furthermore, subcutaneous adipose tissue is a particularly promising candidate for gene studies of obesity, because it is metabolically active and plays an important role in endocrine pathways that modulate eating behavior and metabolism (e.g., appetite regulation, insulin signaling, and leptin signaling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">A recent study by Joseph at al. carried out an analysis of gene co-expression patterns associated with body mass index using expression data in whole blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, it is still unknown how gene co-expression patterns in adipose tissue are related to obesity. A longitudinal study by Cashion et al. analyzed gene expression data from a cohort of kidney transplant recipients to identify individual genes and molecular pathways that could be driving weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that changes in gene expression were associated with insulin, inflammatory signaling pathways, and leptin. Their analysis also identified four obesity-associated genes (<italic>CPE</italic>, <italic>LEP</italic>, <italic>NPY1R</italic>, and <italic>NPY5R</italic>) that were positively correlated with weight gain and two genes (<italic>APOM</italic> and <italic>CRP</italic>) that were negatively correlated with weight gain. Cashion et al. also found demographic and environmental factors were associated with weight gain following kidney transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although Cashion et al. compared expressed genes between those who did and did not gain weight, they did not analyze the interaction patterns among expressed genes. The current study builds on these previous findings by Cashion et al. and utilizes gene expression data to analyze gene co-expression networks to examine obesity-related traits in kidney transplant recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par29">This study utilized gene expression data to examine gene interactions in human adipose tissue of kidney transplant recipients. Tissue samples were obtained from investigators at a regional MidSouth transplant center, who recruited 153 transplant recipients from 2006 to 2011 to study the genetic and environmental factors associated with weight gain following kidney transplantation. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and some patients also signed an optional repository consent. The parent study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Additional analyses on the repository samples were approved by the Office of Human Subjects Research and the Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
                  <p id="Par30">All adults, regardless of race or sex, were eligible for participation. To control for the effect of pre-transplantation immunosuppressant therapy on gene expression profiles, exclusion criteria included prior treatment with prednisone or other immunosuppressant therapies. Other exclusion criteria included underweight status (i.e., BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and pre-existing conditions that may impact weight, including gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, or gynecological diseases. Of the 153 transplant recipients, thirty signed a repository consent and also had RNA microarray data. Of these thirty participants, three were excluded due to excessive weight loss, which was determined to be a potential indicator of an abnormal recovery. An additional participants’ sample was excluded as it did not meet quality control criteria. A total of 26 participant samples were included in the current study.</p>

                  <title>Demographic and clinical variables</title>
                  <p id="Par31">Demographic data (age, race, and sex) were collected from electronic medical records (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Clinical laboratory values were collected at the time of transplantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months post transplantation. Clinical variables were analyzed including height, weight, BMI, body fat, creatinine levels, and glucose levels. Body weight and height were used to calculate BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Weight categories were selected as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, with greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> indicating obesity. Body fat was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. Blood samples were collected to determine laboratory values (e.g., fasting glucose and creatinine). Reference values of normality for creatinine and fasting glucose levels were 0.5–1.2 mg/dL and 70–100 mg/dL respectively.

                  <p id="Par32">The baseline clinical variables included weight (WT_BL), height, total subcutaneous body fat (SubTot_Fat_BL), percent of subcutaneous body fat (SubTot_Pfat_BL), whole-body fat percent (WB_Tot_Pfat_BL), body mass index (BMI_BL), blood creatinine (CREATININE_BL), and blood glucose (GLUCOSE_BL). The following variables were also measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after kidney transplantation: blood creatinine (CREATININE_3M, CREATININE_6M, CREATININE_12M) and blood glucose (GLUCOSE_3M, GLUCOSE_6M, GLUCOSE_12M). Other variables were measured at 12 months, including SubTot_Fat_12M, SubTot_Pfat_12M, and BMI_12M.</p>

Ages were divided into binary groups by age (above or below age 50). Age was divided into two even groups (above or below age 50) in order to better compare age with sex and race (both categorical variables). Additionally, age was tested as a continuous variable and as a continuous variable age was not significantly correlated with the first three principal components of microarray data. For each discrete variable, an ANOVA model was fit between the first three principal components and the variable. For each quantitative variable, a linear regression model was fit between the first three principal components and the variable.

                <p id="Par44">Gene co-expression networks can reveal coordinative behaviors of gene transcription for diseases or medical interventions. We conducted Weighted Gene Correaltion Network Analysis (WGCNA) to obtain a better understanding of gene expression mechanisms underlying obesity-related traits. 5758 (30%) of the most highly expressed genes were examined to reduce the noise (i.e., genes not actually expressed). Fitting of scale-free topology identified 35 gene modules with sizes ranging from 10 to 1451 genes and a median size of 49 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We then examined associations between these 35 gene modules and 26 clinical variables (see Methods, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In order to ensure detection of reliable associations, the <italic>p</italic>-values obtained from the WGCNA software were further adjusted for multiple testing according to the Benjami-Hochberg approach. At an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of 0.05, two modules showed association with at least one clinical trait: the “magenta” module was correlated with SubTot_Fat_BL; the “darkgreen” module was correlated with SubTot_Pfat_BL and WB_Tot_Pfat_BL.

In turn, if genes in a module show high correlations between module memberships and gene significance (for association with traits), that suggests that the association between the gene module and the clinical trait is highly reliable. To this end, we made plot gene module memberships and gene significance for the modules associated with clinical traits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The magenta module showed a highly significant module-membership to gene-significance correlation with the SubTot_Fat_BL trait.

              <p id="Par49">This study sought to identify sets of genes that could provide insight into the genetic underpinnings of obesity-related traits in kidney transplant recipients. Using gene expression data from adipose tissue of kidney transplant recipients, we created gene co-expression networks and correlated them to clinical variables. Previous work has identified individual genes associated with weight gain in kidney transplant populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but to our knowledge no studies have incorporated WGCNA in similar cohorts. Using WGCNA, we found two modules, the magenta module and the darkgreen module, to be significantly correlated with obesity-related traits at baseline.</p>
              <p id="Par50">GO enrichment analysis and identification of hub genes revealed plausible biological functions of genes within the magenta and darkgreen modules. GO enrichment analysis identified that among the 129 genes comprising the magenta model, multiple genes are involved in immune function, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular disease. This is supported by the role of the hub genes within the magenta module. As mentioned previously, the top two hub genes in the magenta module are <italic>ITGAM</italic> and <italic>CD68. ITGAM</italic> plays a role in the adhesion of monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes and the uptake of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>CD68</italic> codes for a glycoprotein expressed in monocytes and macrophages and is related to the innate immune system and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in Atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, GO enrichment and hub genes are consistent, both suggesting the magenta module may hold immune-related, metabolic, and cardiovascular roles in kidney transplant patients.</p>
              <p id="Par51">The biological processes identified by GO enrichment and the hub genes’ function are also consistent with our network analysis using IPA. Network analysis of the magenta module revealed that 15 genes within this module, including <italic>ITGAM</italic> and <italic>CD68</italic>, have immune-related functions. Additionally, within the magenta module, IPA identified 2 networks associated with lipid metabolism (22 genes) and metabolic disease (11 genes). Other genes within the magenta module play a role in metabolic functions and obesity including genes that code for lipase (<italic>LIPA)</italic>, phospholipid transfer protein (<italic>PTLP),</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and lipid metabolism (e.g., <italic>LPIN1)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This suggests that there is a relationship between metabolism, immune response, inflammatory-related genes, and body-fat in kidney transplant patients.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Like the magenta module, the darkgreen module contains genes associated with lipid metabolism and cardiovascular processes. The darkgreen module was enriched for cardiovascular processes including heart and vasculature development. Additionally, the darkgreen module contains genes associated with cellular energy expenditure (e.g. mitochondrion and sodium: potassium-exchanging ATPase activity). The top 2 hubgenes, <italic>CRLS1</italic> and <italic>ACSS3</italic> are involved in lipid metabolism, including the catalysis of key phospholipids and acetyl-CoA from short-chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Network analysis of the darkgreen module was also consistent with the GO enrichment analysis and the function of the hub genes, containing three networks associated with the immune response (e.g. infectious diseases), and cardiovascular processes (e.g. cardiovascular system development and function). Thus, body-fat associated genes within the darkgreen module are associated with cardiovascular health, lipid metabolism, and cellular energy expenditure. Both modules from our analysis are tied to immunological responses such as inflammation, suggesting the immune system may play a role in regulating obesity-related traits (e.g. total subcutaneous body fat) in kidney transplant patients.</p>
              <p id="Par53">The findings of the current study are supported by previous studies which have found immunological, inflammatory, and metabolic genetic drivers are influential in the determination of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Only one previous study by Muniandy et al. used adipose tissue (subcutaneous) to study clinical changes associated with obesity; The study found that the heavier twin in BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs displayed an upregulation of inflammation and other immunological pathways/genes (e.g. <italic>IFI30</italic> and <italic>CCL18)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Other studies have used blood samples to examine differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis from a cohort of monozygotic twins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A study by Wang et al. found 32 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were upregulated in the higher BMI twins including DEGs associated with obesity (e.g. <italic>NAMPT</italic>, <italic>TLR9</italic>, <italic>PTGS2</italic>, <italic>HBD</italic>, and <italic>PCSK1N</italic>), immunological (e.g., <italic>TLR9</italic>), and metabolic functions (e.g., <italic>PTGS2</italic>). Wang et al. also used WGCN to identify two modules strongly correlated to BMI including genes responsible for regulation of phospholipase activity, high density lipoprotein particle clearance, and voltage-gated potassium channel complex. Animal studies have also found that an association between obesity-related genes and inflammation. Studies have found inflammatory signaling affects adipocyte insulin receptors and causes insulin resistance, which further contributed to fatty acid accumulation and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">Gene modules were constructed based on gene expression at baseline. As these modules were constructed at baseline, we did not observe significant associations between gene modules and clinical traits beyond the baseline (i.e. following kidney transplant). As presented by Cashion et al. additional variables (aside from gene associations) contribute to clinical traits following transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For example younger age, higher carbohydrate consumption, higher trunk fat, and higher perception of mental health quality of life are predictors of weight gain following kidney transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par55">Importantly, our analysis is limited to the clinical and demographic variables collected in the parent study. Additionally, only a portion of the participants in the parent study signed the repository consent and had available microarray data. Future studies should examine the co-expression patterns in larger more diverse populations of kidney transplant patients. Studies must also examine whether the obesity-related gene co-expression patterns observed in this study apply to weight gain in the general population.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par56">The current study examined gene co-expression patterns associated with obesity-related traits in kidney transplant recipients. Utilizing WGCNA, we generated gene co-expression networks associated with obesity-related traits to highlight possible gene modules responsible for obesity, and assessed these modules’ pathways, molecular functions, and gene-gene interactions with obesity-related traits. A total of 35 co-expression modules were detected, two modules were associated with clinical traits. These modules are involved in metabolic and immune processes (including genes involved in lipid metabolism and immune-related functions) and are associated with multiple obesity-related traits, total subcutaneous body fat and whole-body fat percent. This study offers a deeper understanding of the gene network properties underlying obesity-related traits and provides new insights regarding the biological processes underlying obesity in kidney transplant patients.</p>
