                <p id="Par1">AMEERA-1 is a Phase 1/2 open-label single-arm study evaluating once-daily (QD) amcenestrant, an orally bioavailable selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer (NCT03284957), who were mostly heavily pretreated (including targeted therapies and fulvestrant). In the dose escalation phase (Part A: <italic>n</italic> = 16), patients received amcenestrant 20-600 mg QD. Based on absence of dose-limiting toxicities, paired functional <sup>18</sup>F-fluoroestradiol positron emission tomography, and pharmacokinetics, 400 mg QD was selected as recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the dose expansion phase (Part B: <italic>n</italic> = 49). No Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events or clinically significant cardiac/eye toxicities were reported. The Part B primary endpoint, confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 3/45 at the interim analysis and 5/46 (10.9%) at the final analysis. The overall clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 13/46 (28.3%). CBRs among patients with baseline wild-type and mutated <italic>ESR1</italic> were 9/26 (34.6%) and 4/19 (21.1%), respectively. Paired tumor biopsy and cell-free DNA analyses revealed ER inhibition and degradation, and a reduction in detectable <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations, including <italic>Y537S</italic>. In conclusion, amcenestrant at RP2D of 400 mg QD for monotherapy is well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities, and demonstrates preliminary antitumor activity irrespective of baseline <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation status.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer, accounting for 24.2% of all cancer diagnoses and 15.0% of cancer-related mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The majority (68–73%) of women with breast cancer present with hormone receptor-positive (HR+; estrogen receptor-positive [ER+] and/or progesterone receptor-positive [PgR+]) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) disease, with 14–15% presenting with HER2+ disease and 10–12% with triple-negative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Endocrine therapies, including aromatase inhibitors (AIs, e.g., letrozole), selective ER modulators (SERMs, e.g., tamoxifen), and selective ER degraders (SERDs, e.g., fulvestrant) that block ER signaling via ER inhibition, modulation, or degradation, and hence estrogen-promoted tumor growth, are mainstays of treatment for patients with HR+/HER2− breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Although 5-year relative survival rates in the US among women with HR+/HER2− breast cancer are high with localized (100%) or regional (90%) disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, approximately 30% of patients will relapse, often with metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, which is associated with a low 5-year relative survival (30%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Among women with advanced or metastatic disease, resistance to endocrine therapies commonly occurs, either because of the development of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in 12–39% of tumors exposed to AIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or poor drug bioavailability in tumors treated with fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These and other mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting, including overexpression of ER coactivators and loss of ER dependence via activation of other oncogenic signals such as via NF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or ARID1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> loss, may differentially affect the efficacy of endocrine therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Tumors that have developed resistance to one endocrine therapy and continue to express ER but have not lost ER dependence often respond to an alternative endocrine therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> or to a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, which are downstream effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and usually given in combination with endocrine therapy for synergy. For example, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations detected after AI therapy for metastatic breast cancer promote AI resistance while retaining sensitivity to ER antagonism via SERMs or SERDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the in vivo activity of SERMs and SERDs is often compromised by properties of these drugs related to (i) partial agonism of some SERMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, (ii) toxicity profiles of certain drugs potentially contributing to discontinuation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and (iii) poor bioavailability of some compounds compromising target inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The latter represents a major limitation of the only approved SERD, fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, whose poor oral bioavailability (requiring intramuscular injections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and 1 month to reach steady state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>) and pharmacodynamic limitations (the maximum 500 mg dose does not fully occupy the ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>) have contributed to therapy failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This represents a particular problem for the <italic>Y537S</italic> mutation in <italic>ESR1</italic>, which is the second most common <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation (14%) requiring higher doses of the drug to achieve occupancy and inhibition of the ER ligand-binding domain and is associated with fulvestrant resistance in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, there remains a need for potent and non-toxic pure ER antagonists to overcome the limitations of existing endocrine therapies.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Amcenestrant (SAR439859) is an orally bioavailable SERD that demonstrates pure ER antagonism in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Compared with other SERD agents, amcenestrant provides optimal ER antagonism and degradation. Amcenestrant robustly inhibits the ER signaling pathway in multiple ER+ breast cancer cell lines, including fulvestrant- and tamoxifen-resistant lines, as well as cell lines harboring ER mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Preclinical data show that amcenestrant degrades the ER with high efficacy (98%) and potency (0.2 nM) comparable to fulvestrant in vitro activity, is metabolically stable, and has no off-target activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration ≤1 µM) in a large in vitro safety screen panel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Moreover, in a mouse model of subcutaneous <italic>MCF7-Y537S</italic> mutant ERα + breast cancer, <sup>18</sup>F-fluoroestradiol positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FES PET) imaging confirmed that amcenestrant dose-dependently inhibited tumor uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FES, which correlated with immunohistochemical scoring for ERα expression, and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET showed a significant decrease in tumoral FLT accumulation when amcenestrant was combined with palbociclib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings support the further development of amcenestrant, alone and in combination therapy, for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Here, we report the final results from Arm 1 of the Phase 1/2 study (AMEERA-1) among postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer, which evaluates the safety, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of amcenestrant administered as monotherapy in dose escalation (Part A) and dose expansion (Part B).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par43">In the current AMEERA-1 study, among postmenopausal women with metastatic ER+/HER2− breast cancer treated with amcenestrant ≥20 mg QD as monotherapy, we observed an absence of DLTs without reaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a favorable safety profile, and a strong pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma amcenestrant concentration and saturation of ER occupancy in multiple tumor sites by <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT imaging at doses ≥150 mg as well as evidence of antitumor activity. On this basis, amcenestrant 400 mg QD was chosen as the monotherapy RP2D for the dose-expansion phase.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Amcenestrant demonstrated overall median ER occupancy of 97% on <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT scans across all doses (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and in multiple tumor sites, including lymph nodes, lung, and bone. Median occupancy was 100% at the RP2D of amcenestrant 400 mg QD (<italic>n</italic> = 3; range 87–100%). In contrast, fulvestrant 500 mg has shown median ER occupancy levels of 85% (<italic>n</italic> = 16; range −60% to 99%), with lower levels of ER occupancy being associated with an increased risk of disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Although <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT imaging can assess ER occupancy to its ligand estrogen, it does not constitute formal proof that amcenestrant degrades ERs in tumors; however, our paired tumor biopsy analyses confirmed that amcenestrant achieved on-target activity (ER degradation/pathway inhibition) among women with metastatic ER+/HER2– breast cancer whose tumors carried multiple <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–d</xref>). Of note, although all patients were ER+ at the diagnostic biopsy, which may have been conducted before enrollment or screening, some patients had ER nucleus H-scores of zero at the screening biopsy, which may have arisen because of ER degradation from prior exposure to fulvestrant or to tissue sampling bias.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Various <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were detected at baseline, including <italic>D538G</italic>, <italic>Y537S</italic>, and <italic>Y537N</italic>. The proportion of patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations at baseline in the current study (49.2%) was higher than that generally reported in advanced/metastatic breast cancer (36.4%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but was consistent with other published studies among patients with hormone-receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving monotherapy with fulvestrant or oral SERDs where rates as high as 65% have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This could suggest that patients with difficult-to-treat <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations tend to be overrepresented in the clinical trial setting. On treatment at cycle 2 day 28, amcenestrant reduced the number of most of these <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in cfDNA, and in 37% of cases, these mutations were no longer detectable, including known resilient <italic>Y537S</italic> and <italic>D538G</italic> mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Moreover, amcenestrant showed clinical benefit independent of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation status, demonstrating activity in tumors with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations known to be associated with endocrine resistance. Thus, mechanisms other than <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations appear to drive resistance to amcenestrant among these patients.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Amcenestrant is orally administered QD and has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, whereas fulvestrant, the only approved SERD, has low oral bioavailability and must be administered as two large-volume intramuscular injections with up to 1 month to reach a steady state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Amcenestrant showed limited accumulation; and exposure increased proportionally with doses up to 600 mg after repeated oral administration. At the 400 mg dose, exposure showed moderate total variability (&lt;40%) associated with a low systemic clearance (10.6 L/h), and no elimination in the urine. The increase in exposures when administered with food was considered a moderate effect when compared with the larger overall variability of pharmacokinetic exposures, allowing amcenestrant to be administered regardless of food status. The mean <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> concentration obtained at the 400 mg dose level (geometric mean 466 ng/mL, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>) was well above the minimum concentration associated with near 90% occupancy or more of ERs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> was about 40 times higher (in molar concentration) than that for fulvestrant (12.5 ng/mL) at steady state after 500 mg intramuscular administration (day 1, day 14 of cycle 1, 500 mg monthly from cycle 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par47">In dose expansion, the primary endpoint evaluating antitumor activity showed an ORR by ICR of 5/46 (10.9%), comprising 1 CR and 4 PRs, and a CBR of 13/46 (28.3%). It is important to note that most patients were heavily pretreated with up to eight lines of therapies in the advanced setting, including up to six lines of hormonal therapies, and prior treatment with chemotherapy, fulvestrant, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Although cross-trial comparisons should be conducted with caution and the current trial sample size was small, we indirectly compared ORR and CBR with methodologically similar studies investigating the recommended 500 mg dose of fulvestrant monotherapy in the second or third-line setting among postmenopausal women (or where pre- or perimenopausal women had received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog prior to randomization that continued throughout the study) with advanced/metastatic ER+/HER2− breast cancer and whose tumor responses were confirmed as per RECIST v1.1 in populations with measurable disease. Four studies met these criteria. The PALOMA-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and FAKTION<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> studies recruited women who had received up to three prior lines of endocrine therapy and the SOLAR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and SANDPIPER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> studies with up to two prior lines. The PALOMA-3 study excluded women who had received prior fulvestrant and CDK4/6, PI3K, and/or mTOR inhibitors. The FAKTION, SOLAR-1, and SANDPIPER studies excluded women who had received prior fulvestrant and PI3K inhibitors, and the SOLAR-1 and SANDPIPER studies also excluded women who had received prior mTOR inhibitors. All four comparator studies investigated less heavily pretreated patients than those in AMEERA-1. In these studies, the fulvestrant monotherapy ORR ranged from 10.9 to 16.2% and CBR ranged from 36.0 to 44.1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Our post hoc exploratory subgroup analyses assessed the impact of prior therapies on antitumor activity with amcenestrant. Among women who had received ≤3 prior advanced lines in the metastatic setting (<italic>n</italic> = 27), the ORR was 18.5% and CBR was 44.4%, which appeared numerically comparable to historical results with fulvestrant monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Among women who had not received prior CDK4/6 inhibitors (<italic>n</italic> = 19), the ORR was 26.3% and CBR 52.6%. Among women who had not received prior CDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitors or fulvestrant (<italic>n</italic> = 11), the ORR was 36.4% and CBR was 54.5%. Given that endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor is now standard of care for the first-line management of patients with ER+/HER2− advanced/metastatic breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which was not established practice at the time AMEERA-1 was designed, we recognize that patients who had not received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor (35.4% in the current study) had a greater antitumor response to amcenestrant than patients who had received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor. However, because AMEERA-1 was a first-in-human Phase 1 study, it was important to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of amcenestrant in a broad population of patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer regardless of prior therapy use.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Amcenestrant demonstrated a favorable safety profile and treatment was well-tolerated. No TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation and most were Grade 2 or less. No serious AEs were considered treatment-related by investigators and no treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 occurred. Among listed serious AEs (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), no clinically significant cardiac or eye safety findings were observed, whereas these AEs have been reported with other orally administered SERDs in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Study strengths include the combined evaluation of safety, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics demonstrating robust target engagement and ER degradation/pathway inhibition in ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer. Study limitations of this Phase 1/2 trial include the small sample size because the prespecified interim analysis results after at least four cycles of amcenestrant therapy led to stopping accrual to Part B. With continued follow-up and monitoring, five patients had responded at the final analysis cutoff date of 30 March 2021. Had these responses been observed earlier than the cutoff date of 30 May 2020, Part B accrual would have continued. However, the knowledge that amcenestrant could be associated with ongoing responses after prolonged therapy was lacking at the time of the design of the study. Given that prolonged responses with amcenestrant were observed, including encouraging clinical benefit rates, and with a very promising safety profile, we considered it unnecessary to reopen the study because sufficient information on the compound had been gained to justify continuing with the amcenestrant clinical development program in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. Additional limitations included, a lack of racial diversity, not all patients having paired tumor biopsies, and the absence of a control arm, requiring validation of these results in larger comparative studies.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Amcenestrant development plan studies in specific populations include: the ongoing AMEERA-1 investigating amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib (Parts C and D), alpelisib (Parts F and G), everolimus (Parts H and I), or abemaciclib (Parts J and K); AMEERA-3 (NCT04059484), a randomized Phase 2 trial investigating amcenestrant monotherapy versus physician’s choice of endocrine therapy among patients with ER + /HER2 − locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to hormonal therapies; AMEERA-4 (NCT04191382), a window of opportunity study investigating amcenestrant at two dose levels versus letrozole on change in Ki67 (percentage of positive tumor cells) among newly diagnosed preoperative postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2− breast cancer; and AMEERA-5 (NCT04478266), a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 study, investigating amcenestrant plus palbociclib versus letrozole plus palbociclib among patients with ER+/HER2− breast cancer who have not received prior systemic anti-cancer treatment for advanced disease.</p>
              <p id="Par53">In conclusion, amcenestrant, an oral SERD, at RP2D of 400 mg QD for monotherapy showed no DLTs and a favorable safety profile with no clinically significant cardiac or eye safety findings, and demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity irrespective of baseline <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation status among postmenopausal women with metastatic ER+/HER2− breast cancer, most of whom were heavily pretreated with targeted therapies and/or fulvestrant.

Dose escalation proceeded based on the occurrence of DLT together with target saturation by <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT scans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and pharmacokinetic parameters during the first 28-day cycle, and according to a 3 + 3 design. For a detailed description of methods for dose escalation and selection of the RP2D, see Supplementary Methods: Dose escalation amcenestrant monotherapy. A twice-daily (BID) dosing regimen of 6 patients receiving amcenestrant 300 mg BID was also planned. During dose expansion, patients were treated at the RP2D. Patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent, or other reasons determined by the investigator (poor compliance with the protocol or intercurrent illness).</p>

                <p id="Par58">In Part A, the dose-escalation phase, the primary endpoints were the incidence of treatment-related DLTs during cycle 1 (days 1–28), defined as the occurrence of any TEAEs related to the study therapy from a predefined list of hematological, non-hematological, and hepatic AEs as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03 (see Supplementary Methods: Definition of DLTs for a list of DLT-defining TEAEs); and the determination of the MTD, defined as the highest dose level at which ≤1/6 evaluable patients experienced a DLT, and the RP2D.</p>
                <p id="Par59">In the absence of DLTs, the RP2D was defined considering pharmacokinetics after repeated administration, level of inhibition of target occupancy measured by <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT imaging, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics on ER occupancy. The RP2D should be at least two dose levels above the dose level showing &gt;90% decrease in maximum standardized uptake value (average of all index lesions’ maximum <sup>18</sup>F-FES uptake standardized by body weight and corrected for background <sup>18</sup>F-FES uptake: SUV<sub>max(cor)</sub>) on <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT imaging (considered to represent inhibition of estrogen ligand binding or near-complete ER degradation), unless there were DLTs at this dose, in which case the RP2D could be any dose where &gt;90% decrease in standardized uptake was reached.</p>
                <p id="Par60">In Part B, the dose-expansion phase, the primary endpoint was the confirmed ORR by ICR.</p>
                <p id="Par61">Because most patients recruited to the study were heavily pretreated with up to 8 lines of prior therapy in the advanced setting (76.9% ≥2 prior lines), 73.8% had received targeted therapies, and 47.7% prior fulvestrant, we conducted two exploratory subgroup analyses for the Part B primary endpoint among patients who had received ≤3 prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting, and among patients who had not received prior CDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitors or fulvestrant. These subgroup analyses based upon prior treatments were performed to match baseline patient characteristics to historical studies with fulvestrant for indirect antitumor activity comparison. In addition, we conducted a third exploratory subgroup analysis among patients who had not received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor.</p>

                <p id="Par66">To evaluate pharmacodynamics in Part A, <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT imaging was performed at baseline and between Days 11 and 15 of the first cycle (16–24 h after the previous amcenestrant dose) to evaluate the extent of residual ER availability at a steady state of ER occupancy (after ≥8 continuous days of treatment). ER occupancy was calculated as the percentage reduction in <sup>18</sup>F-FES SUV<sub>max(cor)</sub> between the on-treatment and screening scans. In addition, a blood sample was collected just before <sup>18</sup>F-FES radioisotope administration on the day of <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT scan (day 11–15) to assess the correlation between the plasma concentration of amcenestrant and scan results.

                <p id="Par69">Post hoc exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted. In order to maximize sample size and exposure to a pharmacodynamically active amcenestrant dose for exploratory biomarker analyses, we selected a pooled population of patients from Parts A and B who had received an amcenestrant dose ≥150 mg. We chose this dose cutoff because doses ≥150 mg showed high levels of ER occupancy on <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET scans, whereas ER occupancy was very low for two of the three patients receiving amcenestrant 20 mg (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par70">To analyze ER degradation/pathway inhibition, tumor biopsies were collected at screening and at the end of cycle 2 (cycle 2, day 28) in patients from Part B who provided consent for their collection. For each biopsy, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were collected of 5 µm each for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, and of 10 µm each for RNA extraction and subsequent RNA-seq analysis. IHC ER, PgR, and Ki67 protein expression slides were assessed by two expert pathologists (V.P. and A.-L.B.). IHC staining was performed on the Ventana Discovery XT IHC platform using anti-ER clone SP1 (CONFIRM Anti-Estrogen Receptor, Roche, ref. 790–4325), anti-PgR clone 1E2 (CONFIRM Anti-progesterone receptor, Roche, ref. 790–4296), and anti-Ki67 clone 30-9 (CONFIRM Anti-Ki-67, Roche, Ref. 790–4286). Stained slides were evaluated by standard light microscopy using a manual scoring system. Staining was evaluated in tumor cells only. For ER and PgR expression, H-scores were calculated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. For Ki67 protein expression, the percentage of positive tumor cells was calculated.</p>
                <p id="Par71">Total RNA was extracted from FFPE tissue (slides of 10 µm). A targeted-enrichment RNA-seq approach was applied utilizing KAPA RNA HyperPrep and whole exome SeqCap kits (Roche) followed by the generation of sequencing reads with NextSeq 500 (Illumina). RNA-seq FASTQ files were processed with STAR aligner and Cufflinks to generate gene-level fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par73">Sample size considerations. A minimax Simon 2-stage design with a 5% one-sided Type 1 error rate was used to test the null hypothesis of a 10% response rate. Under the alternative assumption of 20% response rate, a total of 78 patients were needed to guarantee at least 80% power, accounting for the binding futility interim analysis. In the first stage, 45 patients were to be accrued in Part B and were evaluated for tumor responses after they had had two tumor assessments (i.e., after at least four cycles of amcenestrant therapy) or early progression or an end-of-treatment tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. If ≤4 responders by ICR in these 45 patients were observed, accrual to Part B would be stopped. The null hypothesis would be rejected if ≥13 responders were observed in the 78 patients.</p>
                <p id="Par74">Analysis populations and associated statistical methods. The DLT-evaluable population during Part A was planned to include all patients who had received a first complete cycle, who had received at least 75% of the intended dosing (unless the patient discontinued treatment before cycle 1 completion because of a DLT), and had evaluable <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET/CT scans at baseline and between day 11 and day 15 of the first cycle. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p>
                <p id="Par75">The safety population included all patients exposed to at least one dose of the study treatment. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p>

Patients with an early progression as per RECIST v1.1 or who died from disease progression were evaluable for response. Results were analyzed using mostly descriptive statistics; for ORR and CBR, 90% CIs were calculated using the exact method of Clopper-Pearson.</p>
                <p id="Par77">The pharmacokinetic population evaluable for non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA) was defined as all patients from the all-treated population without any major deviations related to study treatment administration (e.g., early vomiting just after drug administration, food status), and who had adequate blood samples enabling determination of at least one pharmacokinetic parameter. NCA was performed using Phoenix<sup>®</sup> software.</p>
                <p id="Par78">The biomarker-evaluable population was defined as all patients with available biomarker data from the response-evaluable pooled population of patients from Parts A and B who had received an amcenestrant dose ≥150 mg excluding the pharmacodynamically inactive 20-mg dose. Only paired samples (screening or cycle 1, Day1 and available cycle 2, day 28 samples) were considered for assessment of the evolution of biomarkers over time.

              <title>Data availability</title>
              <p>Researchers, such as any researcher holding a faculty appointment or research position at an institution of higher education, a research organization, or a nonprofit organization, may request access to patient-level data and related study documents including the clinical study report, study protocol with any amendments, blank case report form, statistical analysis plan, and dataset specifications for legitimate research purposes, as evaluated by an independent scientific review board. Patient-level data will be anonymized and study documents will be redacted to protect the privacy of our trial participants. Access to data may be restricted in cases where data collected are subject to contractual obligations (for example, data obtained by Sanofi from independent institutions where the data sharing contract prohibits onward sharing to third parties) or require patient consent for sharing (for example, if patients do not consent for their data to be shared with third parties or to be deposited in repositories). Data use agreements will be used for approved data requests. Access to data is expected to take on average 2–5 months, and will depend on various factors. These factors include the number of data contributors, the number of studies, the availability of the requestor to respond to comments, the ability to align with the data use agreement, and if the data from the trial have already been anonymized. Further details on Sanofi’s data-sharing criteria, eligible studies, and process for requesting access can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.vivli.org/">https://www.vivli.org/</ext-link>. Patients in this study did not give consent for their genomic data to be shared or deposited in repositories. Thus, in accordance with Sanofi’s commitment to honoring patient preferences and protecting patient privacy, patient-level genomic data, including RNA-seq data, are not available. Although Parts A and B of this study are complete, which comprise the data presented in this manuscript, the other parts of the study (Parts C through K) are ongoing. As such, at the time of publication, the study is not eligible for posting on the Vivli platform until all parts of the study have been completed. However, requests for data of unlisted studies can be placed via the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vivli.org/members/enquiries-about-studies-not-listed-on-the-vivli-platform/">https://vivli.org/members/enquiries-about-studies-not-listed-on-the-vivli-platform/</ext-link>.</p>
