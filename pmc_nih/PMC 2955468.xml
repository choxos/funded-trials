                  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                  <p>Older adults comprise an increasing proportion of the prison and homeless populations. While older age is associated with adverse post-release health events and incarceration is a risk factor for homelessness, the health status and homelessness risk of older pre-release prisoners are unknown. Moreover, most post-release services are geared towards veterans; it is unknown whether the needs of non-veterans differ from those of veterans.</p>

                  <p>Mean age was 61 years; 93.8% were men and 56.5% were white. Nearly 40% were veterans, of whom 77.2% reported likely VA service eligibility. Veterans were more likely to be white and to have obtained a high school diploma or GED. Overall, 79.1% reported a medical condition and 13.6% reported a serious mental illness. There was little difference in health status between veterans and non-veterans. Although 1 in 12 prisoners reported a risk factor for homelessness, the risk factors did not differ according to veteran status.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>Older pre-release prisoners had a high burden of medical and mental illness and were at risk for post-release homelessness regardless of veteran status. Reentry programs linking pre-release older prisoners to medical and psychiatric services and to homelessness prevention programs are needed for both veterans and non-veterans.</p>

              <title>BACKGROUND</title>
              <p>The United States has the highest incarceration rate of any industrialized country, with 1 in 100 American adults incarcerated in 2008.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> Longer sentences and reductions in discretionary parole have led to an increased proportion of older prisoners (≥55 years of age).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> In 2008, 4.1% of US prisoners were aged 55 or older,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref> and substantial increases in the number of older prisoners are expected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref> The vast majority of prisoners (97%) eventually return to the community,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> typically with no health insurance, limited employment prospects, and insufficient finances.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> Most prisoners are released with a nominal amount of “gate money” (generally 50–100 dollars) and a bus ticket, and half of state correctional departments provide only a 1–2 week supply of medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> Those eligible for government benefits such as Medicaid, Medicare, and social security income must wait up to 3 months for reinstatement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> Older prisoners are far less likely than younger prisoners to be reincarcerated after release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> Compared to younger prisoners, older prisoners have higher rates of chronic medical conditions and a higher risk of post-release death,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> yet little is known about the health status of older prisoners awaiting release.</p>
              <p>Older prisoners may also face challenges to successful community reentry that compound health problems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Many newly released prisoners confront difficulties with employment and housing,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> and up to half of the nation’s homeless have a history of incarceration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> Although the US homeless population has aged over the past several decades,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> and homelessness is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and acute health care utilization,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> the risk of post-release homelessness among older adults has not been evaluated. Such information would be valuable since coordinated treatment programs can improve health outcomes for homeless adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
</p>
              <p>Because veterans comprise about 10% of the prison population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref> and one-third of the homeless population,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> the Department for Veterans Affairs has spearheaded several nationwide initiatives to help meet the health care and housing needs of veterans being released from prisons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref> However, services for non-veteran released prisoners are poorly established and are available only on a state-by-state basis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref> It is unclear if the reentry needs of non-veterans differ from those of veterans, raising the question of whether similar interventions should be targeted to non-veterans. We assessed and compared the health status and risk of homelessness among older veteran and non-veteran prisoners who were within 2 years of release.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Sample</title>
                <p>We conducted a cross-sectional study of 360 prisoners, aged 55 or older, who were within 2 years of release from a US federal or state prison using data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (SISFCF). The SISFCF targets a nationally representative, random sample of US prisoners who participate in confidential interviews conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref> The self-report medical questions were developed by BJS from health questions in other national health surveys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref> We included prisoners within 2 years of release to characterize the health status and risk of homelessness of older adults who would soon reenter the community. Consistent with prior literature, we defined “older” prisoners as those who were ≥55 years to reflect the increased and premature burden of illness and disability occurring among prisoners in comparison to non-prisoners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
</p>
                <p>Overall, 14,499 prisoners from 287 state prisons and 3,686 prisoners from 39 federal prisons were randomly selected to participate in the 2004 SISFCF. The response rate was 89% for state and 84% for federal prisoners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref> Of 18,185 participants, 974 (5.35%) were ≥55 years of age. Among these older prisoners, 37.0% were within 2 years of anticipated release, resulting in a final sample size of 360.</p>

                  <p>Health status was based on self-report of 11 chronic medical conditions and 3 categories of serious mental illnesses. The 11 medical conditions included current cancer or paralysis, and current or past diagnosis of hypertension, brain injury or stroke, diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems, arthritis, asthma, cirrhosis, or hepatitis. The three categories of serious mental illnesses included depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. We reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately from serious mental illness to be consistent with prior literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> The SISFCF used brief questions to elicit medical histories (e.g., “Have you ever had high blood pressure or hypertension?”). Survey participants who reported a history of cancer or paralysis were asked if the condition was still present. To ascertain mental health status, participants were provided a list of psychiatric disorders and asked if a mental health professional had ever told them they had any of the conditions. To assess disability status, we analyzed responses to four questions: (1) “Do you use a cane, wheelchair, walker, hearing aid, or other aids to help you with your daily activities?” (2) “Do you consider yourself to have a disability?” (3) “Do you have difficulty hearing a normal conversations even when wearing a hearing aid?” (4) “Do you have difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint, even when wearing glasses?” Self-report of medical conditions and disability is well validated in older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>As the American population ages, the number of incarcerated and homeless older adults is increasing rapidly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> We found that older veteran and non-veteran prisoners who were within 2 years of release had a similar burden of medical and psychiatric conditions, and an equal number of risk factors for homelessness.</p>
              <p>Appropriate targeting of community-based medical services to the growing number of newly released older prisoners is hampered by inadequate information about their health needs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> A survey of returning prisoners of all ages showed that one-third of those with physical or mental health conditions used emergency room care and one-fifth were hospitalized within 8–10 months after release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref> Another survey found that most older prisoners had fears about their post-incarceration health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Former prisoners have a 12.7-fold increased risk of death in the 2 weeks following release (even excluding seriously ill prisoners granted compassionate medical release); the most common causes of death for those over age 45 are cardiovascular disease and cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> We found that nearly 80% of older pre-release prisoners in our sample reported at least one chronic medical condition (average of 2.1) and that the rates of many medical conditions exceeded those reported in the community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref> These findings highlight the importance of pre-release health care planning for older prisoners.</p>
              <p>The prevalence of serious mental illness in older community-dwelling adults is 15%–20%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref> A current or past history of serious mental illness was reported by 13.6% of our sample, similar to rates reported among older prisoners in Texas (11.0%),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> Tennessee (16.0%),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref> and Utah (13.6%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref> The actual proportion of our sample burdened with significant mental illness is undoubtedly higher than 13.6% because PTSD was excluded from the “serious mental illness” category. This exclusion is the result of an operational definition created to maintain consistency and comparability with other studies and is not intended to imply that PTSD is not a serious mental illness. There is a complex relationship among mental illness, homelessness, and incarceration, and a heightened risk of both recidivism and homelessness among released prisoners with mental illness has been observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref> Additionally, homeless adults with mental illness and an incarceration history have a higher likelihood of experiencing long-term homelessness than those without mental illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref> These findings underscore the importance of providing linkages to community-based mental health services for older released prisoners.</p>
              <p>Because of the association between homelessness and increased acute health care utilization and mortality,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> homelessness prevention strategies have received increasing attention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref> A history of incarceration is a risk factor for homelessness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref> and between 6.3% and 11.4% of prisoners of all ages use homeless shelters following release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref> At least 8.4% of our sample was at risk for homelessness (based on a prior history of homelessness) and more than a quarter expected to live alone following release. These findings suggest that expanded efforts to secure housing for pre-release older prisoners are warranted.</p>
              <p>Although pre-release health care and homelessness prevention planning for all older prisoners is needed, well-established and coordinated programs are typically available only to veterans. In 2001, Congress mandated that the Department of Veterans Affairs collaborate with the Department of Labor and the Bureau of Prisons to assist veterans during reentry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref> This collaboration culminated in the Incarcerated Veterans Transition Program in 2003, a demonstration program providing incarcerated veterans with connections to housing, health care, training, and employment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref> The Healthcare for Reentry Veterans Program, implemented in 2007, has provided outreach and reentry services to over 12,000 veterans in 451 state and federal prisons through June of 2009.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref> Our study showed that 77% of pre-release older prisoners who were veterans reported military discharges with conditions likely to make them eligible for VA services. In addition, while veterans comprise about 10% of the state prison population,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref> nearly 40% of our sample of older prisoners were veterans. This highlights the importance of the VA’s outreach efforts for this segment of the incarcerated population.</p>
              <p>Conversely, 60% of our sample of older prisoners were non-veterans, underscoring the importance of developing national transition programs for non-veterans for whom existing services are limited.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref> While non-veterans on parole may receive reentry assistance via a parole officer or formal parole programs, such services are diminishing with increasing non-parole releases and parole officer caseloads.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref> Although the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative, established in 2003, provided more than $100 million to local reentry program development, the programs only focused on prisoners aged 35 and younger.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
</p>
              <p>Although coordinated reentry programs for non-veteran older prisoners are lacking, we found that rates of poor health status and risk of homelessness were just as high among this group as among veterans. Unfortunately, most states terminate Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security Disability Income eligibility during incarceration,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> and reinstituting coverage can take up to 3 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> Given the high costs of emergency department services and the high risk of homelessness, all pre-release older prisoners should receive assistance with securing housing, medical care, and reinstatement of benefits, and should be screened for eligibility for VA services.</p>
              <p>A strength of our study was that it included a random, nationally representative sample of US prisoners. Limitations included the use of self-reported data, although the majority of studies have found relatively strong agreement between self-report and medical record validation of major medical conditions in older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref> A validation of the medical questions in the SISFCF did identify some underreporting of medical conditions compared with administrative medical data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref> Although we do not know the extent of underreporting, the fact that Census Bureau employees conducted the survey and that no financial incentive was offered for participation likely minimized any incentives to provide inaccurate information. Additionally, underreporting of medical conditions would strengthen our finding that pre-release older adults have more medical conditions than nonincarcerated older adults. Also, it is possible that some veterans in our sample failed to self-identify, while other respondents falsely identified themselves as veterans. Given that we found few differences between the two groups, this possibility is unlikely to have affected our findings. Finally, because this study was cross-sectional, we were unable to determine how many respondents actually experienced homelessness after reentry. Prospective studies are needed to assess rates of homelessness, medical decompensation, and mortality among older released prisoners.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the health status and homelessness risk for older pre-release prisoners. We found that such prisoners had high rates of medical conditions, serious mental illness, and risk of post-release homelessness, regardless of veteran status. While national reentry planning programs for veterans are expanding, the overwhelming similarity in poor health status and homelessness risk between older veterans and non-veterans suggests that programs of equal breadth and caliber are needed for non-veteran older prisoners.</p>
