              <abstract>
                <p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with the vast majority of cervical cancer cases as well as with other anogenital cancers. PepCan is an investigational HPV therapeutic vaccine for treating cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The present study was performed to test whether the cervical microbiome influences vaccine responses and to explore host factors as determinants of the cervical microbiome composition in women with biopsy-proven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. In a recently completed Phase I clinical trial of PepCan, histological response rate of 45% (14 of 31 patients), a significant increase in circulating T-helper type 1 cells, and a significant decrease in HPV 16 viral load were reported. DNA, extracted from liquid cytology specimens collected before and after vaccinations, were amplified and then hybridized to a G4 PhyloChip assay to characterize the microbiome. We describe trends that certain bacterial taxa in the cervix may be enriched in non-responders in comparison to responders (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> = .052 for phylum <italic>Caldithrix</italic> and <italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> = .059 for phylum <italic>Nitrospirae</italic>). There was no difference in bacterial diversity between the 2 groups. A permutational analysis of variance performed for various demographic and immune parameters showed significant clustering with microbiome beta diversity for race, HPV 16 status, peripheral T-helper type 1 cells, and HLA-B40 (<italic>P</italic> = .001, .014, .037, and .024, respectively). Further analyses showed significant differences at the empirical Operational Taxonomic Unit level for race and HPV 16 status. As these results are from a small Phase I study, further studies are needed to examine the role of cervical microbiome in response to HPV therapeutic vaccines.</p>

Women with biopsy-proven HSILs were eligible for intradermal vaccination, which was administered in limbs (most commonly administered in forearms, and less commonly in the outer thigh) every 3 weeks for a total of 4 injections. The doses of the peptides tested were 50 Âµg/peptide, 100 Âµg/peptide, 250 Âµg/peptide, and 500 Âµg/peptide, and 6 patients were tested in each dose group.

              <p>To our knowledge, this study of women with HSILs was the first to examine the effects of the cervical microbiome in response to therapeutic HPV vaccination. This is of clinical interest since others have shown the impact of the gut microbiome on patientâs responses to checkpoint inhibitors,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr10-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> but not necessarily that of a local microbiome, for example, that of the skin in melanoma patients. We studied the cervical microbiome in patients with biopsy-proven HSILs prior to receiving an investigational HPV therapeutic vaccine, and have described trends of phyla <italic>Caldithrix</italic> and <italic>Nitrospirae</italic> being enriched in the nonresponder group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534735419893063">Figure 3</xref>; <italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> = .052 and .059, respectively). Furthermore, 3 eOTUs were enriched in the vaccine nonresponder group, including <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp (<italic>Prevotellaceae</italic>), A17 sp (family <italic>Pirellulaceae</italic>), and an unclassified species (94otu38814) in the family <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534735419893063">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, a local microbiome could potentially influence the mounting of immune response to consequences of local disease (ie, HSIL).</p>
              <p>Huang et al<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> conducted a study comparing the cervicovaginal community profiles among the cervix, posterior fornix, and vaginal canal of nonpregnant women, women in different stages of pregnancy, and postpartum women. Based on their results, it has been proposed that the cervicovaginal microbial communities were homogenous across these 3 anatomic sites although there was a substantial person-to-person variation.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our data presented above showed overabundance of <italic>Caldithrix, Nirtospirae, Prevotella</italic> sp A17 sp (family <italic>Pirellulaceae</italic>), and an unclassified species (94otu38814) in vaccine nonresponders, suggesting that certain bacterial taxa may influence immunological responses to vaccination. <italic>Prevotella</italic> has been best characterized as having a role in gynecological and general health.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>
<italic>Prevotella</italic> has been shown to be the key vaginal microbial species influencing host menopause, bacterial vaginosis, cervicitis, HPV status, body mass index, and hormone therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible that the abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> may be creating an environment conducive for HPV infection to take hold, thereby dampening the effect of therapeutic vaccination. The potential mechanisms for <italic>Caldithrix</italic> and <italic>Nitrospirae</italic> are difficult to speculate, as <italic>Caldithrix</italic> has been reported to be a nitrate-reducing, thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and <italic>Nitrospirae</italic> has been shown to alleviate nitrite toxicity by converting nitrite into nitrate in aquatic organisms.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> As classification of bacterial taxa is a dynamic process, it is possible that organisms identified in this study are closely related, but are of distinct taxa.</p>
              <p>We found no difference in alpha diversity of cervical microbiome between responders and nonresponders prior to vaccination. This is in contrast to other studies of gut microbiome, which showed that higher alpha diversity is associated with better response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr10-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Use of antibiotics has also been shown to be associated with reduced response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> suggesting a positive role of a healthy, diverse gut microbiome. Such a difference between the state of cervical and gut microbiomes in association with immune-based therapy may be a reflection of the difference in the baseline healthy states of these microbiota. More diverse gut microbiota are known to be associated with better response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr10-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> while a less diverse bacterial make-up comprised of a small number of species from the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus is considered to be a âhealthyâ state.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Therefore, there may be no advantages immunologically of having a diverse array of bacteria in the cervicovaginal milieu.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, cervical microbiome was characterized using the PhyloChip, a microarray-based platform that analyzes all 9 variable regions (V1-V9) of the 16S rRNA gene. This capability allows for detection of 16S rRNA sequences that have limited variation in one of their variable regions, whereas high-throughput, next-generation sequencing studies typically only amplify 1 or 2 variable regions (eg, V4, V3-V4). This technology has been previously used to identify differentially abundant microbes in other microbiome studies and results were concordant with V4 sequencing-based analyses.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Each method has its own limitations as to how its results could accurately represent bacterial composition of the samples being studied. Particular PCR primers used would naturally have stronger binding to certain taxa over others, possibly resulting in overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain taxa. The use of hybridization signal as outputs used by PhyloChip could possibly contribute to over- and underrepresentations similarly due to the properties of particular probes used. As it would be difficult to characterize the effects due to use of different methodologies, it would be important to use the same methods within and across studies that should be compared.</p>
              <p>It was expected that the cervical microbiome would be a low diversity community. For example, a total of 49 operational taxonomic units (by sequence) were identified in vaginal swab samples from 169 women.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In this study, a total of 72 to 365 eOTUs were observed per sample, with 1111 eOTUs observed across all samples. Additionally, 27 of these eOTUs were annotated at the strain-level, although they were not statistically significantly different between the nonresponder and responder groups.</p>
              <p>A typical healthy cervicovaginal bacterial community is reported to be composed of a small number of species within genus <italic>Lactobacillus.</italic><sup><xref rid="bibr38-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> This is believed to be due to production of lactic acid by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species leading to protection against genital infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="bibr43-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr44-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> As would be expected, such <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> dominance was not observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534735419893063">Figure 2</xref>), as all but one of the patients were HPV-positive and all had biopsy-proven HSILs.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Such observation is in line with the findings by others who described that prevalent HPV infection can decrease the abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species with a concomitant increase in anaerobes.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Others have also described that HPV-positive women have different microbial profiles compared with HPV-negative women.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr14-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> dominance has also been shown to decrease with increased severity of cervical disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Another possible explanation for the differential abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in our study is the fact that <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> dominance has been reported in women of resource-rich settings. In one study, 90% of Caucasian women had <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominant cervicovaginal microbiota. On the other hand, only 80% of Asian and 60% of Hispanic and African American women did.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In another study of young, healthy South African women, only 37% had <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominant cervicovaginal community.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The potential role of race on microbial composition was not only suggested by the differential abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in this study (as discussed above), but also by significant difference in beta diversity based on race (<xref rid="table2-1534735419893063" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, significant differences in relative abundance of 498 eOTUs were found based on race (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1534735419893063">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). However, there was no difference in racial distribution between the responders and nonresponders (<xref rid="table1-1534735419893063" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that, while race does influence the composition of cervical microbiome, it does not have effect on vaccine response.</p>
              <p>Significant differences in beta diversity were also observed between HPV 16-positive and HPV 16-negative samples with 15 eOTUs being significantly different in abundance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1534735419893063">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). Varied abundance in bacterial composition in women infected with HPV 16, 52, or 58 has been reported previously,<sup><xref rid="bibr46-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> suggesting the possibility that we may be seeing effects between viruses and bacteria. It could be that viral infections have strain-specific effects on bacterial communities. Alternatively, bacterial communities may possibly shape the risk of acquiring or have influence on durations of strain-specific viral infections. As the 2 biotypes revealed using Fast Unifrac significantly separate on the basis of HPV 16 status and race, the influences of these factors on cervical microbiome warrant further investigations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1534735419893063">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>It may be possible for some bacterial taxa such as <italic>Caldithrix, Nitrospirae</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella</italic> to influence the response to HPV therapeutic vaccine. However, similar analyses would need to be repeated with a larger sample size to obtain additional data. The ongoing Phase II clinical trial (NCT02481414) would provide such opportunity. It is possible that the observed cervical microbiome composition associated with nonresponsiveness may be a marker for some underlying immune phenotypes. In other words, the observed possible association could reflect a shared cause rather than a direct causal relationship. In this study, we did not observe an effect of vaccination on the composition of the cervical microbiome. Furthermore, race and infection with HPV 16 appear to influence the beta diversity of cervical microbiome. The major limitation of this study was the small sample size, which is not unexpected given that the clinical trial was in Phase I. Recently, Ilhan and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr47-1534735419893063" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> reported a study in which they examined the interplay among microbiota, HPV, and cervical disease status using cervicovaginal metabolic profiling. Nonâ<italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominant communities, particularly in patients with HSILs, showed altered amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms. Future studies should not only be performed with a larger sample size, but should also probe the mechanisms underlying the association of cervical bacterial communities with vaccine nonresponsiveness using such metabolic profiling. If the role of certain bacterial taxa and their associated metabolites with vaccine nonresponsiveness were to be confirmed, it may be worthwhile to consider modulating the cervical microbiome to enhance vaccine efficacy in the future.</p>
