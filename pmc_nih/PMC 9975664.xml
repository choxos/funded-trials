                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to guide therapy selection and monitor treatment response in patients with metastatic cancer. However, germline and clonal hematopoiesis–associated alterations can confound identification of tumor-specific mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA), often requiring additional sequencing of tumor tissue. The current study assessed whether ctDNA-based treatment response monitoring could be performed in a tumor tissue–independent manner by combining ultra-deep targeted sequencing analyses of cfDNA with patient-matched white blood cell (WBC)-derived DNA.</p>

                  <title>Experimental Design:</title>
                  <p>In total, 183 cfDNA and 49 WBC samples, along with 28 tissue samples, from 52 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer participating in the prospective phase III CAIRO5 clinical trial were analyzed using an ultra-deep targeted sequencing liquid biopsy assay.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>The combined cfDNA and WBC analysis prevented false-positives due to germline or hematopoietic variants in 40% of patients. Patient-matched tumor tissue sequencing did not provide additional information. Longitudinal analyses of ctDNA were more predictive of overall survival than standard-of-care radiological response evaluation. ctDNA mutations related to primary or acquired resistance to panitumumab were identified in 42% of patients.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Accurate calling of ctDNA mutations for treatment response monitoring is feasible in a tumor tissue–independent manner by combined cfDNA and patient-matched WBC genomic DNA analysis. This tissue biopsy-independent approach simplifies sample logistics and facilitates the application of liquid biopsy ctDNA testing for evaluation of emerging therapy resistance, opening new avenues for early adaptation of treatment regimens.</p>

              <p>Treatment response monitoring of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is currently performed by CT imaging, which assesses tumor volume. Liquid biopsy circulating tumor DNA testing has the potential to replace or complement CT imaging by assessing the presence and abundance of tumor-specific mutations, allowing for personalized treatment and early adaptation of treatment regimens based on the emergence of therapy resistance mutations. We here demonstrate that a combined cell-free DNA and patient-matched white blood cell genomic DNA analysis from a single blood draw is sufficient to eliminate the confounding germline and clonal hematopoiesis–associated alterations and results in the accurate calling of tumor-specific circulating tumor DNA mutations in a tumor tissue–independent manner in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In this way, liquid biopsy circulating tumor DNA testing for treatment response monitoring can be offered to patients with cancer in a widely accessible manner.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Monitoring cancer treatment to identify response or progression provides physicians with the opportunity to adapt a patients' treatment regimen. As one-size-fits-all systemic therapy makes room for more personalized treatment approaches, and ineffective treatment continuation has serious side effects for the patient, there is a clinical need for biomarkers that can guide the treatment course (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Currently, clinical treatment response evaluation is performed by standard CT imaging following RECIST (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), which is focused on tumor burden (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Clinical imaging has limitations for treatment response monitoring because tumor mass does not always correlate with the clinical outcome. For example, clinical imaging does not provide information about the viability of the tumor tissue nor does it constitute the genomic changes of the tumor, that is, the development and outgrowth of subclones following treatment-induced selection (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As a consequence, determining treatment effectiveness by radiological CT imaging soon after the start of therapy is challenging. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) derived from minimally invasive liquid biopsies is a biomarker indicative of the presence of tumor cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>). Liquid biopsies allow for longitudinal follow-up and provide the possibility to track intratumoral heterogeneity caused by different subclones without a repeated tumor biopsy and can therefore be a helpful disease monitoring tool (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref>). However, ctDNA analyses are impeded by germline variants and white blood cell (WBC) variants related to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>), which cloud the detection of tumor-specific mutations (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref>). Therefore, ctDNA analyses are often performed in a tumor tissue–informed manner, for which a tumor biopsy is needed to avoid false-positive calls from germline and hematopoietic variants. This requires additional logistic steps, is more complex to perform in daily clinical practice, and is sometimes not feasible. A liquid biopsy-only approach would therefore be an attractive alternative. Here, we investigated whether liquid biopsy cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analyses filtered by liquid biopsy WBC-derived genomic DNA for germline and hematopoietic variants can improve detection of tumor-derived alterations in cfDNA compared with the tissue-informed approach using patient-matched tumor tissue DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We assessed the applicability of this approach in a cohort of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), with both <italic toggle="yes">RAS/BRAF</italic> wildtype and left-sided primary tumors, who received doublet chemotherapy and were eligible for anti-EGFR mAb therapy (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref>). These patients are suited to evaluate treatment response monitoring as not all patients respond (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), while those who initially respond are prone to develop acquired resistance over time (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>).</p>

                <p>This translational research is a retrospective analysis of liquid biopsies collected from patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer with isolated, previously untreated, initially unresectable liver metastases collected in the prospective multicenter CAIRO5 clinical trial (NCT02162563) of the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The ongoing phase-III CAIRO5 trial investigates the optimal first-line systemic therapy for patients with initially unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases. Patients were eligible for the current study when initially <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, NRAS</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> wildtype and randomized for treatment with panitumumab and doublet chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or irinotecan (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI), and when at least two liquid biopsy samples were collected. A total of 52 patients, enrolled between November 2014 and April 2019, were included in this study. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and a medical ethical committee approved the trial and all patients signed written informed consent for study participation as well as liquid biopsy and tumor tissue collection for translational research. The objective of this research was to identify the best strategy to determine tumor-specific somatic mutations in liquid biopsy ctDNA. Therefore, we analyzed serial ctDNA samples with patient-matched tumor tissue DNA and WBC-derived genomic DNA. As a second endpoint, we assessed the prognostic and predictive clinical power of our genomic profiling approach to evaluate treatment response.</p>

                <title>Patient characteristics</title>
                <p>Of the 52 patients with initially unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases included in this study, 42% were female, 92% had synchronous metastases, and patients had a mean age of 61 years. All patients had an adenocarcinoma, were mismatch repair (MMR) proficient, and had tested negative for <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic> mutations on tumor tissue samples. However, plasma deep sequencing did reveal baseline <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> alterations. Non-hotspot mutations in combination with the used tumor tissue mutation assays, or tumor heterogeneity, might explain these discordant results, as discussed previously (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). From February 2017 onward, sidedness and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> V600 mutation status were included in the selection criteria and subsequently, only patients with a left-sided primary tumor without a <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> mutation were eligible. No significant differences were found in baseline mutant allele frequency (MAF) levels among patients with left- and right-sided primary tumors (independent sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.135), among patients with metachronous or synchronous metastases (independent sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.339), and among males and females (Mann–Whitney test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.155). All patients were treated with a combination of panitumumab and chemotherapy, consisting of FOLFIRI in 4 patients (8%), and FOLFOX in 48 patients (92%). Fourteen patients remained permanently unresectable, whereas complete radical resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases was achieved in 25 patients. Additional radiotherapy was given in follow-up after systemic treatment to metastases of 18 patients, and 3 patients received a radioembolization procedure. Radiological complete response was observed after treatment in 3 patients, partial response was seen in 30 patients, stable disease in 7 patients, and 12 patients had progressive disease. In addition, 3 patients switched to cetuximab, 20 patients received bevacizumab, 5 patients received CAPOX, and 4 patients received capecitabine monotherapy. In addition, 7 patients were treated with trifluridine and tipiracil, and 4 patients with tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil. Extrahepatic disease, mainly in the lung and peritoneum, was observed in 17 patients (33%; Supplementary Table S1).

                <p>Liquid biopsies were collected prior to study treatment and every 3 months during follow-up until progression or end of treatment. In total, 186 liquid biopsies were analyzed before treatment (baseline), during treatment, after treatment, and included the latest timepoint closest to progression when available. Six patients missed a baseline blood withdrawal, and no WBCs were stored for 2 patients, resulting in 45 patients with a sample available for the pretreatment analysis. Blood was collected using 10 mL cell-free DNA BCT tubes (Streck) and shipped to the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Here, plasma and cell pellet were obtained after a two-step centrifugation process (10 minutes at 1,700 × <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> followed by 10 minutes at 20,000 × <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) and stored at −80°C until further processing. Furthermore, patient-matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from surgical resection or biopsies of the primary tumors were available for 30 patients, and DNA was isolated using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen). The available plasma samples, matched blood-derived WBCs, and FFPE tumor tissue DNA from the 52 patients were sent to Personal Genome Diagnostics (PGDx). Five plasma samples were already part of an earlier analysis using a 58-gene panel (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>

                <p>At PGDx, cfDNA was isolated using the Circulating Nucleic Acid Purification QIAamp kit (Qiagen), with an elution volume of 55 μL. Concentrations of cfDNA were assessed using the Qubit dsDNA High-Sensitivity Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For three plasma cfDNA, one WBC genomic DNA, and two tumor tissue DNA samples, the quality of the material was insufficient for library construction and sequencing analysis. Next, library preparation, hybrid capture, and sequencing of the plasma cfDNA, WBC-derived DNA, and FFPE tumor tissue DNA were performed. For the FFPE tumor tissue DNA, genomic libraries were prepared from 100 ng of DNA by shearing, end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation. Afterward, the libraries were PCR amplified. Target enrichment was performed by hybridized DNA library capture using the PGDx elio tissue complete kit (Research Use Only, RUO) covering single-nucleotide variants (SNV), amplifications, translocations, and microsatellite instability (MSI-H) using a panel consisting of 505 genes (Supplementary Table S2). Samples were pooled and sequenced with 150 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NextSeq instrument (Illumina) targeting 2,500× depth across the targeted regions, taking along a verified control and a no template control. Two tissue DNA samples did not pass the quality control process and were excluded (Supplementary Table S3).</p>
                <p>For the contrived cfDNA, plasma cfDNA, and WBC-derived DNA samples, genomic libraries were prepared from 40 ng of DNA, following normalization, end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification. For 17 plasma samples, cfDNA yield was limited and genomic libraries were prepared from DNA input ranging from 25 to 40 ng. Targeted capture was performed by hybridization using the custom PGDx elio plasma resolve kit (RUO, version 4.27) covering SNVs, amplifications, translocations, and MSI-H using a panel consisting of 33 genes (Supplementary Table S4), covering over 237,000 bp. After pooling, the captured libraries were sequenced using a targeted deep-sequencing approach with 150 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NextSeq instrument targeting 25,000× depth across the targeted regions, with an average distinct coverage of 2,900×, taking along a verified control and a no template control.

                <p>Somatic variant identification of tumor tissue DNA, plasma cfDNA, and WBC genomic DNA was performed using machine learning software developed by PGDx, which has shown high accuracy for somatic mutation calling via characterization of germline mutations and sequencing artifacts (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In the case of less than 500 bp distinct coverage in plasma cfDNA, assessment at specific regions of interest for coverage requirement was done manually, using a 100 bp cutoff to pass the positive threshold and a 475 bp cutoff to pass the negative threshold. Results of the plasma cfDNA samples were scanned for mutations found in other samples of the same patients but not recorded by the PGDx pipeline. Alterations were considered germline when present in all plasma cfDNA timepoints with a MAF over 35%, and when not considered a hotspot (&gt;20 cases reported) in the COSMIC database.</p>
                <p>Tumor-specific somatic mutations were identified for all plasma samples by subtracting the identified WBC mutations at baseline from the identified plasma cfDNA mutations, as described previously (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In short, WBC genomic DNA samples were analyzed for mutations found in one of the plasma samples of the same patient. When present in all samples with at least three duplicate reads of the same mutant, the mutation variant was considered as a hematopoietic variant, except when the MAF in the WBC genomic DNA was more than 100× lower than the MAF in plasma cfDNA, which might indicate circulating tumor cells in the WBC genomic DNA instead of a hematopoietic variant. For mutations identified by cfDNA sequencing but not identified by WBC sequencing, we computed the posterior probability that the mutation was tumor derived using the Bayesian model described in Leal and colleagues (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>

                <p>After removing germline and hematopoietic variants, molecular response evaluation using ctDNA was calculated on the basis of the percentage difference of the most abundant alteration after treatment compared with baseline. Patients without a baseline cfDNA sample were excluded. The molecular response was compared with the radiological response evaluated after systemic treatment. A molecular responder was defined as a patient with elimination of more than 98% of ctDNA after treatment compared with the measurement before treatment initiation. On the basis of our previous studies, we used the elimination of 98% of ctDNA as the threshold for molecular response (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For comparison, we also evaluated cut-offs of absolute levels of ctDNA at baseline.</p>
                <p>After treatment completion, clinical follow-up was performed according to the standard of care. In the case of resectable liver metastases, this included a clinical review every 3 months as well as serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CT imaging every 6 months. In the case of unresectable liver metastases, patients continued chemotherapy and were continuously evaluated until disease progression by serum CEA and CT imaging every 2 months. CEA levels were compared between two patient groups, that is, patients with serial CEA levels below 5 ng/mL upon treatment and patients with serial CEA levels above 5 ng/mL. The follow-up was recorded until February 1, 2021. The clinical response evaluation was performed according to standard of care, making use of RECIST version 1.1.</p>

                <title>Design and analytic performance of an ultra-deep targeted sequencing liquid biopsy assay</title>
                <p>To perform noninvasive tumor profiling and assessment of ctDNA alterations for patients with colorectal cancer, we first designed a targeted gene panel containing common driver genes in colorectal cancer and other tumor types. The FDA-recognized OncoKb database (ref. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>; levels 1, 2, and R1) was utilized to ensure that genes relevant for the management of approved therapies in colorectal cancer were included, which identified <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>, and MSI-H. We then expanded this to 33 genes in total to encompass relevant genes and alterations across other common solid tumor types, including non–small cell lung cancer and melanoma. First, we investigated the <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> performance of these gene regions across 353 colorectal cancers previously profiled through The Cancer Genome Atlas project (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and established that 99.2% of tumors harbored at least one somatic mutation covered by the panel, while 76.8% contained three or more covered alterations. To assess the analytic performance of this ultra-deep targeted sequencing liquid biopsy assay, currently known and further referred to as the PGDx elio plasma resolve assay, a comprehensive set of verification and validation studies were conducted to assess the limit of blank (specificity), limit of detection (sensitivity), within-run repeatability, between-operator precision, between-day precision, between-instrument precision, and accuracy (concordance). In summary, across 39 noncancerous donors, 62 patients with cancer (including 29 patients with colorectal cancer across a total of 13 tumor types), and 18 contrived samples, a total of &gt;450 sample replicates were evaluated, which exhibited exceptional performance for detection of SNVs, insertions/deletions, amplifications, translocations, and MSI-H (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). Overall, these data demonstrated &gt;99% specificity, &gt;95% sensitivity for detection of alterations 0.25%–1.0% variant allele fraction, &gt;95% repeatability and precision across different laboratory conditions, as well as &gt;95% PPA and NPA compared with orthogonal methods across the majority of alteration types assessed (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).</p>

                <title>Comparison of patient-matched tumor tissue DNA, plasma cfDNA, and WBC DNA</title>
                <p>To investigate whether variants in cfDNA were tumor specific or instead were germline or hematopoietic in origin, we performed targeted sequencing of patient-matched cfDNA (Supplementary Table S5), WBC-derived genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S6), and tumor tissue DNA material (Supplementary Table S3) obtained from 52 patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) who were included in the arm of the CAIRO5 clinical trial (NCT02162563) receiving treatment with doublet chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) and panitumumab (ref. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Patients were enrolled in this arm of the CAIRO5 study when they had no somatic mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, NRAS</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, based on tumor tissue analysis. For the current study, DNA alterations were analyzed in both cfDNA and patient-matched WBC-derived genomic DNA from liquid biopsies that could be obtained at baseline, that is, before treatment, which was feasible in 45 of the 52 patients (Supplementary Fig. S1). Ultra-deep targeted sequencing analyses were performed using the PGDx elio plasma resolve 33-gene panel at approximately 25,000× coverage (Supplementary Table S4; refs. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28, 32</xref>). A total of 157 alterations were identified in the plasma cfDNA samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). All 45 patients (100%) had at least one detectable plasma cfDNA mutation before treatment initiation. Parallel ultra-deep sequence analyses of the patient-matched WBC genomic DNA revealed 39 alterations in total (Supplementary Table S9), of which 29 alterations were also present in the baseline cfDNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These variants comprised rare changes not excluded on the basis of variant databases, as well as potentially pathogenic germline alterations in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> genes specifically, which were not filtered because of their clinical utility. By filtering cfDNA alterations by the WBC-derived germline and hematopoietic somatic alterations, the plasma ctDNA alterations were obtained (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This combined sequencing analysis of plasma cfDNA together with WBC genomic DNA prevented the calling of false-positive ctDNA mutations in 18 patients (40%). After filtering, 45 patients (100%) had at least one detectable plasma ctDNA mutation before treatment initiation, with an average of three tumor-derived mutations per patient with a median MAF of 23% (Supplementary Fig. S2). There was a strong correlation between MAFs of variants observed in both cfDNA and matched WBC samples (Pearson correlation; <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.85; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Variants with a WBC MAF of approximately 50% and similarly high cfDNA MAFs most likely represent germline variants, whereas the variants with substantially lower WBC MAFs and similarly low cfDNA MAFs are more likely hematopoietic variants. The number of WBC variants was not significantly correlated with age (Pearson correlation; <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.14, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.33; Supplementary Fig. S3). As cfDNA fragments derived from tumor cells are on average slightly smaller than cfDNA fragments derived from WBCs (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we used this cfDNA characteristic to verify whether cfDNA fragments containing germline variants differed in size from those with tumor-specific variants in cfDNA molecules containing <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> alterations. As expected, we observed that fragments carrying tumor-derived mutations were shorter than wildtype, germline, and WBC-derived hematopoietic fragments (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4A).</p>

                <p>Next, we investigated whether the sequencing of patient-matched tumor tissue DNA, which was available for 28 patients (54%; Supplementary Fig. S1), provided additional information to the WBC-informed cfDNA calling. Targeted sequencing analysis was performed using the PGDx elio tissue complete 505-gene panel for detecting alterations in tumor tissue DNA (Supplementary Table S2; ref. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This tumor tissue analysis revealed all but one of the germline variants in the samples analyzed but did not identify the majority of hematopoietic variants as identified by the WBC analyses (Supplementary Fig. S5, Supplementary Tables S10 and S11). Interestingly, 1 patient had a somatic <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> V173G alteration with a tumor tissue MAF of 5% and a plasma cfDNA MAF of 12%, which might be interpreted as a tumor tissue–confirmed plasma ctDNA mutation. However, WBC analyses also reported a MAF of 14%, indicating that this <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> alteration is a hematopoietic variant. This patient also harbored another <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (R248W) variant that was not found in the WBCs but only detected in cfDNA and tumor tissue. Comparing within this patient the tumor-specific <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> R248W to the hematopoietic <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> V173G variant by fragment length distributions revealed that <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> R248W harbored a shorter fragment length than wildtype <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and the hematopoietic <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> V173G, providing additional evidence that the <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> V173G variant is indeed hematopoietic and not tumor derived (Supplementary Fig. S4B). This demonstrates that tumor tissue analyses can result in false-positive calls due to the presence of hematopoietic variants in WBC.</p>

                <title>Treatment response monitoring</title>
                <p>Next, we explored the applicability of serial WBC-filtered cfDNA analyses for treatment response monitoring. A total of 183 longitudinal liquid biopsy cfDNA samples were analyzed from 52 patients with CRLM. All patients had an adenocarcinoma, were MMR proficient, and were treated with a combination of panitumumab and chemotherapy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In these 183 liquid biopsy samples, 474 cfDNA alterations were observed (Supplementary Table S12). Sequencing the patient-matched WBC genomic DNA samples revealed 39 alterations, of which 16 germline and 23 hematopoietic variants, resulting in filtering 106 non–tumor-specific somatic alterations from the plasma cfDNA (Supplementary Fig. S6; Supplementary Table S13).</p>
                <p>The prognostic value of liquid biopsy ctDNA monitoring was assessed by evaluating the overall survival for patients with or without a molecular response to treatment. On the basis of previous analyses (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and additional cut-off evaluations (Supplementary Fig. S7), we defined a molecular response as elimination of more than 98% of ctDNA upon treatment based on the highest MAF. Molecular nonresponse was defined as patients with an increase of ctDNA or elimination of less than 98% of ctDNA upon treatment. Supplementary Figure S8A shows an example of a patient classified as a molecular responder, illustrated by clearance of all ctDNA upon treatment. Supplementary Figure S8B and S8C depicts patients classified as molecular nonresponders, presented by MAF levels that do not drop below 20% at any time (Supplementary Fig. S8B) or emerging <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> ectodomain mutations (Supplementary Fig. S8C). Of the 46 patients whose ctDNA levels could be determined at baseline, 28 (61%) were classified as molecular responders, whereas 18 (39%) patients were classified as molecular nonresponders to treatment. We evaluated the molecular response to treatment using the tissue-informed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and WBC-informed approach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) for all 26 patients with tumor tissue DNA, cfDNA, and WBC genomic DNA analyses. The molecular response to treatment was less prognostic for overall survival when ctDNA was not filtered for germline and hematopoietic variants [not filtered: log-rank <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.195; HR = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.7–7.2 vs. filtered: log-rank <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.029; HR = 3.4; 95% CI = 0.8–15.0], highlighting the importance of the combined cfDNA and WBC analyses over the tissue-informed approach. Next, the WBC-informed molecular response evaluation was compared with the clinical response evaluation for all 46 patients. Using the WBC-informed approach, molecular responders showed a significantly longer overall survival compared with molecular nonresponders (median 59 vs. 27 months; log-rank <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.039; HR = 2.4; 95% CI = 0.9–6.1; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In contrast, the overall survival prediction between patients with and without progressive disease based on RECIST evaluation of CT imaging was less strong, with a median overall survival of 39 months and 52 months, respectively (log-rank <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.197; HR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.6–5.6; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S9). In addition, patients with a radiological complete and partial response had a significant decline in the number of mutations detected in plasma after treatment compared with baseline than patients with progressive disease (Supplementary Fig. S10).</p>

                <p>In addition to evaluating ctDNA dynamics, that is, changes in ctDNA upon treatment, we examined the prognostic value of ctDNA levels at baseline. Absolute levels of ctDNA at baseline were not prognostic for overall survival (Supplementary Fig. S11). Whereas ctDNA was able to make a valid response prediction after treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), potentially allowing for early switching of therapies, serum CEA levels after treatment were not prognostic for overall survival (HR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.3–5.1; log-rank <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.867; Supplementary Fig. S12A). CEA levels could only discriminate clinical response based on overall survival when taking all longitudinal measurements after treatment into account (Supplementary Fig. S12B).</p>

                <p>Systemic treatment with therapeutic mAb directed against EGFR can be offered to patients with mCRC, provided that no mutation in either <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> is present and the location of the primary tumor is left sided (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>), but it has shown to be effective in only a limited percentage (10%–20%) of these patients (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Somatic mutations in other genes like <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR</italic>, as well as amplifications of <italic toggle="yes">EGFR, ERBB2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic>, are known to be involved in the primary and acquired anti-EGFR mAb treatment resistance in patients with mCRC (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22, 36–39</xref>). Because all patients in our study received panitumumab as an anti-EGFR agent, we evaluated the presence of somatic DNA alterations in <italic toggle="yes">KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, PIK3CA, PDGFRA, FGFR</italic>, and amplifications in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR, MET</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> as a mechanism of primary and acquired treatment resistance. In addition to the evaluation of somatic alterations in ctDNA, we assessed amplifications in tumor tissue (Supplementary Table S14) and in plasma ctDNA (Supplementary Table S15). Gene mutations associated with primary resistance, which were detected at baseline before the start of treatment, occurred in 17 patients (33%). Mutations associated with acquired resistance, which were detected after the start of treatment, occurred in 5 patients (10%) who were mutually exclusive from the patients with primary resistance (Supplementary Fig. S15). These data imply there is selection pressure to escape the anti-EGFR mAb treatment, yet only in patients lacking these resistance mechanisms at baseline. In addition, for the patients who show acquired resistance on ctDNA analyses, the resistance mechanisms were not detected in the available tumor tissue, highlighting the potential of ctDNA analyses for the detection of anti-EGFR mAb treatment resistance.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Liquid biopsy testing for ctDNA is a promising new diagnostic entity. We here demonstrate that correcting for germline and WBC variants is both essential and sufficient for identifying tumor-specific mutations in patients with mCRC. Our analyses showed that combined deep sequencing of plasma cfDNA with patient-matched WBC-derived genomic DNA is able to distinguish tumor-specific mutations from germline variants and WBC alterations associated with clonal hematopoiesis.</p>
              <p>The novelty of our approach was the possibility of comparing plasma, WBC-derived genomic DNA, and tumor tissue DNA on an individual patient level and using this information to follow patients during the course of treatment. Other studies investigating patients with mCRC have utilized tissue-informed plasma sequencing without analyses of WBCs (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40–46</xref>), or did not monitor ctDNA longitudinally (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47–49</xref>). WBC-informed serial liquid biopsies have been evaluated in a study with patients with stage III colorectal cancer, but only using a pooled set of healthy controls and did not include matched patient-specific filtering (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In the current study, sequencing matched WBC DNA prevented misclassification of germline and clonal hematopoietic variants in 40% of patients, whereas sequencing of patient-matched tumor tissue DNA for the tissue-informed cfDNA analyses had no additional benefit to the WBC-informed approach. These results indicate that liquid biopsy analyses can be performed for patients with mCRC without the requirement of sequencing tumor tissue. Because of the fact that tumor tissue is often not readily available, liquid biopsy-only testing without the need for patient-matched tissue sequencing has important advantages, including reduced logistical complexity and faster turnaround times, thereby facilitating clinical implementation.</p>
              <p>The clinical relevance of cfDNA sequencing was assessed by applying a genomic profiling approach on serial liquid biopsies to evaluate the molecular response to treatment in patients with CRLM receiving chemotherapy and anti-EGFR mAb treatment in a well-controlled clinical trial setting. Longitudinal liquid biopsy ctDNA measurements yield both quantitative (mutant allele fractions) and qualitative (gene mutation) information, allowing simultaneous tracking of different tumor clones. Detecting resistance mechanisms to anti-EGFR treatment in potentially actionable treatment targets, like <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations or <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> amplifications (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) could provide opportunities for dynamic adaptation of patients’ treatment regimens or enrollment into new clinical trials. Although panitumumab was not given as monotherapy in the current study, we observed primary resistance in 33% and acquired resistance in another 10% of patients, indicating that a substantial proportion of these patients might benefit from such analyses. For example, 1 patient had a pretreatment EGFR S464 L mutation, a known resistance mechanism to anti-EGFR treatment. This patient showed an initial response, which presumably must have been due to chemotherapy rather than anti-EGFR therapy. Furthermore, all 5 patients with acquired resistance showed clinical disease progression at the blood evaluation timepoint or developed disease progression soon afterward.</p>
              <p>The current study also showed that ctDNA dynamics after treatment are informative for patient outcome and can discriminate molecular responders from nonresponders at an early phase of a line of therapy. When investigating all patients with no detectable ctDNA after treatment, who had a complete resection of both the primary tumor and the liver metastases, 11 of 12 patients were still alive at the last moment of follow-up. Molecular response evaluation was more indicative of overall survival than clinical response evaluation (i.e., RECIST) or serum CEA, although it could be useful to evaluate the combination of ctDNA and CEA in the future. As for predicting recurrence of disease after liver resection, despite the limited number of patients analyzed, detection of postoperative ctDNA was indicative of earlier disease recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity and a lead time in favor of ctDNA over CT imaging. These observations suggest that patients with postoperative detectable ctDNA are at high risk for recurrence and might benefit from intensified postoperative disease management.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that this study included patients with colorectal cancer liver–only metastases, which have among the highest levels of ctDNA compared with other colorectal cancer metastatic sites (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and other types of cancer (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The extent to which the results of the current study using patients with CRLM can be transferred to patients with other sites of metastases, other types of cancer, or earlier stages of colorectal cancer will need to be evaluated.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study shows that WBC-informed plasma ctDNA testing provides a minimally invasive approach that allows for tissue-independent longitudinal treatment response monitoring that may facilitate clinical intervention in patients with mCRC.</p>
