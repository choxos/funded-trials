                <p id="Par1">Radiographic imaging is the standard approach for evaluating the disease involvement of lymph nodes in patients with operable NSCLC although the impact of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) on lymph nodes has not yet been characterized. Herein, we present an ad hoc analysis of the NEOSTAR trial (NCT03158129) where we observed a phenomenon we refer to as “nodal immune flare” (NIF) in which patients treated with neoadjuvant ICIs demonstrate radiologically abnormal nodes post-therapy that upon pathological evaluation are devoid of cancer and demonstrate de novo non-caseating granulomas. Abnormal lymph nodes are analyzed by computed tomography and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography to evaluate the size and the maximum standard uptake value post- and pre-therapy in NEOSTAR and an independent neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort. NIF occurs in 16% (7/44) of patients treated with ICIs but in 0% (0/28) of patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. NIF is associated with an inflamed nodal immune microenvironment and with fecal abundance of genera belonging to the family Coriobacteriaceae of phylum Actinobacteria, but not with tumor responses or treatment-related toxicity. Our findings suggest that this apparent radiological cancer progression in lymph nodes may occur due to an inflammatory response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, and such cases should be evaluated by pathological examination to distinguish NIF from true nodal progression and to ensure appropriate clinical treatment planning.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) alone or in combination with chemotherapy have become the standard of care for a subset of patients with unresectable/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These agents are being tested in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable  NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> with the rationale to achieve downstaging or major pathologic response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor in the resected tumor specimens)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> more often than chemotherapy, and potentially induce antitumor immunity. As the use of immunotherapy has become more commonplace, it has become increasingly clear that immune-based treatments may result in unconventional response patterns that are distinct from those produced by traditional cancer therapies. One potential concern with ICIs is tumor pseudo-progression, the appearance of tumor growth without true progressive disease (PD) thought to be due to increased intratumoral immune cell infiltration, which has been reported in patients with NSCLC at a rate ranging between 0.6% and 5.8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the response of mediastinal and other systemic lymph nodes to neoadjuvant ICIs is not well characterized. Distinguishing true disease progression due to the involvement of cancer in lymph nodes from false progression is critical for clinical decision making, because failure to recognize false progression could lead to delays or avoidance of potentially curative surgical resection of the primary tumor. Moreover, misinterpretation of a false positive image could lead to enhanced toxicities resulting from an inappropriately large radiation field.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A distinct phenomenon presented in cases of loco-regionally advanced and metastatic cancers following ICI therapy is the increased <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) uptake by lymph nodes and other organs on imaging that were not involved by cancer at the time of diagnosis and deemed cancer-free upon pathological examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Based on our clinical observation of these occurrences in some patients with operable NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy on the NEOSTAR study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we performed an ad hoc evaluation of the radiological and pathological characteristics of this phenomenon in patients who were treated with neoadjuvant ICIs on the randomized NEOSTAR trial (NCT03158129)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and in a historical cohort of patients treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> followed by surgical resection.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In this work, we report the incidence and features of the “nodal immune flare” (NIF) phenomenon, which is characterized by radiologically abnormal nodes on restaging imaging after neoadjuvant ICIs that are cancer-free and contain de novo non-caseating granulomas upon pathological evaluation. NIF appears to be related to neoadjuvant ICI therapy rather than chemotherapy and is associated with an inflamed nodal microenvironment and unique fecal microbiome genera, but not with pathological or radiological tumor responses or toxicity to immunotherapy. Because distinguishing NIF from true nodal cancer progression cannot be achieved radiologically, we suggest that suspected cases of lymph node cancer progression after neoadjuvant ICI therapy undergo invasive pathological evaluation to avoid erroneous changes in the therapeutic approach based purely on imaging.</p>

                <title>Apparent radiological nodal disease progression after neoadjuvant ICIs in the absence of cancer and with non-caseating granulomas</title>
                <p id="Par6">To determine whether the administration of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is associated with unconventional radiological patterns of nodal involvement, we examined the abnormal nodes on scans in patients after they were treated with neoadjuvant ICI therapy on the randomized NEOSTAR study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We noted that among 44 patients, several patients exhibited abnormal nodes on imaging after treatment that mimicked disease progression but were devoid of cancer upon pathological examination and were instead characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas, as shown Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–f</xref>. We referred to this phenomenon as nodal immune flare (NIF). For comparison, an illustrative case of abnormal nodes on imaging after neoadjuvant ICI therapy that was classified as true nodal disease progression based on the presence of malignant cells upon pathological assessment and the lack of non-caseating granulomas is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g–k</xref>. We then questioned whether this pattern of apparent radiological nodal progression in  the absence of cancer and histological presence of non-caseating granulomas also occurred in patients that were treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, although empirically we have not been alerted to this phenomenon previously. We analyzed abnormal nodes on imaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a subset of patients from the ImmunogenomiC prOfiling in NSCLC (ICON) cohort at our institution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and did not observe instances where abnormal nodes post-therapy were devoid of cancer and contained non-caseating granulomas upon pathological examination. These findings suggest that neoadjuvant ICI therapy, compared with platinum-based chemotherapy, is more likely to be associated with unusual radiological appearances of cancer-free lymph nodes that mimic disease progression with the onset of pathological features of sarcoid-like inflammation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical and histopathological patient characteristics in ICON and NEOSTAR cohorts.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Patient cohorts</th><th>ICON (chemotherapy) (<italic>n</italic> = 28)</th><th>NEOSTAR (ICIs) (<italic>n</italic> = 44)</th></tr><tr><th/><th>Mean (SD)</th><th>Mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (yr)</td><td>64.4 (8.8)</td><td>65.6 (8.3)</td></tr><tr><td/><td><italic>n</italic> (%)</td><td><italic>n</italic> (%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Sex</td></tr><tr><td>   Female</td><td>14 (50)</td><td>16 (36)</td></tr><tr><td>   Male</td><td>14 (50)</td><td>28 (64)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Histology</td></tr><tr><td>   Adenocarcinoma</td><td>19 (68)</td><td>26 (59)</td></tr><tr><td>   Squamous cell</td><td>9 (32)</td><td>17 (39)</td></tr><tr><td>   Adenosquamous</td><td>0</td><td>1 (2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Clinical Stage</td></tr><tr><td>   Stage I</td><td>1 (3)</td><td>23 (52)</td></tr><tr><td>   Stage II</td><td>12 (43)</td><td>12 (27)</td></tr><tr><td>   Stage III</td><td>15 (54)</td><td>9 (20)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Smoking</td></tr><tr><td>   Never</td><td>5 (18)</td><td>8 (18)</td></tr><tr><td>   Former</td><td>23 (82)</td><td>26 (59)</td></tr><tr><td>   Current</td><td>0</td><td>10 (23)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>n</italic>, Number of patients. <italic>ICON</italic> ImmunogenomiC prOfiling in Non-small cell lung cancer, <italic>ICIs</italic> immune checkpoint inhibitors, <italic>SD</italic> standard deviation.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Radiological and histopathological features of abnormal nodes following neoadjuvant ICIs.</title><p><bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold> Axial contrast enhanced CT (<bold>a</bold>), and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT (<bold>b</bold>) images of the mediastinum showing normal nodes prior to neoadjuvant treatment with ICIs on NEOSTAR study in a patient with NSCLC (metastasis to station 7; stations 4 R, 4 L, and 11 L negative after invasive baseline mediastinal staging with EBUS). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the mediastinum is due to esophagitis.

                <title>De novo non-caseating granulomas are a pathological hallmark feature of NIF after neoadjuvant immunotherapies</title>
                <p id="Par7">Next, we further evaluated the cytological/histopathological characteristics of nodes collected following neoadjuvant ICIs in NEOSTAR patients and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ICON patients. We compared the pathological characteristics of these specimens to that of nodal samples collected at baseline invasive mediastinal staging. We noted that seven patients with abnormal nodes after neoadjuvant immunotherapy that were negative for cancer on pathological evaluation post-ICI therapy contained de novo non-caseating granulomas compared to baseline nodal specimens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). In contrast, none of the patients treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated radiologically abnormal nodes post-therapy that were cancer-free with de novo non-caseating granulomas in the final pathological analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). Overall, 16% of patients treated with ICIs on the NEOSTAR study (7/44, 95% CI 7–30%) were noted to have NIF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Thirteen percent (3/23, 95% CI 3–34%) of cases were observed in the nivolumab monotherapy group, and 19% (4/21, 95% CI 5–42%) were seen in those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). No cases of NIF were observed in patients treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in the ICON cohort (0%, 0/28) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>; Source Data file).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Histopathological features of nodal specimens pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy in NEOSTAR and ICON patients.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Illustrative FNA image from preoperative mediastinal staging by EBUS in NEOSTAR NIF patient did not demonstrate granulomatous inflammation within examined nodes (station 4 L pictured; Papanicolaou, x20). <bold>b</bold> Resected nodal specimen in NEOSTAR NIF patient following ICIs demonstrating a diffuse non-caseating granulomatous inflammatory reaction (station 11 R pictured; hematoxylin and eosin, x10). <bold>c</bold> Illustrative FNA image from preoperative mediastinal staging by EBUS in ICON No-NIF patient did not demonstrate granulomatous inflammation within examined nodes (station 7 pictured; Papanicolaou, x20). <bold>d</bold> Resected nodal specimen following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a patient with No-NIF from ICON cohort with the absence of diffuse non-caseating granulomatous inflammatory reaction (station 7 pictured; hematoxylin and eosin, x4). <bold>e</bold> Proportions of patients with NIF, characterized by abnormal nodes on imaging that are devoid of cancer and contain de novo non-caseating granulomas in NEOSTAR (<italic>n</italic> = 44) and ICON (<italic>n</italic> = 28) patient cohorts.

                <p id="Par8">To evaluate the likelihood, by chance, of identifying no cases of NIF in chemotherapy-treated ICON patients, we calculated the probabilities of observing no NIF cases assuming several true incidence rates. The probabilities of observing 0 incidence of NIF in the 28 ICON patients were 23.8%, 5.2%, and only 0.8% if the true NIF rates were 5%, 10%, and 16%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Source Data file). We further calculated the posterior probability that the NIF rate in the ICON cohort (<italic>p</italic>) was equal to or greater than the observed NIF rate in the NEOSTAR cohort (16%) and a prior p beta (0.16, 0.84), indicating a prior belief that the NIF rate in the ICON cohort was the same as the one in the NEOSTAR cohort. This probability was only 0.04%.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Interestingly, we also noted that an additional 7% (3/44) of patients who were treated with ICIs on trial had nodes with de novo non-caseating granulomas on pathological analysis after treatment but these nodes were not radiologically abnormal post-therapy. The observation of de novo non-caseating granulomas related to all examined lymph nodes, albeit in the absence of nodes suspicious for cancer on imaging post-therapy in some cases, argues for a systemic effect of ICIs on lymph nodes. These findings suggest that the incidence of de novo non-caseating granulomatous nodal inflammation could be as high as 23% (10/44) following at least one cycle and up to three cycles of neoadjuvant ICIs; however, not all cases were associated with false positive radiological evidence of nodal disease progression. Considering these observations, we suggest pathological analysis of any lymph nodes deemed suspicious for disease by standard radiological criteria due to the possibility of false positive findings on restaging imaging.</p>

                <title>Changes in radiological tumor and nodal parameters after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ICIs</title>
                <p id="Par10">To determine the changes in the radiologic features of tumor and lymph nodes induced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ICIs, we measured the tumor volume and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>), and the nodal size and SUV<sub>max</sub> in both ICON and NEOSTAR patients with abnormal nodes post-therapy and compared these values to their baseline measurements. In ICON patients, the median tumor volume decreased from 68.2 to 20.6 mL (<italic>P</italic> = 0.016) and the median tumor SUV<sub>max</sub> decreased from 9.30 to 8.90 after chemotherapy, although this did not reach statistical significance (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Source Data file). In the same cohort, the mean nodal size decreased from 1.54 cm at baseline (pre-therapy) to 1.25 cm after chemotherapy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.058) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>; Source Data file), whereas the mean nodal SUV<sub>max</sub> remained unchanged (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Source Data file). In NEOSTAR patients with NIF, the mean tumor volume and SUV<sub>max</sub> did not significantly change after ICIs (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Source Data file). However, the mean size and SUV<sub>max</sub> of abnormal nodes increased from 0.91 cm to 1.20 cm (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>; Source Data file) and from 2.82 to 6.33 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>; Source Data file), respectively. In NEOSTAR patients in the No-NIF group, the mean tumor volume and SUV<sub>max</sub> did not significantly change after ICI therapy (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Source Data file), whereas both the mean size (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>; Source Data file) and SUV<sub>max</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>; Source Data file) of abnormal nodes increased after ICI therapy. While nodal size and SUV<sub>max</sub> increased in both NIF and No-NIF groups in the NEOSTAR cohort, the magnitude of change of both parameters was greater in patients with NIF as compared to that of patients with No-NIF (mean nodal size difference, <italic>P</italic> = 0.139, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>; Source Data file; mean nodal SUV<sub>max</sub> difference, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>; Source Data file). Taken together, these results suggest that nodal size and SUV<sub>max</sub> can increase after neoadjuvant immunotherapy in both NIF and No-NIF patients, with a greater increase in nodal SUV<sub>max</sub> in NIF patients, without significant changes in tumor volume and tumor SUV<sub>max</sub> and illustrate the importance of pathological examination of abnormal nodes on imaging after ICIs.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Changes in tumor volume and SUV<sub>max</sub> in ICON patients with abnormal nodes post-therapy.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>ICON cohort</th><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td/><td>Pre-chemotherapy</td><td>Post-chemotherapy</td><td>Change (Post–Pre)</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td><italic>n</italic></td><td>Median (min, max)</td><td>Median (min, max)</td><td>Median (min, max)</td><td><italic>P</italic> value</td></tr><tr><td>Tumor volume (mL)</td><td>8<sup>*</sup></td><td>68.2 (2.50, 207)</td><td>20.6 (2.60, 94.0)</td><td>−35.9 (−113, 0.10)</td><td>0.016</td></tr><tr><td>Tumor SUV<sub>max</sub></td><td>3<sup>**</sup></td><td>9.30 (7.10, 19.0)</td><td>8.90 (6.50, 9.60)</td><td>0.30 (−14.4, 1.80)</td><td>1.00</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>ICON</italic> ImmunogenomiC prOfiling in Non-small cell lung cancer. <sup>*</sup>Post-chemotherapy tumor volume was not measurable (atelectasis) in one patient. <sup>**</sup>Six patients did not have paired tumor SUV<sub>max</sub> values.

                <title>Increased immune cell infiltration in nodes of patients with non-caseating granulomas after neoadjuvant immunotherapy</title>
                <p id="Par11">Next, we questioned whether the composition of the tumor immune infiltrate was associated with the occurrence of NIF after neoadjuvant ICIs. Given the modest number of patients with NIF who also had tissues available for these correlative studies, we included in the NIF group the available samples from all patients with pathological evidence of de novo non-caseating granulomas. First, we analyzed the percentages of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining in available tumor samples resected after ICI therapy from NIF and No-NIF patients. We found no association between NIF and percentages of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 post-therapy by either IHC or mIF staining (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>; Source Data file). We then analyzed the immune cell subpopulations in resected tumors from NEOSTAR patients with mIF and found no association between the densities and frequencies of immune subpopulations in the resected tumors and NIF (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c–k</xref>; Source Data file).</p>
                <p id="Par12">To better understand the immune composition of nodes in patients with non-caseating granulomas, we performed gene expression analysis by NanoString of resected nodes from patients with NIF and No-NIF after ICIs (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We found that the immune cell infiltration was significantly greater in the NIF nodes. The cell type scores for immune cells (CD45 or PTPRC<sup>+</sup>), macrophages, dendritic cells, cytotoxic cells, Th1 cells and exhausted CD8 T cells were greater in nodes from patients with NIF than in nodes from patients with No-NIF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–f</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Source Data file). Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed an enrichment of immune-related genes in nodes from patients with NIF as compared to nodes of patients with No-NIF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>; Source Data file). To determine whether the differentially expressed immune genes in nodes of patients with NIF were associated with specific biological processes or molecular functions that may provide insight into the mechanisms governing NIF, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the resected nodes. We noted that genes usually associated with favorable responses to ICIs, such as the antigen processing and presentation and the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) signaling and response pathways, were significantly upregulated (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in nodes from patients with NIF. In contrast, genes involved in immunosuppressive pathways, including the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and the SMAD2/3 nuclear signaling pathways were downregulated (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005) in nodes from NIF patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>; Source Data file). Together, these results suggest that the microenvironment of nodes of patients with NIF/non-caseating granulomas is inflamed and enriched in macrophages, dendritic and Th1 cells that may be involved in functional pathways of immune response and reduced immune suppression.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Composition of nodal immune infiltrates of NIF/non-caseating granulomas and No-NIF NEOSTAR patients.</title><p>NanoString gene expression analysis was performed in tumor-free nodes from patients with NIF (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and No-NIF (<italic>n</italic> = 29).

                <p id="Par13">Since the primary endpoint of NEOSTAR trial was the rate of MPR in resected tumors in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, we next questioned whether NIF was associated with MPR and/or with the percentage of viable tumor at surgery following neoadjuvant ICIs.

                <title>Fecal microbiome in patients with NIF and No-NIF</title>
                <p id="Par14">The fecal microbiome has emerged as an important component influencing cancer responses to ICIs in patients with solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We analyzed the composition of fecal microbiome between patients with NIF and No-NIF in the NEOSTAR study. Although we did not detect a difference in alpha diversity, which describes the richness of a community, between the groups (Inverse Simpson Index (ISI), <italic>P</italic> = 0.53, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>; Source Data file), we did observe a trend in compositional differences between NIF and No-NIF groups as demonstrated by non-overlapping centroids in beta diversity analysis (weighted UniFrac, <italic>r</italic> = 0.20, <italic>P</italic> = 0.06) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>; Source Data file). To avoid inaccurate identification of bacterial taxa at the species level based on the variability within V4 region, which accounts for only about 250 bp of the 1500 bp long 16 S rRNA gene, we restricted the taxonomic classification of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to higher taxonomic levels in our analysis stopping at the genus-level classification. In patients with NIF, LDA Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis demonstrated a strong association with genera mostly belonging to the family Coriobacteriaceae of gram-positive phylum Actinobacteria including <italic>Collinsella</italic>, an unclassified genus of Coriobacteriaceae and <italic>Adlercreutzia</italic> (cutoff linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score = 2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>; Source Data file).

In contrast, no taxa were estimated to be differentially abundant in No-NIF patients. These exploratory results suggest that the relative abundance of unique fecal microbiome taxa is associated with NIF, a sarcoid-like inflammatory reaction characterized by de novo non-caseating granuloma formation after neoadjuvant ICI treatment. Subsequent studies will be needed to validate these associations in larger and annotated NIF clinical cohorts.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Analysis of gut microbiome diversity and composition conducted by sequencing V4 region of 16 S rRNA gene in NIF and No-NIF NEOSTAR patients.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Inverse Simpson measuring alpha diversity of fecal microbiome in NIF (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and No-NIF (<italic>n</italic> = 29) patients.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par15">Herein, we describe a comprehensive report of NIF, a phenomenon that is characterized by abnormal lymph nodes following immune checkpoint therapy in patients with operable NSCLC, mimicking disease progression, only to be classified as cancer-free de novo non-caseating granulomas upon invasive pathological examination. Although sporadic cases of sarcoid-like reaction have been previously reported following chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, our findings indicate that NIF appears to be particularly common following ICI therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The incidence of NIF on restaging scans following neoadjuvant ICIs in our study was 16% (7/44). However, we noted that the presence of pathologic de novo nodal non-caseating granulomatous inflammation occurred in up to 23% of patients in our cohort (10/44). This rather high observed rate of this phenomenon calls for an extra vigilance on restaging of patients undergoing ICI therapy. Each of the seven NIF patients with radiological suspicion of nodal progression underwent careful multidisciplinary deliberation about the next course of the treatment. Three patients underwent additional extensive mediastinal nodal sampling and restaging prior to definitive lung cancer resection. Two of these procedures were done under separate anesthesia. One patient underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a newly abnormal left submandibular node post-therapy, which revealed the absence of cancer and evidence of non-caseating granuloma. After this additional invasive process, the patient eventually declined definitive surgical resection. Three patients underwent definitive planned resection despite the possibility of nodal disease progression on imaging. In all three cases, preoperative surgical planning and judgement estimated that complete tumor and nodal resection was possible. The fact that these patients were enrolled on a clinical trial also contributed to the surgical decision making process as long as local and regional control could be achieved. These results illustrate how the suspicion of disease progression within the lymph nodes on imaging after immunotherapy suggest the need for an additional invasive pathological restaging evaluation and careful surgical judgment about complete resectability in order to avoid erroneous changes in the planned treatment in otherwise operable NSCLC patients.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The mechanisms of action of ICIs have prompted reconsideration of the patterns of radiological responses to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The NIF phenomenon reported here is distinct from tumor pseudo-progression in which a tumor initially progresses and later responds to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here, the lymph nodes alone appeared to progress radiographically, yet the tumor remained stable or became smaller. The nodal enlargement and increased metabolic activity characterizing apparent cancer progression are due to nodal inflammation and pathological features of non-caseating granulomas. As with tumor pseudo-progression, recognizing NIF is critical from a clinical perspective because any misinterpretation of restaging findings as treatment failure may lead clinicians to make inappropriate decisions and avoid potentially curative treatments. The biological mechanisms underlying NIF are unclear and it remains to be determined whether NIF correlates with enhanced antitumor immunity. In previous reports, the pathological assessment of enlarged and avid nodes revealed sarcoid-like changes and elevated expression of PD-L1 on peripheral immune cells upon discontinuation of ICI therapy in NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The investigators found that an elevated expression of PD-L1 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was associated with nodal and skin sarcoid-like reaction after nivolumab was discontinued in a case of unresectable NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The authors speculated that the increase in peripheral PD-L1 may result from cytokines produced by activated immune cells present in sarcoid lesions and/or in the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In the current study, we did not observe greater frequencies of PD-L1 + tumor cells or macrophages within resected tumors of patients with nodal non-caseating granulomas after neoadjuvant ICIs. However, these results may have been influenced by the modest number of samples available for the analysis and should be validated in larger studies. Other studies have shown an association between ICI therapy and the onset of sarcoid-like reactions in patients with advanced stage melanomas, lung adenocarcinomas, and other cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Non-caseating granulomas are comprised of several cellular types, including macrophages, epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells in a core that is circumscribed by Th cells, and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Complement, Th cells, and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-17 as well as IFN-γ have been known to recruit macrophages to sites of granulomatous inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Some evidence also suggests that CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1-like cells may contribute to the formation of granulomas, and anti-CTLA-4 therapy has been shown to increase the amounts of peripheral Th17 CD4<sup>+</sup> cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The results of our transcriptomic studies in nodes with non-caseating granulomas after neoadjuvant ICIs revealed greater expression of immune genes and immune cells compared to No-NIF nodes, suggesting a nodal inflammatory reaction that is associated with cellular types involved in pathways of immune activation and reduced immune suppression.</p>
              <p id="Par18">It is noteworthy that we did not detect a significant association between NIF and radiographic and pathological tumor responses, suggesting that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of systemic immunity driving NIF and the antitumor immune responses may be distinct from one another. This hypothesis is further supported by the results of our exploratory analysis of the fecal microbiome. Accumulating evidence suggests that the composition of bacteria residing in the gut may play a key role in determining the efficacy of anticancer therapies, including ICIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Recently, we demonstrated that an increased relative abundance of gut <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> was associated with MPR in a cohort of patients with operable NSCLC receiving neoadjuvant ICIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Here, we found that NIF was associated mainly with bacterial taxa that belong to Actinobacteria including <italic>Collinsella</italic>. <italic>Collinsella</italic> is a known butyrate producer that provides energy to the intestinal epithelium and modulates immune function to ensure host health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. More recently, a member of <italic>Collinsella</italic> was shown to be more abundant in metastatic melanoma patients who responded to anti-PD-1 therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and in patients with low-fiber intake and rheumatoid arthritis—perhaps by influencing the production of inflammatory molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The initial associations of relative abundance of unique intestinal microbiota with the NIF phenomenon revealed by our exploratory analyses should serve as a foundation to build upon for subsequent validation in larger clinical NIF datasets and for mechanistic studies aimed to determine the potential functional role of gut microbiota in the formation and composition of nodal non-caseating granulomas in patients developing NIF after neoadjuvant ICIs.</p>
              <p id="Par19">While our study sheds light on the NIF phenomenon and its relationship to neoadjuvant ICIs in NSCLC, it does have limitations. The overall sample size is relatively small and with a modest power to detect significant differences in some cases. The small sample size also prohibited more robust mechanistic studies of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in clinical characteristics between the neoadjuvant chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-treated patient cohorts, e.g., differences in histology, nodal involvement and overall stage distribution, may have influenced the results in these cohorts. Our results will require validation in larger cohorts of patients treated with neoadjuvant ICI-based therapies and it remains to be seen whether the number of cycles and the time from last dose of therapy to restaging imaging may contribute to differences in the systemic immunological response that is manifested as NIF.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In conclusion, surgeons and oncologists administering ICIs as neoadjuvant strategy in NSCLC and nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists reporting their imaging studies need to be attentive to apparent radiological nodal disease progression following neoadjuvant ICIs. Our findings suggest that diligent diagnostic workup, including invasive pathological evaluation where appropriate, of lymph nodes that are deemed suspicious for disease progression by radiological criteria is warranted following neoadjuvant immunotherapy prior to proceeding with final treatment decisions. This report is particularly relevant when considering numerous ongoing neoadjuvant ICI trials and merits further investigation and search for additional tests and biomarkers that may eventually prove helpful in distinguishing NIF from true disease progression without invasive restaging.</p>

                <title>Radiological assessment</title>
                <p id="Par23">CT scans were acquired in a multidetector scanner following IV contrast administration unless contraindicated. Multiplanar CT image series were reconstructed with 2.5 mm slice thickness using standard and high spatial reconstruction algorithms. FDG-PET/CT imaging was performed using Discovery STE PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). All patients fasted for 6 h before the FDG injection and had confirmed normal fasting blood glucose level of less than 200 mg/dL. PET was performed in three-dimensional mode at 3–5 min per bed station depending on patient BMI. An intravenous injection of 9–11 mCi of FDG was administered in the arm or central venous catheter on the side opposite to the cancer, and emission scans were acquired at 70 ± 10 min after the FDG injection. The acquired PET data were corrected for scatter coincidences, random coincidences, deadtime, and attenuation and reconstructed using OSEM on standard vendor-provided workstations. Non-contrast-enhanced CT images from the base of the skull to the mid-thigh were acquired in helical mode (speed, 13.5 mm per rotation) during shallow breathing at a 3.75 mm slice thickness, a tube voltage of 120 kVp, and 0.5 s rotation with tube current modulation. Daily quality control procedures were performed on all PET scanners to ensure cross-calibration between systems and normalize differences in system performance. In a small number of patients, CT or PET/CT scans were performed at an outside institution with comparable technique. All available CT and PET/CT images were reviewed in all patients in both cohorts by a board-certified thoracic radiologist. Measurements of short-axis diameter on CT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) were recorded for all abnormal mediastinal or hilar nodes, which were defined as nodal short-axis diameter &gt; 1.0 cm (&gt;1.2 cm in the subcarinal region)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> on CT images and/or SUV<sub>max</sub> ≥ 4.5 on PET/CT images post-therapy and compared to their corresponding pre-therapy measurements. Measurements were also obtained in any abnormal extra-thoracic node if it met CT and <sup>18</sup>FDG uptake inclusion criteria described above. Tumor volume measurement was performed using a commercially available semi-automatic software MIM v.6.6.6 (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). Characterization of nodal size on CT was performed by measuring short-axis diameter using mediastinal window setting (level 50 HU; width 350 HU). Characterization of tumor and mediastinal lymph node <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake was performed using semiquantitative analysis of the SUV<sub>max</sub> (MIM v.6.6.6; MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). In a few cases, inclusion of outside PET/CT scans or the lack of available images precluded SUV<sub>max</sub> measurements. As described above, on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT a SUV<sub>max</sub> cutoff value of ≥4.5 was used to characterize abnormal nodes suspicious for malignancy. Although the traditional SUV<sub>max</sub> cutoff of 2.5 is associated with a lower false negative rate, which is important to avoid missing nodal metastasis, higher SUV<sub>max</sub> cutoffs have been shown to improve PET/CT diagnostic performance in NSCLC nodal staging by decreasing the false positive rate and may be helpful in distinguishing malignant from inflammatory nodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Positive findings were compared with the post-therapy cytopathologic/histopathological specimen findings and pathological staging for all patients.</p>
                <p id="Par24">For the radiological analysis of the NEOSTAR cohort, all available images in 44 patients, including the patient who underwent restaging imaging off trial after one dose of ICIs followed by administration of platinum doublet chemotherapy off study, were analyzed. The post-therapy size and SUV<sub>max</sub> measurements of abnormal nodes were recorded and compared to the corresponding pre-therapy nodal size and metabolic activity measurements in 24 and 22 patients, respectively. For the radiological analysis of the ICON cohort, all available images in 28 patients were analyzed. The post-therapy nodal size and SUV<sub>max</sub> measurements of abnormal nodes were recorded and compared to the corresponding pre-therapy nodal size and metabolic activity measurements in nine and three patients post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively.</p>

In each patient, multiple lymph nodes were analyzed to estimate changes in nodal size and nodal SUV<sub>max</sub> following neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to pre-chemotherapy at baseline in ICON patients and after neoadjuvant ICIs compared to pre-ICIs at baseline in NEOSTAR patients. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for paired comparisons in tumor volume and tumor SUV<sub>max</sub> in ICON cohort. We utilized the linear mixed-effects model to consider the intra-individual correlation of multiple lymph nodes for the nodal size and nodal SUV<sub>max</sub> analyses in ICON and NEOSTAR cohorts and for the tumor volume and tumor SUV<sub>max</sub> analyses in the NEOSTAR cohort. Unconditional exact test available in the R package “Exact” was used to compare the categorical distributions between patient populations. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the distributions of continuous variables and immune markers between patient populations. Two-sided <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed in R 3.6.3 and UNIVARIATE, NPAR1WAY, and MIXED procedures in SAS 9.4. For the differential gene expression analysis, <italic>P</italic> values for volcano plot were obtained using Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test and determined by nSolver advanced analysis 2.0 software. For the pathway analysis, <italic>P</italic> values (FDR-adjusted &lt; 0.2) were derived from GSEA algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. For the fecal microbiome analysis in patients with NIF and No-NIF, LDA score of 2 and two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 were used as cutoff. Two-sided <italic>P</italic> values were from Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test.</p>
