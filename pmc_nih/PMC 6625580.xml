                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Herpes zoster and its related complications are associated with significant medical burden, which negatively affects quality of life and daily functioning of the patients. The recently licensed recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) offers high efficacy but is associated with local and systemic reactions. This study assessed the impact of RZV on the quality of life and daily functioning of participants and implications for caregivers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Four hundred and one adults aged 50 years or older received single RZV doses at 0 and 2 months in this open-label, single-arm, multicenter study (NCT02979639). Change in mean SF-36 Physical Functioning score following first-dose administration, quality of life, reactogenicity, safety, productivity loss, and health care resource utilization was assessed. The current analysis was performed post-vaccine dose-1; safety follow-up will continue until 1 year post-dose-2.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The most common solicited local symptoms were injection-site pain (77.5%), redness (23.0%), and swelling (13.3%); the most frequent solicited systemic reactions were fatigue (33.5%), headache (28.3%), and myalgia (26.8%). Grade 3 reactogenicity occurred in 9.5% of participants and was associated with a transient clinically important decrease in SF-36 Physical Functioning score (affecting activities such as walking, carrying groceries, climbing stairs) on Days 1 and 2 post-first vaccination. No clinically meaningful reductions in mean SF-36 Physical Functioning scale scores from pre- to post-RZV dose-1 were observed (mean +1.9 points, primary end point), and no overall quality-adjusted-life-year loss was recorded post-dose-1. Five participants reported lost workdays; caregiver workload was not increased.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Overall, the physical functioning and quality of life of older adults were not affected by a first RZV dose. The observed reactogenicity was consistent with previous studies.</p>

            <p>Herpes zoster (HZ), resulting from the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), presents as a vesicular dermatomal rash usually accompanied by pain (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The majority of patients suffering from HZ are aged more than 50 years, reflecting an age-related decline in VZV-specific T-cell immunity; incidence rates rise from 3â5 per 1,000 person-years at 50 years, to 6â8 and 8â12 per 1,000 person-years at 60 and 80 years, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
            <p>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), the most common complication of HZ, may persist for months or years after infection (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). HZ and its complications cause a significant medical, social, and economic burden and have a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) and the ability of patients to perform activities of daily living (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4â7</xref>). HZ can also affect the lives of caregivers and partners (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Inevitably, as the population ages, age-related diseases, such as HZ, will become more burdensome to society (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
            <p>The incidence of HZ in older adults, and its associated complications, can be reduced through vaccination. A live-attenuated vaccine has been available since 2006 (Zostavax, a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp) and an adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, a registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA) was approved in the United States and Canada late in 2017 (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref>). RZV is at least 90% effective in preventing HZ in adults aged 50 years or older (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and is cost-effective from both a payer and societal perspective (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
            <p>All vaccines may produce short-lived local and systemic reactions that have the potential to affect normal activities of daily living and reduce quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) benefits of vaccination. RZV contains the AS01<sub>B</sub> adjuvant system, and although in early trials the observed reactogenicity appeared higher than had been reported in the studies with the live vaccine, development of RZV including this dose of the adjuvant continued as greater vaccine efficacy was anticipated. In two pivotal phase III RZV efficacy trials in adults aged 50 or older (ZOE-50) and 70 years or older (ZOE-70), solicited reports of local and systemic reactions within 7 days of vaccination were 84.4% and 79.0%, with 17.0% and 11.9%, respectively, being classified as Grade 3 (redness/fever &gt; 100 mm diameter; fever &gt; 39.0Â°C; preventing normal activity) (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The most frequent solicited local adverse events (AEs) recorded after RZV vaccination were injection-site pain (in up to 79.1% participants), followed by redness and swelling (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These symptoms were usually of mild-to-moderate intensity and resolved within approximately 3 days or less. Grade 3 injection-site pain, defined as significant pain at rest preventing normal everyday activities, occurred in approximately 4% participants and generally lasted for less than 2 days. Solicited systemic AE, which were recorded in more than 10% participants, included myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Myalgia and fatigue, which occurred in up to 45.9% and 46.3% participants, respectively, lasted an average of 2.5 days (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Grade 3 solicited systemic symptoms occurred in 6.0%â11.4% participants, with an average duration less than 2 days (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
            <p>It is important for vaccinators to discuss the impact of vaccination with recipients and caregivers, in terms of potential reactogenicity and QoL. In particular, having a good understanding of what to expect will inform vaccine recipients about reactogenicity and may influence the decision about returning for the second vaccine dose. As the aforementioned ZOE studies did not evaluate the impact of vaccine reactogenicity on QoL immediately after vaccination, this study was undertaken to primarily assess the effect of vaccination on the QoL of vaccine recipients, by measuring the change in SF-36 Physical Functioning (PF) scale score from pre- to post-first vaccination. Secondary objectives included changes in SF-36 PF single item scores, SF-36 role physical scores, changes in QALY, health care utilization, work loss by participants and caregivers, and the occurrence, intensity, causality, and duration of AEs.</p>

                <p>Systemic symptoms (fatigue, fever, GI symptoms, headache, myalgia, and shivering) were recorded before vaccination on Days â7 and 0. For 7 days post-first vaccination (Days 0â6), participants recorded solicited local (injection-site pain, redness, and swelling) and systemic symptoms (as mentioned earlier) in diary cards. Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 30 days (Days 0â29) post-first vaccination. The intensity of all AEs was graded from 1 to 3, where Grade 3 (severe) symptoms were defined as redness or swelling greater than 100 mm diameter for injection-site events; temperature greater than 39.0Â°C; and âpreventing normal activityâ for all other symptoms. The causality of all AEs was assessed by the investigator, except for solicited local symptoms, which were all considered as causally related to vaccination.</p>
                <p>Serious AEs and potential immune-mediated diseases were recorded over the entire study period.</p>

                <title>Quality-of-Life Assessments</title>
                <p>Two health surveys (SF-36 (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and EQ-5D (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)) were carried out during this trial. SF-36 is a multipurpose health survey comprising 36 questions, including scales for PF (Questions 3aâ3j), Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role Emotional, and Mental Health (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Higher scores represent greater functioning/QoL, and a change from pre-vaccination of 3.3 in PF score was considered to be clinically relevant based on the threshold of minimal clinical importance defined by Angst and colleagues (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). EQ-5D is a generic measure of health status that defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. These five items are combined to generate health profiles, which are converted to provide a single index utility score, where a higher score represents a better QoL (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These questionnaires have been used previously to measure the impact of HZ and PHN on QoL (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
                <p>Participants were trained at each visit on how to complete the forms. Both questionnaires were completed at the study center during Visit 1 (7 days pre-vaccination), Visit 2 (immediately before vaccination), and Visit 3 (7 days post-first vaccination). All participants completed the PF component (Questions 3aâ3j) of the SF-36 and the entire EQ-5D questionnaire at home on a daily basis for 6 days post-first vaccination.</p>
                <p>Prevaccination values for individual participants were calculated as the mean of the Day â7 and Day 0 assessment scores. The mean post-first vaccination scores were defined as the mean of the seven assessment scores recorded from Days 1 to 7. The changes from pre-vaccination were calculated on an individual basis, as the difference between the mean prevaccination score and the mean post-first-vaccination score. The participants thereby served as their own control (ie, by using each participantsâ own prevaccination value).</p>

The results of the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires were reported stratified by age (50â59, 60â69, and â¥70 years) and overall. The SF-36 PF scores were also analyzed by gender, symptom type, and maximum reactogenicity grade. The EQ-5D results (Utility scores and QALY loss) were assessed overall and in post hoc analyses by maximum reactogenicity grade. The QALY loss was estimated using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method, where AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The primary analysis for safety was based on the total vaccinated cohort. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.2.</p>

Overall, there was no decrease in the AUC of the EQ-5D utility scores post-first vaccination (+0.183) and thus no QALY loss. In the 38 participants with Grade 3 reactogenicity (9.5%), a relatively large decrease in mean EQ-5D utility score was observed on Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), but these had returned to prevaccination values by Day 3. Nevertheless, the decrease on Days 1 and 2 affected the AUC score over Days 0â7, and a mean post-first-vaccination reduction of â0.247 was observed (ie, QALY loss in Grade 3 participants: [0.247]/365 = 0.000677, overall QALY loss per dose per participant: 0.000064 [ie, 0.000677 Ã 0.095]; <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this analysis after the first vaccine dose, the pattern of solicited AEs was consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref>). In the two ZOE-50/70 phase III trials in older adults, the overall frequencies of solicited AEs were similar after the first and second doses of RZV, although the frequencies of Grade 3 solicited systemic events were higher post-dose 2 in adults 70 years or older (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this study, notably, several of the solicited systemic AEs were already reported before vaccination (myalgia [18.2%], fatigue [14.7%], headache [6.5%], and GI symptoms [5.5%]), which can be explained by the age of the study population and the nonstringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, allowing recruitment of an overall older adult population, including people with certain comorbidities. There were no serious AEs or potential immune-mediated diseases reported during this 7-day follow-up.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this study was to estimate the change in the SF-36 PF scale score from pre- to post-first vaccination in relation to observed reactogenicity. Overall, there were no reductions above 3.3 (the threshold of minimal clinical importance (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)) in the mean SF-36 PF post-first vaccination. The only factor associated with a transient reduction in SF-36 PF score above this threshold was Grade 3 reactogenicity. In the 38 participants with Grade 3 reactogenicity (9.5%), the PF score decreased by approximately 10 points from Day 0 (75.8) to Day 1 (65.2), but had returned to prevaccination levels by Day 3. This reflects the transient pattern of post-first-vaccination reactogenicity, which has been previously observed to last between 1 and 3 days after RZV administration (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Changes in other SF-36 scales from pre- to post-first vaccination were small (from â0.9 to +1.9), indicating that vaccination with RZV was not associated with a negative impact on these QoL parameters. It was noteworthy that for participants with Grade 1 or 2 reactogenicity, the mean PF score remained relatively stable during Days 0, 1, and 2 (ie, 84.3, 84.1, and 85.5), suggesting that PF scores were affected only in participants with Grade 3 reactogenicity. This would indicate that the classification of individuals into Grade 3 was accurate (ie, defined as preventing normal activity) and therefore provides a validation of the grading system.</p>
              <p>Although QALY loss due to reactogenicity has been infrequently studied in cost-effectiveness models (mainly for sensitivity analysis), the overall QALY loss per vaccine dose per participant estimated here is consistent with values that can be calculated from previously presented data. For example, Ultsch and colleagues (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) assumed that all participants would have a utility loss of 0.01 lasting for 2 days (ie, QALY loss per participant: 0.00005). Van Hoek and colleagues (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) assumed 30% participants would have a utility loss of 0.05 for two days (ie, QALY loss per participant: 0.00008), and Hornberger and Robertus assumed that 0.317 participants would have a utility loss of 0.10 for 2 days (ie, QALY loss per participant: 0.00017) (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, Le and Rothberg (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) assumed that 64% participants would experience a local reaction with a QALY loss of 0.0001 and 0.1% would have a serious reaction (ie, requiring hospitalization) with a QALY loss of 0.0082 (ie, QALY loss per participant: 0.00007). Overall QALY losses due to HZ including PHN ranged from 0.021, 0.049, and 0.058 for participants aged 60â69, 70â79, and greater than or equal to 80 years, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to 0.10 and 0.22 for those less than 70 and greater than or equal to 70 years, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). As such, the QALY loss associated with an episode of HZ (including PHN) ranges from 300 to 3,000 times higher than the potential QALY losses associated with reactogenicity, suggesting the benefits of vaccination in preventing disease clearly outweigh any potential impact of reactogenicity (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
              <p>With respect to indirect costs associated with post-first-vaccination reactogenicity, only three participants sought medical attention, and in no case was this due to Grade 3 reactogenicity. In addition, five participants reported work loss, although only two of those experienced Grade 3 symptoms, and no extra work for caregivers was recorded. Considering that previous studies have shown that up to 64% of employed patients missed work due to HZ and PHN, or up to 76% were less effective while at work (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), any work losses as a result of vaccine reactogenicity are clearly outweighed by the benefits of vaccination.</p>
              <p>We observed excellent compliance in participants returning their questionnaires, which is a strength of the study.</p>
              <p>The study was limited by its open nature and lack of a control group. However, this limitation was mitigated in part by collecting prevaccination data and subsequently using the participants as their own control group, that is, analyzing changes from baseline. Increases in mean QoL scores were observed from Day â7 to Day 0 overall and from Day 0 to Day 7 predominantly in participants with Grade 0 reactogenicity. If a control group had been included in the study design, it may have been possible to adjust for this phenomenon, which is commonly referred to as a response shift (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As participants knew that the study was being undertaken to assess the impact of reactogenicity on QoL, this might have encouraged them to report more symptoms. However, the incidence of symptoms observed in this study was comparable with previous reports. The lack of a control group may be further seen as a limitation in particular when analyzing resource use data; for example, it is not possible to determine whether all work days lost were solely due to solicited reactogenicity.</p>
              <p>Here, we present results after one dose of RZV.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>It is important for vaccinators to inform vaccinees about expected reactogenicity and any anticipated clinically significant impact on their QoL, both to decrease concerns about potential reactogenicity and ensure better second vaccine dose compliance. The reactogenicity observed after the first dose of RZV was comparable with results from previous studies, and the PF and QoL of individuals aged 50 years or older post-first RZV dose was not considered to be clinically affected. Grade 3 reactogenicity was, however, associated with a transient clinically important decrease in SF-36 PF score on Days 1 and 2 post-first vaccination. The work loss and resource utilization associated with reactogenicity are considered to be greatly outweighed by those avoided by preventing HZ episodes through vaccination.</p>
