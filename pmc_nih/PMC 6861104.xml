                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among adults with diabetes. However, little is known about the impact of OSA treatment on DNA methylation levels. The purpose of this study is to explore changes in DNA methylation levels among adults with these conditions enrolled in a randomized controlled trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Research design and methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomized to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment or sham-CPAP placebo for 12 weeks. All participants received diabetes education and counseling. At baseline and 12 weeks, white blood cell DNA methylation levels for five candidate genes (<italic>ANGPTL4</italic>, <italic>DAPK3</italic>, <italic>KAT5</italic>, <italic>PER1</italic>, and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>) and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) levels were obtained from blood. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assessed sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, respectively. T-tests examined within-subject changes from baseline to 12 weeks. Regression analyses explored associations between DNA methylation changes and baseline variables, minutes of therapeutic CPAP use, and changes in A1C levels, PSQI scores, and ESS scores.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Participants (n=10) were 70% female, 80% white, and 61.7±7.9 years old. Among all participants from baseline and 12 weeks, <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and <italic>PER1</italic> DNA methylation levels decreased. At baseline, <italic>PER1</italic> methylation levels were significantly higher in males and sex-based difference in methylation level changes was observed from baseline to 12 weeks. Changes in DNA methylation levels were not associated with minutes of therapeutic CPAP use or changes in A1C, PSQI scores, and ESS scores.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>While DNA methylation level changes were observed in the study, the causal mechanism is unclear and additional work is needed. Although the methylation changes were small, the long-term effects are unknown.</p>

              <p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder characterized by upper airway obstruction while sleeping, resulting in intermittent apneas and hypopneas.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Manifestations of OSA include recurrent hypoxia, decreased intrathoracic pressure, and sleep fragmentation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> OSA is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia leading to oxygen saturation as low as 50%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Airway obstruction leads to hypercapnia and chemogenic activation of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in sleep fragmentation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> In addition, OSA leads to (1) increased oxidative stress and the presence of reactive oxygen species, (2) inflammation due to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and (3) sympathetic nervous system stimulation through changes in neurotransmitter levels.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For adults aged 30–70, 13% of males and 6% of females have moderate to severe OSA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a treatment for OSA that decreases the frequencies of apnea and hypopnea while sleeping. Positive airway pressure is used to keep the airway open, decreasing the severity of the signs and symptoms of OSA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> This leads to lower levels of NF-kB, TNF-α, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and sympathetic activation, and has been shown to have positive effects on glucose metabolism.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 4</xref></p>
              <p>OSA is closely associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and markers of metabolic syndrome including hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and obesity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5</xref> There is a significant relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and OSA, as OSA is three to six times as prevalent in those with T2DM.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> However, the particular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unknown.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Obesity is a comorbidity for both conditions, although not the only link.

              <p>Given the complex nature of OSA, T2DM, and the genetic mechanisms involved in these conditions, the purpose of this pilot study was to explore the effects of CPAP and diabetes education on gene methylation and other measures related to these disorders. The primary aim of the study was to explore changes in white blood cell DNA methylation levels between baseline and 12 weeks in selected candidate genes and to calculate effect sizes for future studies. Secondary aims included exploring associations between methylation changes and (1) baseline variables (ie, sex, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), body mass index (BMI)), (2) dose of therapeutic CPAP, (3) changes in glycemic control (A1C levels), (4) changes in sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores), and (5) changes in daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS).</p>

                <p>Participants enrolled in the DSTT were explained the purpose of this ancillary study by a member of the DSTT research team. If interested, he or she provided his or her contact information with permission to be contacted by the PI of this ancillary study. Several days prior to the scheduled history and physical portion of the DSTT, the PI called the potential participant and explained the purpose of the study. If the potential participant was interested, the PI met the individual at the pre-CPAP/sham-CPAP titration history and physical evaluation. Written informed consent was obtained to use the data obtained from the parent study and blood samples were drawn. Approximately 12 weeks later at a follow-up assessment for the DSTT, additional blood samples were obtained. At both intervals, samples were drawn between the late morning and early afternoon, with collection times ranging from approximately 09:30 to 14:15. At follow-up, each participant’s blood sample was collected within approximately 1 hour of his or her baseline collection time. For example, a baseline blood sample was obtained at 11:45 and 12 weeks later the follow-up sample was obtained at 11:00. All samples were stored in a −80° freezer until processing.</p>

Regression analyses were used to explore associations between methylation changes and (1) baseline variables (sex, AHI, BMI), (2) mean minutes of therapeutic CPAP per night, (3) glycemic control (change in A1C levels), (4) changes in sleep quality (PSQI scores), and (5) daytime sleepiness (change in ESS). Baseline AHI, BMI, mean minutes of therapeutic CPAP, and A1C levels were treated as continuous variables. Effect sizes were used to show differences from baseline to postintervention and were calculated by subtracting the mean baseline scores from the mean scores at 12 weeks, and then dividing the difference by the pooled SD.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The relative magnitude of change was based on Cohen’s definitions of a small (0.2), moderate (0.5), and large (&gt;0.8) effect size.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>

              <p>In this pilot study, both the intervention and control groups received diabetes education. Although the sample size was small, participants experienced decreased <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and <italic>PER1</italic> CpG island 105731 methylation as well as lower PSQI scores at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Therefore, the provided diabetes education and subsequent behavioral changes may have altered participants’ behaviors and thus influenced methylation levels. However, more research is needed with larger samples to explore this line of reasoning.</p>
              <p><italic>TNFAIP3</italic> plays a vital role in reducing inflammation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It is expressed in response to TNF-α, and results in decreased TNF-α-induced apoptosis as well as decreased NF-kB activation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> TNF-α and NF-kB are both proinflammatory.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 24 25</xref> The NF-kB pathway leads to increased activity of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> TNF-α is a cytokine released by adipose tissue that leads to activation of neutrophils and the NF-kB pathway as well, producing an even greater increase in inflammation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 24 25</xref> TNF-α has been connected to obesity and insulin resistance.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 24</xref> Inflammation is another abnormality associated with metabolic syndrome.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 24</xref> Sleep fragmentation caused by OSA leads to sleep deprivation, which has been shown to increase inflammation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p><italic>PER1</italic> is critical to circadian rhythm generation and the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and sleep.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 26</xref> However, circadian rhythm dysfunction leads to sleep disorders and markers of metabolic syndrome, including hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and obesity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 27</xref> These abnormalities are associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Sleep disorders, including OSA, also negatively impact metabolism and circadian rhythms, decreasing the metabolism of glucose and lipids and increasing feelings of hunger.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 27</xref> This has been shown in studies demonstrating the relationships between poor sleep and T2DM and obesity, as well as studies in night shift workers.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 27</xref> OSA treatment has demonstrated secondary benefits in improving glucose metabolism.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>In this pilot study, males had increased white blood cell methylation of <italic>PER1</italic> CpG island 105730 from baseline to 12 weeks, indicating a possible reduction in this gene’s activity. Conversely, females experienced decreased methylation of this gene. Sex differences have been reported in DNA methylation related to metabolic functioning and diabetes. In males, hypermethylation of <italic>PER1</italic> in adipose tissue occurred after acute sleep deprivation.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Also, in pancreatic islet cells, males have higher methylation of CpG sites on the X chromosome.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> One suggested explanation for this phenomenon is higher female methylation of genes that activate NF-kB, and as a result TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In males, statistically significant changes in <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> methylation were evident between acute sleep deprivation and normal sleep periods.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Additional research may further explore methylation differences between male and female participants.</p>
              <p>A mean decrease in PSQI scores was observed among all participants from baseline to 12 weeks. While this does suggest improved sleep quality, participant scores at 12 weeks remained greater than 5, indicating overall poor sleep quality. Additional studies have demonstrated decreases in PSQI subscales in patients with T2DM after non-pharmacological interventions like cognitive therapy, sleep hygiene education, behavioral therapy and stress management.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The diabetes education provided in this study may have contributed to improved sleep quality or less diabetes-related distress. Data from previous studies found higher PSQI scores were associated with control problems with diet and emotional eating, lower self-care and diet adherence, lower diabetes quality of life, and greater numbers of comorbidities and complications.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref></p>
              <p>Although there were no statistically significant changes in white blood cell DNA methylation of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic>, <italic>KAT5</italic>, and <italic>DAPK3</italic>, there were also no statistically significant changes in A1C. Candidate genes were selected based on their relevance to T2DM and OSA. Therefore, the lack of change in glycemic control could have influenced the lack of DNA methylation change in the other candidate genes. Research has shown increased DNA methylation of <italic>DAPK3</italic> in human skeletal muscle after exposure to insulin, as well as decreased DNA methylation of this gene after exposure to glucose.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this case, it is reasonable that no change in glycemic control was accompanied by no change in candidate gene DNA methylation.</p>
              <p>The lack of changes in DNA methylation of candidate genes might have impacted the lack of change in T2DM glycemic control as well. In other words, the inverse relationship than that above may clarify the lack of statistical significance in DNA methylation changes. For example, inactivation of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> is associated with improved glucose regulation and lower risk of T2DM.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Therefore, it is understandable that no change in candidate gene DNA methylation was accompanied by no change in A1C. These inter-related conditions may be points of interest for future research.</p>
              <p>This study had several limitations. First, there was a small, fairly homogenous sample composed of mostly females. Second, no sample size calculation was done and therefore a type 2 error is possible. As a result, it may not be possible to rule out changes in the other candidate genes examined. Third, sleep quality was analyzed using a validated but subjective tool. Fourth, the study did not include any objective measurements of inflammation. Lastly, because the DNA was extracted from white blood cells, methylation changes represented only biomarkers, not well-described mechanisms. As a result of these limitations, the results of this study should be interpreted cautiously. Further analyses with larger sample sizes are needed to support its findings.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, <italic>PER1</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> are involved in the pathway of disease for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. As a result, they are potential targets for future interventions. It is estimated that 25%–40% of people between the ages of 25 and 64 have metabolic syndrome, demonstrating the scope of these findings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, most comparison studies have focused on young, healthy, adult males.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 29</xref> Participants in this study represent a new population of middle-aged adults with multiple comorbidities, which may affect epigenetic changes concerning sleep disorders and metabolic conditions.</p>
              <p>Moreover, genetics and precision medicine are growing fields in the prevention, detection, and treatment of diseases including diabetes and metabolic conditions. Pharmacological and lifestyle interventions should consider an individual’s biomarkers in order to optimize care.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This is the first study to explore the impact of CPAP treatment and diabetes education on white blood cell methylation level. Our work has generated effect sizes on the impact of such treatment which may contribute to the development of future studies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, while white blood cell methylation changes were observed in this preliminary study, the causal mechanism remains unclear. The diabetes education provided to all participants may have contributed to the hypomethylation of <italic>PER1</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> and improved PSQI scores that occurred during this intervention. These results indicate potential improvements in metabolic and inflammatory regulation, as well as better sleep quality. However, changes in <italic>PER1</italic> methylation differed among males and females. Larger studies should be conducted to identify the causal mechanisms for the methylation changes, to examine if baseline methylation levels can be used to predict outcomes, and explore the long-term stability and effects of methylation changes.</p>
