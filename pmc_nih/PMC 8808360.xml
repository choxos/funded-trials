              <abstract>
                <p>Regional variations exist in the epidemiology of peripheral artery disease (PAD),
in comorbidities, use of secondary prevention, and outcomes. Large studies of
these variations in worldwide populations are rare. The EUCLID (Examining Use of
tiCagreLor In peripheral artery Disease) trial included 13,885 patients with PAD
from four geographical regions (Central/South America, Europe, Asia, North
America) and compared monotherapy with ticagrelor and clopidogrel. Inclusion
criteria were either an ankle–brachial index &lt; 0.80 or a prior
revascularization. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to first occurrence of
any event in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or
ischemic stroke and did not differ between the study arms. This post hoc
analysis of EUCLID confirmed that regional differences occurred in the inclusion
criteria with more prior revascularization in North America (73.9%) and Asia
(72.5%) compared with Central/South America (34.0%) and Europe (51.6%). The
characteristics of patients also differed. Prior amputation at baseline was most
frequent in Central/South America (6.3%) compared with other regions (1.6–2.8%).
A history of stroke was most common in Asia, coronary heart disease in North
America, and diabetes in Central/South America compared with other regions. The
incidence of outcomes in patients with PAD varied by region. North America had
the highest rate of the primary combined endpoint (5.97 events/100
patient-years). Corresponding rates were 4.80, 3.95, and 3.87 for Asia, Europe,
and Central/South America, respectively. Hospitalization for acute limb ischemia
(events/100 patient-years) was most frequent in Europe (0.75) and North America
(0.74) compared with Asia (0.60) and Central/South America (0.33). Adjustment
for inclusion criteria and relevant PAD characteristics did not have a major
impact on these regional differences. Further adjustment for concomitant
disease, risk factors, and preventive medication modified the regional
differences only marginally. In conclusion, substantial regional differences
were found in cardiovascular and limb outcomes in patients with PAD and were not
explained by variation in the category of included patients, concomitant
disease, risk factors, and prevention. Such differences, which may be due to
variation in other factors such as background population rates or clinical care,
need to be considered when designing and interpreting large international
studies (<bold>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01732822</bold>).</p>

              <p>The incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is increasing worldwide, not least
in low- and middle-income countries,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> with the greatest number of patients with PAD in the Southeast Asia and

frequency of PAD, risk factors, and treatment. For example, in rural areas of the
United States, amputation for PAD and concomitant diabetes mellitus have increased,
specifically in African Americans and Native Americans.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The REACH (REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) international
registry, following patients with symptomatic PAD, showed at 4 years’ follow-up that
the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was 17.6%,
but with significantly lower rates in Japan compared with North America.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, Eastern Europe had a higher rate and Western Europe a lower rate
of the composite endpoint compared with North America.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In a review of ethnic differences,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> atherosclerotic PAD was found to be less prevalent in patients from Southeast
Asia and those of African descent compared with white patients, despite a higher
prevalence of diabetes mellitus in those from Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Guidelines recommend prevention of cardiovascular disease as part of the treatment of
patients with PAD.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
An international consensus panel performed a systematic review and concluded such
prevention should be a high priority in the management of patients with PAD,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Despite such recommendations, it is evident that antithrombotic treatment has
been far from optimal, even following revascularization.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The role of aspirin as the most frequently used drug has been questioned, and
the slightly more effective drug, clopidogrel,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> has been used to varying extent. Importantly, in cardiovascular prevention
studies, the PAD population has often been included only as a subgroup. The first
large international study to include solely a PAD population was the EUCLID
trial.</p>
              <p>The EUCLID trial (Examining Use of tiCagreLor In peripheral artery Disease) was a
prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, event-driven study in 13,885
patients with symptomatic PAD from four regions (Central/South America, Europe,
Asia, and North America) comparing monotherapy with ticagrelor and clopidogrel
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01732822).<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Patients were included with either an ankle–brachial index (ABI) &lt; 0.80 or
having had a prior revascularization. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to
first occurrence of any event in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial
infarction (MI), or ischemic stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Regional differences in the EUCLID population were recorded at baseline, including
the proportion of patients recruited according to the two indications. Post hoc
analyses of regional differences in the EUCLID trial have shown that hypertension
was more common in White or Black/African American patients than in Asian or
American Indian patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> It was also found that a prior MI recorded at baseline was more common in
North America compared with the other regions.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Regarding outcome, proportionally fewer patients from Central/South America
compared with the other geographical regions suffered later acute limb ischemia.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Major bleeding in the entire study cohort, as well as in cases following
revascularization or amputation, was more frequent in North American participants
compared with those in other regions.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given these differences, a further post hoc investigation of geographical variations
was conducted. The aims of this analysis were to describe demographic differences in
patients with PAD between the regions, and to determine if geographical region was
associated with risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or limb outcomes, namely
acute limb ischemia (ALI) requiring hospitalization or lower extremity
revascularization (LER). In addition, factors that might be associated with these
regional differences in outcomes, specifically concomitant cardiovascular disease,
risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and preventive medication, were
evaluated.</p>

                <p>Baseline characteristics were stratified by region. Continuous variables are
reported as medians with the 25th and 75th percentiles or means with SDs and
were assessed with Kruskal–Wallis tests. Categorical variables are reported as
counts and percentages and were assessed with chi-squared tests. Clinical
outcomes were assessed by region: Central/South America, Asia, North America,
and Europe (reference region). Incidence rates and number of events are reported
for each outcome, and Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine the
association between region and outcomes. For all models, hazard ratios (HR), 95%
CI, and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values are reported. Both unadjusted and adjusted
models were fit. Outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, inclusion criteria, and
severity of disease, where severity of disease is defined as asymptomatic, all
intermittent claudication, or all critical limb ischemia (CLI). The proportional
hazards assumption – which assumes hazards only differ by a multiplicative
constant for all individuals across regions – was assessed for region using
Schoenfeld residuals. Owing to a violation of the proportional hazards
assumption for the outcome of MI and region of Asia, MI events in Asia were
partitioned into those that occurred in the first year or those that occurred
after the first year and modeled separately for each time interval. Kaplan–Meier
curves stratified by region are also presented. A sensitivity analysis was
conducted in which the European region was split into Eastern and Western
Europe, and North America was the reference region.</p>
                <p>Additional Cox models were fit for the primary composite outcome, for all-cause
death, and for LER to investigate the relationships between outcomes and three
groups of factors: concomitant cardiovascular disease, risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, and preventive medications. Concomitant cardiovascular
disease includes prior occurrence of stroke, carotid stenosis or carotid
revascularization, MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary
artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Risk factors for cardiovascular disease
include diabetes, current smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Preventive
medications include baseline use of statins, angiotensin receptor blockers, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Initially, a base model was fit
that adjusted for age, sex, inclusion criteria, and severity of disease. Each
group of factors was sequentially added to the base model, and the corresponding
HRs, 95% CIs, and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values are reported. The base model with
concomitant cardiovascular disease was denoted as Model 1, Model 1 plus risk
factors for cardiovascular disease as Model 2, and Model 2 plus preventive
medication as Model 3. As a sensitivity analysis, forward stepwise regression
models that included all three groups of factors were also fit, forcing the base
model factors into the model. The selected factors, HRs, 95% CIs, and
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values are reported for each outcome. All analyses were
conducted with SAS software, Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,
USA).</p>

in Asia (20.6%) and Europe (24.4%) compared with North America (35.0%) and
Central/South America (38.2%). The median weight of participants was lowest in
Asia (62 kg). Relatively more participants were included in the trial on the
grounds of prior revascularization in North America (73.9%) and Asia (72.5%)
than in Europe (51.6%) and Central/South America (34.0%). The distribution of
presenting limb symptoms was comparable between the regions, except that the
proportion who were asymptomatic was particularly high in Asia (34.5%) and low
in Central/South America (7.4%). Of the asymptomatic patients, 95% had a prior
revascularization (data not shown). CLI, defined as rest pain and/or minor or
major tissue loss, was present in a low proportion of patients (4.6%),
especially in Europe and North America compared with Asia and Central/South
America. Although major amputation at baseline was rare, a higher proportion was
recorded for Central/South America (6.3%) compared with the other regions
(1.6–2.8%).</p>

that histories of concomitant medical conditions varied between the regions. A
history of stroke occurred more commonly in Asia (16.1%) whereas coronary heart
disease and MI were most common in North America (47.2% and 25.0%,
respectively). Diabetes mellitus was particularly common in Central/South
America (56.8%). Hypertension was frequent in all regions, affecting over 70% of
participants. Hyperlipidemia was extremely common in North America, affecting
92.4% of participants. Tobacco use was high in all regions, with at least
two-thirds of participants having a history of current or former smoking. Prior
to entry into the trial, secondary preventive medications were taken frequently.
These included statins (slightly more so in North America and Europe), ACE
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE inhibitors less frequently in
Asia), and antiplatelet medication. Cilostazol was most frequently used in Asia
(47.4%), but very rarely in Europe (3.4%).</p>

lower than the unadjusted HRs, with the exception of LER in Central/South

                <p>These findings were further analyzed by sequential adjustment of the HRs for
regional differences by concomitant cardiovascular disease, risk factors, and
preventive medications (<xref rid="table3-1358863X211038620" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The main effects of adjusting for concomitant
cardiovascular disease (Model 1 compared with the base model) were found in
North America, where the HRs were reduced but with considerable overlap of 95%
CIs for the combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke
(HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.24–1.59 to 1.24; 95% CI 1.09–1.42), for all-cause death (HR
1.00; 95% CI 0.86–1.15 to 0.96; 95% CI 0.83–1.12), and for LER (HR 1.60; 95% CI
1.44–1.78 to 1.55; 95% CI 1.39–1.73). Further adjustment for risk factors
(diabetes, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) led to reductions (Model 2
compared with Model 1) in HRs with overlapping 95% CIs in Central/South America
and in Asia for both the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or
stroke, and for all-cause death. On the other hand, in North America, the HR for
all-cause death increased slightly (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83–1.12 to 1.01; 95% CI
0.86–1.18). The final further adjustment for preventive medications (Model 3
compared with Model 2) had minimal impact on the HRs. Overall, the HRs for Model
3 compared with the base model across the regions indicate that the adjustments
for concomitant cardiovascular disease, risk factors, and preventive medications
had only a slight impact on the magnitude of the HRs. This was further
demonstrated in the stepwise adjusted associations (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1358863X211038620" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link>) in which the final adjusted HRs were very similar to
those in Model 3 for the sequentially adjusted associations (<xref rid="table3-1358863X211038620" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>In the sensitivity analysis in which Europe was divided into Western and Eastern
regions, the main difference in baseline characteristics between the two regions
was that previous revascularization was a more common inclusion criterion in
Western than Eastern Europe (63.8% vs 46.0% of trial participants, respectively)

                <title>EUCLID trial</title>
                <p>EUCLID, the largest trial conducted in patients with PAD to date, included
participants from 28 countries in four regions. The indications for inclusion
were wide, ranging from mild or moderate claudication to CLI. Mild or moderate
claudication dominated, and the patients with CLI had a relatively mild form of
this serious stage of PAD.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Thus, unsurprisingly, the 1-year mortality for patients with CLI was
comparatively low (8.9%). Patients with a prior revascularization were also
included, even if asymptomatic. The primary efficacy endpoint of the composite
of cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemic stroke was reached by a relatively
small proportion of patients (10.7%), with no difference between the ticagrelor
and clopidogrel groups. This homogeneity meant that the two groups could be
combined to study the whole PAD population. Given very limited previous
information on global differences between regions on outcomes of PAD, and
despite the relatively low outcome rates, further investigation was of interest,
particularly given the very large number of patients with PAD in the EUCLID
trial.</p>

                <title>Factors influencing outcomes</title>
                <p>It is important to note that patients were selected by the investigators based on
standard inclusion criteria. Whether differences between regions in the patients
with PAD reflect primarily epidemiological variation or differences in selection
remains difficult to conclude, even though adjustment was made in the analysis
for age, sex, inclusion criteria, and severity of PAD. Selection may have been
influenced by other factors such as availability of resources and the
investigators’ interest and competence. It is also reasonable to assume that
interventionists and vascular surgeons may have included more patients based on
a prior revascularization whereas noninterventionists may have included more
patients based on the ABI criteria. Furthermore, the type and quality of care
provided by different investigators may have influenced outcomes.</p>
                <p>In Central/South America, one-third of the patients were included after a prior
revascularization, whereas in both Asia and North America more than two-thirds
were included based on that indication. This difference may explain the lower
rate of asymptomatic patients in Central/South America. This region also had the
largest proportion of patients with diabetes. It may be hypothesized that the
higher rate of major amputation in this region was caused by more diabetes and
fewer revascularizations. On the other hand, in regions where prior
revascularization was the dominant inclusion criterion, lower limb outcomes
(revascularization, ALI, and hospitalization) might be expected to be more
common, as recorded for North America and to some extent Europe.</p>
                <p>Antiplatelet medication as part of secondary prevention, mainly aspirin, was used
by a majority of patients in all regions. In those with a high usage of both
aspirin and clopidogrel (specifically North America), dual therapy may have been
used more frequently compared with other regions. One reason might be a greater
proportion of endovascular procedures in which dual antiplatelet treatment is
regularly considered. The variation of cilostazol use was extremely wide: only
3.4% in Europe but 47.4% in Asia. A likely explanation is that the European
Medical Association recommended restricted use of cilostazol in 2013<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and a meta-analysis concluded cilostazol was ineffective in preventing
major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with PAD.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1358863X211038620" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Regional differences in outcomes</title>
                <p>The association between region and clinical outcomes showed that the highest
probability of the combined endpoint, cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke, for
the 36 months of follow-up, occurred in North America. The highest probability
of MI was also recorded for this region, whereas cardiovascular death was most
common in Central/South America and lowest in North America. In Asia, the
greatest risk for stroke was found. Central/South America also had the highest
probability for all-cause death. LER and hospitalization for ALI were most
common in Europe and North America.</p>
                <p>Adjustment for the fundamental characteristics of patients with PAD (age, sex,
inclusion criteria, and severity of disease) did not modify the regional
differences in outcomes to any great extent. Adding sequential adjustment for
concomitant cardiovascular disease, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and
preventive medication modified the risk of MI in North America and the risk of
cardiovascular death in Central/South America only slightly.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>The lack of explanation for these regional differences in outcomes could be due
to some limitations in the scope of the analysis. The concomitant diseases, risk
factors, and preventive medications may not have been sufficiently comprehensive
to identify those contributing in a major way to the regional differences. Also,
other possible major influences were not studied, such as the types of
specialists involved in managing patients, the quality and scope of clinical
care, and the genetics and ethnicity of the included patients. Furthermore, the
EUCLID population included relatively mild stages of PAD and whether more
pronounced regional variations might have been revealed in more severely
diseased patients could not be verified. Importantly, the overall background
event rates in the population as a whole may have had a dominant effect on the
event rate in the trial population rather than the specific disease under study
or the treatments administered.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, in the EUCLID trial, differences in cardiovascular and lower limb
outcomes were found between patients with PAD in different world regions. These
differences were not fully explained by different categories of patients with PAD
recruited into the trial nor by differences in concomitant diseases, cardiovascular
risk factors, or preventive medications. These regional differences in outcomes can
influence the overall results in large international trials and, if feasible, should
be understood and assessed when designing such studies. Factors other than the trial
treatment which might influence regional differences in outcome should also be
considered. Furthermore, a particularly high rate of a specific outcome in one
region, especially when combined with a high proportion of trial participants
recruited from that region, might affect the overall results of the trial that are
typically based on the total population and a composite outcome.</p>
