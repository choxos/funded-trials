                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We investigated the effects of an enhanced partner notification (PN) counselling intervention with the offer of provider-assisted referral among people diagnosed with STI in a Cape Town public clinic.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were adults diagnosed with STI at a community clinic. After the standard STI consultation, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to (1) ‘HE’: 20 min health education; (2) ‘RR’: 45 min risk reduction skills counselling; or (3) ‘ePN’: 45 min enhanced partner notification communication skills counselling and the offer of provider-assisted referral. The primary outcome was the incidence of repeat STI diagnoses during the 12 months after recruitment, and the secondary outcome was participants’ reports 2 weeks after diagnosis of notifying recent partners. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare the incidence rates between arms using a Poisson regression model.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The sample included 1050 participants, 350 per group, diagnosed with STI between June 2014 and August 2017. We reviewed 1048 (99%) participant records, and identified 136 repeat STI diagnoses in the ePN arm, 138 in the RR arm and 141 in the HE arm. There was no difference in the annual incidence of STI diagnosis between the ePN and HE arms (IRR: 1.0; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.3), or between the RR and HE arms (IRR: 0.9; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). There was a greater chance of a partner being notified in the ePN condition compared with the HE condition, 64.3% compared with 53.8%, but no difference between the RR and HE arms.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>PN counselling and education with provider-assisted services has the potential to change the behaviour of people diagnosed with STIs, increasing the number of partners they notify by more than 10%. However, these changes in behaviour did not lead to a reduction of repeat STI diagnoses.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Partner notification (PN) is a process by which a person with STI informs sexual partners of their possible exposure and the need to be tested or to obtain treatment. STI PN and treatment can interrupt STI transmission and prevent reinfection of index patients, thus decreasing the pool of infectious people. STI PN and treatment are important in the context of the HIV epidemic because people with non-HIV STIs are more susceptible to HIV acquisition or transmission,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> especially in the context of low coverage of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or antiretroviral therapy (ART). Current methods of PN only reach a small proportion of partners.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Public sector clinics in South Africa offer STI partner services based on patient referral, where the clinician encourages the patient to refer partners for treatment without provider assistance. When index patients bear the sole responsibility for PN, the potential barriers include inadequate knowledge about or motivation for PN, stigma, and fear of blame, abandonment or violence from partners.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> There is evidence people are less likely to notify casual partners (compared with main partners).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>We investigated the effects of enhancing patient referral with counselling, education and the offer of provider-assisted referral among people diagnosed with STI in a Cape Town public clinic. The outcomes included the annual incidence of STI diagnoses in index patients (primary) and index patients’ reports of PN (secondary).

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>Based in a public clinic in a poor Cape Town community, we conducted a three-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT). Eligible participants were 18 years of age and older diagnosed with an STI using a syndromic approach (the standard in South Africa). They were recruited on the day of their diagnosis and participated that day, or the next, except for 45 participants who were enrolled in the study more than 1 day later (up to 3 days).</p>
              <p>After the standard clinic STI consultation, the clinician referred potentially eligible patients to our study. Those who were eligible and consented completed a baseline questionnaire, after which we randomly allocated them in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three interventions using a block randomisation schedule generated by computer and sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes to conceal allocation. We also invited participants to complete 2-week and 3-month, 6-month and 9-month follow-up surveys, but we only report on the 2-week survey. Participants were reimbursed approximately US$10 for each assessment.</p>

                <title>Measures</title>
                <p>At baseline, we asked participants their age, sex, education, STI symptoms, HIV status, and alcohol and drug use. Participants were classified as potentially hazardous alcohol users if, for men, they had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)-C score of greater than 3, and for women they had an AUDIT-C score of greater than 2.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> If they used any of the following drugs in the 3 prior months, they were classified as drug users: marijuana, Mandrax, cocaine, methamphetamine or any drug injected with a needle.</p>
                <p>At baseline participants reported up to five sexual partners in the past 3 months, and classified each as ‘main’, ‘casual’ (‘someone you have sex with on a regular basis who is not a main partner’) or ‘one-night stand’ (‘someone who you may have only had sex with once or twice, not someone you have sex with on a regular basis’). Partners’ first or nick names were entered into the questionnaire system, and questions about sex partners included the partner name. Participants self-completed the baseline in English or isiXhosa as an audio-assisted survey (first 330 participants) or an interviewer-administered, paper survey (remaining participants). An armed robbery necessitated the change in the assessment method.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome was the 12-month incidence of STI diagnosis in participants, measured using City of Cape Town electronic records. The secondary outcome was participants’ reports at the 2-week survey of whether each partner was notified by any method (in person, by phone or text message, or with a third party’s help) or whether the participant had referred the partner for STI testing or treatment. In the 2-week assessment, we also measured the partner’s reaction to the notification (appreciative, angry, violent, abandoned the index patient or no reaction) and whether the participant had had condomless sex with the partner during the 2 weeks after diagnosis. We asked four items to measure knowledge of STIs (that they can be asymptomatic, that transmission can occur when they are asymptomatic, that treatment should not be stopped when symptoms disappear and that PN can interrupt the spread of STIs), and we composed a knowledge score with a point for each correct answer (score range 0–4). We asked six questions to measure PN self-efficacy (eg, how confident are you that you can tell your main partner that you have an STI; how confident are you that you can ask your casual partner to go to the clinic to get tested for an STI) and two questions to measure condom use self-efficacy (eg, how confident are you that you can talk to your main partner about the need to use condoms). For the self-efficacy items, participants used a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 reflected no confidence at all and 10 reflected the highest level of confidence. The 2-week assessments were administered by an assessor blinded to trial condition.</p>

Second, we performed an analysis at the named partner level using a binomial regression model to model the probability of a partner being notified.

At the partner level, to measure STI transmission or acquisition risk, we compared the probability of condomless sex by partner during the 2 weeks after diagnosis (vs no sex with partner or sex with a condom every time), using a binomial regression model estimating risk differences. We compared the risk of a partner perpetrating IPV or abandoning the index patient, using binomial regression models.</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, our study is the only RCT to measure the effects of enhancing patient referral with counselling and education combined with the offer of provider-assisted referral. Our premise was that merging PN interventions for combined delivery is likely to maximise impact. Recent advances in electronic communication technologies have enabled innovations in provider-assisted referral, such as those offered in the ePN arm of our trial,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> rendering them more feasible in settings such as Cape Town. In the ePN arm of our study, the offer of provider assistance was almost never taken up, indicating that there is not widespread acceptability of such services. This is possibly because of the fear that such intervention will disrupt valued relationships, as observed elsewhere.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Participants in all three arms reported third-party assistance, suggesting people with STIs are able to obtain help with PN in the absence of provider-assisted referral. There are other PN interventions that could be considered for testing in a combination intervention, such as recall cues, shown in an RCT to increase the elicitation of partners and improve sexual network ascertainment.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

              <p>We found no difference between arms in the annual incidence of STI diagnosis. Despite the existence of many RCTs measuring the effects of various PN strategies on index patient reinfection including several assessing patient-delivered partner therapy,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 16</xref> only one other RCT compared the effects of counselling and education strategies with standard of care on STI reinfection rates, showing these to be effective among people with <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> in the USA.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Given the suboptimal validity of syndromic STI diagnoses,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> our measure of STI reinfection would have been less sensitive and specific than testing urine specimens as in the US trial. This might explain the different findings. Provider-assisted partner services have been shown to have a small beneficial effect on PN or partner treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 19</xref>
</p>
              <p>Participants who received ePN referred more (&gt;10%) partners for treatment compared with those receiving RR and HE. Among the few other trials that have investigated the effects of PN counselling and education, one Zimbabwean study has shown that it led to a small increase in the rate of partners notified,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 20</xref> while another South African study showed that it led to a small increase in the number of partners treated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Our study contributes to the small body of evidence that PN counselling and education can change the behaviour of people diagnosed with STIs.</p>
              <p>The participants in our trial showed accurate knowledge about STIs and high levels of PN self-efficacy, and there was no intervention effect. It is possible that our measures were not sensitive enough to capture changes in critical aspects of knowledge and self-efficacy that lead to PN behaviour changes.</p>
              <p>Th ePN arm showed benefit in the notification of ‘casual’ partners. Many studies report that people diagnosed with STIs are more willing to notify ‘main’ partners, compared with non-main partners.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This reluctance or difficulty in notifying non-main partners is reflected in our findings, with the proportion of main partners notified ranging between 75% and 82%, and non-main partners between 20% and 57%. On average, successful PN needs to be achieved with more than one partner per index case to prevent onward transmission,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and it has been proposed that PN success with casual or ex-regular partners is more efficient at preventing onward transmission relative to success with regular partners.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This suggests that if the reports of participants in our trial were valid, and if the partners they notified were infected with an STI, and if notified partners sought and received treatment, the ePN intervention would decrease the pool of infectious partners. However, the differential benefits of PN with different partner types will depend on a range of factors, such as frequency of sexual contacts, partner concurrency and sexual network structure, which we have not measured.</p>
              <p>Between 1.0% and 2.8% of participants reported being abandoned by their partner, and participants in the ePN intervention were at greater risk. PN counselling interventions need to carefully assess risks of adverse outcomes and assist people at risk to find alternative ways to prevent reinfection. This was included in the ePN counselling. It is possible that some participants in our trial did not accurately assess the risk of abandonment, or that they chose this risk over potential reinfection.</p>
              <p>Rates of condomless sex with partners during 2 weeks after STI diagnosis ranged from 38% to 46%, indicating risk of STI transmission or reinfection. All three conditions focused on increasing condom use, but the RR condition was modelled on an intervention shown to be effective in South Africa at reducing incident STIs and increasing condom use.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It is unclear why we were not able to reproduce the findings of the previous trial, and further research needs to identify effective ways to reduce condomless sex among people diagnosed with STIs.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Syndromic management has suboptimal validity for diagnosing STIs,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and it would have been preferable to include a biomedical outcome of recurrent STI. The secondary outcome, PN, was based on participant self-report, and was not confirmed by interviewing partner(s). We only included electronic health records from the City of Cape Town Health Department and not those of the Provincial Health Department. We cannot distinguish in the records whether a participant was an ‘index case’ or referred by a partner. Most participants (78.8%) were enrolled on the day of their STI diagnosis (81.1%, 76.6% and 78.6% in the ePN, RR and HE arms, respectively) or 1 day later (16.9%).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study contributes to the small body of evidence that, in settings such as Cape Town, PN counselling and education can change the behaviour of people diagnosed with STIs. Changes in behaviour did not lead to a reduction of STI diagnoses and research is needed to identify effective ways of reducing the incidence of STIs.</p>
