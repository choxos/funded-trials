            <p>In the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines for preventing and treating cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell disease, the committee recommends screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and treatment with regular blood transfusions for at least 1 year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> After 1 year of regular blood transfusion therapy, hydroxyurea therapy may be used in children without cerebral vasculopathy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As a result of standard care practice in high-income countries, the stroke incidence rate has dropped in children with SCA by 10-fold.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Among children with abnormal TCD velocities, ~20% will have a stroke over 2 years if not treated with regular blood transfusion or hydroxyurea therapy, based on an incidence rate of 10.9 strokes per 100 person-years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In low-income countries where blood transfusion is costly and not practical, such as Nigeria, the ASH guidelines recommend hydroxyurea therapy as an initial therapy for stroke prevention.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

            <p>As part of the capacity building component of the phase III Stroke Prevention Trial in Nigeria study (SPRING, Clinicaltrials.Gov: NCT02560935) that tested low-dose (10 mg/kg/day) and moderate-dose (20 mg/kg/day) of hydroxyurea for primary stroke prevention, one aim focused on developing a sustainable program for stroke prevention in SCA.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Thus, we tested the hypothesis that implementing a primary stroke screening program would be a feasible and sustainable strategy for at least a year.

                <p>Before starting the trial, the institutional practice was that only radiologists could perform TCD assessment. We initially identified non-radiologists and radiologists to conduct TCD screening and, subsequently, nurses because only 0 to 300 radiologists are available for a population of over 175 million which is approximately one radiologist for 700,000 people.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There are insufficient radiologists to provide screening TCD evaluations for ~32,000 children with SCA in the region.</p>

                <p>For the training, both children with and without SCA were recruited, including those with known abnormal TCD velocities. The TCD-certified non-radiologist physicians and nurses were also trained and certified on the Pediatric NIH Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS), a validated, standardized neurological examination assessing and quantifying the severity of strokes in children.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> An experienced pediatric neurologist traveled to Nigeria (E.T.), and 2 pediatric neurologists in Nashville (F.K. and L.J.) observed the use of the PedNIHSS in physicians (medical officers) and nurses.

                <p>Hospital leaders at the 5 eligible hospitals with established pediatric SCD clinics in metropolitan Kano and Kaduna, northern Nigeria, agreed to participate in the-<italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Stroke Prevention Team</italic> program. From April 2016 to July 2019, ~32,000 children attending the SCD clinics were identified and found to be eligible for the Stroke Prevention program. All children with SCA between 2 and 12 years of age, who visited the participating hospitals and were approached, agreed to receive the TCD evaluation, Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The program <italic toggle="yes">reach</italic> was 14.7%, that is, 4710 of ~32,000 children with SCA received the TCD screening services. Of those children receiving TCD screening, 6% (281/4710) had confirmed abnormal TCD velocities.</p>

                <p>Children with pre-existing strokes, not eligible for primary stroke prevention but eligible for secondary stroke prevention, were evaluated at 4, not 5 hospitals because the fifth hospital’s clinical staff was not set up to address the presence of pre-existing strokes. Among the children with SCA assessed for pre-existing strokes, 5.6% (172/3049) of the children were identified as having an affirmative answer to the 10 screening stroke questions,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> a validated questionnaire for detecting moderate to severe neurological impairment in children living in Africa, and had a subsequent history and physical examination that confirmed they had a stroke.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Furthermore, only 4 of the 5 participating hospitals asked the 10 stroke screening questions at the beginning of each clinic visit.

                <title>Effectiveness</title>
                <p>Regarding the <italic toggle="yes">effectiveness</italic> outcome (primary stroke prevention), before the program implementation, none of the children were prescribed moderate-fixed dose (20 mg/kg/day) hydroxyurea therapy for primary stroke prevention. After the program implementation, all physicians prescribed hydroxyurea either low (10 mg/kg/day) or moderate fixed-dose (20mg/kg/day) based on chaired decision making with the guardians for children with abnormal TCD velocities. All guardians of children with confirmed abnormal TCD velocities rejected the initial offer of blood transfusion therapy for their children.</p>
                <p>All children with abnormal TCD velocities received hydroxyurea manufactured by Bond Chemical Industries, Nigeria. Of the 281 children with confirmed abnormal TCD velocities, 20.6% (58/281) received hydroxyurea free-of-charge from philanthropic donations, 20.6% paid out-of-pocket, and the remaining children received hydroxyurea as part of the clinical trial (58.7%; SPRING trial). To address the inability of many families to pay out-of-pocket for hydroxyurea, recently, the Director-General of Hospital Management Board in Kano, Nigeria, and the Minister of Health in Kaduna, Nigeria, agreed to provide hydroxyurea free-of-charge to all children with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the current cohort, treating 281 children with SCA with abnormal TCD velocities presumably averted ~40 strokes using the number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 stroke (NNT=7) from the STOP trial and assuming equal efficacy, ~&lt;1 event per 100 person-years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
                <p>For the <italic toggle="yes">effectiveness</italic> of secondary stroke prevention, prescribing disease-modifying therapy (hydroxyurea) was also high (100%). No guardian elected for transfusion therapy outside of the clinical trial setting; 98.8% (170/172) of participants identified as having a stroke received hydroxyurea therapy for secondary stroke prevention.</p>

                <p>All 5 hospitals providing care for children with SCD in Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria were involved in the adoption. For primary stroke prevention, adoption at the provider level included the following: of the eligible 28 physicians (20 non-radiology physicians and 8 radiologists) at the participating sites, 60.7% (17/28) were approached and agreed to TCD ultrasonography training for primary stroke prevention; 42.9% (12/28) received certification.</p>

                <p>Overall, at 12-month evaluation, 100% of the originally planned components of the program for primary stroke prevention for children with SCA were implemented at all 5 sites. The following objectives were achieved: (1) all 5 hospital leaders created a <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Team</italic>, and 42.9% (12/28) of radiology and non-radiology physicians were successfully certified in TCD ultrasonography; (2) all sites and delivery agents agreed to provide screening services in their outpatient SCD clinics.</p>

                <title>Maintenance</title>
                <p>At 12 months post-initiation of the program, all the initially planned program components were implemented per protocol, including hands-on, one-on-one TCD training and TCD certification, PedNIHSS training, and certification of physicians and nurses. All stroke teams continued to maintain and participate in the program, financially supporting a certified TCD ultrasonographer, a certified nurse in standardized neurological examination, and routine screening of children with SCA, with TCD evaluation during outpatient clinic visits, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>
                <p>Seven health care workers (2 nurses and 5 physicians) at the 5 hospitals agreed to adopt the program. After 4 years of interaction, the Director-General of Hospital Boards in Kano and Kaduna states agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to maintain program sustainability. In both states, a gap of ~3 and 6 months, respectively, occurred between activation of the Memorandum of Understanding when the state leaders agreed to provide the hydroxyurea free-of-charge for children at high-risk of an initial or subsequent stroke. Before the state provided hydroxyurea free-of-charge, the team members paid for the hydroxyurea out of pocket, and a health care administrator secured additional funds. The children receiving hydroxyurea are being monitored as part of the new standard of care by the multidisciplinary <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Teams</italic> at each site bimonthly, with complete blood count evaluation every 6 months. There is no hydroxyurea dose escalation based on the results of the SPIN Trial, showing adequate stroke prevention with moderate fixed-dose hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg/d).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We used the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the impact of implementing the <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Teams</italic> program over 1 year in Kano and Kaduna states, Nigeria, to identify “why” and “how” this intervention works in this setting. Creating <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Teams</italic>, including a physician, a skilled TCD ultrasonographer, and a skilled nurse, all trained in performing appropriate neurological examinations, will allow for additional children to be reached. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of program adoption can inform its generalizability to other settings and scalability to other populations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> To our knowledge, our <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Team</italic> program for children with SCA is one of the first intervention programs for a region in Africa, not an individual hospital. This program is feasible in northern Nigeria and may be generalizable to other areas of Africa.</p>
              <p>Before our intervention, primary stroke prevention strategies were not embedded as the standard care for children with SCA in northern Nigeria. All 5 hospital leaders agreed to adopt the program strategies, and all components were implemented and maintained for at least 12 months postimplementation, as planned, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Reach was limited by the high volume of children with SCA, lack of trained personnel certified to perform TCD, and the paucity of TCD equipment. The training of the physicians and nurses was well-received. The program gained support and acceptability among the local leaders and health professionals before the signed Memorandum of Understanding. To increasee the reach a total of TCD machines were purchased with philanthropy funds and all TCD examinations were free of charge.</p>
              <p>All guardians of children with abnormal TCD velocities or pre-existing strokes refused initial regular blood transfusion therapy. Reasons guardians did not accept monthly blood transfusion therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention include, but are not limited to, the regional practice of requiring families to regularly seek blood donors to replace the units used and the high cost of red blood cell unit relative to income. The mean annual cost of chronic transfusion (without chelation) is $3276 United States dollars.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Approximately 40% of the Nigerian population (~83 million people) live below Nigeria’s poverty line, ∼US$1.00.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The large discrepancy between the cost to prevent strokes and the annual income is a significant barrier to blood transfusion therapy for primary stroke prevention. Our experience is identical to that of Lagunju et al at a single site in Nigeria where 100% of families refused regular blood transfusion therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Some Nigerians can afford monthly blood transfusion therapy and iron chelation, but most cannot.</p>
              <p>Significant barriers for SCA stroke prevention included the lack of TCD machines in the region, the potential charge for performing TCD examination, the scarcity of TCD-certified sonographers, the slow development of state hospital leaders, and partnerships to activate the Memorandum of Understanding. In addition, the cost of imported hydroxyurea is prohibitively for most families in the region. <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Teams</italic> are feasible in northern Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, with meaningful partnerships between regional public health care administrators, health care providers, state government leaders, and local philanthropists. Together these entities can ensure the sustainability of stroke prevention programs for children with SCA.</p>
              <p>We have demonstrated the feasibility of implementing <italic toggle="yes">Sickle Cell Disease Stroke Prevention Teams</italic> in northern Nigeria. The cornerstone of the Stroke Prevention Team’s success was the guiding philosophy that Nigerians should provide sustainable stroke prevention services for Nigerian children with SCA. This philosophy led to 2 critical efforts that strengthened the team’s resolve. First, finding a Nigerian pharmaceutical company (Bond Chemical Industries, Nigeria) that produces hydroxyurea at a subsidized cost (US$0.16 for 500 mg capsule per day). Second, the Nigerian team’s steady incremental belief that they could make a difference in children’s lives with SCA. The team’s raison d’etre was manifested in their enthusiasm to obtain TCD and stroke detection training, coupled with the team’s willingness to pay-out-of-pocket for hydroxyurea in children with abnormal TCD velocities before the state-supported free hydroxyurea therapy was available.</p>
