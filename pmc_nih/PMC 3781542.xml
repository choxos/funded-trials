                  <p>A total of 1,441 participants, initially 13–39 years of age, were followed for an average of 23.5 years as part of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up study. The Diabetes Quality-of-Life questionnaire (DQOL) was administered annually during DCCT and every other year during EDIC. Biomedical data, including HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, exposure to severe hypoglycemia, intercurrent psychiatric events, and development of diabetes complications were collected at regular intervals throughout the follow-up.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Mean total DQOL scores were not significantly different between the former DCCT intensive and conventional treatment groups (DCCT baseline, 78 ± 8 vs. 78 ± 9; EDIC year 17, 75 ± 11 vs. 74 ± 11). Over the course of the study, a drop of ≥5 points in DQOL score from DCCT baseline maintained on two successive visits occurred in 755 individuals and was associated with increased HbA<sub>1c</sub>, albumin excretion rate, mean blood pressure, BMI, and occurrence of hypoglycemic events requiring assistance. Lower DQOL scores after 23.5 years of follow-up were associated with prior development of retinopathy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0196), nephropathy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0019), and neuropathy (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) as well as self-reported chest pain (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0004), decreased vision in both eyes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0005), painful paresthesias (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), recurrent urinary incontinence (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001), erectile dysfunction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and history of psychiatric events (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>

          <body>
            <p>The long-term impact of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), associated complications, and diabetes treatment modalities on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are poorly understood. Although numerous studies of T1DM have evaluated HRQOL, many have been small and/or cross-sectional, and they typically involve only brief periods of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These previous studies have suggested that before the onset of chronic complications, patients with T1DM experience relatively small decrements in their HRQOL. Studies examining the effects of treatment, including comparisons of insulin type, frequency of injections, and pump use, have not shown consistent effects on HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Similarly, variations in level of glycemic control and/or frequency of exposure to severe hypoglycemia have not been consistently associated with HRQOL level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A small number of largely cross-sectional studies have indicated that diabetes complications are more strongly and consistently associated with lower quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, there is little information about the long-term effects of treatment modalities or course of illness based on prospective follow-up of a well-characterized cohort of patients evaluated longitudinally over an extended time frame. Obtaining information from diabetes patients about their experiences over many years of illness can help guide clinicians and educators in developing interventions to address patient concerns about this personally demanding condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p>
            <p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and its long-term natural history follow-up, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC), provide an opportunity to address this gap in our understanding by examining the long-term impact of diabetes treatment, acute metabolic changes, and serious complications on HRQOL. Because of the possible deleterious effects of intensive diabetes management on the personal and emotional life of the participants, the DCCT developed the Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), a measurement tool with greater sensitivity to the effects of diabetes treatment than was available in the generic measures of quality of life that were available at the time. The DQOL was tested for reliability and validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and was subsequently used as the principal quality-of-life outcome assessment during the DCCT and EDIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It has now become a commonly used measure of patient perceptions of their quality of life with translation into multiple languages and use with a wide variety of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p>
            <p>In this article, we report on observations that have been made over an average of &gt;23 years on the impact on HRQOL. We address three primary research questions: <italic>1</italic>) does prior DCCT assignment to conventional therapy in comparison with intensive therapy adversely impact HRQOL? <italic>2</italic>) does worse glycemic control or episodes of severe hypoglycemia adversely impact HRQOL? and <italic>3</italic>) does the development of long-term, advanced complications of diabetes adversely impact HRQOL? In addition to these primary research questions, we also examined the association of HRQOL with psychiatric events and symptomatic manifestations of diabetes complications.</p>

                <title>Study sample</title>
                <p>Between 1983 and 1989, 1,441 participants with T1DM, 13–39 years of age, were enrolled in the DCCT. The DCCT consisted of two cohorts: the primary prevention cohort had diabetes for 1–5 years, no retinopathy, and urinary albumin excretion &lt;40 mg/24 h, and the secondary intervention cohort had diabetes for 1–15 years, very mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy, and urinary albumin excretion ≤200 mg/24 h at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Approximately one-half of the subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 711) were randomly assigned to intensive therapy, and the remainder (<italic>N</italic> = 730) were assigned to conventional therapy. The treatment groups maintained a separation of median HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of ∼2 percentage points (7.1 vs. 9.0%; 54.1 vs. 74.9 mmol/mol) during the 6.5-year average DCCT follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p>
                <p>Since it had been shown to be highly effective in reducing diabetic microvascular complications, intensive therapy was recommended for all participants when the DCCT ended in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Participants were then returned to their own health care providers for diabetes care. In 1994, 1,375 (96%) of the 1,428 surviving members of DCCT volunteered to participate in EDIC for annual observational follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This report incorporates data through EDIC year 17 (2010), representing an average of 23.5 years of follow-up from randomization into DCCT. By EDIC year 17, 1,287 subjects continued to participate in EDIC, and of these, 1,177 (91%) completed the DQOL survey. Ninety-five participants had died by the end of EDIC year 17. For purposes of these analyses, two subjects with acute, temporary renal failure unrelated to diabetes were excluded.</p>
                <p>Nonparticipants, including those who died, did not differ from participants in most characteristics at DCCT baseline including sex, age, education, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Nonparticipants had significantly higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and a higher frequency of current cigarette smokers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2109/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Furthermore, 48% of participants were in the conventional treatment group compared with 61% of nonparticipants.</p>

                <title>Quality-of-life assessment</title>
                <p>The DQOL is a self-administered multiple-choice 46-item assessment that has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The DQOL has four primary subscales (satisfaction, impact, diabetes worry, and social/vocational worry) that assess different aspects of quality of life. The scoring system yields scale scores that range from 0 (lowest quality of life) to 100 (highest quality of life), identical to the procedure for scoring the Medical Outcome Survey 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) quality-of-life measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Total DQOL scores are presented in the <sc>Results</sc> section unless otherwise stated, and scores on the four subscales are presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2109/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>.</p>
                <p>Psychometric studies have indicated that the overall DQOL measure has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach α, 0.83–0.92) for both adults and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Test-retest reliability over an average period of 9 days was 0.92 for the overall measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The DQOL has been shown to have convergent validity with conceptually relevant measures of well-being, psychiatric symptoms, and adjustment to illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In addition, the DQOL discriminates between patients with different numbers of clinically evident complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and is sensitive to different therapies for T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and to a change in therapy for T1DM (i.e., pancreatic transplantation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). For this article, the primary outcome was the total DQOL score.</p>
                <p>Past research has suggested that a difference of five points on the total DQOL score represents a clinically meaningful difference in HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Consequently, this parameter was used in our longitudinal analyses of the effects of time-dependent predictors on decrease in quality of life. Specifically, an event was defined as a drop from baseline ≥5 points on two consecutive evaluations. We used a sustained decrease in DQOL score to confirm that a change occurred over a substantial time frame and was not transitory. We have used this same approach for other outcomes such as nephropathy, where a measure like albumin excretion rate (AER) can change up and down over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The DQOL was administered annually throughout the DCCT and biannually during EDIC.</p>

Retinopathy, assessed during EDIC years 11–14 by 7-field stereoscopic fundus photography according to the DCCT/EDIC protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), was defined for these analyses as the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or worse, and/or a history of panretinal scatter-photocoagulation (laser) therapy. In addition, visual acuity (VA) was assessed to determine best corrected vision in the best and worst eye. Nephropathy was defined in this study as having any AER ≥300 mg/24 h through EDIC year 16 or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), defined as treatment with dialysis or transplantation for chronic renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).

                <p>The occurrence of severe hypoglycemia was documented quarterly during the DCCT and within 3 months of the annual visit during EDIC.

Twenty-seven percent of severe hypoglycemic episodes involved coma or seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In this article, the episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance and those also resulting in seizure or coma were analyzed separately.</p>

Since QOL was only measured during odd years in EDIC, each model was stratified for calendar year of randomization, allowing subjects who entered into the study during the same calendar year to have the same visit sequence. Updated mean values are time-weighted, running means up to each study visit in the DCCT and EDIC.</p>
                <p>Separate ANCOVA models were used to assess the relationship between total DQOL and both complication status and functional symptoms by year 17 of EDIC.

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>We present the longest prospective follow-up study of HRQOL in individuals with T1DM and describe their course of quality-of-life experiences over ∼25 years. The therapy applied to the intensive treatment group during DCCT and encouraged for the entire cohort during the 17 years of EDIC follow-up has resulted in relatively low rates of severe diabetes complications. Our findings support a salutary effect of the prevention and delay of complications on HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Decreases in HRQOL are particularly likely among patients with a higher prevalence of severe complications.</p>
              <p>With regard to our first research question and consistent with our previous report at the end of the DCCT, there are no apparent adverse effects of intensive therapy on HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). With regard to our second research question and in contrast to our initial HRQOL report based on an average of 6.5 years of treatment during DCCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), after an additional 17 years of follow-up, we now find an association between elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance and a sustained decrease in DQOL scores.</p>
              <p>With regard to our third research question, the development of advanced complications and the symptoms resulting from these complications, such as decreased VA, erectile dysfunction, and incontinence, were associated with decreases in HRQOL. Each of the three complications assessed (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) were individually associated with lower DQOL scores in comparison with those without the complication; moreover, using a composite index, increasing numbers of advanced complications led to lower quality of life. Consistent with the assessment of complications, functional symptoms were also associated with lower quality of life. It is important to note that while almost all patients developed some degree of retinopathy (88% prior intensive group; 96% prior conventional group) and 19% required laser treatment or vitreoretinal surgery in at least one eye, only 4.8% (<italic>N</italic> = 52) had best corrected vision worse than 20/40 in one eye, and only 13 had best corrected vision worse than 20/100 in one eye. Patients with best corrected vision less than 20/100 in their worse eye had lower HRQOL than those with better VA.</p>
              <p>Finally, the development of common psychiatric syndromes like depression is linked to HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This relationship was seen in the association of psychiatric conditions and their treatment on lower DQOL scores after an average of 23.5 years of follow-up.</p>
              <p>The current study has unique strengths compared with previous studies of T1DM, including its long-term, consistent follow-up of a large cohort; detailed demographic and clinical information collected prospectively using standardized methods from relatively early in the course of illness; repeated measurement of HRQOL; the diversity of clinical outcomes; and the wide range of ages represented during the study period (13–65 years of age).</p>
              <p>The study also has limitations that can affect the generalizability of its findings. These include the selection and self-selection of participants to enroll in a randomized clinical trial that required careful screening and adherence to a complex regimen over an extended period of time. Such patients have relatively high levels of motivation compared with the general population. Moreover, potential participants with psychosocial problems and limited social support would have been screened out. The DCCT/EDIC cohort had relatively high average socioeconomic status and education level of the group and was predominantly Caucasian. During DCCT, there was a high degree of assistance provided by the study nurse-coordinators and physicians. This was especially evident for the intensively treated group during DCCT. Such factors would tend to lessen the impact on HRQOL, so these findings may understate the effects in typical clinical populations, who also may have higher rates of severe complications.</p>
              <p>Although our cohort, and in particular the intensive treatment group, received an unusual level of attention and support during the 6.5 years of the DCCT, during 17 of the average of 23.5 years represented by this study, the participants have been followed in typical practice settings with less support from the study. The return to usual care settings may increase the representativeness of this group of T1DM patients.</p>
              <p>Our ability to examine the effects of treatment assignment, exposure to varying levels of glycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, and the development of medical complications provide a benchmark for comparison with other research studies and with patients followed in typical clinical settings. We have constructed a quantitative picture of the impact of different interventions, levels of metabolic control, and complications on patient experiences of illness. Smaller studies that have explored in greater depth the experiences of illness using qualitative methods augment these findings while evaluating specific aspects of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Other studies, typically cross-sectional or of shorter duration, but with broader representation of patient types, have provided information that is reasonably consistent with our findings. Specifically, complications exert a stronger effect on HRQOL than diabetes management approaches. Moreover, as in our study, intensification of treatment using multiple daily injections and insulin pumps does not lead to decreased quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Indeed, intensive treatment and the subsequent reduction of symptomatic complications helps maintain the long-term quality of life of patients with diabetes.</p>
              <p>The information derived from studies like this one can be useful for clinicians as the initiate newly diagnosed patients into treatment and work with patients collaboratively over time. Indeed, such personal experiences are increasingly viewed as critical for patients in making their own therapeutic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and engaging their clinical care team in dealing with the rigors of long-term diabetes. Moreover, symptoms related to sexual and urologic functions may be embarrassing for patients to discuss, but have distinct impact on patient experience of illness and represent an important area for inquiry by treating health care professionals.</p>
