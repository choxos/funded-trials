                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Caregivers of a family member with a chronic disability or illness such as dementia are at increased risk for chronic disease. There are many factors that contribute to dementia caregiver vulnerability and these factors can be challenging to assess in clinical settings. Self-rated health (SRH) is an independent measure of survival and physical health in the elderly. As an inclusive measure of health, SRH has been proposed as a reliable way to assess a patient’s general health in primary care. Therefore, we sought to identify determinants of poor/fair SRH versus categories of at least good SRH in informal caregivers.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In a cross-sectional study, we examined 134 elderly (≥55 years) providing in-home care for a spouse with dementia who rated their own health with a single-item question: “In general, would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?”. In a multivariable model, we compared caregivers with poor/fair SRH to those with good, very good, or excellent SRH on demographics, health characteristics (health behaviors, physical health indicators, psychosocial factors) and caregiving-specific stress (a composite index/total of four caregiving-specific stressors: years of caregiving, dementia severity, care recipient functional impairment and perceived caregiver burden).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Compared with caregivers who rated their own health as either good (31.3%), very good (38.8%) or excellent (14.2%), caregivers with poor/fair SRH (15.7%) were more likely to have lower physical function and total greater caregiving-specific stress. More years of caregiving, severe dementia and care recipient functional impairment, but not perceived caregiver burden, were also more likely among caregivers with poor/fair SRH. Additionally, high negative affect and low positive affect were more likely in caregivers with poor/fair vs. good or excellent and very good or excellent SRH, respectively.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Caregivers with poor/fair SRH were characterized by higher levels of medical comorbidity, low physical function, high negative, but low positive affect and longer duration of caregiving, as well as more severe dementia and greater functional impairment of the care recipient. These findings suggest that caregivers need to be more closely evaluated and targeted for preventive interventions in clinical practice.</p>

Yet, the predictive ability of these risk factors should be viewed cautiously, as they are often intercorrelated and have not been simultaneously examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Vulnerable caregivers at high risk of adverse health outcomes should be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, this task is challenging in clinical settings, where short consultations, reimbursement structure and lack of training limit extensive history taking, risk assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the implementation of practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To overcome this shortcoming, it has been suggested that health professionals should simply ask caregivers about how they perceive their own health, as those with poor self-rated health (SRH) are at an increased risk of serious medical complications and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this regard, population-based studies show a gradual increase in mortality risk, independent of covariates across response categories of excellent, very good, good, fair and poor SRH, with twice the risk in individuals with poor vs. excellent SRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">In adults 60 years and older, fair or poor vs. at least good SRH is a powerful predictor of all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality such that SRH may also be a useful tool for a quick and simple identification of elders in need for more intensive clinical evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since SRH is associated with comorbid illness, health behaviors, functional status, psychological distress, social support and demographic factors, assessments of SRH with a single-item question may yield an inclusive measure of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As such, SRH has been proposed for disease screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and as a reliable way to assess patients’ general health situation in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">About 30% of caregivers rate their own health as fair or poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and caregivers have significantly poorer SRH than non-caregivers, even when adjusting for demographic factors, social support and long-term illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In dementia caregivers, caregiver burden was found to be the strongest predictor of poor SRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and, in a vicious cycle, the poor SRH accentuated caregiver distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the determinants of poor/fair SRH versus each category of better SRH (i.e., versus good, very good and excellent SRH) have not systematically been investigated in dementia caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">On the whole, SRH provides a summary statement about numerous aspects of subjective and objective health within the perceptual framework of an individual patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the process may also apply to dementia caregivers in clinical settings. SRH can be recommended as an easy-to-administer routine health indicator that can be used as a screening tool by clinicians, while at the same time allowing caregivers to generate a genuine perspective of their own health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, identification of some of the above delineated determinants of SRH in caregivers with poor/fair SRH could help to make decisions about further clinical evaluation and target interventions in the group of vulnerable caregivers with the greatest health risk.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Therefore, we sought to identify demographic factors (i.e. age, sex, education), health characteristics (i.e., health behaviors, physical health indicators, psychosocial factors) and caregiving-specific stressors (i.e., years of caregiving, dementia severity, functional impairment of the care recipient, perceived caregiver burden) that may differentiate dementia caregivers with poor/fair SRH from those with good, very good, or excellent SRH. Based on the existing literature, all of these determinants of SRH could be hypothesized to differentiate caregivers with different categories of SRH. For the purpose of this study, we were particularly interested in potentially modifiable components of SRH as potential targets to improve clinical care in dementia caregivers. We specifically hypothesized that caregivers with poor/fair SRH are at an increased risk of poor physical health, high negative/low positive affect, and of experiencing caregiving-specific stress.</p>

The intervention has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In brief, six face-to-face sessions were conducted in caregivers’ homes. Intervention 1 is a behavioral activation intervention targeting engagement in pleasant leisure activities. Intervention 2 (comparison) is a support intervention but teaches skills like managing problem behaviors and improving communication. Data reported here are from the baseline visit, obtained before randomization. The baseline visit consisted of a series of questionnaires, administered by interview by a trained research associate. The interview took approximately 1.5–2 h in duration and the participants were paid $100 for completing the assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Our study used community sampling strategies to recruit participants. We presented the study at various community support groups, health seminars for elderly (generally) and caregivers (specifically), and also received referrals from community providers who serve caregivers and dementia patients (e.g., professionals at adult day care centers; respite providers). The majority of subjects were recruited through community agencies serving active Alzheimer’s disease patients and their caregivers. These included Alzheimer’s organizations (e.g., Alzheimer’s association) and a variety of caregiver support groups, churches, health fairs, and day care facilities. Additional recruitment of a minor fraction of participants was through the UCSD Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. We screened 248 participants for eligibility, of which 150 met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 136 were willing to participant and provided consent. Two participants were excluded from the present analysis due to missing demographic and SRH data, yielding a final sample of 134.</p>
                <p id="Par19">To be eligible, caregivers had to be 55 years or older, English-speaking, provide at least 20 h per week of in-home care for a spouse with dementia and endorse at least mild depressive symptoms (i.e., mild level of distress) as per a score of ≥5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] at the time of enrollment. A specific diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, as opposed to other forms of dementia, was not required as an inclusion criterion.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Exclusion criteria were current treatment for any malignancies, severe chronic illnesses requiring ongoing medical treatment (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure), severe hypertension (&gt; 200/120 mmHg), major psychiatric illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), prior or ongoing participation in a behavioral caregiver intervention, or treatment with steroids, non-selective beta-blocking, or anticoagulant medications.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par40">The objective of this study was to identify determinants of poor/fair SRH versus self-assessments of good, very good or excellent health in a sample of informal caregivers providing in-home care for a spouse with dementia. Of 134 caregivers studied, 15.7% rated their own health as poor or fair. This proportion is lower than in earlier studies with percentages ranging between 18 and 45% and a median of 31% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but closer to more recent surveys in which 20% of caregivers described their own health as poor or fair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In turn, the high proportion of caregivers describing their health as good, very good or excellent could also reflect evidence of caregiver resilience, even among spousal dementia caregivers who are a particularly vulnerable subgroup.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Both in the crude and fully adjusted analysis, we found that caregivers who reported poor/fair SRH had lower physical function. The likelihood of higher caregiver physical function increased from good to very good to excellent SRH in the fully adjusted model. Medical comorbidity, defined by the number of physical health problems, was a less robust predictor and more likely in caregivers with poor/fair vs. those with very good SRH only. Therefore, reports of any impairment in caregiver physical function may be more relevant to SRH than the sheer number of physical health problems.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The probability of greater total caregiving-specific stress was also higher in caregivers with poor/fair SRH, as opposed to caregivers in the other three categories of SRH. However, this was true only after controlling for covariates, likely because caregiver physical function and total caregiving-specific stress were directly correlated with each other. In other words, only when their mutual effect was accounted for was caregiving-specific stress total unmasked as an independent determinant of poor/fair SRH.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Caregivers with higher physical function may be those having more caregiving-specific stress because their physical resources make them more capable of taking care of an overly ill and impaired spouse. This is underscored by the observation that higher caregiver physical function was also correlated with greater care recipient functional impairment. In the post hoc analysis, a higher probability of measures of objective caregiving-specific stressors – more years of caregiving, more severe dementia and greater care recipient functional impairment distinguished poor/fair SRH from categories of at least good SRH.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Contrary to a study from Iran in which perceived caregiver burden emerged as the strongest predictor of SRH, perceived caregiver burden was not associated with SRH in our sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Different measures of perceived caregiver burden and SRH, cultural differences in caregiver roles, and, in the study on dementia caregivers from Iran, a high proportion of non-spousal family caregivers (two thirds were daughters/sons) and a comparably lower socioeconomic status (two fifths being poor or very poor) might possibly explain this inconsistency. A longer duration of caregiving was most consistently associated with a higher probability of poor/fair SRH; in agreement with data showing that 17% of caregivers believe that their health has deteriorated as a result of providing care, particularly those who have been providing care for at least 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">The likelihood of more negative affect and less positive affect was also highest in caregivers with poor/fair SRH. The finding regarding negative affect concurs with literature showing that poor SRH is associated with psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity, including depressive symptoms in dementia caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The role of positive affect in SRH has to our knowledge not previously been investigated in caregivers. More negative affect already distinguished caregivers with poor/fair SRH from those with good SRH, whereas more positive affect was likeliest in those with very good and excellent vs. poor/fair SRH.</p>
              <p id="Par46">A direct comparison between categories of SRH showed more positive affect in those with excellent vs. very good or good SRH (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In older people, followed for up to five years, positive affect, as opposed to negative affect, was associated with changes in SRH only when physical health (chronic disease score) was better than usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Another study in community-dwelling older adults showed that participants with higher positive affect were more likely to preserve favorable assessments of SRH over a follow-up between one and five years, even after adjustment for functional limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Altogether, high positive affect may be necessary for dementia caregivers to perceive their health at the very positive end. Moreover, for a better understanding of the basis of SRH in dementia caregivers, positive affect measures should be included in future studies, along with negative affect and medical comorbidity, to attend to the full illness-wellness continuum of health and not only to the presence or absence of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">Of interest, there was little evidence for differences in demographic factors and adverse health behaviors between caregivers with poor/fair vs. groups with at least good SRH when controlling for covariates. This is in agreement with a study showing that socioeconomic and health behavior covariates predicted mortality in individuals with average and good SRH, but not in those with poor SRH, whose risk was largely attributable to illness-related limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Exceptions in our sample were lower alcohol consumption, concurring with some positive health effects of moderate alcohol intake in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and younger age, both in caregivers with poor/fair vs. those with very good SRH. Younger caregivers could be more concerned than older ones that caregiving adversely impacts their own health. We believe the unexpected finding of a higher probability of ever smokers in caregivers with excellent vs. poor/fair SRH is due partially to the fact that among the 58 participants identifying as “ever smokers”, only 5 reported they were “current” smokers, meaning that over 90% had quit smoking at some point in their lifetimes. Further, it is possible that among the remaining “current” smokers, smoking is used as a stress relief, which has been demonstrated in the scientific literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">On the whole, the findings from this study suggest that poor/fair SRH vs. at least good SRH reflects an inclusive measure of low physical and mental health as well as caregiving-specific stress in dementia caregivers. These domains have individually been shown to be associated with physical health decline and mortality in caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, from a clinical perspective, screening for poor/fair SRH with a single-item question may be valuable for identifying caregivers at risk of adverse health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Even in a busy clinical setting, such a policy could be applied to capture a need for further clinical evaluation and specific treatments. A better understanding of correlates of poor/fair SRH may prompt target interventions aimed at improving SRH in the most vulnerable caregivers. When appropriate treatment follows positive screening, a caregiver’s perceived poor or fair health could be improved. Meta-analyses show that interventions improve caregiver burden and negative emotions, but less so physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Yet, compared with a no-treatment control group, dementia caregivers who underwent a 6-month multicomponent skills training, targeting self-care behaviors, showed improvements in physical health, mood, and SRH assessed with a single-item question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. With periodical assessments of SRH, clinicians could also easily monitor treatment success and sustainability. However, whether this clinical approach ultimately results in better physical health outcomes and lower mortality of informal caregivers remains to be demonstrated. Unfortunately, as the intervention study from which we drew data for this paper was not designed to specifically improve SRH, post-intervention data were not included in this analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Limitations of our study are the cross-sectional design, precluding any causal inferences, and a modest percentage of caregivers with poor/fair SRH limiting statistical power. This may be a consequence of the aim of our parent study and may threaten external validity of our findings. Caregivers were originally enrolled in an intervention trial, so they may have felt overly healthy to even dare taking the effort to participate; moreover, we excluded caregivers with severe medical conditions. Nevertheless, all caregivers were at least mildly distressed per enrollment criteria, so they reflect an important subgroup of this vulnerable population. The high proportion of female caregivers and an above-average socioeconomic status, with only two caregivers indicating less than grade 12 education, are possible reasons for why sex and education were not predictive of poor/fair SRH.</p>
              <p id="Par50">In terms of representativeness, our sample is highly consistent with epidemiologic samples of spousal dementia caregivers in the United States, and in California in particular, as seen by the statistics provided by the Alzheimer’s Association in their annual “Facts and Figures” release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Indeed we have a majority of our sample as female, with approximately 40% having significant symptoms of depression, and providing substantial amounts of care per week (both in terms of hours caregiving and services provided). However, because we did not have specific resources available to enroll Spanish-speaking participants, our sample does have potential bias in terms of race/ethnicity, limiting its representativeness. Caution is advised when generalizing our findings to samples with a higher share of male caregivers and caregivers without formal education. We used a systems review and history questionnaire to assess medical comorbidity, but there are more established measures such as the Charlson comorbidity index. There are various response formats to assess SRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and some do not apply single-item questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], making an integration of the literature challenging. As they are not part of clinical routine, we did not consider biomarkers of disease risk, which are elevated in dementia caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and also associated with SRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, SRH has been shown to predict mortality even when controlling for objectively confirmed laboratory data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We acknowledge that estimates for a few determinants of excellent SRH are uncertain due to the small number of caregivers in this category. Nonetheless, informative knowledge that higher levels of positive affect and less severe dementia in the care recipient may differentiate caregivers with different SRH response categories from those with poor/fair SRH was lost in the binary logistic analysis. As the relationship between dementia caregiving and different categories of SRH is still a nascent field of research, we decided to present and discuss the findings from the multinomial logistic regression analysis as the primary results of our study.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par51">Taken together, dementia caregivers with poor/fair SRH are more likely to have medical comorbidity, low physical function, high negative affect, low positive affect, and more subjective caregiving-specific stressors than caregivers who self-rate their health as good, very good or excellent. A single-question rating of self-perceived health may be a clinically useful tool to evaluate caregivers’ physical health risk in clinical practice and a need for further clinical evaluation and treatment.</p>
