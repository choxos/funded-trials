                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Lower grade gliomas (LGGs) are malignant brain tumors. Current therapy is associated with short- and long-term toxicity. Progression to higher tumor grade is associated with contrast enhancement on MRI. The majority of LGGs harbor mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic>). Vorasidenib (AG-881) is a first-in-class, brain-penetrant, dual inhibitor of the mutant IDH1 and mutant IDH2 enzymes.</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study of vorasidenib in 93 patients with mutant <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> (m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic>) solid tumors, including 52 patients with glioma that had recurred or progressed following standard therapy. Vorasidenib was administered orally, once daily, in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment is complete; this trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02481154.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Vorasidenib showed a favorable safety profile in the glioma cohort. Dose-limiting toxicities of elevated transaminases occurred at doses ≥100 mg and were reversible. The protocol-defined objective response rate per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for LGG in patients with nonenhancing glioma was 18% (one partial response, three minor responses). The median progression-free survival was 36.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 11.2–40.8] for patients with nonenhancing glioma and 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.8–6.5) for patients with enhancing glioma. Exploratory evaluation of tumor volumes in patients with nonenhancing glioma showed sustained tumor shrinkage in multiple patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Vorasidenib was well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity in patients with recurrent or progressive nonenhancing m<italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> LGG.</p>

              <p>Standard treatments of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for diffuse lower grade gliomas (World Health Organization grade II/III) are noncurative. Tumors recur and progress to a higher grade in most patients. Patients with long-term disease control often experience disease- or treatment-related symptoms. Vorasidenib, a first-in-class, brain-penetrant dual inhibitor of mutant IDH1/2 (mIDH1/2), reduced tumor growth and levels of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate in an orthotopic m<italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> glioma mouse model. In this phase I, first-in-human study, vorasidenib showed a favorable safety profile at doses &lt;100 mg once daily and preliminary clinical activity in recurrent or progressive m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> glioma. Although these patients had recurrent disease after—or had not responded to—initial standard therapy, these results suggest a potential benefit of introducing mIDH-targeted therapy during the watch-and-wait period, which could potentially delay the use of more toxic treatments. Moreover, they provide the rationale for the continued evaluation of vorasidenib in an ongoing placebo-controlled, randomized, phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04164901).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gliomas represent the most frequent malignant primary brain tumors and are characterized by diffuse infiltration of the brain by malignant cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas are often referred to as lower grade gliomas (LGGs; ref. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Compared to glioblastomas (WHO grade IV diffuse gliomas), LGGs afflict younger patients, initially grow at a slower rate, and typically do not show contrast enhancement on T1-weighted brain MRI at initial disease diagnosis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>). Treatment of LGGs includes maximally safe tumor resection, followed by radiation and chemotherapy as appropriate (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>). Unfortunately, this treatment is not curative and most patients suffer disease recurrence and progress to a higher tumor grade (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), often associated with aberrant vascularization (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and the appearance of tumor contrast enhancement on T1-weighted brain MRI (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Even patients with long-term disease control suffer from disease-related or treatment-related symptoms, including neurocognitive changes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 9, 10</xref>). New treatment approaches targeting disease-defining genetic events at the earliest stage of the disease may delay the need for DNA-damaging therapies and perhaps delay the transformation of LGGs into more aggressive tumors.</p>
              <p>Mutations in the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) occur in various human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cholangiocarcinoma, and glioma. They occur in up to approximately 80% of patients with LGGs (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Cancer-associated IDH1/2 mutations occur early in tumorigenesis, cluster in the active site of the enzymes, and cause the mutant enzymes to produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG; refs. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). Accumulation of 2-HG leads to competitive inhibition of potentially more than 60 α-ketoglutarate–dependent enzymes, causing epigenetic dysregulation and impaired differentiation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>). Given the central role of 2-HG in the molecular pathogenesis of mutant <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> (m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic>) cancer (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>), pharmacologic blockade of mIDH enzymes is being pursued as a potential therapy. Inhibition of mIDH1/2 promoted differentiation in experimental models of m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> glioma, leukemia, and cholangiocarcinoma (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>). Patients with relapsed or refractory AML harboring m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> or m<italic toggle="yes">IDH2</italic> showed clinical responses to isoform-selective inhibitors of mIDH1 (ivosidenib) and mIDH2 (enasidenib), respectively (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18, 19</xref>). Ivosidenib also showed antitumor activity in patients with m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> gliomas (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
              <p>Vorasidenib (AG-881), a first-in-class, dual inhibitor of mIDH1/2, was specifically developed for improved penetration across the blood–brain barrier, and showed brain penetrance and reduced tumor growth in an orthotopic model of m<italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> glioma (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 22</xref>). Dual inhibition of mIDH1 and mIDH2 may be superior to isoform-selective inhibition of mIDH1 or mIDH2 because isoform switching from mIDH1 to mIDH2, or vice versa, has been reported as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance in AML (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Here, we report the results of a phase I study of vorasidenib in patients with advanced m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> solid tumors, with a focus on glioma.</p>

                <title>Study design and oversight</title>
                <p>This phase I, single-arm, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of vorasidenib enrolled patients with m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> advanced solid tumors, including glioma (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02481154).</p>
                <p>Vorasidenib was administered orally, once daily, in continuous 28-day cycles. Dose escalation was conducted separately for glioma and non-glioma solid tumors. Cohorts of 3 to 6 evaluable patients were to be enrolled, including at least 6 patients receiving the MTD or recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Additional cohorts of 1 to 6 patients could be enrolled at any dose level below the estimated MTD or RP2D for the replacement of patients not evaluable for the dose escalation, the evaluation of alternative dosing regimens, or for further analyses used for RP2D selection. At least 18 patients in the glioma cohort and 21 in the non-glioma cohort were expected to be treated.</p>
                <p>The study was conducted according to International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board/International Ethics Committee at each study location. Written informed consent was provided by all patients before screening and enrollment. The complete study protocol is available in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.</p>

                <p>All enrolled patients had a confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor, including glioma, with documented m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> or m<italic toggle="yes">IDH2</italic> that had recurred after—or had not responded to—initial standard therapy. <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> mutation status was assessed locally. Eligible patients were aged ≥18 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0–2, and evaluable disease assessed using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) or RANO-LGG criteria for patients with glioma, or RECIST version 1.1 for patients with non-glioma solid tumors (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref>).</p>
                <p>Other eligibility criteria included an expected survival of ≥3 months and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were excluded if they had received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;21 days before their first day of study drug administration, prior treatment with bevacizumab at any time, or an investigational agent &lt;14 days before their first day of study drug administration. Patients with glioma had a baseline brain MRI scan within 14 days before day 1 while not receiving glucocorticoids, or receiving the same daily dose of glucocorticoids, during the 5 days before the baseline MRI scan.</p>

                <title>Study assessments</title>
                <p>The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vorasidenib treatment and to determine the MTD and/or RP2D. Safety evaluation included the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first treatment cycle and adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation.</p>
                <p>Secondary objectives included clinical activity as measured by best overall response and progression-free survival (PFS). For enhancing glioma and non-glioma solid tumors, objective response was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by the investigator on the basis of RANO criteria (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or RECIST version 1.1 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), respectively. For patients with nonenhancing glioma, objective response was defined as CR, PR, and minor response (mR) as determined by the investigator on the basis of RANO-LGG (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Given the challenges associated with accurate representation of tumor response on MRI in LGG, the RANO working group considers a 25%–50% reduction in tumor size compared with baseline clinically meaningful, and several classifications now include mR as a measure of treatment effect (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25, 27</xref>). Therefore, mR was included in the objective response rate for nonenhancing glioma. PFS was defined as the time from first dose to the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first. Blood samples were drawn pre- and postdose to determine circulating levels of vorasidenib.</p>

                <p>Tumor volume measurements were evaluated in the nonenhancing glioma cohort as described previously (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Exploratory assessments also included confirmation of baseline m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1/2</italic> status and identification of co-occurring mutations by next-generation sequencing using the ACE Extended Cancer Panel (Personalis) whenever archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples were available.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The dose-determining set comprised all patients considered evaluable for DLT assessment and MTD estimation [i.e., patients either had a DLT during cycle 1 or completed ≥75% of their planned cycle 1 doses (21 of 28 days) and were considered by the clinical study team to have had sufficient safety data available to conclude that a DLT did not occur during cycle 1]. AEs occurring after cycle 1 may have been designated as DLTs by the study team.</p>
                <p>An adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with two parameters guided by the escalation with overdose control principle (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was used to make dose recommendations and estimate the MTD/RP2D. Dose-escalation decisions were based on all relevant data available for patients in the dose-determining set from all dose levels evaluated in the study, including observed toxicities and estimates of probability of DLTs using BLRM, safety information, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data.</p>
                <p>Disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized using frequency distributions or descriptive statistics.</p>
                <p>Objective response rates were calculated along with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI). All time-to-event outcomes were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods. Point estimates and 95% CIs were calculated. Estimates of the median and other quantiles were generated.</p>

                <p>The glioma cohort included 22 patients with nonenhancing glioma (absence of enhancement on MRI by investigator assessment) and 30 with enhancing glioma. The median age of the patients with glioma was 42.5 (range, 16–73) years. Nearly all patients with glioma had WHO grade II [25 (48.1%)] or WHO grade III [22 (42.3%)] tumors as of the most recent assessment before screening. Most tumors harbored a mutation in <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> (92.3%). Thirty-nine (75.0%) patients had received prior systemic therapy for the treatment of glioma and 30 (57.7%) had received prior radiation therapy. Eight (36.4%) patients with nonenhancing glioma remained on treatment, with 10 (45.5%) discontinuing treatment due to disease progression, 2 (9.1%) due to AEs, and 2 (9.1%) withdrawing from the study. One (3.3%) patient with enhancing glioma remained on treatment, with 24 (80.0%) discontinuing due to progressive disease and 5 (16.7%) withdrawing from the study. Patient disposition is reported in Supplementary Fig. S1.</p>
                <p>The non-glioma cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 41) comprised patients with a variety of other solid tumors. Most patients had an m<italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> tumor [27 (65.9%); <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>] and most had received prior systemic therapies. Enrollment to this cohort was stopped by the sponsor in October 2016, in favor of continued development in glioma.</p>

                <p>The initial starting dose was 25 mg once daily. Dose escalation up to 300 mg once daily in glioma and 400 mg once daily in non-glioma was initially completed (Supplementary Table S1). On the basis of DLTs of elevated serum transaminases in patients with glioma, an additional 10 mg once-daily level was opened and an additional 6 patients were enrolled in the 50 mg once-daily dose level. Five AEs of grade ≥2 elevated transaminases that occurred at doses of ≥100 mg in patients with glioma were designated as DLTs by the sponsor. Transaminase AEs were dose dependent (Supplementary Table S2), not associated with a bilirubin elevation, and resolved to grade ≤1 with dose modification or discontinuation. Two patients discontinued because of this AE. The MTD was not reached in the glioma cohort based on BLRM; dose selection could be guided by the BLRM but was not dependent upon the BLRM. On the basis of dose-dependent DLTs, the sponsor and investigators recommended no further escalation beyond 300 mg, and that doses &lt;100 mg be further explored in glioma. No DLTs were observed and the MTD had not been reached at doses of up to 400 mg once daily in patients with non-glioma tumors before termination of enrollment in this cohort based on the sponsor's decision to focus on the development of vorasidenib in glioma.</p>
                <p>The most common (&gt;10%) AEs are reported in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Ten (19.2%) patients with glioma and 19 (46.3%) with non-glioma tumors experienced a grade ≥3 AE. The most common grade ≥3 AEs among patients with glioma were seizure [4 (7.7%)] and increased alanine aminotransferase [3 (5.8%)] and aspartate aminotransferase [2 (3.8%)]. In the glioma cohort, 2 (3.8%) patients discontinued because of AEs and 7 (13.5%) required a dose reduction due to AEs. Treatment-related AEs were reported in 38 (73.1%) patients with glioma and 26 (63.4%) with non-glioma tumors. There were no treatment-related deaths.</p>

                <p>With 75% of events reported, the median PFS in the overall glioma population was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.7–12.9; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In patients with nonenhancing glioma, the median PFS was 36.8 months (95% CI, 11.2–40.8), with 59% of events reported and 6 of 9 censored patients remaining on treatment (range of PFS for these 6 patients, 33.2–49.6 months). In patients with enhancing glioma, the median PFS was 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.8–6.5). Efficacy results for the non-glioma cohort are provided in the Supplementary Results.</p>

              <p>Standard therapy for patients with LGGs includes maximally safe surgical tumor resection, with additional radiation and chemotherapy for high-risk tumors (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>). This treatment is not curative and most patients with LGG suffer considerable morbidity and premature death (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 9</xref>). There remains an urgent need to develop novel treatment paradigms. Our study describes the first-in-human evaluation of vorasidenib, a dual <italic toggle="yes">mIDH1/2</italic> inhibitor specifically developed for increased blood–brain barrier penetrance, in glioma. Vorasidenib was associated with a favorable safety profile at doses &lt;100 mg once daily in this previously treated glioma population, with many patients remaining on treatment after several years of continuous treatment. On the basis of safety and pharmacokinetic data from this study, doses of 50 mg once daily and 10 mg once daily were tested in a subsequent perioperative phase I study in patients with nonenhancing glioma (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03343197). Preliminary data from that study confirmed sufficient central nervous system concentrations of vorasidenib 50 mg once daily and &gt;90% reduction in intratumoral 2-HG concentrations compared with untreated controls, indicating near complete inhibition of the enzyme (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). On the basis of the findings from these phase I studies, a vorasidenib dose of 50 mg once daily was selected for further study in m<italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> glioma.</p>
              <p>Vorasidenib showed preliminary activity in patients with nonenhancing glioma, with an objective response rate (CR + PR + mR) of 18% (one PR, three mR) and a median PFS of 36.8 months. Although comparisons with historical data are difficult to make due to differences in patient populations and the heterogeneity of prior treatments in this recurrent patient population, the median PFS for patients with nonenhancing disease in our study compares favorably with outcomes reported for cytotoxic therapies (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30, 31</xref>). Despite lacking historical MRI scans for all patients, sustained tumor shrinkage was observed in multiple patients with nonenhancing glioma with vorasidenib treatment. In contrast, there was no indication of antitumor activity of vorasidenib in patients with enhancing tumors (no objective responses; PFS, 3.6 months), reminiscent of our earlier findings with the mIDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The lack of single-agent antitumor efficacy of vorasidenib in patients with enhancing gliomas may be due to the presence of additional genetic alterations in these tumors that can bypass the need for the mIDH enzyme for tumor maintenance. Although this explanation seems plausible, given the general association between contrast enhancement and genetic tumor evolution in LGG (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), we are unable to address this question in our current study because our protocol did not mandate a tumor biopsy and genomic sequencing immediately preceding study enrollment.</p>
              <p>A watch-and-wait approach following surgery remains a treatment option for patients with low-risk LGG. Given the acute and long-term toxicities associated with—and additional genetic alterations at disease recurrence resulting from—alkylating chemotherapy and radiation treatment for glioma (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9, 10, 33</xref>), there is an opportunity to introduce a targeted therapy against a potential driver <italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> mutation during the active observation period, in the hopes of delaying more toxic therapies and preserving quality of life for a younger patient population. The favorable safety profile and single-agent activity of vorasidenib in recurrent, progressive nonenhancing glioma in our current study support the further exploration of vorasidenib in the earliest stages of m<italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> LGG, compared with a watch-and-wait approach. To that end, vorasidenib (50 mg once daily) is being tested versus placebo in the ongoing, randomized, phase III INDIGO study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04164901). The INDIGO study is enrolling patients with recurrent grade II nonenhancing m<italic toggle="yes">IDH</italic> glioma treated with surgery only, and will seek to offer additional insight into the antitumor activity of vorasidenib at an early stage of disease.</p>
