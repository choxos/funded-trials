                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Impaired movement preparation of both anticipatory postural adjustments and goal directed movement as shown by a marked reduction in the incidence of StartReact responses during a standing reaching task was reported in individuals with stroke. We tested how transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the region of premotor areas (PMAs) and primary motor area (M1) affect movement planning and preparation of a standing reaching task in individuals with stroke.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Each subject performed two sessions of tDCS over the lesioned hemisphere on two different days: cathodal tDCS over PMAs and anodal tDCS over M1. Movement planning and preparation of anticipatory postural adjustment-reach sequence was examined by startReact responses elicited by a loud acoustic stimulus of 123 dB. Kinetic, kinematic, and electromyography data were recorded to characterize anticipatory postural adjustment-reach movement response.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Anodal tDCS over M1 led to significant increase of startReact responses incidence at loud acoustic stimulus time point − 500 ms. Increased trunk involvement during movement execution was found after anodal M1 stimulation compared to PMAs stimulation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The findings provide novel evidence that impairments in movement planning and preparation as measured by startReact responses for a standing reaching task can be mitigated in individuals with stroke by the application of anodal tDCS over lesioned M1 but not cathodal tDCS over PMAs. This is the first study to show that stroke-related deficits in movement planning and preparation can be improved by application of anodal tDCS over lesioned M1.</p>

              <p id="Par15">StartReact (SR) responses triggered by a loud acoustic stimulus (LAS) during the planning and preparation of goal intended actions have been used to probe the state of brainstem neuronal excitability related to posture and movement sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Abnormal posture and movement planning and preparation as shown by an absence of SR responses during standing reaching have been found in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Premotor areas (PMAs) such as supplementary motor areas and premotor cortex are thought to be involved in posture and movement planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In preparation for a movement, the neural pathways originating from PMAs to the spinal cord via the reticular formation modulate spinal circuitry through inhibitory effects in order to prevent premature release of the movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous studies also suggested that damage to the premotor cortex following stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or temporary inhibition by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the supplementary motor areas of healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] impair the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) preparation during voluntary stepping. Furthermore, animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have shown the activation in neurons in subcortical pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) were related to the APAs prior to the reaching movement. The signals for the APAs were possibly generated from higher cortical level such as PMAs via cortico-reticular pathway to the PMRF. We proposed that PMAs normally have a modulatory role in SR responses through inhibitory input to brainstem motor circuits and/or spinal cord via the PMRF. Hence, abnormal hyperexcitability in PMAs due to chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] may lead to excessive inhibition of the PMRF and/or spinal cord resulting in an absence of and/or reduced magnitude of SR responses and a disruption of the normal sequencing between posture and movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Cortical excitability can be modulated by the application of weak continuous direct electrical current over a specific location of the head by noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Depending on the direct current polarity, tDCS can either up-regulate neuronal excitability using anodal tDCS or down-regulate it using cathodal tDCS by hyperpolarizing or depolarizing the membrane potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of applying tDCS over M1 on arm, hand, and lower limb motor performance in individuals with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, only one recent study demonstrated that SR response in ankle dorsiflexion, wrist flexion, and automatic postural responses could be facilitated by applying anodal tDCS over M1 in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. No studies have used tDCS over PMAs as a target for neuromodulation therapy to augment posture and movement planning, preparation, and execution following stroke.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The purpose of this study was to determine the modulatory role of the PMAs on SR responses following cathodal tDCS over PMAs in persons with stroke. Knowing that PMAs have projections to the M1, we included anodal tDCS over M1 as a control condition to validate that PMAs stimulation has additional modulatory effects. Our hypothesis was that applying cathodal tDCS over PMAs will reduce the neuronal excitability in PMAs thereby helping to improve posture and movement planning and preparation in persons with stroke, as measured by increased incidence and faster onset of the SR responses.</p>

Inclusion criteria were unilateral cortical or white matter subcortical stroke, age 40 years and older, ≥ 6 months post ischemic stroke or ≥ 12 months post hemorrhagic stroke, residual arm hemiparesis as indicated by Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] score between 20 and 65, and having the ability to perform reaching movements with the paretic arm in standing without an assistive device. Exclusion criteria included stroke involving bilateral hemisphere, brainstem or cerebellum, any medical condition precluding participation in testing, and other health conditions affecting balance and upper extremity movement function beyond the effects of stroke. Participants were also excluded if they did not meet the TMS safety criterion including having implantable medical devices, history of seizures, taking medications to reduce anxiety, sedatives, and seizure, and pregnancy. All participants gave written informed consent to participate, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland Baltimore (HP-00064894). Participants were recruited from October 2016 and the data collection of all participants was completed by Oct 2017. There was no deviation from the study protocol. The study was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrial.gov due to the lack of knowledge about trial registration before enrolment of participants.

                <p id="Par19">Motor hotspots were located by using single-pulse TMS delivered by a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Company, Dyfed, UK) using a figure-of-eight coil (70-mm) for biceps brachii and a double cone coil (110-mm) for tibialis anterior. For subjects who had absent motor evoked potentials (MEP) of the affected side, the mirrored location of the nonaffected side hotspot was used to determine the hotspot for the affected side. The active motor threshold was determined while the subjects exerted a force of 20% maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of each muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The active motor threshold was defined as the lowest stimulus intensity that could evoke a MEP (about 200 μV) in 5 out of 10 consecutive trials during isometric contraction of the tested muscle. A hand-held dynamometer (Chatillon DFX-200 Digital Force Gauge, Itin Scale Co., Inc., Brooklyn, NY) was used to measure the MVIC. The MVIC is defined as the average of 3 measurements of each tested muscle. For each MEP measurement, the assessor holding the dynamometer visually verified if the force reached the level of 20% MVIC and instructed the subjects to hold the level of force exertion. Changes in cortical excitability as measured by MEPs were measured 10 times at the hotspots of the biceps brachii and tibialis anterior with an intensity of the 120% of active motor threshold at 20% of MVIC. A neuronavigation system (Brainsight Version 2, Rogue Research Inc., Montreal, Canada) was used to confirm that the same hotspots were used.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par35">The findings that anodal tDCS over M1 was more effective in increasing the SR incidence than cathodal tDCS over PMAs in individuals with stroke was unexpected. It has been suggested that PMRF is critically involved in generating posture responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in the SR responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].We proposed that the abnormal hyperexcitability in PMAs due to chronic stroke may lead to excessive inhibitory input via the cortico-reticulospinal pathway, and consequently impairs posture and movement planning, preparation, and execution. Therefore, down-regulating the hyperexcitability in PMAs by applying cathodal tDCS over these regions may restore the inhibitory input from PMAs to the PMRF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a). However, opposite to our hypothesis, our findings showed an increase in SR incidence and a decrease in muscle activation onset latency when the LAS was applied at − 500 ms after anodal M1 stimulation compared to cathodal PMAs stimulation in individuals with stroke (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>b). This is consistent in part with Nonnekes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] who showed a decrease in reaction time irrespective of whether or not an LAS was given at the imperative stimulus after anodal M1 stimulation. The author concluded that the subcortical structures can possibly be facilitated by an enhancement of the cortico-reticular drive or by direct excitations caused by the applied current. One animal study also showed that tDCS over the motor cortex of anesthetized cats facilitated subcortical structures either directly or indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, Wagner and colleagues showed possible direct subcortical facilitation from the spread of current during tDCS application and importantly the current density distributions were different in the stroke model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is possible that application of anodal tDCS over M1 facilitates directly or indirectly the subcortical structures such as PMRF. With our stimulation paradigm, rather than remediating the excessive inhibitory input from the PMAs onto the subcortical brainstem by applying cathodal tDCS over PMAs, the direct or indirect subcortical facilitation from anodal tDCS over the region of M1 may be more effective modulating brainstem neuronal excitability and in turn improving movement planning and preparation. Another plausible explanation is that given that PMAs include a larger cortical area compared to M1, a higher intensity or longer duration of tDCS is required to induce changes in PMAs. Although the findings from this study are not consistent with our hypothesis, our conceptual model does not mutually exclude the possible subcortical facilitation mechanisms.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of proposed neuromodulation of <bold>a</bold> cathodal tDCS over PMAs and <bold>b</bold> anodal tDCS over M1 related to posture and movement planning and preparation in individuals with stroke. In <bold>a</bold>, we hypothesized that cathodal tDCS over PMAs would down-regulate the hyperexcitability in this region and consequently restore the excessive inhibitory input (red dashed arrow) from PMAs to the PMRF via cortico-reticulospinal tract. In <bold>b</bold>, based on our findings, it is possible that application of anodal tDCS over M1 facilitates the subcortical PMRF via the cortico-reticular drive (green arrow) or direct excitations caused by the applied current</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12984_2020_799_Fig10_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par36">Another factor that influenced the effect of tDCS on the incidence of SR response was the LAS timing. A greater increase in the incidence of SR responses following anodal M1 stimulation was only found at the LAS time point − 500 ms but not at − 200 ms. One possible explanation is that during the time course of movement planning and preparation, the excitability at the cortical and subcortical levels changes gradually. During preparation for movement there are two pathways controlling spinal motorneuronal circuitry in order to preplan the movement and avoid premature release of the movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The excitatory input which originates from PMAs and relays via M1 to spinal cord transmits task-related information while the global inhibition originates from PMAs and relays via subcortical level to spinal circuity (i.e., cortico-reticulospinal pathway) prevents premature release of a motor action. It has been suggested that the corticospinal excitability during movement planning and preparation undergoes progressive changes due to global inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The dynamic changes of inhibitory inputs onto spinal motorneuronal circuitry during movement planning and preparation may lead to differential effects of tDCS on the incidence of SR responses depending on the LAS timing.</p>
              <p id="Par37">There were no detectable neurophysiological change of MEP amplitudes following PMAs and M1 stimulation but posture and movement planning, preparation, and execution were modified after tDCS. One possible reason for non-significant changes in MEP amplitudes is inter-individuals response variability. Previous studies have reported that the effects of tDCS on MEP amplitudes elicited by single-pulse TMS as a measure for corticospinal excitability are highly variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Another possible reason is that the changes in cortical excitability after tDCS are the result of intracortical facilitation or inhibition not corticospinal excitability as shown in MEP amplitudes elicited by single-pulse TMS. One study by Nitsche et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] used paired-pulse TMS with different interstimulus interval and found that following tDCS intracortical inhibition and facilitation were modified. This may suggest that single-pulsed MEP amplitude may not be a preferred indicator of neurophysiological changes obtained by tDCS.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Our findings show a differential effect of cathodal PMAs vs anodal M1 stimulation on trunk contribution during reaching execution across LAS conditions. Generally, we found that there was a greater increase in trunk movement after anodal M1 compared to cathodal PMAs stimulation. One possible explanation is that the anodal electrode placement over M1 stimulation included the trunk representation since it was at the midpoint of hotspots of biceps brachii and tibialis anterior. Based on the homunculus map of a human brain, the area representing the trunk is in the middle of arm and leg areas. Thus, the anodal M1 stimulation may also affect trunk performance. Another plausible explanation is the subcortical facilitation described in the previous section. Since the PMRF is known to be involved in generating compensatory postural responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the direct or indirect facilitation induced by anodal M1 stimulation may increase the excitability in the PMRF and subsequently alter trunk involvement during reaching.</p>
              <p id="Par39">One major challenge of our study was that we aimed to modulate PMAs and M1 separately. Even though small tDCS electrodes (15 cm<sup>2</sup>) were used over both target areas in an attempt to increase the focality of stimulation, the possibility that during PMAs stimulation, M1 region was also partly stimulated can not be ruled out, and vice versa. Nevertheless, differential effects of cathodal PMAs vs. anodal M1 stimulation on variables of posture, movement planning, preparation and execution were demonstrated in the present study and provide credible evidence that modulation of these two areas by tDCS is plausible. Another limitation is that the absence of detectable MEP amplitudes changes following tDCS. The difficulty to record MEPs data in 20–30% of our stroke subjects, inter-individuals response variability, and inability to capture changes in cortical excitability by single-pulsed TMS protocol possibly contributed to nonsignificant changes in MEP amplitudes. Future studies should also consider measuring cortical excitability changes following tDCS with a more comprehensive assessment by TMS such as cortical silent period in order to detect the modulation effect of tDCS.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par40">The present results show that following the application of cathodal and anodal tDCS over the region of the PMAs or M1, respectively, “stimulation”-specific changes were observed in posture and movement planning, preparation and execution in individuals with stroke. We also provide novel evidence that stroke-related deficits in movement planning and preparation as shown by an abnormal absence of SR responses can be improved by application of anodal tDCS over lesioned M1 and the enhancement effects are depending on the timing of the LAS. It is possible that either direct or indirect subcortical facilitation resulting from the anodal tDCS over M1 may offer a new neuromodulatory target to remediate the imbalance in neuronal excitability between PMAs and subcortical brainstem level, which in turn improve the posture and movement planning, preparation, and execution in individuals with stroke.</p>
