                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are common malignancies caused by carcinogens, including tobacco and alcohol, or infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway are effective against unresectable recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. Here, we explored the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in at-risk resectable HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC in the neoadjuvant setting.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The phase I/II CheckMate 358 trial in virus-associated cancers assessed neoadjuvant nivolumab in patients with previously untreated, resectable HPV-positive or HPV-negative HNSCC. Patients received nivolumab 240‚Äâmg intravenously on days 1 and 15, with surgery planned by day 29. Safety/tolerability (primary endpoint) was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and surgical delays. Radiographic response was measured before surgery using RECIST v1.1, adapted for a single post-nivolumab evaluation. Pathologic specimens were examined for treatment response using immune-based criteria.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>From November 2015 to December 2017, 52 patients with AJCC (seventh edition) stage III‚ÄìIV resectable HNSCC received neoadjuvant nivolumab (26 HPV-positive, 26 HPV-negative). Any-grade treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 19 patients (73.1%) and 14 patients (53.8%) in the HPV-positive and HPV-negative cohorts, respectively; grade 3‚Äì4 TRAEs occurred in five (19.2%) and three patients (11.5%), respectively. No patient had a protocol-defined TRAE-related surgical delay (&gt;4 weeks). Thirty-eight patients were reported as undergoing complete surgical resection, 10 had a planned post-nivolumab biopsy instead of definitive surgery due to a protocol misinterpretation, and four did not undergo surgery or biopsy, including two with tumor progression. Radiographic response rates in 49 evaluable patients were 12.0% and 8.3% in the HPV-positive and HPV-negative cohorts, respectively. There were no complete pathologic responses by site or central review in operated patients. Among 17 centrally evaluable HPV-positive tumors, one (5.9%) achieved major pathological response and three (17.6%) achieved partial pathologic response (pPR); among 17 centrally evaluable HPV-negative tumors, one (5.9%) achieved pPR.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Neoadjuvant nivolumab was generally safe and induced pathologic regressions in HPV-positive (23.5%) and HPV-negative (5.9%) tumors. Combinatorial neoadjuvant treatment regimens, and continued postoperative therapy for high-risk tumors, are warranted in future trials to enhance the efficacy of this approach.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are among the most common malignancies worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Tobacco use and alcohol consumption are well-known primary risk factors for HNSCC.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> More recently, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as an increasingly significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), with an estimated prevalence of &gt;70% in OPC in North America.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCCs are genetically distinct: HPV-negative HNSCC is characterized by genetic complexity, nearly universal <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations, frequent alterations in cell cycle regulator oncogenes, and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); in contrast, HPV-positive HNSCC is associated with wild-type <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, activating <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations, lower EGFR expression, and upregulation of the tumor suppressor protein p16, which is widely used as a surrogate marker of HPV infection in OPC.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6‚Äì8</xref></p>
              <p>Likely as a result of these genetic and potentially immunologic differences, HPV-positive tumors have been associated with improved prognosis and better treatment response.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9‚Äì11</xref> Moreover, as smoking and HPV infection are not mutually exclusive risk factors, tobacco exposure is associated with a worse prognosis even in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Although HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCCs have distinct genetic profiles,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> there is conflicting evidence on whether their respective overall tumor mutational burdens (TMBs) differ substantially.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14‚Äì16</xref> Due to the distinct etiologic and prognostic differences based on HPV status, we hypothesized that enrollment and analysis of these two different subgroups might yield insights into genetic, transcriptomic, and immunologic characteristics of pathologic and clinical response.</p>
              <p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting interactions of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have emerged as effective treatments for some patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, with improved efficacy and safety versus standard-of-care regimens.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17‚Äì21</xref> In studies of anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or anti-PD-L1 (durvalumab) monotherapy for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, objective response rates (ORRs) ranged from 13.3% to 17.9%, but observed benefits over standard regimens were most pronounced for overall survival (OS), which was generally doubled at 12 months.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17‚Äì21</xref> Subgroup analyses showed that ORR benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitors was generally greater in patients having tumors with higher PD-L1 expression levels<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17‚Äì21</xref>; however, with nivolumab, OS benefit was seen regardless of PD-L1 status.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Similarly, ORR was higher in HPV-positive disease, but OS benefit was observed regardless of tumor HPV status.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Since response kinetics differ based on PD-L1 and HPV status, on-treatment tissue analyses paired with functional anatomic imaging would be valuable.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p>Because of the benefits observed with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in the recurrent/metastatic setting, there is increased interest in investigating immunotherapy earlier in the course of HNSCC. Preoperative targeting of micrometastatic disease using neoadjuvant immunotherapy might prevent local or distant disease recurrence in patients with resectable advanced HNSCC, and potentially reduce the extent of surgical resection.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 therapies have been explored in other tumor types,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24‚Äì27</xref> information in HNSCC is limited. Three small trials, all conducted at one or two centers, with two focused exclusively on HPV-negative HNSCC and one on OPC (86% HPV-positive), have shown encouraging early results.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28 29</xref> Here, we report results from the CheckMate 358 trial, which is the first to assess the safety and potential efficacy of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC cohorts.</p>

                <title>Study design, patients, and treatment</title>
                <p>CheckMate 358 is a global multicenter, multicohort phase I/II trial of nivolumab (alone or in combination regimens) in recurrent/metastatic or neoadjuvant settings for patients with virus-associated malignancies. Two neoadjuvant HNSCC cohorts, including 52 patients with HPV-positive or HPV-negative tumors, were enrolled at 10 sites in the USA and Europe. Patients were ‚â•18 years of age with newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, and/or larynx, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0‚Äì1. Tumors were amenable to pretreatment biopsy and deemed surgically resectable, with a requirement for ‚â•T1 primary lesions and ‚â•N1 nodal disease.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Patients with active brain metastases, prior malignancy within ‚â§3 years, autoimmune disorders, conditions requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or prior exposure to antitumor vaccines or T-cell modulating drugs were excluded.</p>
                <p>Before enrollment, tumor HPV status was determined at study sites or centrally in all patients using p16INK4a (p16) immunohistochemistry (IHC, n=46), HPV in situ hybridization (n=4), or PCR (n=2). p16 IHC was deemed positive if &gt;70% of tumor cells showed strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Tested samples were derived from the primary tumor or a lymph node metastasis.</p>
                <p>Patients received nivolumab 240‚Äâmg intravenously on days 1 and 15, with surgery scheduled on day 29 (¬±7 days). Administration of the second nivolumab dose could be delayed¬†‚â§7‚Äâdays. Postoperative (adjuvant) treatment was allowed at the investigator‚Äôs discretion if nivolumab-related toxicities had resolved to grade¬†‚â§1. For unresectable recurrent/metastatic disease occurring¬†‚â§12 months postoperatively or the end of adjuvant therapy (whichever is later), medically eligible patients could resume on-study nivolumab treatment every 2 weeks for¬†‚â§2 years.</p>

              <sec id="s2-2">
                <title>Study endpoints</title>
                <p>The primary endpoint was safety/tolerability of neoadjuvant nivolumab, evaluated by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and surgical delays (protocol-defined as a TRAE-related delay &gt;4 weeks from scheduled surgery date). Exploratory endpoints included pathologic response (assessed by study investigators (site review), or by a head and neck pathologist (SIC) from UPMC with independent subset review by a pathologist (JMT) from the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (central review)), radiographic response (change in sum of diameters of target lesions measured once before surgery using adapted Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1),<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> recurrence-free survival (RFS, time from surgery to recurrence per investigator or death from any cause, whichever occurred first), OS (time from first nivolumab dose to date last known alive or death), and immunologic changes in blood and tumor.</p>
                <p>Response assessment, event schedules, survival monitoring, and follow-up were conducted as previously described for the neoadjuvant Merkel cell carcinoma cohort of CheckMate 358.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> AEs were assessed per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4 by system organ class and MedDRA preferred terms.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The CheckMate 358 trial included a separate neoadjuvant cohort for patients with HPV-positive gynecologic cancers, in which neoadjuvant nivolumab could be followed by biopsy and definitive standard-of-care chemoradiation rather than surgical resection, at the discretion of the investigator. This was misinterpreted by two investigators to pertain to the neoadjuvant HNSCC cohorts as well, leading to approximately 20% of patients receiving planned post-nivolumab tumor biopsies instead of curative-intent surgical resection.</p>

                <p>Site pathology reviews categorized patients as achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) or non-pCR. Central review categorized patients as achieving pCR (no residual viable tumor (RVT) on H&amp;E evaluation of completely resected tumor specimens including all sampled lymph nodes), major pathologic response (MPR, ‚â§10%‚ÄâRVT), or pathologic partial response (pPR, &gt;10% to 50%‚ÄâRVT),<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> based on immune-related pathologic response criteria.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> Tumors undergoing planned biopsy without complete resection, due to a misinterpretation of the protocol, were also evaluated for pathologic response using major pathologic response on biopsy (MPRbx) criteria.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> MPRbx criteria were developed to assess early on-treatment tumor biopsies from patients with advanced unresectable melanoma receiving immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and correlated significantly with OS.</p>
                <p>Tumor PD-L1 expression was evaluated in recent archival or fresh pretreatment biopsies using automated IHC (PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay; Dako, an Agilent Technologies, Inc. company, Santa Clara, CA, USA). PD-L1-positive tumors had ‚â•1% of tumor cells with cell surface expression at any intensity. PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and/or tumor-associated immune cells was determined using a combined positive score (CPS; number of PD-L1-positive cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) /total number of viable tumor cells√ó100).</p>

                <p>Whole-genome sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to assess TMB, defined as the total number of missense mutations per exome within a tumor sample relative to normal host tissue. Tumor and normal tissue samples were sequenced at a minimum of 50√ó and 25√ó coverage, respectively. A minimum of 20√ó coverage was achieved for ‚â•80% of target bases.

Gene expression was profiled by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) using pretreatment tumor samples. The samples were sequenced to a minimum depth of 85‚Äâmillion paired end reads with 50 base pair read length. Sequencing quality was assessed using the Picard QC tool kit (V.1.14, <ext-link xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/" ext-link-type="uri">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Samples were required to have ‚â•85% of total reads aligned to the genome.

Any-grade TRAEs occurring between the first dose of neoadjuvant nivolumab and 100 days after the last dose were reported in 19 patients (73.1%) in the HPV-positive and in 14 patients (53.8%) in the HPV-negative cohorts (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S1 and S2</xref>); the most common any-grade event was fatigue, occurring in six (23.1%) and five (19.2%) patients, respectively. Grade 3‚Äì4 TRAEs were reported for five (19.2%) and three patients (11.5%), respectively; two (7.7%) and four (15.4%) had treatment-related serious AEs. No patient in either cohort discontinued nivolumab due to a TRAE, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Any-grade select TRAEs (AEs with potential immunologic cause) occurred in four (15.4%) and five patients (19.2%) in the HPV-positive and HPV-negative cohorts, respectively; one grade 3‚Äì4 event occurred in each cohort (gastrointestinal (colitis) in the HPV-positive cohort and skin-related (maculo-papular rash) in the HPV-negative cohort; <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S1 and S2</xref>).</p>

The remaining four patients, all with HPV-negative tumors, did not undergo surgery or biopsy due to non-treatment-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (n=1), consent withdrawal before surgery (n=1), or rapid tumor progression (n=2).</p>

Furthermore, an operative delay of 3‚Äì4 weeks has previously been shown to be safe in HNSCC.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42‚Äì44</xref> The rationale for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition in at-risk resectable tumors is supported by an emerging body of clinical evidence across various cancer types.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24‚Äì27 45</xref> In addition to the potential for generating enhanced and sustained antitumor immunity and clearance of micrometastases in treatment-na√Øve patients, neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 offers the possibility of pre-surgical tumor down-staging, evaluation of pathologic response as a potential predictor of long-term outcomes, and availability of sufficient on-treatment tissues for in-depth biomarker and mechanistic studies.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> However, this must be balanced with the possibility of undue surgical delay, particularly in patients experiencing TRAEs and/or tumor progression during the treatment ‚Äúwindow.‚Äù</p>
              <p>In CheckMate 358, patients with resectable stage III‚ÄìIV HNSCC received nivolumab for ~4 weeks preoperatively. There were no unexpected TRAE-related surgical delays, consistent with previously published reports of various neoadjuvant regimens of anti-PD-(L)1 with or without anti-CTLA-4 in HNSCC.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28 29</xref> However, in the current study, four of 26 (15%) patients with HPV-negative tumors did not undergo surgery due to consent withdrawal, disease progression, or unrelated death. Furthermore, due to a protocol misinterpretation by some investigators, approximately 20% of patients did not undergo curative-intent post-nivolumab surgical resection but had a tumor biopsy instead (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary figure S1 and tables S4 and S5</xref>). This reduced the number of specimens eligible for conventional pathologic response determination, although innovative MPRbx criteria were applied to evaluate pathologic changes in these specimens. Notably, in patients undergoing curative-intent resection, none achieved a pCR; one MPR and three pPRs were observed in the HPV-positive cohort (23.5% pathologic response rate among centrally evaluated cases), and only one pPR was observed in the HPV-negative cohort (5.9%). Although case numbers are small, this suggests that HPV-positive tumors display an early and more frequent response to nivolumab monotherapy than HPV-negative tumors, which was also observed clinically in the CheckMate 141 study of nivolumab for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> However, the lack of pCRs in our study in HNSCC contrasts with studies in other cancers showing substantial pCR rates, some of which employed longer neoadjuvant treatment intervals.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> For instance, a trial of nivolumab therapy for 4 weeks preoperatively in non-small-cell lung cancer yielded a pCR rate of 10%<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; nivolumab administered for 8 weeks preoperatively in melanoma yielded a pCR rate of 25%<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; and pembrolizumab given for 9 weeks before surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer mediated pCRs in 42% of patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>Three other reports of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade in HNSCC have recently been published.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28 29</xref> Relatively small numbers of patients (n=14‚Äâto n=36) received anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy at one or two medical centers in each study, for 2‚Äì8 weeks before surgery; in addition, two of these trials included a randomized combination therapy arm with anti-CTLA-4 agents. Each trial focused on either HPV-negative<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28</xref> or HPV-positive tumors,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and median follow-up ranged from 14 to 22 months. Two studies employed a study-specific ‚Äúpathologic tumor response‚Äù scoring system based on tumor necrosis and histiocytic reaction,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28</xref> and all three recorded pathologic response separately in the primary tumor or lymph node metastases. In contrast, the current study treated 52 patients at 10 medical centers, including equally sized cohorts of patients with HPV-positive or HPV-negative HNSCC who were followed for a median of 38 and 28 months, respectively. Furthermore, we used widely accepted methods for scoring immune-mediated pathologic response in the primary tumor and all sampled lymph nodes,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> based on percent residual viable tumor within a defined tumor regression bed. While such methodologic variations make cross-study comparisons difficult, a paucity of substantial pathologic responses after anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy (i.e., ‚â§50% residual viable tumor, assessing all resected tissues) is evident across these trials.</p>
              <p>In general, neoadjuvant studies of immune checkpoint blockade in other cancer types have shown pathologic response exceeding radiographic response. However, in the current study in HNSCC, both the RECIST radiographic response rate and the pathologic response rate were low. This is consistent with evidence that the tumor microenvironment of HNSCC may be particularly immunosuppressive.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41 46</xref> These results suggest that combinatorial neoadjuvant therapies are needed to mediate more robust HNSCC regression during the pre-surgical window. The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab yielded numerically higher rates of pathologic and radiographic response than nivolumab monotherapy in one study,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> although durvalumab plus tremelimumab did not appear to provide an advantage over durvalumab alone in another trial.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Ongoing and future HNSCC trials will leverage additional neoadjuvant immunotherapy combinations based on the biology of this disease. Such regimens may include chemoradiotherapy, EGFR inhibition (cetuximab), inflammatory agonists (TLR, STING, etc), natural killer cell targeting agents, and other checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-TIM-3 and anti-LAG-3.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 47</xref></p>
              <p>While pathologic response may provide an early surrogate endpoint for efficacy, the clinical success of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is ultimately measured by RFS and OS. In our trial, there were few pathologic responders, and there was no clear association between pathologic response and RFS or OS (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S4 and S5</xref>). Twenty-four‚Äâmonths post-surgery, RFS rates were 88% vs 54% for the HPV-positive and HPV-negative cohorts, respectively. We observed similarly divergent results associated with HPV status for OS. These substantial survival differences may not be surprising in previously untreated, locally advanced disease. For instance, in a study of chemoradiation for stage III‚ÄìIV locally advanced oropharyngeal SCC, the 3-year progression-free survival rates were 73.7% vs 43.4%, and the 3-year OS rates were 82.4% vs 57.1%, for patients with HPV-positive vs HPV-negative tumors, respectively.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Similar differences based on HPV status were observed for RFS and OS in another study of patients with oropharyngeal SCC undergoing surgery.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Differences based on HPV status have also been observed for ORR using anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11 18 49</xref> Such differences may relate to the more highly immune-reactive microenvironment found in HPV-positive HNSCC containing strongly immunogenic tumor-associated viral neoantigens.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 46</xref> Thus, in view of the modest pathologic responses seen in CheckMate 358, it is unclear how the brief period of neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy in HNSCC (which has ~15%‚ÄâORR in recurrent/metastatic disease) may have contributed to the observed long-term clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>Clearly, more effective treatment strategies for HNSCC are needed. In addition to evaluating combinatorial neoadjuvant therapies as mentioned previously, more effective application of post-surgical therapies should be considered in efforts to optimize survival outcomes in HNSCC. For instance, Uppaluri <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> treated patients with high-risk HPV-negative tumors (positive surgical resection margins or extranodal extension after receiving neoadjuvant pembrolizumab) with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus pembrolizumab on-study.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> With this adaptive treatment strategy, only 17% of high-risk tumors relapsed within a year, suggesting an improvement over historical data. These results imply that more aggressive neoadjuvant/adjuvant immunotherapy regimens are warranted for HPV-negative HNSCC, consistent with the generally more aggressive approach taken when treating this HNSCC subtype. Multimodal treatment approaches in earlier stages of disease, integrating neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies, will likely be needed to achieve further advances in immunotherapy for patients with HNSCC.</p>
