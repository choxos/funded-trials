                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>To evaluate the mechanisms of how therapeutic upregulation of the transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPÎ±), prevents tumor progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in different mouse tumor models.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Experimental Design:</title>
                  <p>We conducted a phase I trial in 36 patients with HCC (NCT02716012) who received sorafenib as part of their standard care, and were given therapeutic C/EBPÎ± small activating RNA (saRNA; MTL-CEBPA) as either neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. In the preclinical setting, the effects of MTL-CEBPA were assessed in several mouse models, including BNL-1ME liver cancer, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and colon adenocarcinoma (MC38).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>MTL-CEBPA treatment caused radiologic regression of tumors in 26.7% of HCC patients with an underlying viral etiology with 3 complete responders. MTL-CEBPA treatment in those patients caused a marked decrease in peripheral blood monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) numbers and an overall reduction in the numbers of protumoral M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Gene and protein analysis of patient leukocytes following treatment showed CEBPA activation affected regulation of factors involved in immune-suppressive activity. To corroborate this observation, treatment of all the mouse tumor models with MTL-CEBPA led to a reversal in the suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs, but not polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSC). The antitumor effects of MTL-CEBPA in these tumor models showed dependency on T cells. This was accentuated when MTL-CEBPA was combined with checkpoint inhibitors or with PMN-MDSCâtargeted immunotherapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>This report demonstrates that therapeutic upregulation of the transcription factor C/EBPÎ± causes inactivation of immune-suppressive myeloid cells with potent antitumor responses across different tumor models and in cancer patients. MTL-CEBPA is currently being investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in a phase I/Ib multicenter clinical study (NCT04105335).</p>

              <p>In this paper, we demonstrate preclinical data across a range of tumor types that establish the mechanism of action of MTL-CEBPA in modulating myeloid cells. The safety of combination treatment with sorafenib is confirmed in a phase Ib clinical trial that demonstrates a strong efficacy signal in a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma of viral etiology who are tyrosine kinase inhibitor naÃ¯ve. These data provide evidence for combination treatment with immunotherapies across other primary tumor types.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which are composed of monocytic (M-MDSC) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSC), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play an important role in immune suppression and tumor progression (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and are closely associated with negative clinical outcome in cancer (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Transcriptional factors regulating the function of myeloid cells represent an attractive targeting opportunity with broad effects on the function of these cells. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPÎ±) is involved in differentiation of myeloid cells as well as in proliferation, metabolism, and immunity (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). Deregulation of C/EBPÎ± has been reported in several solid tumors, including liver, breast, and lung (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This is in contrast to C/EBPÎ², which is upregulated in MDSCs and involved in their suppressive activity (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); C/EBPÎ± was found to be downregulated in MDSCs and, furthermore, C/EBPÎ± knockout mice displayed greater MDSC tumor infiltration (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Upregulation of C/EBPÎ± inhibits tumor growth in rodent liver cancer models; however, it is still unclear if this is mediated directly on tumor cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>). We have developed a first-in-class small activating RNA (saRNA) therapeutic (MTL-CEBPA) comprising of a SMARTICLES liposomal nanoparticle encapsulating CEBPA-51, a 2â²O-Me RNA oligonucleotide duplex designed to specifically target and upregulate transcription of the <italic toggle="yes">CEBPA</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The compound demonstrated safety in a phase I clinical trial (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). However, the mechanism of the antitumor effects of MTL-CEBPA, as well as its possible effects in cancer patients, remains unclear.</p>
              <p>Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has been the first-line systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for many years. Despite this, the overall survival benefit of sorafenib in previously untreated patients with preserved liver function, good performance status, and advanced disease, although statistically significant, remains disappointing (10.7 vs. 7.9 months; ref. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Recently, the immune-checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab, when combined with bevacizumab, a VEGF-specific monoclonal antibody, showed a one-year progression-free survival rate increase from 54.6% to 67.2% when compared with sorafenib in a phase III clinical trial (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This illustrates the need to search for novel combination therapeutics for patients with unresectable HCC. Because sorafenib is associated with increased MDSC infiltration, and is an identified mechanism for acquired resistance, we used this as a rationale for combining MTL-CEBPA with sorafenib. In this study, we evaluated the effect of MTL-CEBPA on the function of myeloid cells in patients with advanced HCC. We performed mechanistic studies in mouse tumor models and identified the mechanism of antitumor effect of MTL-CEBPA.</p>

                  <p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
                  <p>We report an international multicenter, noncomparative, open-label, phase Ib study in patients with advanced HCC to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MTL-CEBPA once weekly at 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in combination with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily administered to HCC patients either concomitantly or sequentially, in cohorts either tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naÃ¯ve or resistant. This study was conducted at 10 tertiary centers and university hospitals in three countries (Singapore, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom). Clinical trial information: NCT02716012.</p>
                  <p>Eligible patients were at least 16 years old with histologically confirmed advanced HCC with cirrhosis, or resulting from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with or without cirrhosis, and unsuitable for liver surgery and/or refractory to radiotherapy, ablation, and other therapies. Patients were required to have a ChildâPugh score of B8 or less and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0â1. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Supplementary Appendix SA. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol and amendments were approved by the relevant regulatory authority and each site's institutional review board or independent ethics committee.</p>
                  <p>MTL-CEBPA was administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. MTL-CEBPA dosing was preceded by corticosteroid and anti-histamine administration to minimize the risk of infusion reactions. Two doses of MTL-CEBPA were explored. Patient dosing was based on body surface area calculation on day 1 of each cycle. The recommended starting dose for sorafenib was 400 mg twice daily. For relevant algorithms for sorafenib dose modification, interruption, or stoppage, please see study protocol in Supplementary Material.</p>
                  <p>Each treatment cycle was 28 days and continued until disease progression. Seven days elapsed between the first dose of the first participant and the first dose of the subsequent participants in each dose cohort. Patients off treatment were followed up for survival every three months.</p>
                  <p>In the combination cohorts, MTL-CEBPA 90 or 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered once weekly on days 1, 8, and 15; sorafenib was initiated on day 1 of cycle 1 and continued for the duration of each cycle. In the sequential cohorts, MTL-CEBPA was administered at 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 for the first two cycles only and discontinued thereafter; sorafenib was initiated on day 1 of cycle 3 and continued for the complete duration of each cycle.</p>

                  <p>The dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were determined on the basis of the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) occurring in the first cycle (28 days). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A Safety Review Committee was convened to oversee safety, scientific integrity, and validity of the study. Safety and tolerability of MTL-CEBPA was evaluated in terms of frequency of AEs graded according to toxicity criteria (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE v 4.03).</p>

                  <p>The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of coadministering/sequentially administering MTL-CEBPA and sorafenib (frequency of AEs graded according to toxicity criteria) and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of MTL-CEBPA during these treatments (Cmax, Tmax, and AUC).</p>
                  <p>Additional outcome measures included determining the antitumor activity of MTL-CEBPA in combination with sorafenib as assessed by complete response rate and progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).</p>

                <p>Plasma samples for the analysis of CEBPA-51 were collected over the first dosing interval and for 72 hours after administration of the second dose. Due to the rapid degradation and elimination of free CEBPA-51 in plasma, the measured concentration of CEBPA-51 reflects the concentration of CEBPA-51 encapsulated in MTL-CEBPA nanoparticles. A fluorescently labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-probe, designed against the guide strand of CEBPA-51, was used to extract the single-stranded parent compound. RNA species are quantitated using anion-exchange HPLC and fluorescence detection. Plasma CEBPA-51 is expressed as Î¼g/mL of double-stranded RNA, and the lower limit of quantitation is 0.001 Î¼g/mL.</p>

                <p>The blood was processed within 30 minutes of collection. Briefly, following red blood lysis, the isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) were adjusted to a concentration of 20 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL with cold FACS staining buffer. Cell suspension (50 Î¼L), which was equivalent to 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells, was used per FACS staining in 50 Î¼L antibody cocktail with Brilliant Stain buffer comprising of (CD10, CD66b<sup>â</sup>; CD16; CD14, CD15, CD11b, LOX-1, HLA-DR, CD38, and DRAQ7). Together with the appropriate FMO controls and compensation bead set up, all mixtures were performed at 4Â°C in the dark for 15 minutes. All samples were washed with PBS and fixed BD Cytofix. Samples were resuspended in 500 Î¼L of cold FACS staining buffer and transferred through 30-Î¼m cell strainer into round bottom tubes ready for FACS analysis. All samples were analyzed with a BD LSRFortessa. All analyses were based on 60,000 events captured from 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells.</p>

                <p>H&amp;E staining was performed on 4-Î¼m-thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections for a preliminary tissue evaluation. Slides were scanned with the NanoZoomer-XR (Hamamatsu) to generate digital images (20Ã). A pathologist identified the tumor area and provided qualitative assessment. The multiplex IHC panels used were part of Immunoscore Suppressor Cells family (MDSC/Macrophages Brightplex; Neutrophils Brightplex; MacrophagesBrightplex). They were carried out on 4 FFPE biopsies to identify and quantify myeloid cell subsets in a patient's tumor microenvironment. The 4-Î¼m-thick unstained sections from the pre- and posttreated patients were stained in a Leica Bond RX autostainer (Leica Biosystems). Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated in the autostainer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antigen retrieval was performed with Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution #2 (Leica Biosystems), equivalent to EDTA pH 9.0, for detection of all biomarkers. Successive stainings were performed on the same FFPE slide. The primary antibodies used for the different Brightplex panels (Supplementary Table S4) were anti-CD68 (Abcam, catalog #ab213363), anti-CD163 (Bio-Rad, catalog #MCA1853), anti-LOX1 (Merck Millipore, catalog #MABS186), anti-CD11B (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog #49420S), anti-CD15 (BD Biosciences, catalog #555400), anti-CD14 (Cell Marque, catalog #114R-15), anti-S100A9 (Origene, catalog #UM800066), anti-IL10 (RandD Systems, catalog #MAB92101), anti-TNFÎ± (Proteintech, catalog #60291-1-Ig), anti-MPO (Abcam, catalog #ab93665), anti-IDO (Thermo Fisher, catalog #14-9750-82), anti-CD64 (Abcam, catalog #ab140779), anti-CD163 (Abcam, catalog #ab182422), anti-CD86 (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog #91882S), and anti-CD206 (R&amp;D Systems, catalog #MAB25341). Antibodies were diluted in Emerald antibody diluent (ESBE Scientifique; catalog #CMQ-936B09). The primary antibodies were detected using MACH 2 rabbit HRP polymer (Biocare, RHRP520L) or MACH 4 Universal HRP polymer as secondary antibody (Biocare, M4U534L). The labeling was visualized using aminoethyl carbazole (AEC Peroxidase Substrate Kit, Biocare, catalog #SK-4200; ImmPACT AMEC Red, Vector Lab, catalog #SK-4285) and hematoxylin counterstaining. A human tonsil specimen was used as control for all immune biomarker's detection using qualitative acceptance criteria [specificity, staining location (nucleus/membrane), cell type, and lack of background or unspecific staining]. After each individual staining, coverslipping was performed automatically by the workstation CTM6 with aqueous mounting (<italic toggle="yes">VectaMount AQ</italic>, VECTOR Laboratories, catalog #H-5501). The slides were digitalized in a NanoZoomer-XR scanner (Hamamatsu; Ã20) and a visual quality control carried out. Between each staining cycle of the sequential multiplex, the labeling was eliminated by incubating the samples in ethanol, and the antibody complexes were denatured using a denaturing buffer.</p>

Immobilized trypsin was then added to digest proteins into peptides. After overnight incubation with trypsin, peptides were desalted by solid phase extraction (SPE) using OASIS HLB columns (Waters) in a vacuum manifold following manufacturer's guidelines with the exception that the elution buffer contained 1M glycolic acid. Peptides were enriched from the resulting peptide mixture using TiO2 chromatography essentially as described (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) with the modifications (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

                <title>MTL-CEBPA treatment in patients with advanced HCC shows antitumor responses</title>
                <p>We previously reported the effects of MTL-CEBPA in a phase Ia clinical trial on 38 patients with advanced-stage liver cancer (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A recommended phase II dose was identified (130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly) where MTL-CEBPA was found to be safe, well tolerated, and demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity with evidence of target engagement. This prompted the initiation of a phase Ib dose escalation and cohort expansion study of MTL-CEBPA in combination with sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC. In this international multicenter, noncomparative, open-label, phase Ib study (NCT02716012), we evaluated safety, tolerability, and preliminary assessment of the activity of MTL-CEBPA 90â130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly in combination with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily administered to HCC patients either concomitantly or sequentially, in cohorts of either TKI-naÃ¯ve or -resistant patients. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old with histologically confirmed advanced HCC with cirrhosis, or resulting from NASH, with or without cirrhosis, and unsuitable for liver surgery and/or refractory to radiotherapy, ablation, and other therapies. Patients were required to have a ChildâPugh score of B8 or less and ECOG performance status of 0â1. Between November 2018 and January 2020, 36 patients were enrolled in the phase Ib trial. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the coadministration cohorts receiving MTL-CEBPA and sorafenib concomitantly during both treatment cycle 1 and cycle 2. Fourteen patients were enrolled into the sequential cohorts receiving MTL-CEBPA alone for 2 cycles followed by sorafenib alone in cycle 3 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table S1). The safety profile was acceptable (Supplementary Table S2) with no dose-limiting toxicities observed.</p>
                <p>Of the 36 patients with advanced HCC enrolled in the study, 15 were not previously treated with TKI and had established viral etiology of the disease (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Four patients in this group demonstrated objective response (OR) to the treatment with MTL-CEBPA in combination with sorafenib (26.7%). Remarkably, 3 patients had developed complete response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The responses were durable with complete eradication of target lesions at month 12 when compared with pretreatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), and a complete radiologic response of lung metastases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Notably, only 1 patient out of 11 with HCC of nonviral etiology had OR (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results compared favorably with contemporary OR rate in HCC patients treated with sorafenib (7%â11.9%; ref. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>

                <title>The effect of MTL-CEBPA therapy on myeloid cells in cancer patients</title>
                <p>We assessed the effect of MTL-CEBPA on gene and protein expression changes specifically in mononuclear cells. Because our preliminary studies demonstrated that MTL-CEBPA was rapidly taken up by myeloid cells, we evaluated cells isolated from blood before (day 0) and 24 hours (day 1) after the initial dose of MTL-CEBPA. No additional therapy was administrated during that time. Mononuclear cells were collected from 7 patients. Gene-expression profile was evaluated by NanoString analysis using the human PanCaner IO 360 panel (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Genes with &gt; 1.4-fold up- or downregulation with FDR &lt; 5% are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>. We observed marked decrease in the expression of <italic toggle="yes">NFKB1, MAPK8, ILF3, CCR3, IDO1, CLEC4C, ISG15, CCL4, C2</italic> encoding complement C2, <italic toggle="yes">CYBB</italic> that encodes NADPH oxidase, <italic toggle="yes">LTF</italic> encoding lactoferrin, <italic toggle="yes">CEACAM8</italic> encoding CD66b, and <italic toggle="yes">ITGB1</italic> encoding integrin Î²1 protein. These genes are known to be implicated in immune-suppressive activity of MDSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In parallel, mononuclear cells were collected from 6 patients, and the total protein content was extracted and solubilized for whole proteome mass spectrometry analysis. Five hundred and seventy-four differentially enriched proteins (DEP; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified from the paired day 1 vs. day 0 samples. Five hundred and thirty-one proteins showed more than 2-fold upregulation, and 43 proteins showed more than 2-fold downregulation. Marked downregulation of different subunits of NF-kB, complement C2, LAMP1, and TGFÎ² was seen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These paralleled the changes also measured from the gene-expression profile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Genes and proteins associated with monocyte and neutrophil function including TNFR, TLR4, TLR5, TLR2, integrins, neutrophil cytosolic factor 4, CD14, MHC class I, neutrophil elastase, ICAM3, and MAPK14 (p38Î±) were upregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). From this pattern of factors changing, we proposed that MTL-CEBPA caused downregulation of proteins associated with suppressive activity of myeloid cells while promoting activation of classic monocytes and granulocytes.</p>

                <p>To expand on these observations, we performed independent gene-expression analysis of total leukocyte population using qRT-PCR from 12 patients treated only with MTL-CEBPA. As expected, MTL-CEBPA upregulated expression of <italic toggle="yes">CEBPA</italic>. It was associated with upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">TLR5, IL18R1, IL18AP</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MAPK14</italic>. At the same time, marked decrease of <italic toggle="yes">CSF1, OLR1</italic> encoding LOX-1, <italic toggle="yes">IL8</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">TNFA</italic> was found (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This observation therefore supported the result of our unbiased gene-expression analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) of the mononuclear cells. Downregulation of these genes suggested that MTL-CEBPA treatment affected the presence of M-MDSCs or PMN-MDSCs in blood. Therefore, we evaluated these cells by flow cytometry in patients treated with MTL-CEBPA. M-MDSCs (CD66b<sup>â</sup> CD14<sup>+</sup> HLA-DR<sup>â/lo</sup>CD15<sup>â</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>) were dramatically reduced 24 hours after MTL-CEBPA injection and further decreased 7 days after the treatment. A decrease in PMN-MDSCs (CD66b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>â</sup>CD15<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> LOX1<sup>+</sup>) was also evident, albeit at a lesser extent and with a slight rebound observed after 7 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, no significant changes in the circulating populations of monocytes and neutrophils were observed in those patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, we proposed that an increase of CEBPA transcription factor expression in monocytes driven by MTL-CEBPA caused rapid downregulation of genes and proteins involved in MDSC suppressive activity.</p>

                <p>We explored the effect of therapy on the presence of 8 major subpopulations of TAMs including the M1- and M2-type polarization using sequential multiplex, brightplex IHC in liver biopsies of representative patients who showed complete response, stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A heatmap of the different macrophage populations was established based on the log2 fold change of cell density in the liver biopsies obtained before commencement of MTL-CEBPA treatment (pretreatment) and compared with end-of-study biopsies (posttreatment). We observed a strong downregulation of M2-polarized TAMs [where reduced staining of CD68, CD163, and CD64 was quantified from the posttreatment biopsy of the complete response (CR) patient (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>)], whereas in patients with SD and PD, the decrease in these cells after MTL-CEBPA treatment was less prominent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Overall, data from the biopsy staining and from the gene-expression analysis suggested a possible shift from M2-type to M1-type polarized TAMs after treatment with MTL-CEBPA and sorafenib. Because sorafenib alone was not part of the therapeutic regimen in this trial, we cannot at this stage exclude the contribution of sorafenib on the observed changes in myeloid cells within the tumors.</p>

                <title>MTL-CEBPA abrogates the immune-suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and macrophages in mouse tumor models</title>
                <p>To better understand the contribution of MTL-CEBPA with sorafenib or checkpoint inhibitors on the tumor responses seen from the clinical study, we used different mouse tumor models. First, we asked if the antitumor effects of MTL-CEBPA alone were observed in an orthotopic BNL model of HCC, where tumor cells were injected into livers of BALB/c mice. After establishment of tumor nodules, we observed marked reduction in tumor growth following MTL-CEBPA treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This was associated with an increase in the presence of T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) but not NK cells (CD3<sup>â</sup>CD49b<sup>+</sup>) in the spleens when compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Antitumor effect of MTL-CEBPA was similar to that of sorafenib alone. A combination of sorafenib with MTL-CEBPA demonstrated increased antitumor effects; however, this did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

MTL-CEBPA treatment failed to control tumor growth in immune deficient SCID-NOD mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transfection of tumor cells with CEBPA-saRNA (CEBPA-51) did not affect their survival and proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these results indicated that the antitumor effect of MTL-CEBPA was mediated by the immune system rather than by a direct effect on tumor cells.</p>
                <p>We next evaluated the blood distribution profile of MTL-CEBPA after intravenous injection of Cy3-labeled compound in LLC-C57BL/6 mice. Time-course experiments indicated that maximum uptake was observed 4 hours after intravenous administration. Cy3-labeled MTL-CEBPA was readily detectable in myeloid cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A), but was also picked up by a substantial (&gt;10%) proportion of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in spleen, tumor, lung, and liver tissues. About 10% of monocytes/M-MDSCs and only very few PMN/PMN-MDSCs were positive for Cy3-labeled MTL-CEBPA (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). The liver was the exception where monocytes/M-MDSCs, PMN/PMN-MDSCs, DCs, and macrophages all showed an equal distribution of about 10% of positively stained cells across all the subpopulation when measured by FACS analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Expression of <italic toggle="yes">Cebpa</italic> was measured by qPCR in M-MDSCs, PMN-MDSCs, and TAMs dissociated from the tumor nodules. Although the expression levels were low, we observed increased <italic toggle="yes">Cebpa</italic> levels across all the cell populations in the MTL-CEBPAâtreated group. Only M-MDSCs showed a significant increase consistent with the data on MTL-CEBPA uptake. Tumor M-MDSCs and to a lesser extent TAMs also demonstrated upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">Cebpa</italic> expression. In PMN-MDSCs, these changes were less prominent (Supplementary Fig. S3C).</p>
                <p>Although MTL-CEBPA treatment of the LLC tumorâbearing mice did not appear to affect the presence of the major population of myeloid cells within the spleen and tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4), MTL-CEBPA treatment caused a significant reversal in the suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs. Consistent with the absence of Cy3-MTL-CEBPA internalization within PMN-MDSCs, MTL-CEBPA treatment did not affect the T-cell suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Similarly, in spleens the T-cell suppressive activity of M-MDSCs was abrogated following MTL-CEBPA treatment, whereas no effect on PMN-MDSC activity was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

                <p>To confirm that MTL-CEBPA exploits an immune modulating axis via M-MDSCs and TAMs for its tumor suppressive activity, we next investigated the effects of MTL-CEBPA in a colon adenocarcinoma (MC38) tumor-bearing mouse model.

                <p>To better understand mechanistically how MTL-CEBPA exerts its immune-modulating properties, TAMs (where suppressive activity was abrogated) and PMN-MDSCs (where suppressive activity was not changed) were sorted by flow cytometry from tumors of vehicle control (NOV-FLUC) and MTL-CEBPA treated LLC tumorâbearing mice. The transcriptome of these cells was evaluated using RNA-seq. Three hundred genes were differentially expressed (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in TAMs (150 genes were upregulated and 153 downregulated), whereas only 100 genes showed changes in PMN-MDSCs. No overlapping gene changes between TAMs and PMN-MDSCs were observed (Supplementary Fig. S6). The top-scoring changes in gene expression showed MTL-CEBPA caused downregulation of pathways associated with integrin signaling and extravasation in TAMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). A marked decrease in the expression of genes regulated by NF-ÎºB, type I interferon, IL1Î², and STAT4 was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). No statistically significant changes in pathways were observed in the PMN-MDSC population.</p>
                <p>Next, we focused on the analysis of genes known to be directly involved in the suppressive activity of myeloid cells. MTL-CEBPA caused substantial decrease in the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Arg1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Nos2</italic> in TAMs and M-MDSCs, whereas expression of genes involved in PGE2 production (<italic toggle="yes">Ptges</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ptgs2</italic>) were increased (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). No changes in <italic toggle="yes">Arg1</italic> expression were observed in PMN-MDSCs. However, expression of <italic toggle="yes">Ptges</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ptgs2</italic> was increased (Supplementary Fig. S7C) suggesting that MTL-CEBPA showed evidence of affecting gene expression in PMN-MDSCs albeit at a lesser extent when compared with M-MDSCs and TAMs. Importantly, upregulation of C/EBPÎ± caused increase in the expression of genes responsible for synthesis of PGE2, a potent immune-suppressive mediator (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

                <title>Therapeutic effect of MTL-CEBPA</title>
                <p>Our data demonstrated that MTL-CEBPA caused significant regulatory changes in factors affecting myeloid function where increase in <italic toggle="yes">Cebpa</italic> expression reduced the immune-suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs. However, we also identified upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">Ptges</italic>, which is directly involved in PGE2 synthesis known for its immune-suppressive activity. We hypothesized that upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">Ptges</italic> could potentially limit the effect of MTL-CEBPA. Our data also demonstrated that MTL-CEBPA treatment did not affect the function of PMN-MDSCs. We set out to evaluate the effects of combining MTL-CEBPA with checkpoint inhibitors (antiâPD-1 or antiâCTLA-4), with an inhibitor of PGE2 (celocoxib) and with an inhibitor of PMN-MDSCs (lipofermata). We first used the MC38 colon carcinoma model as it is known to respond to PD-1 antibody treatment (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). As expected, MTL-CEBPA monotherapy had little antitumor effects, whereas treatment with PD-1 antibody alone had modest but significant antitumor activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). A combination of MTL-CEBPA with PD-1 antibody, however, showed marked abrogation of tumor progression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Next, we tested LLC tumorâbearing mice that poorly responded to the checkpoint inhibitor antiâCTLA-4. A weak antitumor effect of either MTL-CEBPA or antiâCTLA-4 alone was only slightly enhanced by a combination of these compounds (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Because MTL-CEBPA caused upregulation of genes involved in PGE2 synthesis, we used celecoxib, an inhibitor of PGE2 synthesis. A combination of MTL-CEBPA and celecoxib failed to show significant antitumor effects. However, when MTL-CEBPA and celecoxib were combined with antiâCTLA-4, we observed a complete suppression of tumor progression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Recently, an inhibitor of fatty acid transport protein 2 (FATP2), lipofermata, was shown to selectively inhibit the immune-suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs but not M-MDSCs or TAMs (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). A combination of MTL-CEBPA with lipofermata caused marked inhibition of tumor progression in LLC tumorâbearing mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Thus, our data support the beneficial effect of simultaneously targeting both major groups of myeloid cells (M-MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs), or targeting the escape mechanism of myeloid cells through immune checkpoint inhibition, after upregulation of C/EBPÎ± with MTL-CEBPA.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study describes our unexpected finding that C/EPBÎ± upregulation in myeloid cells elicits a potent inhibition in the suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs. The C/EBP family of transcription factors are generally characterized as regulators of several cellular processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Although C/EBPÎ² is known for its ability to enhance the suppressive function of MDSCs (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and protumoral polarization of M2 macrophages (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the role of C/EBPÎ± in regulating immune-suppressive myeloid cells is less well characterized. Our study revealed that the liposomal formulation MTL-CEBPA was largely taken up by M-MDSCs and TAMs, subsequent to which its CEBPA-saRNA payload (CEBPA-51) enhanced expression of C/EBPÎ±. Here, we observed C/EBPÎ± induced downregulation of major genes implicated in the suppressive activity of M-MDSCs and TAMs. However, given the diverse regulatory role of C/EBPÎ± in different cell types and our observation of small changes occurring in PMN-MDSCs, we did not dismiss the notion that this subpopulation of MDSCs escaped the effects of MTL-CEBPA. Within the hematopoietic system, C/EBPÎ± is predominantly expressed in myeloblast progenitors and granulocytes. Monocytes however have lower endogenous levels of C/EBPÎ±. Reports have shown that ectopic expression of C/EBPÎ± in bipotential myeloid cells induces granulopoiesis while blocking monocyte differentiation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In contrast, loss of C/EBPÎ± results in an absence of granulocytes (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that upregulation of C/EBPÎ± preferentially affects cells where its endogenous levels are very low (i.e., in mononuclear cells). This selective effect of MTL-CEBPA was further supported when we combined MTL-CEBPA with the PMN-MDSC inhibitor lipofermata (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Of significance, we demonstrated that targeting both arms of myeloid cells (mononuclear and polymorphonuclear) resulted in tumor suppression even without combination with standard immunotherapy. We observed that MTL-CEBPA treatment caused a decrease in factors involved in immune suppression (<italic toggle="yes">Arg1, Nos2)</italic> while concomitantly increasing factors involved in PGE2 synthesis (<italic toggle="yes">Ptges</italic> and Ptgs<italic toggle="yes">2</italic>). Because PGE2 has been shown to be a potent immune-suppressive factor produced by myeloid cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), we postulated that if we abrogated the synthesis of PGE2 synthesis, we would observe a more pronounced effect of MTL-CEBPA on its suppressive activity of myeloid cells. The addition of celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor in combination with MTL-CEBPA, confirmed this by significantly reducing tumor progression. This supports the biological role of PGE2 in the dynamics of macrophage immunometabolism, and also suggests a potential therapeutic opportunity.</p>
              <p>In previous studies, we demonstrated that treatment of HCC tumorâbearing mice with sorafenib resulted in decreased presence of regulatory T cells and MDSCs, and a substantial regression of tumor growth (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, it was not clear if the effect of therapy was the result of changes in tumor burden. It is reported that an accumulation of TAMs and neutrophils (possibly PMN-MDSCs) is responsible for the progression of resistance to sorafenib (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Although sorafenib is still maintained as standard-of-care treatment for nonresectable HCC, there is an urgent need to find alternative therapy. Recent examples of this include the immune-checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, that increased OS at one year from 54.6% to 67.2% compared with sorafenib in a phase III clinical trial (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This provides both a rationale for combining MTL-CEBPA with sorafenib and an explanation for the clinical response we observed in TKI-naÃ¯ve patients. Because accumulation of MDSCs in patients with HCC is associated with negative clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), then, the specific targeting of these cells would be a valuable therapeutic strategy.</p>
              <p>The disparity in observing better treatment response in patients with viral hepatitisâassociated HCC when compared with much weaker response in patients with NASH-associated HCC shows anecdotal, but interesting correlation of immune responsiveness in patients to treatment outcome. As a way of validating this observation, we showed that by depleting mice of T cells, we lost the antitumor effects of MTL-CEBPA despite its continued activity in myeloid cells. We therefore hypothesized that the better treatment responses seen in virally associated HCC are likely due to a more potent immune response when compared with NASH-associated HCC. This hypothesis is further supported by a recent study that demonstrated that the immune response of T cells to tumor-associated antigen in NASH-associated HCC patients was substantially weaker than the responses in patients with the virally associated HCC (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This hypothesis requires further confirmation. We hypothesize that patients with any solid tumor will be suitable for combination treatment with MTL-CEBPA. MTL-CEBPA is currently being used in a large international multicenter study in combination with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04105335).</p>
