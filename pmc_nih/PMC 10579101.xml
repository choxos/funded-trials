              <abstract id="Abs1">
                <p id="Par1">Inducing antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free virological control is a critical step toward a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cure. In this phase 2a, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, 43 people (85% males) with HIV-1 on ART were randomized to (1) placebo/placebo, (2) lefitolimod (TLR9 agonist)/placebo, (3) placebo/broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) or (4) lefitolimod/bNAb. ART interruption (ATI) started at week 3. Lefitolimod was administered once weekly for the first 8 weeks, and bNAbs were administered twice, 1 d before and 3 weeks after ATI. The primary endpoint was time to loss of virologic control after ATI. The median delay in time to loss of virologic control compared to the placebo/placebo group was 0.5 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = 0.49), 12.5 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) and 9.5 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) in the lefitolimod/placebo, placebo/bNAb and lefitolimod/bNAb groups, respectively. Among secondary endpoints, viral doubling time was slower for bNAb groups compared to non-bNAb groups, and the interventions were overall safe. We observed no added benefit of lefitolimod. Despite subtherapeutic plasma bNAb levels, 36% (4/11) in the placebo/bNAb group compared to 0% (0/10) in the placebo/placebo group maintained virologic control after the 25-week ATI. Although immunotherapy with lefitolimod did not lead to ART-free HIV-1 control, bNAbs may be important components in future HIV-1 curative strategies.

              <p id="Par3">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection persists mainly in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a long-lived HIV-1 reservoir. Continuous lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) is needed to suppress viral replication and prevent disease progression. When ART is stopped, viral replication quickly resumes, leading to rebound of plasma viremia within weeks in almost all individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Many HIV-1 curative strategies aim to enhance HIV-1-specific immunity as a means to achieve ART-free HIV-1 virologic control. Until recently, HIV-1 cure trials have typically involved people with HIV-1 (PWH) on long-term suppressive ART, which is continued during the therapeutic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In these individuals, the level of HIV-1 antigen both in blood and tissues is extremely low due to the effective modern ART regimens. The scarcity of antigen may explain why experimental immunotherapies, such as cytokines and other immunostimulatory agents, have had limited impact on HIV-1-specific immunity and viral persistence in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">One promising immunostimulatory agent is lefitolimod (MGN1703), a dumbbell-shaped DNA molecule that triggers Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 signaling in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, TLR9 agonists have been shown to enhance potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In vivo, TLR9 agonist administration among PWH on long-term suppressive ART induced activation of pDCs, leading to potent upregulation of antiviral immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. During TLR9 agonist treatment, the proportion of activated cytotoxic (CD56<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) natural killer (NK) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expanded in blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and lymph nodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This might facilitate killing of infected cells, as ex vivo studies have shown that priming of effector cells, such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cells, enhances their ability to recognize and eliminate antigen-expressing infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Finally, TLR9 agonist treatment may directly impact the HIV-1 reservoir through cytokine release or cell-to-cell-mediated activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In a small clinical trial, an increased frequency in viral blips during lefitolimod administration was observed among PWH on ART, suggesting that lefitolimod may have a latency-reversing effect on the HIV-1 reservoir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The immunological effects of lefitolimod could potentially be boosted either by administering the drug in the presence of higher antigen load or by co-administration with broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs), such as 3BNC117 and 10-1074, which recognize non-overlapping epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>). In support of the latter concept, non-human primate (NHP) studies have shown that administration of a TLR7 agonist, which, similarly to a TLR9 agonist, activates pDCs and triggers antiviral immune responses, in combination with bNAbs led to ART-free virologic control in a large proportion of animals during ART interruption (ATI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In phase 1–2 clinical trials, repeated administration (3–8 doses) of the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 maintained viral suppression for ~13 weeks after last bNAb infusion when administered instead of ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Finally, owing to Fc-mediated engagement of effector and antigen-presenting cells, bNAbs independently exert immunomodulatory effects, and bNAb treatment has been shown to augment HIV-1-specific T cell immunity both in viremic NHPs and in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Collectively, these observations led us to hypothesize that lefitolimod alone or in combination with two doses of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 administered in the setting of ATI could potentially enhance elimination of infected cells and boost HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity, leading to ART-free virologic control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To address this hypothesis, we conducted an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase 2a trial to determine the impact of lefitolimod and 3BNC117 + 10-1074 on virologic control among PWH undergoing ATI. Secondary endpoints were safety and viral rebound kinetics.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>TITAN trial design (a) and abbreviated CONSORT flow diagram (b).</title><p>Solid green arrows indicate lefitolimod injections.

Of 117 individuals who were screened for sensitivity to 3BNC117 and 10-1074 by phenotypic or sequence-based analysis, 46 participants were enrolled in the study, of whom three withdrew consent for personal reasons and did not receive the random allocation treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of the remaining 43 participants, 10 were randomly allocated to placebo/placebo, 10 to lefitolimod/placebo, 11 to placebo/bNAb and 12 to lefitolimod/bNAb. Lefitolimod (120 mg) or placebo was dosed subcutaneously (s.c.) once weekly for 8 weeks starting 2 weeks before the ATI and ending at the beginning of week 6 of the ATI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). 3BNC117 (30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and 10-1074 (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) or placebo were given as sequential intravenous (i.v.) infusions the day before starting the ATI and 3 weeks into the ATI. One participant in the placebo/bNAb group discontinued the ATI and re-started ART after an infusion-related reaction during the second bNAb infusion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This person was included in the analyses. No participants were lost to follow-up.</p>

                <title>Plasma HIV-1 RNA kinetics after ART interruption</title>
                <p id="Par10">To determine the impact of the interventions on ART-free virologic control, all participants underwent a closely monitored 25-week ATI. The study’s primary endpoint was time from stopping ART to the date of meeting the criteria for loss of virologic control (defined as 4 weeks with sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥1,000 copies per milliliter or two consecutive measurements &gt;100,000 copies per milliliter). All participants in the placebo/placebo group experienced loss of virologic control, which occurred at a median of 4.5 weeks (IQR: 3.0–11) after stopping ART (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In the lefitolimod/placebo group, median time to loss of virologic control was 5.0 weeks (IQR: 4.0–6.0) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). One individual in this group had partial ART-free virologic control with viremia ranging from &lt;20 to 5,500 copies per milliliter throughout the ATI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In the placebo/bNAb group, median time to loss of virologic control was 17 weeks (IQR: 11–25) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). However, four of 11 participants (36%) maintained virologic control during the 25-week ATI. In the lefitolimod/bNAb group, the median time to reach criteria for viral rebound was 14 weeks (IQR: 10–17) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). One individual had partial ART-free virologic control, with viremia ranging from &lt;20 to 65,100 copies per milliliter during the ATI. All six individuals with either partial or complete ART-free virologic control tested negative for antiretroviral drugs in plasma at week 25 of the ATI. One partial controller in the placebo/bNAb group had a protective HLA class I allele (ID601: HLA*B27) (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and one started ART less than 6 months from the presumed date of HIV-1 infection (ID142) (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Viral kinetics and time to loss of virologic control during 25 weeks of ATI.</title><p><bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>, Individual plasma HIV-1 RNA levels are shown in the four randomization groups during 25 weeks of ATI: <bold>a</bold>, placebo/placebo group (<italic>n</italic> = 10); <bold>b</bold>, lefitolimod/placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 10); <bold>c</bold>, placebo/bNAb (<italic>n</italic> = 11); and <bold>d</bold>, lefitolimod/bNAb (<italic>n</italic> = 12).

If phenotypic sensitivity results were inconclusive or the PhenoSense assay could not be carried out, single-genome amplification and sequencing of HIV-1 envelope (<italic>env</italic>) followed by genotypic sensitivity prediction was used as an alternate screening method (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Among participants who received bNAb, plasma HIV <italic>env</italic> sequences were analyzed for known resistance mutations if viral rebound occurred (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As serum levels of 3BNC117 gradually declined to subtherapeutic levels, most participants in the bNAb groups experienced viral rebound while seemingly on 10-1074 monotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>). Post hoc analyses demonstrated that the prevalence of genotypic 10-1074 resistance mutations increased from 13% at screening to 89% at viral rebound among bNAb-treated individuals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

This change in HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from pre-ATI to week 6 was significantly correlated with measurable plasma HIV-1 RNA at week 6 (<italic>r</italic> = 0.51, <italic>P</italic> = 0.021) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The frequency of HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also increased significantly from the pre-ATI timepoint to week 13 for the lefitolimod/bNAb group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0059). To disentangle increased antigen exposure from a bNAb-mediated vaccinal effect as potential cause of increased HIV-1 specific immunity, we separated bNAb-treated individuals in a post hoc analysis into two groups based on whether their plasma HIV-1 RNA was below or above 50 copies per milliliter during the ATI. As expected, bNAb-treated individuals with plasma HIV-1 RNA above 50 copies per milliliter had higher HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses at week 13 compared to pre-ATI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0052) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par18">In this randomized, placebo-controlled HIV-1 cure trial among PWH on long-term ART who screened sensitive to the study bNAbs, we found that two doses of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in the setting of ATI led to a significant delay in viral rebound compared to placebo. We also observed that 36% of individuals in the placebo/bNAb group compared to none in the placebo group maintained partial or complete virologic control at the end of the 25-week ATI. There were no differences in time to viral rebound or change in reservoir size between the placebo/placebo and the lefitolimod/placebo group or between the placebo/bNAb and lefitolimod/bNAb group. Thus, although there was no added clinical or immunological benefit of combining lefitolimod with bNAbs, antibody treatment alone led to a significant delay in viral rebound, and some bNAb-treated individuals experienced long-term ART-free virologic control.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Single-arm trials show that bNAb-sensitive PWH on long-term ART receiving 3–8 infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 maintain prolonged viral suppression in the absence of ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Notably, our study was not designed to evaluate the ability of bNAbs to replace ART as a means to durably suppress viral replication but, rather, to address an important HIV-1 cure hypothesis: could a TLR9 agonist alone or in combination with bNAbs increase the chance of long-term ART-free control? We addressed this question using the most rigorous study design: a factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. We administered bNAbs only twice—one infusion before stopping ART and a second infusion 3 weeks after ATI—but found that time to viral rebound after the last infusion was similar to that seen in previous multi-dose trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Of note, we administered 10-1074 at 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> compared to 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for 3BNC117 to compensate for the longer half-life of 10-1074 compared to 3BNC117, but, despite differential dosing, 3BNC117 was cleared from plasma faster than 10-1074, leading to a period of effective monotherapy with the latter. Consistent with the pharmacokinetics, 89% of our participants developed new 10-1074 resistance mutations at viral rebound indicative of residual 10-1074 monotherapy, which has also been reported in other trials. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that 10-1074 monotherapy is not sufficient to maintain virologic suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">In our study, 18% of participants (2/11) in the placebo/bNAb group maintained complete virologic control (HIV RNA &lt;20 copies per milliliter) throughout the 25-week ATI, and both elected to continue off ART after the ATI ended. In previous trials using the same bNAb combination, 0% (0/7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, 11% (1/9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and 17% (2/12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> of bNAb-sensitive individuals maintained complete virologic control during ATI. Furthermore, in our study, bNAb treatment changed the trajectory of viral rebound as evidenced by slower plasma virus doubling time during the ATI, which is suggestive of stronger immune pressure against the replicating virus in bNAb recipients.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Although virologic or immunological features characteristic of post-bNAb controllers have yet to be identified, pre-ATI HIV-1 reservoir size was seven-fold lower in post-ART controllers compared to non-controllers in a cohort study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Further analysis showed that the reservoir in post-treatment controllers remained stable during ATI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We found that the frequency of intact HIV-1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells remained stable during bNAb-mediated suppression of plasma viral load but expanded upon loss of virologic control. The two individuals who maintained complete virologic control maintained a stable reservoir throughout the ATI.</p>
              <p id="Par23">As expected, we found that HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses increased during viral rebound. We also observed a modest increase in HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses among bNAb recipients who maintained viral suppression, but, in contrast to a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we observed no change in Gag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses or Gag-induced cytokine release. Thus, there was no clear indication of a vaccinal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> in the present study. The failure to broadly stimulate cellular immunity could be due to low amounts of antigen at the time of bNAb administration because bNAb dosed at ART initiation among newly diagnosed viremic individuals induced sustained strong HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Potent HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity is critical for maintaining virologic suppression in humans and bNAb-treated macaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Whether increases in HIV-1-specific cellular immunity after bNAb administration contributed to virologic control in the present study is unclear, but it seems plausible that a combined restriction of outgrowth from the viral reservoir, along with potent cellular responses, contributed to long-term ART-free control in some individuals.</p>
              <p id="Par24">The combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 subtypes ex vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, but bNAb treatment is still challenged by archived resistant mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. To address this issue, we pre-screened all participants for bNAb sensitivity using both genotypic and phenotypic approaches. However, neither bNAb sensitivity analysis accurately predicted time to viral rebound, adding further evidence of the challenge of effective screening for bNAb sensitivity. This finding is in line with other recent studies, which indicate that currently available bNAb sensitivity testing of the proviral reservoir does not accurately predict the clinical outcome of bNAb treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Of note, the average serum concentrations of 3BNC117 at viral rebound were slightly higher than previously reported, where viral rebound generally occurred after 3BNC117 decreased below 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>). However, both studies were relatively small, and serum antibody concentrations were measured by different methods.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Lefitolimod alone or in combination with bNAbs did not significantly impact time to viral rebound or any of the immunological or virologic outcomes in this trial. Unexpectedly, co-administration of lefitolimod led to a faster decline in bNAb serum concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Lefitolimod administration has been shown to increase proportions of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells among PWH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which theoretically could facilitate increased binding and faster clearance of bNAbs. Of note, a faster decline in serum concentration of an Fc-modified version of PGT121, a bNAb with similar properties to 10-1074, was also observed when it was co-administered with a TLR7 agonist in NHPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against anti-HIV-1 bNAbs rarely develop in humans, and, when they do, the presence of ADA has discernible impact on bNAb elimination kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The combination of a TLR7 agonist and PGT121 was shown to induce long-term ART-free virologic control among 34–45% of NHPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, so why did a TLR9 agonist in combination with two bNAbs fail to produce similar effects in humans? Potential explanations include the lower degree of fitness and greater bNAb sensitivity of simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) versus HIV-1, a smaller reservoir in macaques and very early ART initiation (day 7 or day 9 after infection) in the NHP model. In contrast, our study population consisted mainly of people who started ART during the chronic phase of infection and had large genetically diverse reservoirs with varying degrees of bNAb sensitivity. Early ART initiation and bNAb sensitivity are two key parameters that determine the outcome of ATIs in bNAb studies in humans and NHPs. In two complementary studies with NHPs that started ART later (day 14 and day 365 after infection), the combination of TLR7 agonist and one or more bNAbs tended to be associated with a lower frequency of post-intervention control (0%, 22% and 50%) than in the studies where animals started ART at day 7 or day 9 after infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Another potential explanation is differences in immune signaling between TLR7, which recognizes viral single-stranded RNA, and TLR9, which recognizes unmethylated DNA with CpG motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although both TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed in the endosomal compartment and signal via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), there are notable differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), TLR7 agonists induce a rapid burst of type I IFN transcripts, whereas TLR9 agonists trigger a slower but sustained expression of type I IFN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The subtypes of induced type I IFNs also differ between the two agonists. Collectively, these experimental and biological differences may explain the divergent results between macaque and human HIV-1 cure trials.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Despite lefitolimod’s well-documented ability to enhance DC-mediated cross-presentation, upregulate IFN-stimulated genes and activate multiple innate and adaptive immune cell subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we observed no discernible impact of TLR9 agonist treatment on T cell immunity. Our findings may indicate that such immunostimulatory molecules may not effectively boost HIV-1-specific immunity unless substantial amounts of HIV-1 antigen are concurrently present in the same anatomical location. This hypothesis gains support from recent discoveries in cancer research, wherein intra-tumoral injection of cytokines or TLR9 agonists has demonstrated substantially greater effects on tumor size and tumor-specific immune responses compared to the same therapies administered s.c. or i.v.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. However, ongoing trials will yield additional insights into the potential of an HIV-1 cure strategy that centers on the combination of bNAbs with immunostimulatory agents, such as other TLR agonists, pegylated interferon-a2b or IL-15 super-agonists. These trials will determine whether this approach can induce post-treatment control or if it necessitates a re-evaluation of our current strategy.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The reported results have limitations and may not be generalizable to all PWH. Specifically, our ability to predict proviral bNAb sensitivity based on the PhenoSense assay or sequence analysis is limited. Undetected bNAb resistance leading to treatment failure may have clinical implications, particularly if bNAbs were to replace modern ART regimens as suppressive antiviral treatment or if used in combination with the new long-acting small-molecule-based injectable antivirals. Most enrolled participants were male. In contrast to some bNAb trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we did not exclude individuals who initiated ART during the chronic phase of infection. Although this inclusive approach made our study population more representative of the overall population, it might also have contributed to raising the bar for success, as PWH who started ART during the acute/early phase of infection harbor smaller and less diverse HIV-1 reservoirs and may be more likely to become post-treatment controllers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Although lefitolimod and bNAbs were overall safe, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count dropped in response to recrudescent viremia. Reassuringly, once plasma HIV-1 RNA was re-suppressed, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts returned to pre-ATI levels. We also found that the size of the HIV-1 reservoir expanded at rebound. In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, 22 PWH interrupted ART for a median of 4 months and were followed for ~2 years after restarting ART. The investigators found no difference in HIV-1 reservoir size from pre-ATI and until the last follow-up timepoint. Thus, although viral rebound might cause transient CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count declines and HIV-1 reservoir size increases, the long-term clinical implications of these changes, if any, appear to be limited. Of note, one individual in this study (ID807) did not achieve rapid viral re-suppression despite having therapeutic ART drug concentrations and no evidence of emerging or archived resistance mutations. We speculate that this case of slow viral resuppression could be due to clonally expanded defective proviruses, which were recently reported to be a potential source of non-suppressible viremia among fully ART-adherent individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In conclusion, although there was no added benefit of combining a TLR9 agonist with bNAbs compared to bNAbs alone, this was, to our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to show prolonged ART-free virologic control during ATI in individuals receiving just two doses of bNAbs. This finding provides further support for investigating bNAbs as a component in long-acting treatment and HIV-1 curative strategies. However, additional interventions, optimization of bNAbs and bNAb drug combinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and/or administration of bNAbs in the setting of higher antigen load will likely be needed to achieve ART-free HIV-1 remission in the majority of PWH on long-term suppressive ART.</p>

The first participants were enrolled on 16 May 2019. Before any study-related procedures, written informed consent was obtained from the participants. Participants were randomized into one of four groups— placebo/placebo, lefitolimod/placebo, placebo/bNAb or lefitolimod/bNAb—in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). Sex of participants was determined based on self-reporting. The planned sample size was 48 participants. Study procedures were unfortunately severely impacted by the coronavris disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and enrollment had to be paused for longer periods in 2020 and 2021. Due to expiration dates of the study drugs, enrollment closed on 5 November 2021 with 46 of the 48 planned participants enrolled. Screening took place 2–20 weeks before entering the trial. Study participants remained on ART for the first 2 weeks (week −2 to week 0) of the 8-week interventional period. The 25-week ATI started at week 0; thus, administration of study medication ended in week 5 of the ATI. Regular follow-up visits continued for 20 weeks (weeks 6–25) after the last dose of the study medication. Participants who resumed ART during ATI were followed at 4-week intervals until plasma HIV-1 RNA was &lt;50 copies per milliliter. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and is reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par54">HIV-1-specific T cell immunity was assessed using the AIM assay by flow cytometry at weeks 0, 6, 13 and 25 after ATI. Aliquots of cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, washed and rested at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were then plated into wells of a 96-well plate at a total of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs per well in RMPI glutamine supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin and 10% FBS. Cells were then stimulated at a final concentration of 2 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> of total peptide with four different HIV peptide pools for 20 h at 37 °C. Detailed description of the methods can be found in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, and the gating strategy can be found in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>

Paired two-tailed Wilcoxon tests and two-tailed Mann–Whitney tests were used to analyze non-parametric outcomes within and between groups, respectively. When more than two groups were compared, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used. Data are presented as median (IQR), median (range) or mean ± s.d. as indicated in each respective figure legend. The Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to assess the magnitude of the difference between the survival curves, and the log-rank test was used to compare time to loss of virologic control during ATI between groups. For correlations, Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used. We used the full analysis set, comprising all individuals receiving at least one dose of active treatment with assessable data, for the efficacy analyses and all enrolled individuals for the safety analyses. We used Stata version 17.0 and Prism version 7.0 software for statistical analyses.</p>

In seven participants, the PhenoSense Assay failed, and we secondarily used proviral HIV-1 envelope (<italic>env</italic>) sequences on a genotypic prediction algorithm with predefined thresholds of ≥90% known sequences are sensitive. Two participants (ID141 and ID313) were enrolled based upon the genotypically analysis, but post-hoc phenotypic data showed IC90 values of 3.69 and 3,59 µg/mL for 3BNC117, respectively. In another two participants (ID614 and ID808), both the PhenoSense Assay and <italic>env</italic> sequencing initially failed, and we tertiary-included (see Methods) these individuals based on the assumption that both assays failed due to a very small reservoir size. Empty red and blue triangles indicate placebo for 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions, respectively.
