                <p id="Par1">This phase I, dose-escalation trial evaluates the safety of combining interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and nivolumab in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Twenty-six patients are treated in four cohorts assessing increasing doses of IFN-Î³ with nivolumab to evaluate the primary endpoint of safety and determine the recommended phase two dose (RP2D). Most common adverse events are low grade and associated with IFN-Î³. Three dose limiting toxicities are reported at the highest dose cohorts. We report only one patient with any immune related adverse event (irAE). No irAEs â‰¥ grade 3 are observed and no patients require corticosteroids. The maximum tolerated dose of IFN-Î³ is 75â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup>, however based on a composite of safety, clinical, and correlative factors the RP2D is 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exploratory analyses of efficacy in the phase I cohorts demonstrate one patient with a complete response, and five have achieved stable disease. Pre-planned correlative assessments of circulating immune cells demonstrate intermediate monocytes with increased PD-L1 expression correlating with IFN-Î³ dose and treatment duration. Interestingly, post-hoc analysis shows that IFN-Î³ induction increases circulating chemokines and is associated with an observed paucity of irAEs, warranting further evaluation.

              <p id="Par3">Systemic immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with drugs targeting the programmed death one (PD-1) pathway has revolutionized oncology. ICB offers the potential for some patients to experience durable anti-tumor responses; however, the majority of patients do not respond to single-agent ICB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Numerous combinatorial approaches are exploring whether combining additional agents with PD-1 pathway inhibitors can increase the quantity or quality of responses. For example, combined ICB with drugs targeting both the PD-1 pathway along with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) checkpoint has demonstrated increased efficacy in several cancers, albeit with increased toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the improved efficacy of combined ICB, including the release of non-overlapping co-inhibitory pathways and the activation of complementary anti-tumor T-cell subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Discovering novel strategies to optimize ICB in tumors less likely to respond or that have acquired resistance to single agent PD-1 inhibition, without increasing immune-related adverse events (irAEs), are needed.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Cytokines have been used for decades as anti-cancer therapeutics with mixed success. Interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) is the only type II interferon and is FDA-approved for the treatment of two rare pediatric diseases, osteopetrosis and chronic granulomatous disease. In the 1980s-90s it was evaluated as a single agent for use against a variety of different cancers and demonstrated limited activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. One potential explanation for its lack of success as a single agent may be the confounding impacts of immune checkpoints, particularly the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), which had not been discovered when these trials were conceived. Since IFN-Î³ directly up-regulates PD-L1, the presence of IFN-Î³ in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may enhance an immunosuppressive milieu, further promoting T-cell inhibition and creating an immune inhibitory environment favoring tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, IFN-Î³ also has a multitude of pro-inflammatory properties, including acting as a chemoattractant, up-regulating expression of major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), controlling immunoproteasome machinery to enhance antigen presentation, augmenting interactions between macrophages and T-cells, and regulating differentiation of T-cell effector subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory properties of IFN-Î³ therapy could prime an effective anti-tumor response, and that adding a PD-1 pathway-targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb) would ablate the associated inhibitory impacts of PD-L1 upregulation to facilitate more robust and sustained T-cell mediated tumor cell destruction.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Here we report the results of a phase I dose escalation trial of the combination of IFN-Î³ and the anti-PD-1 targeted mAb nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02614456). The trial establishes a recommended phase two dose of IFN-Î³ at 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> and is well tolerated, with one patient experiencing a durable complete response and five patients achieving stable disease as best response. No patients developed a serious immune-related adverse event (irAE), and post-hoc exploratory correlative chemokine analysis supports a hypothesis warranting further study as to whether IFN-Î³ may promote an environment restraining irAE development.</p>

Three patients in the 25â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> IFN-Î³ dose cohort were unable to complete the DLT phase and two were replaced. One patient had worsening myalgias as an exacerbation of his chronic hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy while on IFN-Î³ induction and withdrew consent before the first dose of nivolumab. Another patient developed a new pleural effusion during IFN-Î³, which was attributed to the IFN-Î³ but occurred prior to starting the nivolumab, thus, that patient was not able to complete the DLT period and was replaced. The final patient accrued to the 25â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> fourth cohort came off for disease progression prior to completing the DLT phase; however, this patient was not replaced as no DLTs were recorded in other patients in this cohort, thus that dose would be considered safe regardless.

                <p id="Par9">There were three DLTs on the trial, one in the 75â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> cohort, and two in the 100â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> cohort. The patient in the 75â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> cohort developed grade 3 fatigue, possibly related to both drugs, that met criteria for DLT and was taken off trial. In the 100â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> cohort, one patient developed a grade 3 pleural effusion and grade 3 dyspnea possibly related to both drugs, while a second patient experienced grade 3 elevation in liver enzymes that met criteria for DLT. The patient with dyspnea and effusion went off trial and died within 4 months. While grade 3 elevation in liver function tests was attributed as possibly related to nivolumab, that patient had hepatic metastases and evidence for clinical progression of disease and ultimately died of disease progression shortly after discontinuing on study. The MTD of IFN-Î³ was determined to be 75â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Two AEs of interest occurred during the trial. In the 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> cohort, two patients developed symptomatic brain metastases while on trial (mRCC and TNBC). Neither patient had brain imaging prior to starting on trial, thus subsequent cohorts required brain imaging for trial inclusion. One patient with metastatic RCC and stable systemic disease in the 25â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> cohort died of a hemorrhagic stroke from a metastatic lesion despite a negative baseline MRI. Seven patients (26.9%) on trial developed new or worsening ascites or pleural effusion while on treatment, including two patients that came off trial for new pleural effusions (one attributed to IFN-Î³, one possible but ultimately due to progression). One patient noted above developed a new, large pleural effusion during the one-week induction and prior to receiving the first nivolumab dose. Otherwise, all remaining patients developing fluid accumulation had either a malignancy susceptible to ascites (e.g., ovarian cancer) or known baseline disease in the pleura or peritoneum that worsened on treatment (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par11">We also looked at irAEs that would be normally associated with treatment with nivolumab; however, there were no grade â‰¥ 3 irAEs and no patients received steroids for management of any irAE. The only AE of any grade attributable as an irAE occurred in one patient. This was a patient with TNBC who experienced a complete response (CR) on trial and completed the 3 months of IFN-Î³ and the entire year of nivolumab. While on nivolumab alone, the patient experienced grade 2 arthralgias that started three months after completing IFN-Î³. This was managed with anti-inflammatory supportive medications initially, later maintained on a tricyclic antidepressant.</p>

                <p id="Par16">In an exploratory post-hoc analysis performed to assess the relative paucity of irAEs, we noted a statistically significant increase in plasma concentrations of six chemokines from baseline compared to both C1D1 and C2D15.

The median concentration of these chemokines increased in response to IFN-Î³ administration and remained elevated with the addition of nivolumab.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par17">IFN-Î³ signaling plays an integral role in regulating immune activation and senescence in the TME, induces the expression of PD-L1 and is an essential component of an effective anti-tumor response with PD-1 pathway targeted agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, IFN-Î³ harbors both pro and anti-inflammatory properties and may also be a source of adaptive resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although exogenous administration of IFN-Î³ to optimize immune activity in combination with anti-PD-1 targeted therapy may be a rational approach, IFN-Î³ is short-acting, rapidly taken up by tissues, and its multitude of systemic effects are sensitive to administration dose and schedule.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Overall, the combination was well tolerated. An increased burden of flu-like symptoms was present in most patients, slightly worse at higher doses of IFN-Î³, but were generally grade 1-2 and tolerable with supportive care. We did see an unexpected number of patients develop new ascites or pleural effusions, but it is unclear whether this is attributable to IFN-Î³. Prior trials of single-agent IFN-Î³ have not previously reported such a concern. The majority of patients who developed new fluid collections had cancers associated with ascites (i.e., ovarian cancer), or had baseline pleural or peritoneal disease that may have foreshadowed this possibility. One patient developed a pleural effusion after IFN-Î³ induction without baseline pleural disease that improved upon subsequent anti-cancer therapy without positive fluid cytology. Further trials that involve IFN-Î³ should consider incorporating planned prospective fluid analysis in patients that develop new ascites or effusions.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Exploratory analyses of efficacy in this trial were modest, with one patient with metastatic TNBC and no prior immunotherapy exposure achieving a durable CR. Although two patients achieved stable disease despite progression on prior ICB, the sample size is too small to make any conclusions. One clear limitation of this trial is the heterogeneous population, with multiple diagnoses that have subsequently demonstrated poorly immunogenic tumors or modest single agent benefit from PD-1 targeted drugs, thus potentially hampering any benefit from IFN-Î³. Additionally, the four dose cohorts are small, limiting efforts to assess differences in IFN-Î³ dose ranges, although more patients with clinical benefit were treated in the two lower dosed cohorts. Based on a combination of increased low-grade AEs and DLTs starting at 75â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup>, the longer duration of treatment at the lower dose cohorts, and the increased expression of PD-L1 on peripheral monocytes at the higher dose levels which associated with shorter therapy duration, 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> was chosen as the RP2D. In light of evidence of the anti-immunogenic effects of chronic IFN-Î³ stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, any future study of this drug in cancer patients should start at doses of 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> or less, with consideration of less frequent dosing or alternative schedules.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Notably, in an exploratory post-hoc observation, there appeared to be a paucity of irAEs amongst patients in this study. The relative incidence of grade â‰¥ 3 irAE development with nivolumab is about 10-15%. With 26 treated patients, we would have predicted 3-4 events, and yet only one patient developed any manifestations attributable as an irAE, and this only after discontinuing IFN-Î³. Several factors may have contributed to this, for example 46.2% patients had received prior ICB without any irAEs and thus may have been less likely to develop an irAE. Additionally, 16 of 23 patients evaluable for efficacy (69.6%) progressed within the first 100 days of therapy, and simply may not have been exposed long enough to nivolumab. It is also possible this was merely by chance. However, it is reasonable to speculate whether the IFN-Î³ may have altered the immune milieu in such a way to restrain irAE development. Support for this hypothesis exists with the results of the post-hoc exploratory cytokine analysis, which showed a statistically significant increase in CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. These three chemokines are known to be directly induced by IFN-Î³ signaling and bind to a common receptor (CXCR3). Primarily, they are responsible for regulating immune cell migration, differentiation, and activation and thus are important regulators of immune responses in the TME; however, they have also been implicated in promoting tumor proliferation and metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A previous retrospective study assessing irAEs in ICB-treated patients found that irAE development was associated with a lower baseline level of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 and with a greater increase in these chemokines upon treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We postulate that IFN-Î³ induction may have raised the systemic levels of these key chemokines above a threshold, impacting T-cell activation and diminishing the likelihood of irAE development with the addition of nivolumab. Continued administration of IFN-Î³ may have maintained these high chemokine levels to prevent autoimmune activation. Physiologically, chronic IFN-Î³ administration and exposure may induce widespread terminal T-cell exhaustion and PD-L1 independent signaling, essentially rendering T-cells non-functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Potentially, the IFN-Î³ may have also attenuated the benefits of nivolumab due to prolonged exposure. There was a statistically significant increase in the same three chemokines in the patients who had progressive disease compared to those with SD or better, further suggesting the chemokine increase may have hampered response. Further prospective research is warranted to evaluate the association between these chemokines and irAE development, as well as whether there could be a role for IFN-Î³ administration in the prevention or treatment of irAEs.</p>
              <p id="Par21">A number of notable findings were revealed in pre-planned exploratory PBMC flow cytometry studies and biopsy tissue assessments. IFN-Î³ induction significantly increased the frequency of intermediate monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup>) in the peripheral circulation, but these, along with non-classical monocytes (CD14<sup>low/-</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup>), tended to decline after nivolumab addition. Intermediate monocytes increase in the peripheral blood of patients with infection or inflammatory diseases and have high antigen presentation capacity, whereas non-classical monocytes are more highly differentiated and patrol vascular endothelial surfaces to survey for signs of inflammation before transmigrating into tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Whether the non-classical monocytes left the circulation to enter the tissues remains unclear, but more CD68<sup>+</sup> cells (a macrophage marker) were observed in the TME after treatment, and this was accentuated at higher doses of IFN-Î³. The upregulation of HLA-DR (MHC Class II) and PD-L1 on all monocyte subpopulations after IFN-Î³ administration is expected, and indicative that treatment was on-target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. On the other hand, although IFN-Î³ administration did not increase PD-L1 expression within the TME, we observed a dose-dependent increase of PD-L1 expression on intermediate and non-classical monocytes, which would be expected to effectively suppress activation of PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although nivolumab would be expected to overcome this, patients with the highest levels of PD-L1 on circulating intermediate monocytes had the lowest duration of treatment, suggesting that induction of PD-L1 on these cells by IFN-Î³ may have hindered efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Additionally, patients with the lowest frequency of circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells prior to treatment had the shortest duration of therapy. This observation has also been noted with single agent PD-1 blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, since effective PD-1 blockade requires adequate numbers of available exhausted T-cells to be re-invigorated to mount an effective anti-tumor response. In addition, there was a dose-dependent decline in PD-1 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells after the addition of nivolumab. Reduced surface expression of PD-1 on T-cells after treatment with blocking antibodies has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, but higher doses of IFN-Î³ significantly enhanced this effect. It is unclear if the enhanced loss of PD-1 expression on peripheral T-cells is due to augmented endocytosis of PD-1 upon binding of nivolumab or increased reversal of exhaustion, cell death, or tissue migration of PD-1<sup>+</sup> T-cells.</p>
              <p id="Par23">There were several limitations to this trial that may have impacted the results. The heterogeneous population and small cohort sizes limits comparisons of efficacy and correlatives and dose comparisons. Future trials of larger cohorts in specific cancers, such as RCC, TNBC, or esophagogastric carcinoma, might allow for better assessment of efficacy and a better understanding of the impacts of IFN-Î³ at the TME in these tumors. The choice of subcutaneous every other day administration may not have been optimal and may have limited the impact of IFN-Î³ on the TME and ultimately on efficacy. Lastly, advances and standardization in PD-L1 testing that were not available when this study was designed and conducted may have affected the analytic yield.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In summary, the combination of IFN-Î³ and nivolumab in previously treated advanced solid tumor patients was safe and based on clinical and correlative findings we recommend 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> as the RP2D. A post-hoc exploratory efficacy analysis showed modest benefit, with 1 CR and a DCR of 26.1%. No patients experienced a grade 3 irAE and post-hoc exploratory cytokine analysis suggests that this lack of irAEs may have been afforded by an IFN-Î³-induced increase in the associated chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Further prospective study of the role of IFN-Î³ in the development of irAEs is warranted.</p>

                <p id="Par25">The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) Institutional Review Board. This was a single-center, investigator-initiated phase I trial. The study was pre-registered at clinicaltrials.gov and first posted November 25, 2015 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02614456?term=interferon+gamma+AND+nivolumab&amp;cond=Cancer&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">NCT02614456</ext-link>;). Full protocol available in supplementary materials. Patients were accrued to cohorts of six in a modified 3â€‰+â€‰3 design, optimizing patient accrual during a time when access to ICB was more challenging for many tumor types. Four dose finding cohorts of IFN-Î³ were conducted: 25, 50, 75, and 100â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup>, with a fixed dose initially of 3â€‰mg/kg nivolumab (changed to flat dose of 240â€‰mg with amendment when FDA label changed). Dosing was based on 50â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> being the approved dose with 25â€‰mcg/m<sup>2</sup> chosen for dose titration. IFN-Î³ was self-administered subcutaneously every other day (QOD). All patients were started on IFN-Î³ alone for a one-week induction phase prior to adding nivolumab, then continued combination therapy for up to three months. The inclusion of the induction period was intended to inflame the TME prior to starting ICB, to manage mild IFN-Î³-associated AEs, and to facilitate correlative assessments. Patients clinically benefitting after three months would discontinue IFN-Î³ and remain on nivolumab every three weeks for up to one year. Treatment beyond first progression was allowed if a patient was deemed by the treating investigator to be clinically benefitting.</p>
                <p id="Par26">Patients in each cohort were assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) as specified in the protocol (provided in the supplementary material) over the first six weeks of the combination phase, not including the one-week IFN-Î³ induction since that time period would not have reflected DLTs from the combination. If two or more DLTs occurred in any cohort, that dose of IFN-Î³ would be deemed intolerable and the prior completed dose would be considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients that were not evaluable for DLT because they went off trial for disease progression or withdraw of consent without receiving 75% of IFN-Î³ doses were replaced, but were included in overall safety analysis. Based on a complete assessment of toxicity, as well as correlative factors, the study team had authority to denote the MTD as the recommended phase two dose (RP2D), or if warranted for safety and/or scientific reasons, a lower dose could also be chosen as the RP2D.</p>
                <p id="Par27">Patients were seen every two weeks once they entered the combination phase, then every three weeks during the single agent phase. RECIST version 1.1 was used to assess objective tumor response, with assessments performed after the combination phase and then every 9 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par28">All patients provided written informed consent and were not compensated for study participation. The first patient was enrolled 12/29/2015 and the last patients was enrolled 2/12/2018. A steering committee consisting of select study investigators and staff met after each dose cohort to review safety data and decide whether to proceed to the next dose, and the study conduct was also reviewed regularly by an independent FCCC data safety monitoring board. The study was conducted at and sponsored by Fox Chase Cancer Center and all data was evaluated independently. Funding for study conduct and IFN-Î³ administration was provided by Horizon Pharma, LLC. The original design included plans for expansion cohorts to assess preliminary efficacy as measured by response rate in specific cancers of interest; however, the funding organization elected to halt further trial conduct after the Phase I portion. The original plan can be found in the full protocol in the supplement, but no changes to analysis or design of the phase I portion were made.</p>

Initial secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS, OS (median and at 1 year), and ORR for patients in the planned expansion cohorts of esophagogastric carcinoma and in patients with metastatic cancers refractory to prior PD-1 targeted treatment. We also planned to investigate the relationship between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment before and after treatment initiation. The expansion cohorts were not pursued due to perceived limited efficacy by the funding body, and a decision was made to perform exploratory post-hoc analyses to evaluate efficacy in the dose escalation patients. Pre-planned exploratory objectives included investigating changes in PD-L1 expression in tumor biopsy samples and in peripheral blood in relation to response, as well as the effect of IFN-Î³ administration on changes in known IFN-Î³ markers. Post-hoc, we elected to perform an exploratory cytokine analysis from plasma at various time points to associate with incidence of irAEs.</p>

                <p id="Par31">All patients were required to undergo a baseline tumor biopsy within 28 days prior to starting trial treatment, and then underwent a second tumor biopsy of the same site after the IFN-Î³ induction phase but before receiving nivolumab. Tumor specimens were to be evaluated by immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration as pre-planned exploratory analysis. Biopsy samples underwent routine pathology review to determine cellularity and tumor presence via hematoxylin and eosin stain. PD-L1 expression was determined via immunohistochemistry (IHC) utilizing VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) and calculated using the tumor proportion score (TPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. IHC for CD68 was performed according to local protocols on an automated immunostainer (Ventana Benchmark Ultra: Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Arizona).

Peripheral blood was separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were analyzed the same day by the FCCC Immune Monitoring Facility using 12-color multiparametric flow cytometry employing the antibody staining panel shown in Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> to quantify biomarkers on T, NK, and myeloid cells utilizing leukocyte sub-gating strategies, as shown in supplementary figuresÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (volumes shown in Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) were added to 1 million PBMCs in 100â€‰ÂµL staining buffer (Hanksâ€™s Balanced Salt Solution + 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0.09% sodium azide), incubated on ice Ã— 20â€‰min, and washed twice with staining buffer before analysis. Surface PD-1 was measured by primary staining of those samples with unlabeled nivolumab (1â€‰Âµg in 100â€‰Âµl wash buffer on ice Ã— 20â€‰min), followed by two washes, secondary staining with fluorophore-conjugated anti-human IgG4 (10â€‰ÂµL in 100â€‰ÂµL staining buffer on ice Ã— 20â€‰min), and two washes on ice, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD Aria II sorter and processed using FlowJo software (BD; version 10.7). DNA was extracted and prepared for future genotyping.</p>

                <p id="Par32">In a post-hoc analysis prompted by clinical observations during the trial, cytokines in plasma were analyzed by the FCCC High Throughput Screening Facility utilizing the Human Chemokine Panel 40-plex (Bio-Plex Pro, Bio-Rad cat # 171AK99MR2) following manufacturerâ€™s protocols and plates were read on a Bio-Plex 100/200 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA). Plasma underwent cryopreservation at âˆ’80â€‰Â°C via standard operating procedures and was later used for batch cytokine analysis. The instrument was driven with Bio-Plex Manager (version 6.1.0727) software and data was analyzed and exported utilizing Bio-Plex Data Pro software (version 1.2.03).</p>

                <p id="Par33">PFS and OS in all evaluable patients were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. PFS was the interval to progression or death in those evaluable for efficacy. Duration of treatment was defined as the date from first dose of IFN-Î³ to progression, death, or completion of all treatments. The ORR was calculated using RECIST v 1.1. Planned exploratory correlative analysis of the difference in immune parameters at various treatment time points was done using a Wilcoxon test where consecutive samples from the same patient constituted a pair. Correlations to duration of treatment were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression and tests for dose dependence were done using a Kruskalâ€“Wallis test. <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.033 were considered to be statistically significant. Calculations were done with Matlab R2016b Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.</p>
