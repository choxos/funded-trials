                <p id="Par1">Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal cancers with poorly tolerated treatments. There is increasing interest in using high-dose intravenous ascorbate (IVC) in treating this disease partially because of its low toxicity. IVC bypasses bioavailability barriers of oral ingestion, provides pharmacological concentrations in tissues, and exhibits selective cytotoxic effects in cancer cells through peroxide formation. Here, we further revealed its anti-pancreatic cancer mechanisms and conducted a phase I/IIa study to investigate pharmacokinetic interaction between IVC and gemcitabine. Pharmacological ascorbate induced cell death in pancreatic cancer cells with diverse mutational backgrounds. Pharmacological ascorbate depleted cellular NAD+ preferentially in cancer cells versus normal cells, leading to depletion of ATP and robustly increased Î±-tubulin acetylation in cancer cells. While ATP depletion led to cell death, over-acetylated tubulin led to inhibition of motility and mitosis. Collagen was increased, and cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was inhibited, accompanied with inhibition in metastasis. IVC was safe in patients and showed the possibility to prolong patient survival. There was no interference to gemcitabine pharmacokinetics by IVC administration. Taken together, these data revealed a multi-targeting mechanism of pharmacological ascorbateâs anti-cancer action, with minimal toxicity, and provided guidance to design larger definitive trials testing efficacy of IVC in treating advanced pancreatic cancer.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Whereas advancements in molecular and targeted therapies have greatly improved survival of patients with many types of cancers, treatment outcomes for pancreatic cancer have not changed significantly over the past 30 years. Pancreatic cancer remains the most fatal type of cancer, with 5-year survival less than 8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. If left untreated, the median life expectancy is 3Â½ months after diagnosis. Gemcitabine monotherapy was the standard of care for more than 15 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, it produces a median overall survival (OS) duration of only 6â7 months, with little impact on OS of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, who comprise the majority of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recently developed combination regimens such as FOLFIRINOX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> have prolonged the median OS to 8.5â13 months, but with added significant toxic burden. Numerous attempts have been made to improve systemic therapies, but they have either failed to improve efficacy or added significant toxic side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Recently, there has been increased interest in using high-dose intravenous ascorbate (IVC) as an adjunct therapy with standard chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. IVC is safe and free of common toxic side effects that often accompany chemotherapies. A phase I trial by Hoffer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> treating 24 terminal cancer patients found that IVC dosed at 1.5âg/kg 3x weekly was free of significant toxicity, and unexpectedly, 2 patients had stable disease. Our group reported a pilot trial treating stage III-IV ovarian cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> randomized to the standard paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy, or the standard chemotherapy plus IVC (75â100âg/infusion, 2 x weekly for 1 year). IVC treatment substantially decreased chemo-associated toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The median time for disease progression/relapse was prolonged by 8.75 months in the ascorbateâ+âchemo group compared to the chemo-only group, despite the trial not being statistically powered to detect efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Two small trials in pancreatic cancer patients were recently reported by Monti <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and Cullen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> both using IVC (50â100âg/infusion 2â3x weekly) together with gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib. In both trials, IVC did not increase any toxicity to the chemotherapy. In Montiâs trial, 8 out of 9 patients had tumor shrinkage after only 8 weeks of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In Cullenâs trial, despite its very small size, overall survival was nearly doubled compared to historical controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Similar good tolerability was reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A recent mechanistic study showed that ascorbate had preferential cytotoxic effects against KRAS and BRAF mutated colon cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since more than 90% of pancreatic cancers harbor KRAS mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, there is great potential to use IVC as a low-toxic treatment for pancreatic cancer.</p>
              <p id="Par4">In contrast to oral ingestion of vitamin C, IVC bypasses the physiological âtight controlâ of systemic concentrations and achieves pharmacological concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Pharmacological concentrations of ascorbate (Asc) generate hydrogen peroxide, which via Haber-Weiss reaction and Fenton chemistry induces oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity apparently is selective to different types of cells, with higher toxicity toward cancer cells relative to normal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Many laboratories have shown in rodent xenografts that Asc decreased the growth rate of various aggressive tumors without causing adverse effects, such as pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, hepatoma, colon cancer, sarcoma, leukemia, mesothelioma, breast cancer, and neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our previous study, using a panel of 7 pancreatic cancer cell lines, showed that Asc sensitized all these pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment, despite their different genetic backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In this study we investigated the mechanisms of Asc in inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis, evaluated the safety when adding IVC to gemcitabine chemotherapy, and assessed pharmacokinetics to determine whether there is drug-drug interaction when administering IVC and gemcitabine concurrently.</p>

                <title>Mechanisms of pharmacological ascorbate decreasing pancreatic cancer cell viability and metastasis</title>
                <p id="Par5">A panel of 8 human pancreatic cancer cell lines and 1 murine pancreatic cancer cell line were exposed to up to 20âmM of ascorbate, which are clinically relevant concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These cells harbor different combinations of genetic alternations that are the most commonly seen in pancreatic cancer patients, including different mutational status of KRAS and P53 (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Viability in all tested cancer cells was markedly decreased 24 to 48âh after the treatment, despite their different genetic backgrounds. For all tested pancreatic cancer cell lines, IC50 values were below 5âmM (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). In contrast, the treatment of 20âmM ascorbate only minimally influenced viability of a non-tumorigenic pancreatic ductal epithelial cell hTERT-HPEN and fibroblasts (WI-38). Addition of catalase, an enzyme that specifically degrades hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), completely reversed ascorbate-induced cell death in cancer cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). To assess long-term inhibition in cancer cells, colony formation ability of the cells in soft agar was evaluated. Ascorbate at 5âmM significantly decreased the percentage of colony formation in all tested cancer cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Again, catalase completely reversed the inhibitory effect of pharmacological ascorbate. These data confirmed conclusions from previous studies that high concentrations of ascorbate selectively induced cell death in cancer cells versus normal cells, through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Given the promiscuity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a prodrug for reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the sensitivity of cells to ascorbate despite a variety of mutations, we postulated that pharmacological ascorbate would target multiple pathways in a cancer cell. As clinical data suggest that high dose intravenous ascorbate has minimal toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, targeting multiple pathways for cancer treatment is advantageous because of potential synergy.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ascorbate inhibited pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic>.

                <p id="Par6">Interestingly, at a sub-cytotoxic concentration of 1âmM, ascorbate was able to inhibit PANC-1 cell migration and invasion through Matrigel coated Boyden chambers (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), without influencing viability of the cells (Fig. S1). Because cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been suggested to be the initial step of cancer cell dissemination and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, we first examined whether ascorbate treatment influenced the EMT features of pancreatic cancer cells. In PANC-1 cells treated with sub-cytotoxic concentrations of Asc (1â1.5âmM), E-cadherin expression was increased as shown by both RT-PCR and western blot (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D,E</xref>). Consistently, Snail, a major EMT transcription factor, was decreased, and the mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin were also decreased (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D,E</xref>). The overall pattern in the changes of EMT markers indicated attenuation of EMT. Similar results were seen in another pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa2 (Fig. S2). Remarkably, mRNAs of collagens were dramatically increased in Asc treated PANC-1 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). At the same time, mRNAs of multiple matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were decreased (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). We further examined MMP-2 as a representative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Asc treatment decreased MMP-2 expression dose dependently in PANC-1 cells in 24âh of treatment (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Gelatinolytic activity of secreted MMP-2 also decreased dose dependently to Asc in the supernatant media of PANC-1 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). These data indicated that even at sub-cytotoxic concentrations, ascorbate exerted actions in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion.</p>
                <p id="Par7">Because pharmacological ascorbate was synergistic with paclitaxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules, we investigated whether pharmacological ascorbate could act similarly, by acetylating tubulin and thereby interfering with its catabolism specifically in cancer cells. Robust Î±-tubulin acetylation was found in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells treated with Asc at both sub-cytotoxic and cytotoxic concentrations (1.25â2.5âmM), in a dose dependent manner (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,B</xref>). In contrast, Asc only minimally increased acetylated Î±-tubulin in the non-cancerous pancreatic ductal epithelial cell hTERT-HPEN. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment mimicked the effects of Asc, whereas catalase completely eradicated Î±-tubulin acetylation induced by Asc (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). These data indicate that the mechanism of Asc action in stabilizing Î±-tubulin is dependent on extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated by pharmacological ascorbate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Previous studies reported DNA damage and subsequent PARP activation in cancer cells treated with Asc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As activated PARP utilizes NAD+ as substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that NAD+ is decreased by Asc treatment. Indeed, NAD+ levels significantly dropped in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells in relation to Asc concentrations, within 4âhours of exposure when cell death had not occurred (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The decrease of NAD+ caused depletion in ATP in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), which is related to the subsequent cell death and inhibition in proliferation. In the non-cancerous hTERT-HPEN cells, the 1.25â2.5âmM ascorbate concentrations had no effects on the level of NAD+, only the 5âmM concentration caused decrease in NAD+, and the decrease was more subtle compared to that in cancer cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). There was no decrease in cellular ATP levels in hTERT-HPEN cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). The selectivity of Asc effects could be explained by two reasons: 1) active replication renders cancer cell DNA more susceptible to oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and thus NAD+ is under a greater demand by PARP in cancer cells; 2) the Warburg effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> showed that cancer cells depend more on glycolysis for ATP production, which is inefficient compared to normal oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Therefore, depletion of NAD+ induced catastrophic effects on cancer cellsâ ATP production while sparing normal cells.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Ascorbate depleted NAD+ in pancreatic cancer cells and enhanced tubulin acetylation.

</p>
                <p id="Par8">In addition, because NAD+ is an essential co-factor for the tubulin deacetylzing enzyme Sirt-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the decrease of NAD+ inhibited the activity of Sirt-2 and resulted in increased Î±-tubulin acetylation, even when there was no change in Sirt-2 protein levels with Asc treatment (Fig. S2A). As evidence, in PANC-1 cells, supplementation of NAD+ to the cell culture media rescued the NAD+ decrease caused by a cytotoxic concentration of 5âmM Asc (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>) thus reversing the Asc-mediated Î±-tubulin acetylation in a dose dependent manner (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Cellular ATP was also rescued (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). As ATP was protected and the excess tubulin acetylation was prevented, cell viability as measured by colony formation was restored to control values (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par9">Because Î±-tubulin acetylation is under the balanced control of acetyl transferases (Î±-TAT) and deacetylases (Sirt-2 and HDAC6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, we also examined Î±-TAT and HDAC6. No change was found in Î±-TAT with ascorbate treatment, while decrease in HDAC6 expression was found in both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells treated with Asc (Fig. S2A). However, overexpression of HDAC6 in PANC-1 cells only slightly reversed Î±-tubulin acetylation (Fig. S2B), and did not influence Asc-induced cell death (Fig. S2C). Although data here cannot exclude the contribution of HDAC6 and Î±-TAT, a major role of Sirt-2 is likely because supplementation of NAD+ completely rescued Asc-induced Î±-tubulin acetylation and cell death.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Acetylated Î±-tubulin is associated with stable microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Here, we found over-stabilization of microtubules induced by Asc treatment. Four hours after Asc treatment, there was an enrichment of high molecular weight fractions of acetylated Î±-tubulin, indicating microtubule polymerization, mimicking the effect of paclitaxel (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). As cold temperature is known to induce depolymerization of tubulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, cells lysates were put on ice (4âÂ°C), and the Asc-induced tubulin polymerization was found stable over time (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The degree of Î±-tubulin acetylation was inversely correlated to the viability of pancreatic cancer cells after Asc treatment (PANC-1, râ=ââ0.98287 and BxPC-3, râ=ââ0.88609, by Pears test) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Ascorbate over-stabilized polymerized tubulin by increased tubulin acetylation.

                <title>Inhibition of pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis by pharmacological ascorbate in a mouse model</title>
                <p id="Par11">The multiple mechanisms of Asc actions in pancreatic cancer cells suggested that, inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis was likely to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. We explored this possibility by using a mouse orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. Luciferase expressing PANC-1 cells were orthotopically injected into pancreas of nude mice. After tumor formation was detected by imaging, mice were grouped and treated with intraperitoneal (IP) doses of ascorbate (Asc) at 4âg /Kg body weight/day for 45 days (equivalent to 1.3âg/Kg/day by intravenous injection)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, or gemcitabine (Gem, 40âmg/kg every 3 days, IP), or the combination of Asc and Gem. Live animal imaging showed that the gemcitabine treatment did not inhibit tumor growth. In contrast, Asc treatment alone significantly reduced tumor progress longitudinally (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>). Combination of gemcitabine and ascorbate (Gem+Asc) achieved significant tumor growth inhibition compared to control and Gem alone groups, but was not different compared to Asc alone group. At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized and total tumor weight was detected, and visible metastases in the abdomen were examined by gross necropsy. A significant decrease in average tumor weight was found with Asc treated and Gem+Asc treated groups, compared to controls (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). The number of metastases in each mouse were significantly decreased in the Asc group and the Gem+Asc group, compared to controls (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). However, the Gem alone treatment had no effects on both tumor weight and metastases, and the Gem+Asc treatment did not show superior effects compared to Asc treatment alone.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Ascorbate inhibited pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>.

                <p id="Par12">Immunohistochemical analysis on tumor samples showed that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an indicator of cell proliferation, decreased substantially in tumors treated with Asc (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). The mitotic index also decreased significantly in the Asc treated group, as analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&amp;E stain) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Massive increases in collagen content were found in the tumor stroma of Asc-treated mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). RT-PCR detected significant elevation of multiple collagen synthesis in mice tumors with Asc treatment (7 collagen gene transcripts were upregulated in Asc group, 6 in Gem group, and 14 in Gem+Asc group) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Considering all transcripts, collagen gene expression in Asc group and Gem+Asc group had significant increase relative to control group (Pâ=â0.001 and 0.00003 respectively); gemcitabine alone did not increase collagen gene expression (Pâ=â0.08); and Gem+Asc group had significant increase relative to Gem group (Pâ=â0.05). Accordingly, desmoplasia in tumor stroma was significantly enhanced in Asc-treated mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). No such increase in collagen or fibrosis was found in the livers of the Asc-treated mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>). Also consistent with cellular data, decrease of Snail was found in mouse tumors treated with ascorbate (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>), and the epithelial molecule CK-19 showed robust increases in tumor samples from Asc-treated mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>). Acetylation of Î±-tubulin was significantly increased in tumors of Asc-treated mice and in mice treated with Gem+Asc, while Gem treatment alone did not influence Î±-tubulin acetylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par13">Taken together, these <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data indicated that, pharmacological ascorbate inhibited pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis through a pro-oxidative mechanism, subsequently induced NAD+/ATP depletion selectively in cancer cells, and resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. NAD+depletion also caused impairment in Sirt-2 activity, resulted in imbalance of Î±-tubulin acetylation and subsequently inhibited mitosis and metastasis. Pharmacological ascorbate treatment altered tumor stroma by enhancing collagen production. EMT was inhibited, with mechanisms worthy of further investigation. These multiple mechanisms of pharmacological ascorbate work together and result in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic tumor (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4M</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par14">We conducted a Phase I/IIa trial to investigate safety and pharmacokinetic interaction in pancreatic cancer patients using IVC in combination with gemcitabine. Seven participants were enrolled initially and when safety was confirmed, an additional 7 participants were enrolled (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a,b</xref>). Twelve of the 14 enrolled subjects completed phase I pharmacokinetic evaluation composed of IVC and gemcitabine pharmacokinetics each as single drugs followed by pharmacokinetic measurement of IVC combined with gemcitabine (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). These 12 patients entered Phase IIa and received intravenous ascorbate (IVC) 3Ã weekly at the established doses and in conjunction with gemcitabine on the dose and schedule established by the treating oncologist (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).

Six patients had disease progression based on RECIST criteria and were removed from the study (of these six: 5 had treatment prior to enrollment, 1 without pretreatment); 1 voluntarily withdrew for personal reasons; and 4 were withdrawn based on medical issues not related to disease progression, and 1 withdrew because the treatment response made the participant eligible for surgery.

Prior to enrollment, the participant had Stage III pancreatic ductal carcinoma, failed FOLFIRINOX treatment and was on disease progression. The patient was not eligible for surgery because of concerns that the tumor mass involved a mesenteric pancreatic artery (Fig. S3A). After enrollment in the trial, the participant received a total of 70 doses of IVC (64 doses of 100 grams/infusion when in Phase II, and 6 doses from 25â75âg/infusion when in Phase I) and gemcitabine (715âmg/m<sup>2</sup>) for 9 cycles. Imaging showed tumor stabilization/shrinkage and improvement in appearance of margins which became more distinct (Fig. S3A). The patient was then determined suitable for surgical resection. The resected tumor was examined by pathological analysis. Consistent with our pre-clinical data, high levels of collagen content were found in tumor stroma compared to pancreatic ductal carcinoma samples from untreated, FOLFIRINOX treated, or gemcitabine treated patients (Fig. S3B).</p>

                <title>Effect of IVC on Gemcitabine Pharmacokinetics</title>
                <p id="Par18">Pharmacokinetic parameters of individual participant for gemcitabine, its main metabolite dFdU, and ascorbate were evaluated for the 12 participants, by administering each of IVC and gemcitabine alone, and then in combination (TablesÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics were as expected, with a half-life (t Â½) of 15â20âminutes, reflecting rapid deamination to its primary metabolite dFdU, which has a longer t Â½ of ~12 hrs. Cmax and AUC of gemcitabine were also comparable to literature reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6AâC</xref>). There was no difference for Cmax and AUC between the values obtained when gemcitabine was administered by itself (Gem) and when it followed IVC (Gemâ+âIVC), either un-normalized (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), or normalized to gemcitabine dose (i.e. Cmax/D and AUC/D) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A,B</xref>). Only T Â½ of gemcitabine was shortened by 9% (Pâ=â0.003) when combined with IVC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). As gemcitabine is rapidly metabolized to dFdU, this decrease in t Â½ (from 0.28âh to 0.25âh) is unlikely to be clinically significant, and the pharmacokinetics of dFdU should be considered. For dFdU, the values for t Â½, Cmax, and AUC were all comparable to previously reported pharmacokinetic parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and showed no difference when gemcitabine was administered with ascorbate (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6DâF</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters of gemcitabine, dFdU and ascorbate when IVC and gemcitabine were used alone or in combination.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par21">Previous studies indicate that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) formation drives the actions of pharmacological ascorbate against cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Following this mechanism, studies have shown that catalase and/or other antioxidant enzymes in the cells contribute importantly to the cellâs sensitivity to pharmacological ascorbate, so as trans-metals that enhance ROS formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. It is proposed that these mechanisms rendered cancer cells more susceptible than normal cells because cancer cells in these studies were found to have decreased ability to metabolize H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or increased ability to form ROS. A recent study suggested that increased intracellular superoxide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cancer cells can disrupt ion metabolism and enhance intracellular redox cycling of ascorbate by iron ions contributing to selective toxicity and chemo-radio-sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, sensitivity to pharmacological ascorbate treatment seems to involve multiple cellular components and functional pathways in addition to the capacity of metabolizing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. What is apparent is that peroxide formation, mediated by pharmacological ascorbate, is essential for cell death. A thorough understanding is yet to form on the cellular/molecular mechanisms of pharmacological ascorbate action. We postulate that Asc-induced ROS have multiple mechanisms of action on cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, many factors are suggested important in determining the fate of cancer cells after exposure to pharmacological ascorbate, such as hypoxia induced factor (HIF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, KRAS/BRAF status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, P53 status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, glucose and/or ascorbate transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We showed in previous studies that Asc-generated ROS induces DNA damage and ATP depletion, causing downstream AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Described here are several cellular responses that have not been elucidated before. Downstream to DNA damage induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, cellular NAD+ decreases as an effect of PARP activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Decrease of NAD+ triggers different effects in pancreatic cancer cells versus normal cells. First, ATP in pancreatic cancer cells decreases and leads to cell death, while normal cells maintain their ATP levels. This phenomenon has a root in dysregulated glucose metabolism in cancer cells, known as the Warburg Effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, that renders cancer cells less efficient in ATP production than normal cells because they depend on a larger proportion on glycolysis for ATP whereas normal cells depend more on oxidative phosphorylation. Second, lack of NAD+ inhibits activity of Sirt-2, and induces tubulin acetylation, which in turn disrupts dynamics of microtubules. This influences cancer cells that are actively undergoing mitosis and migration. Further, pharmacological ascorbate inhibited EMT, an important process contributing to cancer metastasis. The mechanisms of Asc-induced EMT inhibition is worth further investigation. Finally, pharmacological ascorbate enhanced collagen synthesis in tumor stroma. Despite the controversial reports on the effect of elevated collagen in tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, the increased collagen by pharmacological ascorbate treatment is associated with restriction of tumor invasion in our animal experiment and in the patient description.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Targeting multiple pathways of cancer cells without affecting normal cells could decrease toxicities and the likelihood of emerging resistance, both being serious problems in cancer chemotherapies. Data here show multi-targeting effects of pharmacological ascorbate that favor death/inhibition in cancer cells relative to normal cells. Thus cell sensitivity to pharmacological ascorbate is not likely to be determined by any single pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. For a cancer that has complicated heterogeneity, such as pancreatic cancer, the multi-targeting actions of ascorbate are advantageous, because if inhibition of one target is incomplete, or ultimately fails because of mutations, treatment effects could be exerted through other pathways. A potential problem for multi-targeting agents is collateral/ multiple toxicities. However, pharmacological ascorbate is safe with few adverse events in animals and people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Combination of this unique agent with current 1<sup>st</sup> line chemotherapy or radiation therapy may result in additional synergistic effects in treating tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The FDA recently approved the addition of nab-paclitaxel to gemcitabine (Nabpaxâ+âGem) for treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In a Phase III trial, Nabpaxâ+âGem improved median overall survival (OS) to 8.5 month compared to 6.7 months with gemcitabine. One year survival was 35% and 2 year survival was 9%, significant increases compared to 22% and 4% with gemcitabine. A few smaller Phase II trials with 11â30 patients achieved 12â13.5 months median OS with Nabpaxâ+âGem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. However, the Nabpaxâ+âGem increased grade 3 or higher neutropenia, fatigue and neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Our Phase I/IIa trial with data in 12 patients showed an encouraging median OS of 15.1 months by adding high dose intravenous ascorbate to gemcitabine (IVCâ+âGem). Survival at 1 year was 50%, and at 2 years was 8.3%. We realize that this trial cannot be compared to the Phase III trial using Nabpaxâ+âGem. Our trial had a one-arm design, small sample size, a mixture of prior treated and untreated patients, and a mixture of locally advanced PDAC (4 participants, 33%) and metastatic PDAC (8 participants, 67%) at enrollment. Our results are in agreement with another published trial using similar treatment of IVCâ+âGem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, in which 9 subjects with biopsy-proven stage IV pancreatic cancer were treated with twice weekly IVC and co-current gemcitabine, aiming to establish tolerability and safety of IVC. The dose and duration of IVC treatment were similar in both the reported trial and our trial: escalating from 15âg to the aimed plasma ascorbate level of ~350âmg/dL (ranging from 50 to 125âg/infusion of ascorbate). Treatment duration was 69â556 days. Of the 9 patients completed the treatment, 6 maintained or improved performance status. The overall survival achieved 13âÂ±â2 months, similar to the 15.1 months in our trial. Notably, the patient in our trial who became resection eligible had metastatic disease on Stage III at enrollment, and had failed FOLFIRINOX.</p>
              <p id="Par24">We observed a mix of stable disease, partial response and disease progression in the course of our trial. Although RECIST criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> was used to assess tumor responses, overall response was not selected to be discussed when the trial was designed. With the focus on the Phase I pharmacokinetic analysis of ascorbate with gemcitabine and the intent to enroll based on the participants needed to determine that effect, it is not likely to be able to adequately evaluate response in these limited numbers. Also, our trial did not observe an improved progression-free survival (PFS), compared with gemcitabine or Nabpaxâ+âGem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Except for the small sample size, the lack of improvement in PFS could be secondary to the high drop-out rate and high percentage of pre-treated patients. Eight out of the twelve (67%) patients had failed prior treatments, and had progressive disease at the time of enrollment. Six patients (50%) had disease progression when on the trial. One patient had tumor response and was removed from the trial for surgery resection of the tumor, 4 dropped out because of unrelated medical issues and 1 dropped out for personal reason. These removed or dropped-out patients did not necessarily have disease progress while on the trial, but their withdrawals were counted as time to progress when calculating the PFS, causing an underestimation of PFS for this trial. A larger, more definitive Phase II/III trial is needed to detect efficacy and benefit of IVC.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Independent of the promises in treatment efficacy, an obvious advantage for using IVC in cancer treatment is its low-toxicity, which is now shown repeatedly in more than 10 recent clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Here again, IVC did not add any significant adverse effects (SAE) to gemcitabine chemotherapy. IVC does not alter gemcitabine Cmax and AUC, only shortened gemcitabine half-life (T1/2) by 4âminutes, which was statistically significant. However, as gemcitabine T1/2 is only 16.7âminutes and is quickly metabolized to dFdU which has a much longer half-life of 12âhours, evaluation of dFdU half-life is more clinically meaningful. IVC does not change dFdU half-life, nor does it change Cmax or AUC of dFdU. The conclusion can be made that IVC does not influence gemcitabine pharmacokinetics in any clinically significant way. These data are the first to describe in detail that ascorbate does not change pharmacokinetic parameters of a standard chemotherapeutic agent.</p>

                <p id="Par27">Independent data safety and monitoring oversight was provided by the KUMC Cancer Center Data Safety and Monitoring (DSMB) Committee. The primary objective was to assess safety combining high-dose IV ascorbate (IVC) with gemcitabine chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer not eligible for surgical resection. The secondary objective was to determine if there was drug-drug interaction in terms of pharmacokinetics. Patients with newly diagnosed unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer who declined combination chemotherapy, or patients who progressed on a non-gemcitabine containing treatment were eligible for further screening, requiring them to be ambulatory with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2; have normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status; have adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function; be able to receive chemotherapy for duration prescribed; and not use tobacco products.</p>
                <p id="Par28">Seven subjects were enrolled initially and when safety was confirmed an additional 7 participants were enrolled to total 14 participants. All participants received gemcitabine chemotherapy according to standard of care, and all doses were administered in the KUMC Cancer Center under the direction of the treating oncologist with oversight by co-investigator oncologist. Injectable ascorbic acid (Mylan, Inc. formerly Bioniche Pharma) dosing was established via dose escalation as described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p>

During this time, safety data was collected. Then subjects entered Phase IIa and received IVC 3Ã weekly in conjunction with established gemcitabine dose and schedule, until tumor progression determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or withdrawal for other reasons.

Protein quantification used BCA method (Pierce BCA protein assay kit, Waltham, MA). SDS-PAGE and Western blot was performed as routine. Native PAGE protocol was adapted from a recent publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Briefly, 10âÂµg protein was mixed with equal volume of 2âÃânative sample buffer (Bio-Rad laboratories, Ltd, Hercules, CA), and were loaded onto 8% poly acryl amide gels without SDS. The electrophoresis was at 60âV for 3.5â4âhour. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane for overnight at 4âÂ°C. Dilutions for primary antibodies were anti-Î±-tubulin, anti-HDAC6 anti-vinculin, (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-acetylated Î±-tubulin (1:5000), anti-Sirt-2 (1:500), anti-Î±-TAT (1:1000), anti-flag (1:1000) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). A goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse polyclonal horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was used.

                <p id="Par43">Statistical analysis was performed using SYSTAT 11 software for student T-test for comparison between 2 groups, and using ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni and Holm analysis when comparison involves more than 2 groups, with all groups simultaneously compared. A difference was considered significant at the pâ&lt;â0.05 level. Correlation analysis used the standard Pears Tests. Differences between individual pharmacokinetic parameters for gemcitabine, dFdU, and ascorbate determined from the single agent treatment and from the combined treatment were assessed using a paired t-test when data sets met the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, or using the Wilcoxon signed rank test when normality was not observed.</p>
