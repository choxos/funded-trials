                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>HIV status awareness is important for household contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB). Home HIV testing during TB contact investigation increases HIV status awareness. Social interactions during home visits may influence perceived stigma and uptake of HIV testing. We designed an intervention to normalise and facilitate uptake of home HIV testing with five components: guided selection of first tester; prosocial invitation scripts; opt-out framing; optional sharing of decisions to test; and masking of decisions not to test.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will evaluate the intervention effect in a household-randomised controlled trial. The primary aim is to assess whether contacts offered HIV testing using the norming strategy will accept HIV testing more often than those offered testing using standard strategies. Approximately 198 households will be enrolled through three public health facilities in Kampala, Uganda. Households will be randomised to receive the norming or standard strategy and visited by a community health worker (CHW) assigned to that strategy. Eligible contacts ≥15 years will be offered optional, free, home HIV testing. The primary outcome, proportion of contacts accepting HIV testing, will be assessed by CHWs and analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Secondary outcomes will be changes in perceived HIV stigma, changes in perceived TB stigma, effects of perceived HIV stigma on HIV test uptake, effects of perceived TB stigma on HIV test uptake and proportions of first-invited contacts who accept HIV testing. Results will inform new, scalable strategies for delivering HIV testing.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>An estimated 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV, and more than 15%<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> do not know their status because they are unaware that they are at risk, unable to access counselling and testing, or unwilling to test because of stigma and fear. Layered on to the stigma of HIV is stigma for tuberculosis (TB),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the leading cause of death among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Approximately 40% of those with TB worldwide are unaware of their TB status.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Like HIV-related stigma, TB-related stigma is common and reduces the willingness of at-risk individuals to test for TB and engage in care.</p>
                <p>Testing for HIV is particularly important for close contacts of patients with TB. However, layered HIV–TB stigma introduces social and psychological barriers to testing for HIV and TB during TB contact investigation. Acceptance of home HIV test offers is lower among TB contacts compared with the general population.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> There is a critical need for targeted interventions to address layered stigma, reduce the fear of HIV and TB testing and increase uptake of testing for HIV and/or TB among individuals at high risk.</p>
                <p>Offering testing at home is a promising approach to increase testing and linkage to care for HIV and TB. Home-based HIV testing can reach individuals outside the health system, eliminate the costs of attending clinics for testing and offer testing in a familiar environment. Nevertheless, many individuals offered home HIV testing in sub-Saharan Africa decline. We have previously shown that when HIV testing is offered during TB home visits, social interactions among household members influence perceived stigma and test uptake.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Specifically, when household members discern that others have declined, they say that they fear that testing will be socially discrediting. In adjusted analyses, individuals were four times as likely to decline testing when the first member of their home declined testing as when that individual accepted.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6</xref> Others have shown that misperceived norms influence HIV-related health behaviours.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> A ‘norming’ intervention<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> to facilitate re-evaluation of norms related to HIV testing may increase uptake of testing by exposing individuals to the attitudes, values and behaviours of household members who support HIV testing.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>Nearly a century of research demonstrates that observing the decision-making behaviours of peers profoundly influences perceptions, judgments and subsequent behaviours.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref> Moreover, status and social ties among group members modify their influences on one another. We designed an intervention using established principles from social and behavioural science to facilitate household interactions that reduce stigma and promote uptake of HIV testing. This study will evaluate a novel approach to destigmatising home HIV testing that optimises the social opportunity to test and link to care for HIV. We plan to evaluate this strategy in a randomised controlled trial, and hypothesise that offering and delivering HIV testing in this manner will increase the proportion of TB contacts completing HIV testing and linking to care. The results will inform new, scalable strategies for delivering HIV counselling and testing to key populations. These data will also inform a future factorial experiment and scale-up study to evaluate the effectiveness of each intervention component in increasing uptake of HIV testing and decreasing perceived stigma related to HIV testing in household settings.</p>

                <p>We will carry out a prospective, household cluster-randomised controlled implementation trial evaluating a multicomponent, social and behavioural intervention to reduce household HIV stigma and promote uptake of HIV testing among household members undergoing TB contact investigation. We will recruit multiple-contact households undergoing routine contact investigation for TB, and randomise them to one of two study arms. Households in both arms will receive routine TB contact investigation services, with optional oral HIV testing at no cost to the patient.

                <title>Intervention description</title>
                <p>The intervention is designed to normalise the use of HIV testing in the household and increase detection of HIV. Community health workers (CHWs) will employ acceptance-optimised sequencing of invitations and a prosocial invitation script to offer salivary testing for HIV to household members. We will measure HIV-related and TB-related stigma using standardised, locally validated instruments before invitation and after completion of post-test counselling. We will measure the proportion consenting to HIV testing, the yield of HIV diagnoses and the proportion of new PLWH linked to HIV care. We will also reassess household HIV and TB stigma at 3 months in a subset of participating households. A subset of participants will be contacted at a later point for interviews, focus-group discussions or surveys to better understand the implementation, mechanisms and impact of the intervention.</p>

                  <p>Approximately 152 households including about 304 household contacts are needed to power the primary analysis. For recruitment and randomisation, we will inflate this number by 30% to 198 households to account for non-completion of household visits (ie, losses to follow-up). We analysed power for a two-arm household-randomised controlled trial using mixed model tests for two proportions in a two-level hierarchical design (household, contact). Based on our previous randomised controlled trial of household contact investigation for TB, we assume an average of two household contacts will be eligible for HIV testing per household, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) within households will be 0.59, the proportion consenting to testing in the control group will be 0.85, and proportion consenting to testing in the intervention group will be 0.98.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> With these assumptions, this sample size target will provide 90% power to detect an effect of +0.13 at α=0.05.</p>

Those identified as eligible for both contact investigation and this study will be offered a home visit by the CHW. During the home visit, CHWs will assess all encountered household contacts aged ≥15 for study eligibility and subsequently offer HIV testing. Those not eligible for the study will be offered routine TB contact investigation services per NTLP guidelines.</p>

                  <p>Although CHWs will be blinded to the allocation procedures, blinding them to the assigned strategy is not feasible because the two approaches to test offers are easily distinguishable. CHWs will record the outcome of test acceptance, but CHWs assigned to each arm will be blinded to the outcomes recorded in the other arm. Participants will not be informed about whether they are assigned to the intervention or the standard invitation strategy. Neither the investigators nor the onsite study coordinators managing randomisation will be blinded to allocation, but all will remain blinded to study outcomes until data cleaning is completed after the trial and the database are locked.</p>

                  <title>Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>We will describe enrollment and report baseline characteristics by study arm using simple proportions for categorical variables and measures of central tendency for discrete variables. We will estimate primary and secondary outcomes using simple proportions or probabilities using mixed effects logistic models. We will assess the correlation of outcomes within households by calculating the ICC for test uptake by household. We will compare uptake among intervention households by fitting a multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model with two levels (household, contact), including covariates for characteristics of contacts (age, sex). First, we will compare proportions of first-invited contacts who accept HIV testing between study arms. We will estimate the reliability of the TB case’s nomination of the household contact most likely to test by calculating the proportion of nominated contacts who accept HIV testing offers in each study arm. We will estimate the influence of the first-tester’s decision on subsequent testers’ decisions to test by study arm. For the intervention arm only, we will estimate the effect of the first testers’ disclosure of their decision to test on subsequent testers’ decisions to test. Finally, we will assess the effect of the intervention on HIV and TB stigma by comparing stigma scores between study arms. We will carry out secondary analyses of the association between HIV and TB stigma scores and decision to test for HIV. We will construct models adjusted for imbalances in baseline confounders as needed.</p>

                  <p>After 100 unique household visits have occurred, we will conduct an interim analysis for the purposes of evaluating the sample size target. We will not examine trial outcomes during the interim analysis. Rather, we will calculate the household ICC and mean cluster size for contact HIV test uptake across study arms by fitting a null multilevel model. If the ICC is meaningfully different from our initial sample size calculations (&gt;10% difference higher or lower than our initial estimate of 0.59), or mean cluster size differs by ≥1 participant, we will recalculate sample size and adjust the final sample size accordingly.</p>
