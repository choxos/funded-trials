                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Hookworms infect 730 million people in developing countries where they are a leading cause of intestinal blood loss and iron-deficiency anemia. At the site of attachment to the host, adult hookworms ingest blood and lyse the erythrocytes to release hemoglobin. The parasites subsequently digest hemoglobin in their intestines using a cascade of proteolysis that begins with the <italic>Ancylostoma caninum</italic> aspartic protease 1, APR-1.</p>

                  <title>Methods and Findings</title>
                  <p>We show that vaccination of dogs with recombinant <italic>Ac-</italic>APR-1 induced antibody and cellular responses and resulted in significantly reduced hookworm burdens (<italic>p</italic> = 0.056) and fecal egg counts (<italic>p</italic> = 0.018) in vaccinated dogs compared to control dogs after challenge with infective larvae of <italic>A. caninum</italic>. Most importantly, vaccinated dogs were protected against blood loss (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049) and most did not develop anemia, the major pathologic sequela of hookworm disease. IgG from vaccinated animals decreased the catalytic activity of the recombinant enzyme in vitro and the antibody bound in situ to the intestines of worms recovered from vaccinated dogs, implying that the vaccine interferes with the parasite's ability to digest blood.</p>

                  <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a recombinant vaccine from a hematophagous parasite that significantly reduces both parasite load and blood loss, and it supports the development of APR-1 as a human hookworm vaccine.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hookworms infect more than 700 million people in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The major species infecting humans are <italic>Necator americanus</italic> and <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale.</italic> The parasites feed on blood, causing iron-deficiency anemia, and as such, are a major cause of disease burden in developing countries [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unlike other human helminthiases, worm burdens do not generally decrease with age; in fact, recent findings revealed that the heaviest worm burdens are found among the elderly [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Whereas anthelminthic chemotherapy with benzimidazole drugs is effective in eliminating existing adult parasites, re-infection occurs rapidly after treatment [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], making a vaccine against hookworm disease a desirable goal.</p>
              <p>Canines can be successfully vaccinated against infection with the dog hookworm, <italic>Ancylostoma caninum,</italic> by immunization with third-stage infective larvae (L3) that have been attenuated with ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Subsequently, varying levels of vaccine efficacy have been reported for the major antigens secreted by hookworm L3 using hamsters [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and dogs [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite obtaining encouraging levels of protection with larval antigens, only partial reductions in parasite load (fecal egg counts and adult worm burdens) were reported. Moreover, protective antigens from the larval stage are only expressed by L3, and not adult worms, rendering antibodies against these L3 secretions useless against parasites that have successfully reached adulthood in the gut and begun to feed on blood. We therefore suggest that an ideal hookworm vaccine would require a cocktail of two recombinant proteins, one targeting the infective larva and the second targeting the blood-feeding adult stage of the parasite [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Of the different families of proteins expressed by blood-feeding parasitic helminths, proteolytic enzymes have shown promise as intervention targets for vaccine development [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Proteases are pivotal for a parasitic existence, mediating fundamental physiologic processes such as molting, tissue invasion, feeding, embryogenesis, and evasion of host immune responses [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Parasite extracts enriched for proteases protect sheep against the blood-feeding nematodes <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and <italic>Ostertagia ostertagi</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; however, significant protective efficacy has not been shown with a purified recombinant protease from nematodes of livestock.</p>
              <p>Hookworms feed by burying their anterior ends in the intestinal mucosa of the host, rupturing capillaries and ingesting the liberated blood. Erythrocytes are lysed by pore formation [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], releasing hemoglobin (Hb) into the lumen of the parasite's intestine, where it is degraded by a semi-ordered pathway of catalysis that involves aspartic, cysteine, and metalloproteases [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Vaccination of dogs with a catalytically active recombinant cysteine hemoglobinase, <italic>Ac</italic>-CP-2, induced antibodies that neutralized proteolytic activity and provided partial protection to vaccinees by reducing egg output (a measure of intestinal worm burden) and worm size, but significant reductions of adult worm burdens and/or blood loss were not observed [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Anemia is the primary pathology associated with hookworm infection, and an ultimate human hookworm vaccine would limit the amount of blood loss caused by feeding worms and maintain normal levels of Hb. This is particularly important in young children as well as women of child-bearing age, in whom menstrual, and particularly fetal, Hb demands are considerable, rendering these populations most vulnerable to the parasite [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here we describe vaccination of dogs with the aspartic hemoglobinase of <italic>A. caninum, Ac-</italic>APR-1 [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and show that vaccination resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies, significantly reduced egg counts, and significantly reduced adult worm burdens. Most importantly, Hb levels of vaccinated dogs were significantly higher than those of dogs that were vaccinated with adjuvant alone after parasite challenge. These data show that aspartic hemoglobinases, particularly APR-1, are efficacious vaccines against canine hookworm disease, providing strong support for further investigation and development of APR-1 as a recombinant vaccine against human hookworm disease.</p>

By day 26 postchallenge, there was an 85% reduction in mean egg counts between the two groups. For statistical analyses, we transformed egg counts into log values and ran the test in two ways: (1) comparing the log transformed epgs in the last three egg counts by analysis of variance (Kruskall-Wallis) revealed no significant differences among the groups for the last three egg counts when each time point was considered individually; and (2) comparing pooled data from the last three egg counts using a Mann-Whitney test (APR-1 versus control), revealed a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.018).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Here we describe protective vaccination of dogs with a recombinant aspartic hemoglobinase, a pivotal enzyme in the initiation of Hb digestion in the gut of canine hookworms [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We show that APR-1 provides the best efficacy thus far reported for a recombinant vaccine aimed at reducing hookworm egg counts, intestinal worm burdens, and hookworm-induced blood loss.</p>
              <p>The vaccine efficacy of recombinant <italic>Ac-</italic>APR-1 expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells was described earlier by us [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; however, this initial vaccine trial was hampered by limited availability of the recombinant protein: Suboptimal doses were used and antibody responses (titers &lt;10,000) were first observed just 1 wk following the third (and final) immunization, and only in some dogs. Despite the weak antibody responses, a statistically significant reduction in mean (18%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and median (23%) hookworm burdens were observed. In addition there was a shift of adult hookworms from the small intestine to the colon [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, no reduction in the mean fecal egg counts were observed, and hematologic parameters were not assessed. The improved immunogenicity of APR-1 observed in this study might also be attributed to use of the adjuvant AS03 compared with alhydrogel in the previous study. We have shown in a head-to-head comparison of a hookworm cysteine hemoglobinase formulated with different adjuvants (including alhydrogel) that AS03-formulated protein generated higher antibody titers and afforded greater protection to vaccinated dogs [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, we show that yeast-derived APR-1 provides the best efficacy thus far reported for a recombinant vaccine aimed at reducing hookworm load and potential transmission. Moreover, we show that vaccination protects against the pathology associated with worm-induced blood loss, or hookworm disease.</p>
              <p>Hookworms bury their anterior ends into the intestinal mucosa to feed, secreting anticoagulants to promote blood flow and stop clot formation at the site of attachment (reviewed in [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Numerous anticoagulant peptides have been reported from hookworms [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and their combined activities result in âleakageâ of blood around the attachment site and into the host intestine [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is not known whether the majority of blood loss during a hookworm infection is due to leakage around the feeding site or from ingested blood that enters the parasite's alimentary canal for nutritional purposes. To address this, attempts have been made to measure blood lost from the anus of <italic>A. caninum</italic> (i.e., blood that has passed through the parasite's alimentary canal); varying calculations have been proposed ranging from 0.14â0.8 ml blood expelled over 24 h per adult worm (reviewed in [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Whatever the true figure is, significant blood loss occurs via this route, supporting the hypothesis that vaccination with APR-1 damages that parasite's intestine and results in decreased blood intake (and blood loss) by feeding worms.</p>
              <p>The immunological parameters required for vaccine-induced protection against hookworm infection were, until recently, poorly defined. Protection against <italic>A. caninum</italic> by vaccination of dogs with radiation-attenuated L3 was reported many years ago [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, it was not until recently that murine [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and canine [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] studies revealed the protective mechanisms of the irradiated larval vaccine at a cellular level. These studies suggested that a T-helper type-2 response is induced by vaccination with irradiated L3; however the authors did not prove that a T-helper type-1 response abrogates protection. In our study reported here, dogs vaccinated with APR-1 generated strong memory responses to the recombinant antigen and did not secrete Th-2 cytokines but instead secreted IFN-Î³ in response to stimulation with recombinant APR-1. Moreover, the dominant antibody isotype induced by vaccination was IgG2, suggesting that a Th-1-like response was generated. Unlike the clear association between IgG2 and type I cytokines such as IFN-Î³ in mice and humans, little is known about this association in dogs. Experimental evidence using the canine model suggests that immune responses (Th1 versus Th2) are, however, linked to isotype production. For example, animals infected with and protected against visceral leishmaniasis (Th1 response) or <italic>Salmonella</italic> (also a Th1 response) mount a higher IgG2 than IgG1 response [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our data [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] show that dogs immunized with irradiated hookworm larvae demonstrated a stronger production of IgG1 (also supported by [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) which accompanied IL-4 production, implying a Th2 cytokine response in dogs is accompanied by the same immunoglobulin isotypes seen in humans and mice. Based on the current data, we cannot conclude that a Th-1 response to APR-1 is required to obtain protection; however, it does not inhibit the development of a protective memory response. It should also be considered that successful immunity to the different developmental stages of hookworms might require very different immune response phenotypes, not unlike those seen in schistosomiasis [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Further studies will explore the effects of vaccination with APR-1 formulated with different adjuvants and co-factors (e.g., cytokines) that will promote a Th2 response.</p>
              <p>Hematophagous helminths require blood as a source of nutrients to mature and reproduce. Female schistosomes ingest 13 times as many erythrocytes and ingest them about nine times faster than male worms [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, mRNAs encoding Hb-degrading proteases of schistosomes are overexpressed in female worms [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although similar studies have yet to be performed for hookworms, female hookworms are bigger than males and lay up to 10,000 eggs per day, implying that they have a greater metabolism and therefore greater demand for erythrocytes<bold>.</bold>
<italic>Ac-</italic>APR-1 degrades Hb in the gut lumen of the worm, and it is therefore not surprising that interruption of the function of APR-1 via the action of neutralizing antibodies has a deleterious effect on the establishment of worms, particularly females and their subsequent egg production. We observed a similar (although not as pronounced) phenomenon when dogs were vaccinated with the cysteine hemoglobinase, <italic>Ac-</italic>CP-2, followed by challenge infection with <italic>A. caninum</italic> L3 [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Vaccination with CP-2, however, did not result in reduced adult worm burdens or reduced blood loss, essential attributes of an efficacious hookworm vaccine.</p>
              <p>Vaccination of livestock and laboratory animals with aspartic proteases of other nematodes, as well as trematode helminths, has resulted in antifecundity/antiembryonation effects. Immunization of sheep with the intestinal brush border complex, H-gal-GP, confers high levels of protection (both antiparasite and antifecundity) against <italic>H. contortus</italic> and at least three different protease activities, including aspartic proteases, have been detected in this extract [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Immunization of sheep with aspartic protease-enriched fractions of <italic>H. contortus</italic> membranes resulted in 36% reduction in adult worms and 48% reduction in fecal egg output [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Vaccination of sheep with denatured <italic>H. contortus</italic> proteases or recombinant proteases expressed in bacteria, however, did not confer protection, suggesting that conformational epitopes are important in protection [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Vaccination of mice with recombinant aspartic protease of the human blood fluke, <italic>Schistosoma mansoni,</italic> resulted in 21%â38% reduction in adult parasites after challenge with infective cercariae; however a reduction in eggs deposited in the liver (the cause of most pathology in schistosomiasis) was not detected [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Protective efficacy of aspartic proteases has been observed against fungal pathogens as well. Vaccination of mice with secreted aspartic proteases of <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> known virulence factors in candidiasis, protected animals against a lethal challenge infection and inhibited colonization of fungi in the kidneys [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, passive transfer of serum from vaccinated animals conferred protection, pointing towards an antibody-mediated protective mechanism.</p>
              <p>Almost all of the pathology and morbidity of human hookworm infection results from intestinal blood loss caused by large numbers of adult hookworms. Depending on host iron and protein stores, a range of hookworm intensities, equivalent to burdens of 40 to 160 worms, is associated with Hb levels below 11 gÂ·dl<sup>â1</sup>, the World Health Organization threshold for anemia. In Tanzania, Nepal, and Vietnam where host iron stores are generally depleted, there is a direct correlation between the number of adult hookworms in the intestine and host blood loss [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore the optimal hookworm vaccine will be one that either prevents L3 from developing into adult blood-feeding hookworms, or one that blocks the establishment, survival, and fecundity of the adult parasites in the intestine [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Achieving both goals will likely require a vaccine cocktail comprised of an L3 antigen, such as ASP-2 now under clinical development [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and an adult gut protease, such as APR-1.</p>
              <p>An effective hookworm vaccine need not attain 100% efficacy. Unlike many unicellular organisms that reproduce asexually within the host, nematodes need to sexually reproduce. Therefore, small numbers of adult worms will generate fewer eggs to contaminate the environment, and subsequently reduce transmission. More importantly, because hookworms are blood feeders, a partial reduction in adult worm burden equates to a decrease in pathology, notably iron-deficiency anemia [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Mathematical modeling of schistosomiasis in China showed that elimination of the parasite could be attained using an antifecundity vaccine that targets egg output with 75% efficacy [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and it is likely that a similar scenario applies to long-term elimination of soil-transmitted helminths such as hookworms. An orthologue of <italic>Ac-</italic>APR-1 has been reported from the major human hookworm, <italic>N. americanus</italic> [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 is structurally and antigenically very similar to <italic>Ac-</italic>APR-1 and also functions as a hemoglobinase [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For this reason, we believe that APR-1 is now the major vaccine antigen from the adult stage of the parasite, and as such, <italic>Na-</italic>APR-1 should undergo process development and enter into Phase I clinical trials as a vaccine for human hookworm infection. This vaccine strategy is now being implemented for a larval hookworm antigen, with Phase 1 human trials using ASP-2 formulated with Alhydrogel already underway [<xref rid="pmed-0020295-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Based on the data reported here, APR-1 may also be selected for downstream process development, manufactured under good clinical manufacturing processes, and tested in the clinic.</p>

                      <title>Background</title>
                      <p>Hookworms are parasites of the intestines. They can infect many animals, including dogs, cats, and people. Worldwide, about one person in five has a hookworm infection. Most of these one billion people live in tropical countries. Hookworm is not spread from person to person, because at one stage of its lifecycle, the parasite needs to be in the soil. In areas where hookworm is common, people who have contact with soil that contains human feces are at high risk of infection; because children play on soil and often go barefoot, they have the greatest risk. Infection leads to blood loss and a decrease in the amount of iron, and this causes anemia (i.e., because of a lack of iron, the blood cannot carry oxygen efficiently). There are effective drugs to treat the infection, but they do not prevent the patient from becoming re-infected. Making a vaccine against hookworm is therefore a priority. Some vaccines for use in animals have already been developed, but their effectiveness is limited to one stage of the hookworm's lifecycle. The aim is to find a vaccine that works against more than one of the stages that the parasite passes through in its lifecycle.</p>

                      <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
                      <p>The researchers focused on two enzymes the parasite needs in order to live. Building on earlier research and using a species of hookworm that affects dogs, the researchers aimed to make these enzymes the âtargetâ of a vaccine. They first vaccinated dogs, then infected them with hookworm. These dogs had fewer parasites than dogs that had not been vaccinated. Most importantly, vaccinated dogs were protected against blood loss, and most did not develop anemia. Laboratory tests confirmed that the target enzymes had been damaged.</p>

                      <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
                      <p>This is the best result so far for a hookworm vaccine used in dogs. The authors believe that, as well as reducing parasite numbers, the vaccine reduces the ability of the parasite to take in blood, which would explain the reduction in anemia. The researchers have called for trials to begin with a vaccine targeted against similar enzymes in the species of hookworm that most commonly affects humans.</p>
