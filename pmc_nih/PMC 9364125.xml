                <sec id="ab-zoi220719-1">
                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Can peer-led behavioral interventions in the emergency department for patients who have had a recent opioid overdose increase short-term treatment engagement after the emergency department visit?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi220719-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial of 648 emergency department patients at high risk of opioid overdose, there was no difference in treatment engagement within 30 days of the visit for participants who received a peer-led intervention vs those who received a standard behavioral intervention by a clinical social worker (32% vs 30%).</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi220719-3">
                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>An emergency department–based behavioral intervention is likely effective in promoting treatment engagement, but who delivers the intervention may be less influential on short-term outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Overall, this study found that a substantial proportion of participants in both groups engaged in SUD treatment within 30 days of the ED visit. An ED-based behavioral intervention is likely effective in promoting treatment engagement, but who delivers the intervention may be less influential on short-term outcomes.

              <p>In 2021, more opioid overdose deaths were recorded in the United States than in any prior year,<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and opioid-related visits to US emergency departments (EDs) increased 4-fold from 2008 to 2018.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Patients admitted to an ED for an overdose are at greatly elevated risk for a subsequent nonfatal overdose and overdose death.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Thus, the ED encounter has been presented as both a critical and opportune time to prevent recurrent opioid overdoses and death through increased uptake in addiction treatment and provision of other harm reduction and recovery services.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, there is limited evidence on the most effective ways to promote engagement in treatment after discharge from an ED.</p>
              <p>As 1 potential solution, peer-led behavioral interventions delivered by certified peer recovery specialists have been implemented in EDs throughout the country. Peer support has a well-established role in community-based treatment and recovery approaches,<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> but only more recently has it been integrated into ED staffing models. To our knowledge, there is a paucity of studies rigorously evaluating peer recovery support services, and to date, none have been conducted in the ED setting.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Pilot programs of ED-based peer support have shown promise in increasing access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and care,<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> but it is still unknown whether a peer-led approach is more effective than other approaches. We sought to compare the effectiveness of a peer-led behavioral intervention vs a standard one to increase treatment uptake among ED patients who were at greatest risk of accidental drug-related death.</p>

                <title>Trial Design</title>
                <p>This study was a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial in which patients at high risk for opioid overdose who presented to the ED were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a behavioral intervention from either a certified peer recovery specialist (“peer”) or a licensed clinical social worker (“social worker”). At the outset, we had also intended to enroll a companion cohort of control participants who refused any intervention (as part of the study or clinical care), but this was closed for futility 6 months after launch. Participants completed baseline assessments and consented to review of electronic health records and linkage to state administrative data (including substance use treatment records) to objectively assess the study outcomes. The full study protocol (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03684681" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03684681</ext-link>) has been published elsewhere (trial protocol and statistical analysis plan in <xref rid="note-ZOI220719-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Ethical approval was obtained from the Lifespan institutional review board. All participants provided written informed consent. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/" ext-link-type="uri">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.</p>

                <title>Setting, Timeline, and Population</title>
                <p>The study was conducted in 2 EDs in Rhode Island, one in an academic tertiary care hospital and the other in a high-volume, community-based affiliate. The 2 EDs combined have more than 170 000 adult visits annually and receive approximately 50% of all the overdose-related ED visits in Rhode Island.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Recruitment occurred from November 15, 2018, to May 31, 2021. There was a brief pause in enrollment during April and May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A consecutive sample of patients presenting to the ED (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) was assessed for eligibility by study research staff.</p>
                <p>To be eligible, participants must have met 1 of the following criteria: they were in the ED for an opioid overdose at the time of the visit, they received treatment related to an opioid use disorder (OUD) (eg, infectious complication or opioid withdrawal) at the time of the visit, or they were identified as having had an opioid overdose within the previous 12 months (self-report or electronic health record review). The presence of an opioid overdose at the ED visit was determined by the treating physician and was generally defined as (1) the presence of decreased levels of consciousness or respiratory depression, (2) occurring after the consumption of opioids, and (3) resolving after the administration of naloxone. Potential participants were deemed ineligible if they were previously enrolled in the trial, were in police custody or incarcerated, were pregnant, predominantly lived outside of Rhode Island, or were unable to provide informed consent.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>The trial was conducted using the existing infrastructure. Participants received a behavioral intervention delivered by either a peer or a social worker. Before the trial started, it was standard of care to receive a behavioral intervention in the ED after an opioid overdose, but not necessarily for OUD in general. Both social workers and peers were available to provide behavioral interventions in the ED, but this consultation was performed at the discretion of the treating physician. In accordance with quality data, approximately half of all patients with a visit for opioid overdose received a behavioral intervention, with approximately equal numbers consulting a social worker vs a peer.</p>
                <p>Social workers were employed by the recruitment sites (hospitals). They were chosen as the active comparator group because they are often extant staff within hospital systems. A community-based organization in Rhode Island (Anchor Recovery Community Center<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220719r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>) provided the certified peer recovery specialist staff for the study. Individuals employed as a certified peer recovery specialist have had at least 2 years of recovery and completed a 45-hour training program with supervised work experience (500 hours). The training program is based on the trauma-informed model of care and the transtheoretic model of behavior change, with focus on wellness and recovery, motivational interviewing, mentoring, and advocacy.</p>
                <p>Both groups of interventionists underwent training before study initiation and then regular, standard training according to their standard practice. Because this trial was an effectiveness study, we did not monitor or ensure the fidelity of the interventions throughout the study. Both groups of interventionists were trained to administer a range of evidence-based interviewing and intervention techniques to support patients who are attending the ED for an opioid overdose or who are identified as having an OUD. A key distinction is that social workers rely on clinical experience and social work theory and practice, whereas peers draw on lived experience of SUD and recovery to inform the intervention. Throughout the study, both the peers and social workers were expected to respond to a consultation within 30 minutes of request. Both social workers and peer interventionists aimed to address the immediate and long-term needs of clients, such as take-home naloxone and SUD treatment access, but also other factors, such as housing and transportation. The social work intervention was delivered as a onetime, generally brief intervention without contact after ED discharge. Although there was no time limit to the intervention, most lasted less than 30 minutes. Peers also delivered a brief intervention in the ED, but they also continued contact after ED discharge. After the ED visit, the peers followed protocol and initiated and continued contact with individuals for 3 months (daily for the first 10 days and then weekly unless services were decreased) in accordance with their standard practice.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> On review of quality data, peers were able to make contact with 85% of participants within the first 10 days after the ED visit. Participants could opt in to ongoing peer-support services beyond 3 months from the community-based organization. Participants in both groups received usual clinical care services, including naloxone, electronic referrals to SUD treatment, and, if interested, prescriptions for medications for OUD (mainly buprenorphine).</p>

                <title>Outcomes and Measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcomes of the trial were engagement with a formal SUD treatment program within 30 days of the initial ED visit and recurrent ED visits for a suspected opioid overdose during 18 months. A major strength of this study is that both end points were assessed via linkage to statewide administrative databases, as outlined later. We report herein on the first end point (treatment engagement) because participant follow-up for the second primary end point (ED visit for opioid overdose) is still under way and will not be completed until November 2022. There was not an a priori stopping rule based on the first end point, and analysis for the second end point is expected to commence in early 2023. Treatment engagement was defined as admission to a formal, publicly licensed SUD treatment program or receipt of office-based medication for OUD within 30 days of the initial ED visit—specifically, an inpatient detoxification program, outpatient or residential treatment programs, or outpatient medication for OUD (ie, methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone).<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The outcome was assessed with deterministic linkages to the Behavioral Health Online Database, a state database containing information on all admission and discharge events of clients of all behavioral health care organizations licensed by the Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Participants who received buprenorphine or naltrexone in office-based settings were identified via linkage to the state’s prescription drug monitoring program, maintained by the Rhode Island Department of Health.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> As detailed in the study protocol, a comprehensive biobehavioral questionnaire was administered at enrollment and included questions about demographic characteristics (eg, self-reported race and ethnicity, gender identity, and sex at birth) and substance use (eg, past use, SUD treatment, and self-reported readiness for change).<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Sample Size</title>
                <p>In accordance with quality improvement data, we assumed that 23 of 325 participants (7%) randomly assigned to receive a behavioral intervention from a social worker would enroll in a formal SUD treatment program within 30 days of their ED visit. A sample size of 650 participants would provide at least 80% power to detect a 2-fold increase in treatment engagement (ie, 14%) among participants assigned to receive a behavioral intervention from a peer recovery specialist; this increase was identified as an appropriate benchmark by a group of key stakeholders that included clinicians, policy makers, and patient advocacy representatives.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>To determine the success of randomization, we described and compared (eg, using the χ<sup>2</sup> test or the <italic>t</italic> test) the distribution of baseline characteristics stratified by the study group. For evaluation of our primary end point, we used an intention-to-treat approach to estimate the average treatment effect. We compared the differences in the primary end point between treatment groups using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed to examine enrollment in any SUD program according to reason for ED visit (ie, opioid overdose–related vs nonoverdose-related visit) and SUD treatment exposure in the 30 days before enrollment. Specifically, 4 log-binomial regression analyses were conducted: without adjustment (model 1); with adjustment for block randomization variables (ie, site, aged &lt;50 years, and sex at birth [model 2]); an interaction term between intervention group and reason for ED visit (model 3) with adjustment for randomization variables; and an interaction term between intervention group and prior or curent SUD treatment exposure (model 4). The results from models 3 and 4 were summarized according to established guidelines for reporting interaction.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> All analyses were conducted with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), with a priori levels of significance set to .05 and hypothesis tests conducted as 2 sided.</p>

Overall, 442 of the participants identified as male (68.2%) and 206 as female (31.8%). A total of 17 were American Indian or Alaska Native (2.6%); 3 were Asian (0.5%); 39 were Black, African, Haitian, or Cape Verdean (6.0%); 107 were Hispanic (16.5%); 61 were of mixed race, biracial, or multiracial (9.4%); 3 were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (0.5%); 541 were non-Hispanic (83.5%); 444 were White (68.5%); and 62 (9.6%) were of other race (race and ethnicity were self-reported, and no further level of detail for “other” was available). More than half of enrolled participants (353 [54.5%]) were attending the ED for reasons other than opioid-related overdose, whereas slightly less than half (293 [45.4%]) were identified as having had a recent overdose. Half of participants had reported injecting drugs in their lifetime. A large proportion of participants (500 of 627 [79.7%]) reported adverse social determinants of health, including unstable housing, current unemployment (450 [69.4%]), and a current monthly income of $0 (158 [24.4%]).</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Initial screening of electronic health records identified 10 815 potentially eligible individuals attending the ED from November 15, 2018, to May 31, 2021. After ongoing detailed review and application of electronic health record eligibility criteria, 2236 individuals (20.7%) met the eligibility criteria and were approached to participate (<xref rid="zoi220719f1" ref-type="fig">Figure</xref>). An additional 429 individuals were referred by their treating physician. Of the 2665 individuals who completed in-person screening, 658 (24.7%) consented to participate, and 648 (24.3%) were randomly assigned to study groups (social worker, 325 participants; peer, 323 participants). Most participants (627 of 648 [96.8%]) completed the intervention; of those who did not, 2 (1 in each group) did not receive any intervention, and the remaining 19 met with the interventionist but left the ED before completing the interaction. The most-cited reason for not completing the intervention was “not wanting to wait.” In alignment with intention-to-treat principles, all randomized participants were analyzed (n = 648) regardless of whether the intervention was completed.</p>

                <p>Among the participants who reported plans to change their drug use (562 of 648 [86.7%]), 472 (72.8%) indicated they might do so that day. Most participants had reported previous experience with treatment for an SUD (497 of 630 [78.9%]), with a similar proportion reporting experience with methadone (253 [39.0%]) and buprenorphine (236 [36.4%]). Approximately one-quarter of participants (185 [28.5%]) reported receiving treatment at enrollment. Barriers to access were common among participants, with one-third (226 [34.9%]) reporting ever experiencing difficulty initiating a treatment program. In addition, 269 participants (41.5%) were interested in receiving a referral for an SUD treatment program at the visit, and 255 (39.4%) were very or somewhat interested in starting medication for OUD. Eighty participants (12.3%) were interested in starting buprenorphine at the visit.</p>

                <title>Primary Outcome</title>
                <p>We observed no significant difference between the 2 groups in enrollment in an SUD treatment program within 30 days of the ED visit, with 98 of 325 participants (30%) and 103 of 323 participants (32%) in the social worker and peer groups experiencing this outcome, respectively (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI220719-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). The relative risk of the outcome was not significantly different between the 2 groups in the unadjusted log-binomial model or when adjusting for block randomization variables (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI220719-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Results were similar when the interaction between study group and reason for the ED visit (overdose or nonoverdose visit) was examined, with no significant interaction between them (<xref rid="zoi220719t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI220719-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Individuals with prior SUD treatment were more likely to engage in post-ED treatment in both intervention groups (social worker: relative risk, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.86-3.40]); peer: relative risk, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.86-3.50]) (<xref rid="zoi220719t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI220719-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). However, there was no significant interaction between study group and history of SUD treatment before enrollment; in other words, there was no difference in outcomes between study groups after accounting for SUD treatment before enrollment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this large, randomized clinical trial of 2 different behavioral interventions in the ED for patients at high risk of opioid overdose, there was no difference in SUD treatment uptake within 30 days of the ED visit between participants who received a peer-led intervention and those who had an intervention delivered by a licensed clinical social worker. To our knowledge, this trial represents the first systematic evaluation of behavioral interventions delivered in the ED for patients at high risk of opioid overdose and is also the first to examine whether a peer-based model is more effective than a brief onetime intervention delivered by a clinical social worker.</p>
              <p>Substance use disorder treatment uptake within 30 days of the ED visit was high in both study groups compared with that in previous studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> with nearly one-third of patients accessing treatment within this time frame. Moreover, this proportion may underrepresent the total number of participants who accessed treatment because it would not reflect certain services (eg, out-of-state or private programs not licensed by the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals). Since the introduction of the standards of care for patients presenting for opioid overdose in Rhode Island, 50% to 75% of eligible patients received a referral to SUD treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> There are limited data on the historical rates of SUD uptake after an ED visit, although referrals to SUD treatment during an ED visit have previously ranged from 9% to 20% in our setting.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In the review of quality improvement data from the Rhode Island Department of Health (from April 2016 to March 2021), 22.5% of all patients who visited 1 of the 2 study EDs after an opioid overdose subsequently engaged in treatment in the 30 days after their visit. This estimate uses the same data sources and outcome definition as this study and also includes some of the study participants who were attending the ED after an overdose. It is likely, then, that the rates of engagement observed in our study are higher than previously noted, supporting the idea that a behavioral intervention in the ED is an opportunity to direct patients to SUD treatment, regardless of the person who delivers it.</p>
              <p>The ED visit for overdose has often been suggested as a teachable moment<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>; however, this concept was born out of early literature in other disease states (eg, smoking cessation counseling after a new cancer diagnosis). In addition, previous studies of ED-based behavioral interventions for SUD have had mixed results, calling into question this approach.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> It is also unknown whether the overdose visit itself is the most appropriate opportunity for many patients; the psychosocial and physiologic circumstances of the overdose event may actually make it a difficult time to successfully engage patients. Indeed, patients with OUD may not perceive the ED as a suitable location for OUD treatment, in part because of prior experiences of stigmatization and discrimination by ED staff, minimization of their medical needs, and inadequate resources for EDs to provide treatment for OUD.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, in our subgroup analysis, there were no meaningful differences in treatment engagement after the ED visit between individuals who were there after an overdose and those who were there for other reasons but who were identified as having had a recent overdose or an OUD-related visit. This suggests that continued engagement after an overdose visit is important but that other patients at high risk should also be considered candidates for a behavioral intervention.</p>
              <p>In a subgroup analysis, we observed that individuals with a treatment history were more than twice as likely to engage in treatment compared with those without one. This finding was consistent across both intervention groups. However, a significant proportion of individuals without prior treatment exposure still engaged in treatment (143 of 648 [22%]), suggesting that, although individuals with prior treatment may be more amenable to reengagement, the lack of treatment history should not discount a willingness to engage. To reflect the actual situation that would be encountered in the ED, we chose to allow people to enter the study regardless of treatment history.</p>
              <p>Although our study findings describe the average effects of treatment, there may be individual or subgroup causal effects not identified by this study design. Patient perspectives and experiences are also not measured in this study, and it is likely that some patients respond better to a peer than to a social worker. Future studies might examine predictors of treatment response within each study group to begin to understand this question. Finally, peers maintain contact with participants for the initial 90 days and use harm-reduction principles compared with the onetime interaction with social workers. It is therefore possible that there is a difference in treatment engagement beyond 30 days or an effect on recurrent overdose. Data collection addressing these secondary end points is in progress.</p>
              <p>Given the high rates of treatment engagement after the ED visit, our data suggest that a behavioral intervention should be incorporated into routine ED care. Given the amount of time our interventionists spent at the bedside, a dedicated individual is likely needed to do this (beyond ED clinicians and nurses). In some health systems, this may be clinical social work staff, but in some EDs, peers or community health workers might be a more feasible resource.</p>
              <sec id="H2-10-ZOI220719">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>A few limitations should be noted when this study’s findings are interpreted. First, research assistants had contact with the participants in both groups. Although research staff were instructed and trained not to be involved in the intervention, it is possible that their interactions during consent or even during the self-administered assessments had an influence on participants, potentially making the groups more similar and thus biasing results toward the null. Second, as a pragmatic trial, we did not control or assess the fidelity of the intervention. Although our results reflect actual outcomes, it is possible that the interventions would have performed differently if they had been tightly controlled. Third, our study outcomes were captured with administrative data. Although this is a key strength of our study design, it is possible that participants could receive treatment that would not be captured by our data (eg, out-of-state or private programs not licensed by Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals). Although we do not believe it to be the case, if differential misclassification occurred, results would be further biased toward the null. Recovery from SUD has been described as a nonlinear process that often involves multiple recovery attempts.<sup><xref rid="zoi220719r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Participants may have varied in the number of recovery attempts, with some participants being further along in their process and more willing to enter into SUD treatment. This was not captured in our study and could lead to residual confounding. Fourth, our study lacked a true control group. For a variety of reasons, including standards of care in the state where this study was conducted, it was thought that randomly assigning patients to a sham intervention was unethical. Unfortunately, we cannot conclude that the behavioral interventions tested are superior to no intervention. Historical data suggest that this is not the case, and future work might seek to resolve this through causal inference methods using already collected data.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study suggests that an ED-based behavioral intervention is likely effective in promoting treatment engagement but that the person delivering the intervention may have less influence regarding the likelihood of a patient’s entering treatment immediately after the ED visit. Work is still needed to determine whether a peer-led intervention affects outcomes beyond 30 days or reduces the number of recurrent overdoses. In the era of highly potent synthetic opioids, highly responsive (ie, consultations within 30 minutes) ED-based interventions using appropriately trained personnel who support patients in accessing SUD treatment are vital. The outcomes from this study support the broad implementation of these services, irrespective of who would be providing them, in areas with high opioid overdose burden.</p>
