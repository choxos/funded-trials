                  <p>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mealtime or post‐meal fast‐acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) vs mealtime insulin aspart (IAsp), both in combination with insulin degludec, in participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This multicentre, treat‐to‐target trial (Clinical trial registry: NCT02500706, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) randomized participants to double‐blind mealtime faster aspart (<italic>n</italic> = 342) or IAsp (<italic>n</italic> = 342) or open‐label post‐meal faster aspart (<italic>n</italic> = 341). The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks post randomization. All available information, regardless of treatment discontinuation, was used for evaluation of the effect.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Non‐inferiority for the change from baseline in HbA1c was confirmed for mealtime and post‐meal faster aspart vs IAsp (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: 95%CI, −0.02% [−0.11; 0.07] and 0.10% [0.004; 0.19], respectively).

              <p>To reduce the incidence and slow the progression of diabetes‐related complications, guidelines recommend HbA1c target levels.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Achievement of the conventionally accepted HbA1c target &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) usually requires postprandial glycaemic control.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Exogenous mealtime insulin administration aims to mimic the physiological secretion pattern of insulin to control postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions. There is an unmet need for mealtime insulin that better mimics physiological control, while enhancing flexibility and treatment convenience for patients. The development in basal insulin analogues, including ultra‐long‐acting and high‐concentration insulins, such as insulin degludec (degludec) and glargine U300,<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> is now being complemented by emergence of ultra‐fast‐acting mealtime insulins. These agents incorporate modifications to insulin formulations to accelerate absorption and thereby improve insulin time–action and PPG‐lowering profiles.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Fast‐acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is a faster‐acting mealtime insulin with a more rapid rate of absorption into the bloodstream and greater early‐glucose‐lowering effect than conventional insulin aspart (IAsp).<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Faster aspart has been approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as treatment for diabetes in adults.</p>
              <p>In the onset 1 trial, the efficacy and safety of faster aspart were evaluated as part of a basal–bolus regimen with insulin detemir (detemir) in participants with T1D.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> A statistically significant, yet modest, improvement in HbA1c was observed with mealtime faster aspart compared with IAsp after 26 weeks of treatment (estimated treatment difference [ETD], −0.15% [95%CI, −0.23; −0.07]; −1.62 mmol/mol [−2.50; −0.73]), with a superior reduction in 2‐hour PPG increment during a standardized meal test.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> This improvement in glycaemic control was maintained after 52 weeks of treatment.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Faster aspart administered 20 minutes after the start of the meal was non‐inferior (0.4% margin) to mealtime IAsp regarding change in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>
</p>
              <p>To date, no studies comparing faster aspart with IAsp in a basal–bolus regimen with ultra‐long‐acting basal insulins are available. The onset 8 study is similar in design to the onset 1 study, and aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of faster aspart in conjunction with degludec in participants with T1D. The onset 8 study was designed to quantify a population average effect, irrespective of adherence to randomized treatment and ancillary therapy use. The primary objective was to estimate the effect based on difference in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks under these circumstances. As it can sometimes be challenging to administer bolus insulin before a meal, a post‐meal faster aspart arm (administration within 20 minutes after start of the meal) was also included to further evaluate the option of administering faster aspart after a meal when needed.</p>

In a third, open‐label treatment arm, participants received post‐meal faster aspart (Figure <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Faster aspart and IAsp were delivered in a basal–bolus regimen in conjunction with once‐daily degludec. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice. The study was conducted at 146 centres in 12 countries/regions (Appendix <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).

                  <p>After a two‐week screening period, an eight‐week run‐in period allowed for basal insulin titration, and participants switched from their existing basal insulin analogue to degludec (100 U/mL, 3‐mL pen injector) at the start, based on protocol‐specified guidelines (Table <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). During the run‐in period, the investigator titrated degludec on a weekly basis to the pre‐breakfast glycaemic target of 4.0 to 5.0 mmol/L in accordance with titration guidelines (Table <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Further adjustment of degludec during the treatment period was performed at the investigator's discretion.</p>

                  <title>Bolus dosing during the trial</title>
                  <p>At the start of the run‐in period, participants switched from their previous bolus insulin to IAsp (all bolus insulins supplied as 100 U/mL, 3‐mL pen injector) on a unit‐for‐unit basis. IAsp dose was not adjusted during the run‐in period unless considered necessary by the investigator. At the end of the run‐in period, participants with HbA1c at 9.5% (80 mmol/mol) or less were randomized 1:1:1 to receive double‐blind mealtime IAsp, double‐blind mealtime faster aspart or open‐label post‐meal faster aspart. Mealtime insulins were injected 0 to 2 minutes before a meal, while post‐meal faster aspart was injected at the end of a meal, no later than 20 minutes after the start of the meal.</p>
                  <p>During the 26‐week treatment period, bolus insulin was titrated to achieve a glycaemic target of pre‐prandial and bedtime plasma glucose (PG) between 4.0 and 6.0 mmol/L. Participants who were considered proficient in carbohydrate counting continued using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period, while all other participants used a predefined bolus‐dosing algorithm (Table <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Meal carbohydrate content and pre‐prandial BG values were used to determine bolus‐insulin doses for participants, based on flexible dosing principles. Doses were calculated several times daily by each participant based on the insulin:carbohydrate ratio and insulin correction factor. Weekly review of the ratio and correction factor was performed by the investigator, based on each participant's self‐measured blood glucose (SMBG) values. In the event of hypoglycaemia, the dose could be reduced at the investigator's discretion.</p>

Before randomization at Week 0 (baseline), a bolus dose of IAsp was administered (0.1 U/kg, calculated by investigator), followed by a standardized mixed liquid‐meal test (78 g carbohydrate consumed within 12 minutes). Blood samples were taken immediately before the meal and after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours (0 hour defined as start time of meal consumption). The meal test was repeated at Week 26, using the participant's study medication. Participants randomized to post‐meal insulin received a bolus dose 20 minutes after starting the meal.</p>

                <p>All statistical analyses were prespecified. Efficacy endpoints were summarized using the full analysis set, and results are presented based on data from all randomized participants for the entire trial period, which includes data collected after participants prematurely discontinued treatment (in‐trial observation period). Safety endpoints were summarized using the safety analysis set (participants receiving ≥ 1 dose of IAsp or faster aspart). Statistical analysis of primary and secondary confirmatory endpoints followed a stepwise hierarchical procedure, which was discontinued after step 4 (Figure S2 and Table <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).

                <p>Change from baseline in HbA1c 26 weeks post randomization was analysed using a statistical model with multiple imputations, in which, for participants without any available HbA1c measurements at scheduled visits, HbA1c values were imputed from available information from the treatment arm to which the participant had been randomized. Change from baseline in PPG and PPG increment (meal test) was analysed using an analysis of variance model, and HbA1c and PPG responder endpoints were analysed using a logistic regression model. Change from baseline in 7‐9‐7‐point outcomes (mean SMBG, PPG, PPG increments), 1,5‐AG, FPG, lipid‐lipoprotein profiles (log‐transformed) and body weight were analysed using a model similar to the statistical model used for the primary endpoint. Number of treatment‐emergent severe or BG‐confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was analysed using a negative binomial regression model.

                <p>In total, 1025 participants were randomized to mealtime faster aspart (<italic>n</italic> = 342), IAsp (<italic>n</italic> = 342), or post‐meal faster aspart (<italic>n</italic> = 341), all exposed to their respective study medications, among whom 1007 participants (98.2%) completed the trial, while 999 participants (97.5%), similarly distributed across treatment arms, completed the 26‐week treatment period without premature discontinuation of randomized treatment (Figure <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> in File <xref rid="dom13545-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The most common reason for withdrawal from the trial was “withdrawal by subject” (four participants each in the mealtime faster aspart and IAsp arms, six in the post‐meal faster aspart arm). Seven, nine and ten participants in the mealtime faster aspart, post‐meal faster aspart and mealtime IAsp arms, respectively, prematurely discontinued randomized treatment. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between the three treatment arms (Table <xref rid="dom13545-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

No statistically significant difference between treatment groups was observed concerning mean body weight at Week 26 (change from baseline: +1.43 kg [mealtime faster aspart], +1.14 kg [post‐meal faster aspart], +1.24 kg [insulin aspart]).</p>

              <p>The results of this study confirm that both mealtime and post‐meal faster aspart, in combination with degludec, were non‐inferior to mealtime IAsp regarding change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks in individuals with T1D. Furthermore, mealtime faster aspart was effective in reducing PPG excursions, and superiority to IAsp in 1‐hour PPG increment, following a standardized meal test, was confirmed. Mean SMBG‐derived 1‐hour PPG increments also showed a trend towards improved PPG control, with mealtime faster aspart conferring a significantly lower 1‐hour PPG increment than IAsp at breakfast and also when averaged over all meals. Furthermore, significantly more participants who received mealtime faster aspart achieved a 1‐hour PPG target less than 7.8 mmol/L, based on SMBG, compared with those who received IAsp. Change in body weight was less than 2 kg in all three treatment arms, which may be expected given that participants were already on a basal–bolus regimen at baseline.</p>
              <p>The improved PPG findings reported in the present study, from both meal test and SMBG, are consistent with general findings across the faster aspart clinical trial programme.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Furthermore, the results here specifically support the results of the onset 1 study, in which once‐ or twice‐daily detemir in conjunction with mealtime or post‐meal faster aspart was compared with the same basal regimen and mealtime IAsp.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> In the onset 1 study, however, there was a statistically significant difference in HbA1c change after 26 weeks between mealtime faster aspart and IAsp, unlike in the present study. Despite the reported improvements in PPG and the similar patient populations in both studies, it is unclear why a greater difference in change in HbA1c between mealtime faster aspart and IAsp was not observed in the present study. There was also a discrepancy between the two studies in the incidence of meal‐related hypoglycaemia at 1 hour after the start of a main meal. In the present study, there was no significant difference between mealtime faster aspart and IAsp regarding the rate of severe or BG‐confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 1 hour after a main meal, whereas a statistically significant difference in favour of IAsp was recorded in the onset 1 study (rate ratio: faster aspart/IAsp 1.48 [95%CI, 1.11; 1.96]; <italic>P =</italic> 0.0073).<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Conversely, there was a significant reduction in meal‐related hypoglycaemia in favour of mealtime faster aspart 3 to 4 hours after a main meal in the present study. These differences are probably related to the reported left shift of the concentration–time curve for faster aspart relative to IAsp, reflective of the faster onset and offset of action of faster aspart.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>

              <p>While mealtime dosing of insulin is appropriate for many patients with diabetes, there are situations in which the increased flexibility of post‐meal dosing may be advantageous. During social or other occasions, for example, the timing and/or carbohydrate content of a meal may be unpredictable. Furthermore, elderly or hospitalized patients, in whom lack of appetite and nausea are common, may also benefit from post‐meal dosing, as might patients who have forgotten an injection, or are anxious about severe hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Although post‐meal dosing cannot be recommended, the results of the present study suggest that post‐meal dosing of faster aspart may be considered in patients who need it.</p>
              <p>This study employed once‐daily degludec as the basal insulin. Degludec is associated with tolerability and overall glycaemic control similar to other long‐acting insulin analogues, with the benefit of a reduced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemic and severe hypoglycaemic events,<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="dom13545-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> which may have contributed to the lower rates of hypoglycaemia observed here compared with observations during the onset 1 study.<xref rid="dom13545-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> In addition, in the present study, an improvement in glycaemic control, that is, a reduction in HbA1c of approximately 0.6% in each arm, was achieved with weekly titration of degludec (pre‐breakfast target, 4.0–5.0 mmol/L) over the eight‐week run‐in period.</p>
              <p>Strengths of the onset 8 study include the large patient cohort, the high percentage of participants who completed the study, the randomized, double‐blind design for mealtime groups, and the individual optimization of basal insulin dose during the run‐in period to allow a clearer comparison of study arms. Furthermore, this is the first study to evaluate the combination of degludec, a basal insulin proven to confer fewer hypoglycaemic events, with faster aspart, and the use of faster aspart post meal. The meal‐test protocol was a potential limitation of the study, as the standardized meal composition may not accurately reflect what patients habitually consume. Moreover, all participants received an insulin dose of 0.1 U/kg for the meal test without adjustment for individual insulin:carbohydrate ratios. The meal‐test insulin dose was, therefore, only an approximation of the participant's normal dose. Nevertheless, the reported SMBG 1‐hour PPG increment findings corroborated the meal‐test results. Continuous glucose monitoring was not performed; however, monitoring in prospective studies could help to confirm hypoglycaemic events and to evaluate the impact of treatment on glucose variability and time in range.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the findings of this study, together with those of the onset 1 study, confirm that mealtime and post‐meal faster aspart provide effective HbA1c control in individuals with T1D, as the findings from both met the criteria for non‐inferiority compared with IAsp. Mealtime faster aspart further provides modestly improved control over early (30‐minute and 1‐hour) PPG excursions compared with mealtime IAsp. The overall safety profiles for faster aspart and IAsp are similar and are as expected for the IAsp formulation. Administration of faster aspart after a meal, although less favourable compared with mealtime administration, may be considered for some individuals with T1D under certain circumstances.</p>
