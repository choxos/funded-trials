                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systematic symptom screening for tuberculosis (TB). However, TB prevalence surveys suggest that this strategy does not identify millions of TB patients, globally. Undiagnosed or delayed diagnosis of TB contribute to TB transmission and exacerbate morbidity and mortality. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of large urban and rural primary healthcare clinics in 3 provinces of South Africa to evaluate whether a novel intervention of targeted universal testing for TB (TUTT) in high-risk groups diagnosed more patients with TB per month compared to current standard of care (SoC) symptom-directed TB testing.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>Sixty-two clinics were randomized; with initiation of the intervention clinics over 6 months from March 2019. The study was prematurely stopped in March 2020 due to clinics restricting access to patients, and then a week later due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) national lockdown; by then, we had accrued a similar number of TB diagnoses to that of the power estimates and permanently stopped the trial. In intervention clinics, attendees living with HIV, those self-reporting a recent close contact with TB, or a prior episode of TB were all offered a sputum test for TB, irrespective of whether they reported symptoms of TB. We analyzed data abstracted from the national public sector laboratory database using Poisson regression models and compared the mean number of TB patients diagnosed per clinic per month between the study arms. Intervention clinics diagnosed 6,777 patients with TB, 20.7 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 16.7, 24.8) versus 6,750, 18.8 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 15.3, 22.2) in control clinics during study months. A direct comparison, adjusting for province and clinic TB case volume strata, did not show a significant difference in the number of TB cases between the 2 arms, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.14 (95% CI 0.94, 1.38, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.46). However, prespecified difference-in-differences analyses showed that while the rate of TB diagnoses in control clinics decreased over time, intervention clinics had a 17% relative increase in TB patients diagnosed per month compared to the prior year, interaction IRR 1.17 (95% CI 1.14, 1.19, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Trial limitations were the premature stop due to COVID-19 lockdowns and the absence of between-arm comparisons of initiation and outcomes of TB treatment in those diagnosed with TB.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2020 Global Tuberculosis (TB) Report highlighted the gap between the number of new patients diagnosed with TB worldwide (7.1 million) and the estimate of total incident cases (10 million) [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggesting that a substantial proportion of people with TB disease are missed by health systems. Missed or delayed diagnosis of TB results in additional TB transmission as, in the absence of TB treatment, infectious respiratory droplets continue to be dispersed, and additional morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]<sub>.</sub> Although there has been a downward trajectory of total patients diagnosed with TB in South Africa since 2008 [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the recent 2018 South African TB prevalence survey suggests that 150,000 people with TB were not diagnosed or started on TB treatment in South Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Passive case finding, which relies on people with symptoms of TB presenting themselves to the health system, does not identify the majority of missing TB patients [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and WHO now recommends systematic active case finding directed to those with high risk of TB disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most recent WHO guideline on systematic screening for TB includes rapid molecular tests and chest X-rays as primary screening tools in addition to symptom screening to identify those who should be laboratory tested [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. South African guidelines at the time of the study recommend that if a TB symptom screen identifies at least 1 symptom, this should prompt collection of a specimen for laboratory TB testing. Symptom screening remains the mainstay of identifying people who require further investigation for TB as it maximizes sensitivity of laboratory testing and reduces laboratory resources being spent on those with a low probability of TB disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, several studies report poor sensitivity of symptom screening at the primary care clinic level in people living with HIV, pregnant women, and adults living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, TB symptom screening for every clinic attendee together with collection and laboratory testing of a sputum specimen appears to be a difficult target to achieve in South Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>We did not conduct a formal review of prior research into finding missing patients. There are 3 recent reviews of existing data directed at finding missing TB patients, one of which assessed cost effectiveness; all conclude that in high-risk groups, Xpert testing could be included as a screening tool [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>We posited that there were patients who did not report TB symptoms for some reason, or that they did not have TB symptoms that could be elicited by routine screening, or they did have symptoms but these were not detected or responded to by the health system. Although there are multiple groups at high risk for TB disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], there are 3 large groups of adults in South Africa at extreme risk of TB. Firstly, despite being attenuated by ART and TB preventive treatment, the risk of TB disease in people living with HIV remains persistently higher than in their seronegative peers [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Secondly, close contacts of a patient with pulmonary TB have a high risk of developing TB disease, particularly in the year following exposure [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Screening contacts for TB who are attending clinics is likely less costly in identifying additional patients with TB than outreach household and workplace contact tracing. Thirdly, adults with a prior episode of TB are at elevated risk of recurrent TB [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In South Africa, annual TB incidence was 805 and 738 per 100,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and South African TB surveillance data suggest that participants self-reporting prior TB treatment were at least 3 times more likely to have prevalent TB than those who did not [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>We therefore hypothesized that targeting high-risk groups for universal TB testing, irrespective of whether they report symptoms or not, would identify additional patients with TB. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of targeted universal testing for TB (TUTT) for clinic attendees in these 3 high-risk groups to ascertain whether more patients were diagnosed with TB every month in those clinics randomized to TUTT than in the control clinics.</p>

The trial intervention started in some clinics in March 2019, and over 6 months, all intervention clinics were implementing TUTT until COVID-19 lockdowns permanently stopped new recruitment on 20 March 2020. In South Africa, at the time of the study, national guidelines required that all clinic attendees be TB symptom-screened at each visit, and those with at least 1 symptom suggestive of TB should provide a sputum sample for laboratory testing with the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Virtually, all clinics in South Africa have access to Ultra testing of sputum, free of charge to the patient, and although Ultra testing laboratories are distant from most clinics, results are usually available at the clinic within 2 working days [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
                <p>Clinics were randomized 1:1 either to the control arm where the standard of care (SoC) - symptom-based TB screening sputum testing - continued without change, or to the intervention, which augmented SoC with targeted universal testing for clinic attendees who were in one of the study-defined high-risk groups: living with HIV, self-reported contact of a TB patient within the past year, or diagnosed with TB in past 2 years. Intervention clinics were planned to implement targeted universal testing for TB for a continuous duration of 14 months to account for seasonal variation in clinic attendances and TB diagnoses, and to allow a lead-in month for integration of the intervention into clinic processes. To account for secular trends in TB diagnoses, we collected study outcome data for clinics in both arms using identical processes from a year prior to the first clinic receiving the intervention through to the last intervention clinic completing the intervention phase.</p>

                <title>Eligibility</title>
                <p>Trial clinics were identified using data provided by the National Health Laboratory Service’s (NHLS) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which includes individual patient results for all laboratory specimens collected by public sector clinics and analyzed in NHLS laboratories. We initially required eligible clinics to diagnose ≥15 individual patients with laboratory-confirmed TB every month based on CDW data from the last quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This eligibility threshold was later reduced to ≥10 laboratory-confirmed patients with TB diagnosed per month as there were insufficient clinics in the 3 study provinces diagnosing ≥15 TB patients per month. We excluded clinics in prisons, clinics conducting research that could either interfere with the intervention or confound our outcome, and an outlier clinic in central Johannesburg that diagnosed ≥50 TB patients per month. Additionally, to mitigate potential contamination between clinics, we required eligible clinics be ≥5 kilometers apart. After exclusions, there were 143 potentially eligible clinics diagnosing ≥10 new patients with TB per month and among these, 60 (8 GP, 26 KZN, 26 WC) were randomly selected (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Randomization and masking</title>
                <p>Randomization of selected clinics was stratified by province and by strata of the number of TB patients diagnosed in each clinic per month (10 to 15, 15 to 21, and 21 to 30 patients with laboratory-confirmed TB per month) using CDW data from the last quarter of 2017. Randomization code was written such that for each province and size stratum, clinics were randomly selected to be in either arm with equal probability. The trial statistician initially randomized 8 clinics in GP (a province with relatively few clinics that met eligibility criteria), 26 in KZN, and 26 in the WC (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, implementation was hindered in some due to delays in obtaining local approvals to conduct research; 5 and 7 clinics randomized to control and intervention arms, respectively, were denied approval. Moreover, a clinic randomized to the intervention was destroyed by fire before the start of the intervention, and another a month after the intervention started—data from both are not included in these analyses. Additionally, 4 months into the intervention, research activities at 2 intervention clinics in GP were halted because another study targeting patients with TB had started, and our trial interfered with the other’s eligibility criteria. Clinics were replaced following additional stratified randomization (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Study investigators responsible for implementation were deliberately masked to outcome data, which were received from the NHLS only after the last patient was recruited. Interim comparative analyses were presented in closed sessions to the DSMB.</p>

Fieldworkers received trial-specific training that included approaching and obtaining individual written consent from participants, safe collection and labeling of sputum specimens, and the maintenance of patient confidentiality. We used 3 methods to identify potential participants: fieldworkers presented at approximately 2 hourly intervals in intervention clinic waiting rooms during which they introduced the study and its purpose, and requested attendees who thought they were in a high-risk group to privately contact the fieldworker at any time during their clinic visit; they reviewed patient files to assess potential eligibility of participants; and other healthcare workers in intervention clinics were requested to refer potentially eligible patients to fieldworkers for enrolment and sputum collection.</p>
                <p>Adults, ≥18 years of age, with at least one of the following were eligible: documented HIV infection in the clinical record irrespective of ART treatment or CD4 count; self-report of a close contact with a person with TB in the workplace or at home or elsewhere in the prior year; or self-report of TB disease—including receipt of TB treatment—in the prior 2 years. We excluded individuals taking TB treatment at the time of the study visit, as well as those who had a trial specimen collected in the previous 6 months. Consented participants had a brief interview, and confirmation of HIV seropositivity was abstracted from medical records, with the most recent CD4 count, if available. Irrespective of the presence of symptoms, every participant had a supervised sputum specimen taken in a standardized manner according to an operating procedure on which fieldworkers rceived training at the beginning and also oversight throughout the trial. Specimens were taken either outside the clinic or in a well-ventilated sputum collection booth. After an oral water rinse, fieldworkers collected ≥3 ml of sputum in a prelabelled specimen container. Participants unable to produce a mucoid sputum specimen immediately were encouraged to make repeated cough efforts and then spit whatever was in their mouth into the specimen container and to repeat this process 3 times. Specimens were couriered by routine transport systems to NHLS mycobacterial culture laboratories (in eThekwini, Cape Town, Tshwane, and Johannesburg) with automated liquid culture capacity.</p>
                <p>At each laboratory, after homogenization and decontamination with <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetyl-l-cysteine (NALC), the specimen was centrifuged, and the resulting pellet split in equal parts. One part was subjected to Ultra and the other to the Mycobacterial Growth in Tube (MGIT) automated liquid culture system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). All NHLS TB culture laboratories have quality assurance systems that include analysis of blinded specimen panels and contamination rate review. In intervention clinics, fieldworkers were instructed to follow up any laboratory results that reported <italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> detected and to notify the clinic’s TB focal point to expedite TB treatment. Ultra-semiquantitative “trace” results, the lowest threshold of detection of <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> detected by the Ultra [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], were managed according to provincial clinical algorithms: The WC required a positive culture in patients with a prior history of TB treatment, and all required clinical evaluation and repeat laboratory testing if clinically warranted. Additionally, the study team created an advisory panel of 3 infectious disease physicians who clinic staff could consult for advice. Clinic attendees at intervention clinics who were not enrolled in the trial received usual TB symptom screening with specimen collection, as appropriate, from routine health workers. These specimens were delivered by NHLS courier to the nearest NHLS laboratory to be tested using Ultra.</p>
                <p>In control clinics, no changes in TB symptom screening or collection of specimens for TB testing occurred. Patients attending these clinics continued to have specimens collected if they reported TB symptoms. All control clinics’ sputum specimens were delivered by routine courier to the nearest NHLS laboratory to be tested using Ultra. TB screening and sample collection processes were observed and evaluated at least twice at each control clinic over the duration of the intervention phase. Clinics that scored poorly on 2 occasions on a standardized evaluation by study staff were brought to the attention of the Provincial TB Manager by the study team.</p>

                <title>Data sources and analyses</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the number of unique patient TB diagnoses reported in the NHLS’s CDW database per clinic per month. After deduplicating results, TB test results obtained from CDW spanning February 2018 through March 2020 were included. For the purpose of this trial, we defined a TB patient as: unique individuals with a laboratory result that included <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> complex detected, either by Ultra and/or liquid mycobacterial culture in all study clinics per month over the study duration; in all study clinics, patients diagnosed with TB for a second time within 6 months of their first positive test were counted once. In intervention clinics, this count included participants diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed TB as part of the intervention and through routine clinic processes for patients who were not eligible for the intervention.</p>
                <p>We initially planned a confirmatory second data source for the primary outcome using clinic-maintained TB registers from which study personnel abstracted the total number of TB cases diagnosed by that clinic each month. However, during the period of study implementation, clinic-based TB registers were replaced with an electronic system, Tier.net [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It was apparent that clinic TB registers were not standardized; some did not differentiate between patients diagnosed in the clinic and those initially diagnosed elsewhere and referred to the clinic, or between laboratory and clinically diagnosed patients. We report these analyses in sensitivity analyses.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculations</title>
                <p>We based sample size on being able to determine at least a 25% difference in number of TB patients diagnosed per clinic per month between intervention arm clinics and SoC arm clinics, assuming a full calendar year of the implementation phase. We wanted to obtain a full calendar year of data from each clinic to account for seasonal changes. To do this, we originally planned to collect 14 months of intervention and control clinic data from each clinic to account for a lead-in month during which the fieldworker was learning to optimize the intervention, and to account for the possibility of a month of clinic closure (due to strikes or unrest; both are frequent in South Africa). Data provided by CDW from the first quarter of 2018 indicated that clinics diagnosed a median of 16 (range 9,66) cases per month (30-day period) across the 3 study provinces. The observed between-facility coefficient of variance (CV) was 0.34, which reduced to 0.1 after stratifying facilities into small, medium, and high case rates. We expected that size and provincial stratification in our study would also reduce the CV because of the variability in 3 provinces’ TB burden. We thus conducted power estimates for a CV of 0.1 as well as for a more conservative estimate of 0.24. With a CV of 0.1, 60 clinics (30 per arm) would provide more than 99% power to detect a difference of 25% in the number of TB cases diagnosed per month between the 2 study arms after 6 or 14 months of implementation in an analysis that adjusts for these stratification variables. A CV of 0.24 would provide 91% power after 6, and 93% after 14 months’ of observation per clinic. We estimated that, with a coefficient of variation of 0.24 over a period of 14 months’ observations per clinic, 60 clinics (30 per arm) would provide 93% power to detect an increase of 25% in the number of TB cases diagnosed per month in the intervention compared to control clinics.</p>

                  <p>We report results for the intervention period, comparing the intervention clinics with control clinics. For all analyses, we assumed that those with an Ultra trace result were negative for <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> complex to prevent biasing trial results toward the intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In intervention arm clinics, the primary outcome was contributed to both by the sputum collections of the intervention and by routine TB diagnoses of the clinic; in the control clinics, this reflected only routine symptom-directed diagnostic processes. Analyses were prespecified in the approved protocol and were further described in a study-specific statistical analysis plan finalized in October 2019. After the last participant was recruited, we obtained CDW TB diagnoses data from 1 year prior to starting the intervention through the last month of the intervention (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1004237.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs).</p>
                  <p>The primary analysis compared the mean number of TB patients diagnosed per month per clinic between study arms during the intervention period only, using both Ultra and liquid culture results. Unadjusted analyses used the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test on cluster-level TB case rates (i.e., TB diagnoses/clinic’s observation months), and a robust check was conducted by running the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test on the log of the case rates. Furthermore, Poisson regression models with robust variance or a Pearson residual overdispersion parameter to adjust for extravariability due to clustering were used to compare the outcomes between study arms adjusting for the clinic stratification variables used for randomization (province, and the strata of average number of TB patients diagnosed per month in the last quarter of 2017), with the offset as the log<sub>10</sub> of the total number of months the clinic participated in the study. For the primary analysis comparing intervention clinics directly to control clinics, we used all months in 32 intervention clinics while the intervention was implemented, and for all 30 control clinics, 12 months of CDW data from March 2019 to February 2020 were included.</p>
                  <p>In a sensitivity analysis, we applied Poisson regression—excluding each intervention arm clinic’s first month of intervention data to account for a possible initial learning period and a regression excluding the 2 GP clinics that had only 4 months of activity before being replaced. A sensitivity test was applied to this primary analysis but using clinic-based TB count data. Finally, although not protocol specified, we report the primary outcome modeling the results as though the Ultra were the only assay used, as it is unlikely that laboratory capacity to conduct large numbers of mycobacterial cultures would be feasible. Additionaly, we also report results assuming trace results were included as positive Ultra result.</p>
                  <p>To assess the impact of the study fieldworker, we also report a dose–response test, using the Poisson regression, within the intervention clinics to evaluate if the number of days that study fieldworkers were present in the clinic per study month was associated with the number of TB cases diagnosed.</p>

                  <p>A protocol-specified difference-in-differences analysis was conducted, comparing the number of TB cases between individual clinics by study arm during the months of the intervention and during the corresponding calendar months for each clinic from the prior year. Thus, for control clinics, a total of 24 months’ data were included per clinic, and for intervention arm clinics, this varied from 8 to 26 months per clinic. We used a Poisson regression model including study arm, period (study and prestudy), and their interaction, as well as province and size strata used for randomization. A final combined analysis including an arm-by-period interaction term to ascertain the overall benefit of the intervention strategy taking into account year-on-year changes.

              <p>Eleven intervention arm clinics initiated universal testing in March 2019; over the following 6 months, all intervention clinics were initiated, with the last clinic initiating the intervention in October 2019. In the latter part of March 2020, as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnoses in South Africa increased, patient access to clinics was restricted, and those with respiratory symptoms were not tested for TB [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The study was stopped on 20 March 2020, a week prior to start of a national lockdown. Once it was apparent that lockdown would persist, the study team permanently stopped the study, a decision ratified by the TUTT trial DSMB, which determined that sufficient data were available to draw inferences, after adjusting for each clinic’s implementation months, considering that a total of 13,527 TB diagnoses had been made in the trial period, comparable to the 13,662 diagnoses in the corresponding prior period.</p>

              <p>A detailed description of the participants who were consented and tested in intervention clinics, including the proportion who were positive on each or both TB tests, stratified by the high-risk group/s they were in, is described elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, of 32,891 consented intervention clinic attendees, 30,513 had at least 1 sputum TB laboratory assay result (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Their median age was 37 years (IQR 30 to 46), and 11,553 (38%) were men. Most (71%) were living with HIV, 41% reported being in close contact with a TB patient, and 5% reported had been diagnosed with TB in the past 2 years. Of those who were tested by the study, 5.1% were positive for <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> when Ultra trace results were excluded, but this increased to 7.6% when Ultra trace results were considered positive; a caveat is that merely 10% of these Ultra trace results were culture positive. In these participants recruited in intervention clinics, 55% of those with a positive laboratory result did not report TB symptoms on a symptom screen.</p>
              <p>Overall, for all intervention clinics during the intervention months, 101,786 specimens were analyzed in the public health laboratory service—this number includes specimens of the intervention participants—compared to 57,983 in the same calendar months a year prior to the intervention (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In control clinics, 67,843 tests were analyzed during the 12-month intervention period and 68,189 in the same month a year prior. Based on the pretrial period data (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the assignment of clinics to the 2 study arms was balanced with respect to the proportion of overall Xpert positive tests per clinic month (15.6% versus 16.3%), and positive tests among men (12.2% versus 12.0%)) and women (7.3 versus 7.8) and across age groups.</p>
              <p>The 32 intervention clinics contributed a cumulative total of 315 clinic months of intervention time; the median number of months each clinic received the intervention was 11 (IQR 8, 12). CDW data restricted to the months while universal testing was implemented in intervention clinics showed that 6,777 individuals were diagnosed with TB. This included both TB patients diagnosed by the intervention and patients diagnosed through routine symptom-directed TB testing at the clinic, representing a monthly TB case rate of 20.7 cases per clinic (95% CI 16.7, 24.8) (<xref rid="pmed.1004237.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1004237.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs). Men were 60% (4,030/6,777) of all TB diagnoses in intervention clinics. In matched clinic months from the year prior to the intervention, 6,330 patients were diagnosed with TB in intervention clinics—of whom 4,109 (61%) were men—for monthly case rate of 19.3 (95% CI 15.9, 22.8).</p>
              <p>The 30 control clinics contributed 12 study months of CDW data for each clinic for a total of 360 months of data both in the intervention period and in the preintervention period. During this time, 6,750 patients were diagnosed with TB for monthly case rate 18.8 (95% CI 15.3, 22.2) in the year of the intervention, compared to 7,332 patients diagnosed with TB for a monthly case rate of 20.4 (95% CI 16.9, 23.7) in the year preceding the intervention.</p>
              <p>Unadjusted counts of positive diagnoses from the intervention period and the year prior to the intervention period, stratified by multiple subgroups, suggest increases in TB diagnoses per month in intervention clinics compared with the prior period for all strata. In the control arm, fewer patients were diagnosed with TB per clinic per month in the intervention period compared to the year prior across these strata.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We did not meet our stated goal of diagnosing an additional 25% more adults with laboratory-confirmed pulmonary TB by augmenting symptom-directed TB testing in clinics with systematic universal TB testing of individuals at high risk of TB disease. The primary contemporaneous between-arm comparison was a nonsignificant 14% increase in TB diagnoses in intervention clinics. However, we demonstrated that taking into account the secular decline in TB diagnoses, intervention clinics had a relative year-on-year increase in TB diagnoses per month of 17%.</p>
              <p>Novel approaches to diagnose additional patients with TB include augmenting symptom screening with chest X-rays subjected to automated diagnostic algorithms [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or adding C-reactive protein (CRP) assessment [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, we had originally considered including urinary point of care lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assays for people living with HIV whose CD4 count is low [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but differential testing was considered too complex to be implemented on a large scale. With time, these strategies are becoming more accessible and less expensive. However, routine sputum testing of high-risk groups can be implemented immediately, using healthcare, logistics, and laboratory infrastructure already in place in settings like South Africa. Obtaining specimens from participants who reported no symptoms was feasible and in another manuscript we describe yield of TB testing in the intervention arm, by risk group, and by the presence or absence of TB symptoms [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>More research is required to assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy and, importantly, whether it would be appropriate to implement in less-resourced settings than South Africa. The TUTT approach will clearly be more costly and requires higher numbers to be tested (NNT) to identify each additional TB patient when compared to existing symptom-directed TB testing. This study highlights the urgent need for rapid, affordable, and accurate TB screening (and testing) assays that could be applied universally in high-risk populations or, alternatively, other less expensive strategies to reduce costs, such as pooling multiple specimens [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid and sustained reduction in the number of sputum specimens submitted for TB testing [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in South Africa and elsewhere. TUTT strategies could be used to counter this decline in TB diagnoses and has been already explored for other high-risk groups at the level of the household for close contacts of adult and child index TB patients [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], pregnant women living with HIV [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and in people living with HIV starting ART [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Clearly in other settings, alternative high-risk groups could be tested.</p>
              <p>Strengths of our study include its implementation in a large sample of randomly selected public sector clinics in 3 different provinces of South Africa and its use of the public sector laboratory courier and analytical systems already in place to analyze study specimens. The results, therefore, represent what would be achieved if this intervention were scaled up in South Africa.</p>
              <p>A key limitation of this study was trial interruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite stopping the study early, we do not believe that COVID-19 substantively impacted the results we report here, primarily because the number of TB diagnoses in the study period was 13,527, a rate of 20.5 per clinic month, comparable to the 13,440 TB diagnoses (60 clinics over 14 months at an average rate of 16 diagnoses per clinic month) anticipated in our power estimate. Moreover, the final day of recruitment to the study was a week prior to the introduction of lockdown when clinic procedures were starting to be amended in response to concerns about COVID-19. A cumulative total of only 1,278 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 had been diagnosed in South Africa by then [<xref rid="pmed.1004237.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Obstacles to implementation led to variations in the number of clinic months of the intervention, which increased between-clinic outcome variability. The trial intervention could be construed to be more than just TUTT as study-hired fieldworkers were placed at intervention clinics to identify and consent high-risk individuals and to collect specimens; moreover, study sputum specimens were not processed in the same manner as routinely collected specimens. Our data are not generalisable to children younger than 18 for whom alternative testing strategies would be required, nor to settings with lower HIV prevalence than South Africa. Finally, we did not assess the effect of the intervention on TB treatment initiation rates, treatment outcomes, or adverse events related to trial procedures or initiation of TB treatment.</p>
              <p>In this trial of targeted universal testing for TB, clinics randomized to the intervention diagnosed substantially more individuals by sputum testing than did routine symptom-directed TB testing and indicates that a TUTT strategy could make a contribution to identify “missing” patients with TB in South Africa. The key questions that remain are whether this approach provides a morbidity, mortality, and transmission benefit, and whether it is possible for TUTT to be implemented in a sustainable way, especially in settings with fewer resources or lower HIV prevalence than South Africa.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Martinson,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "A Cluster Randomized Trial of Systematic Targeted Universal Testing for Tuberculosis in Primary Care Clinics of South Africa" (PMEDICINE-D-22-03274R1) for consideration at PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>Your paper was evaluated by a senior editor and discussed among all the editors here. It was also discussed with an academic editor with relevant expertise, and sent to independent reviewers, including a statistical reviewer. The reviews are appended at the bottom of this email and any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>In light of these reviews, I am afraid that we will not be able to accept the manuscript for publication in the journal in its current form, but we would like to consider a revised version that addresses the reviewers' and editors' comments. Obviously we cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response, and we plan to seek re-review by one or more of the reviewers. </p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration, your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments, the changes you have made in the manuscript, and include either an excerpt of the revised text or the location (eg: page and line number) where each change can be found. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file; a version with changes marked should be uploaded as a marked up manuscript.</p>
              <p>In addition, we request that you upload any figures associated with your paper as individual TIF or EPS files with 300dpi resolution at resubmission; please read our figure guidelines for more information on our requirements: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures</ext-link>. While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the PACE digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link>. PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>PLOSMedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript by Jan 04 2023 11:59PM. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement, making sure to declare all competing interests. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. If new competing interests are declared later in the revision process, this may also hold up the submission. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT. You can see our competing interests policy here: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/competing-interests" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/competing-interests</ext-link>.</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>GENERAL</p>
              <p>Please respond to all editor and reviewer comments detailed below, in full.</p>
              <p>The reviewers agree the study is important and well-conducted, but there are a number of clarifications which are required which the editorial team are in agreement with. Please see below.</p>
              <p>Thank you for including a CONSORT flow diagram. Please complete the CONSORT checklist and ensure that all components of CONSORT are present in the manuscript, including [how randomization was performed, allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, definition of lost to follow-up, power statement]. When completing the checklist, please adapt to use section and paragraph numbers, rather than page numbers (which often change at publication).</p>
              <p>COMMENTS FROM THE ACADEMIC EDITOR</p>
              <p>A major revision makes sense to me at this time. No major issues. The article seems well written and the discussion brought up the key issues that come to mind.</p>
              <p>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</p>
              <p>Thank you for including a statement. Please clarify whether Pfizer contributed specifically to this study and if so, please describe what role they had in the study design, if any (your current funding statement would suggest none).</p>
              <p>FUNDING STATEMENT</p>
              <p>Thank you for including a funding statement. Please update, as necessary in line with above.</p>
              <p>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT</p>
              <p>Thank you for including a Data Availability Statement (DAS) which requires revision. For each data source used in your study: </p>
              <p>a) If the data are freely or publicly available, note this and state the location of the data: within the paper, in Supporting Information files, or in a public repository (include the DOI or accession number).</p>
              <p>b) If the data are owned by a third party but freely available upon request, please note this and state the owner of the data set and contact information for data requests (web or email address). Note that a study author cannot be the contact person for the data.</p>
              <p>c) If the data are not freely available, please describe briefly the ethical, legal, or contractual restriction that prevents you from sharing it. Please also include an appropriate contact (web or email address) for inquiries (again, this cannot be a study author).</p>
              <p>ABSTRACT</p>
              <p>Please structure your abstract using the PLOS Medicine headings (Background, Methods and Findings, Conclusions).</p>
              <p>Please combine the Methods and Findings sections into one section, “Methods and findings”.</p>
              <p>Abstract Background: </p>
              <p>Provide expand the details and context of why the study is important – what’s the impact of missed TB cases on health economics, how does it help to identify more cases, for example. </p>
              <p>Abstract Methods and Findings: </p>
              <p>Please ensure that all numbers presented in the abstract are present and identical to numbers presented in the main manuscript text.</p>
              <p>Where 95% CIs are reported please also report p-values. Please report exact values or for smaller values, p&lt;0.001</p>
              <p>Line 49-51: “Intervention clinics diagnosed 6777 patients with TB [20.7 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 16.7, 24.8)] versus 6750 [18.8 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 15.3,22.2)].” The use of parentheses is confusing here, especially after p-values are added. Suggest the following:</p>
              <p>“Intervention clinics diagnosed 6777 patients with TB, 20.7 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI [16.7, 24.8], p=/p&lt;…) versus 6750, 18.8 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI [15.3,22.2], p=/p&lt;…).”</p>
              <p>Please amend statistical reporting throughout for consistency and accessibility</p>
              <p>Please include the study design (randomised control trial) and further details of the population and setting – what kind of clinics, rural/urban and so on, years during which the study took place, length of follow up, and main outcome measures.</p>
              <p>Please include a summary of adverse events if these were assessed in the study.</p>
              <p>In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology. </p>
              <p>Abstract Conclusions:</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Background</p>
              <p>* References to the WHO Global TB report can be updated using the 2022 version (now that this is available)</p>
              <p>* Line 77-79. While symptom screening does help identify individuals more likely to be diagnosed with TB, it is very subjective and its inconsistent implementation is a big reason for patients being missed with TB. Authors should soften this sentence to rather focus on symptom-based screening being the mainstay for identifying presumptive TB patients and limitations of this approach currently</p>
              <p>* Line 79-81. WHO symptom screening has been recommended for persons living with HIV since 2011 and has been shown to be effective - not clear why the authors have suggested otherwise. Is this within the context of South Africa?</p>
              <p>* Line 83. Not clear who the 'high risk' groups refer to and why have they been specifically targeted? </p>
              <p>* Line 88-92 should move higher up BEFORE the study hypothesis is presented (line 83)</p>
              <p>* The setting of the study is not well captured in the introduction i.e. that you are intending to address undiagnosed TB at clinic-level. In addition, not sufficient justification provided for focusing on contacts of TB patients at facility level - such individuals are actively sought out at their households through contact investigation.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>* Lines 100-102. While indicating the justification for the three provinces is useful, it would also be important to highlight the 'missed/undiagnosed' burden for these provinces as well, since your hypothesis is intended to close this gap?</p>
              <p>* Line 103. Confirm which or how many symptoms are considered for further evaluation to be initiated</p>
              <p>* Lines 105-107. Please clarify what you mean when you say "Xpert Ultra testing available at virtually all clinics in South Africa"? Are you saying the testing is done at facility level (which is how it currently reads) or that testing is offered at facility-level but samples are sent off to centralized testing labs?</p>
              <p>* Lines 111-112. More clarity on how high-risk groups were classified. For PLHIV did it matter if patients were on ART? For contacts of a TB patient, how was this 'contact defined' i.e., household vs casual contact. For previous TB patients, did you determine the outcome of the previous episode?</p>
              <p>* Line 123. Why was 15 patients diagnosed per month considered for selecting clinics - how does this align with your hypothesis of 'missed TB patients' that the intervention was going to identify? Was screening and Xpert positivity rates considered at clinic level?</p>
              <p>* Lines 135-136. Why was HIV prevalence not considered for your randomization strata - would this not influence yield since you are include PLHIV as one of your high-risk groups?</p>
              <p>* Was HIV testing offered as part of the study? It would seem important for individuals in the other two risk groups (contacts and previous TB) to know their status as this would further increase their risk of TB.</p>
              <p>* Line 171. Please clarify/provide more information on what 'standardized manner' refers to for sputum collection? How was this standardized?</p>
              <p>* Line 174. How were staff trained to assess sputum quality i.e., to ensure that it was mucoid?</p>
              <p>* Lines 176-178. When were sputum samples sent, same day or next day to the labs?</p>
              <p>* Line 185. Were fieldworks acting on Xpert Ultra results only or also if MGIT cultures were positive?</p>
              <p>* Lines 186-188. Please provide more information on whether any of the three provinces considered 'trace' as a positive result?</p>
              <p>* Lines 197-201. How were screening and sampling evaluated? Facilities who were notified to the Provincial TB Manager, did they get re-evaluated for improvement? Was there anything done to improve their assessment?</p>
              <p>* Line 202. The heading 'Data sources' should be changed to also reflect analyses as the language is focused primarily around describing parts of the analysis. I would suggest include a definitions sub-heading to clarify who was deemed a TB patient. Could also include other classifications as well such as the high-risk groups.</p>
              <p>* Line 221. Please provide justification for the assumed 25% difference in yield between intervention and control clinics.</p>
              <p>* Line 243-244. For individuals with an initial 'trace' result, were these patients evaluated further? In intervention clinics, MGIT culture was performed in addition to Xpert Ultra and thus patients in this arm who had an initial trace result would have benefited immediately from the additional culture investigation, which may or may not have been done for trace patients in the control arm (as they would have also needed to provide an additional specimen). Would this have biased the outcome of your comparison?</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>* Line 392. Remove 'statistically' to make the sentence clearer.</p>
              <p>* Line 401-403. Cost-effectiveness would be an important consideration for this strategy and should be outlined as a follow-up to this manuscript. While the intervention increased TB detection by 17% among intervention clinics, it does not reflect the resources required to achieve this increase. In the absence of cost-effectiveness data, would it be possible for the authors to comment on the number-needed-to-test (NNT) in intervention clinics among enrolled participants; this could provide some perspective on the effort/resources required?</p>
              <p>* Line 408-411. While it is possible that TUTT may help increase testing at clinic level, their needs to be a shift towards community interventions and increased case finding (especially individuals who are not presenting to health facilities). Is there a role for TUTT in community interventions (considering the same high risk groups, particularly household contacts of TB patients? Please provide additional commentary around this.</p>
              <p>* Discussion requires more synthesis of important aspects relevant to the TUTT intervention. Firstly, an inherent limitation of TUTT is sputum collection since individuals without symptoms at the time of investigation are less likely to provide a quality sputum. Can results be presented around sputum quality, for intervention participants and how this may or may not have affected the study. In addition, there is no mention of the potential of urine LAM (and its current use in SA) or other alternative sample types, particularly since the former is currently aimed at PLHIV. Secondly, there is a lack of discussion on how whether the choice of risk groups was the correct groups to have 'targeted' for the intervention. PLHIV are routinely screened for TB so unclear if the intervention would have supplemented such efforts within facilities. Not being able to disaggregate the risk group data from the overall data is a limitation to the study as it doesn't address the question about whether the correct groups were selected. This requires some discussion. Thirdly, and related to the previous point, only adults were considered for the study, and while it makes it easier re. informed consent and sputum collection, there is a desperate need to improve TB detection in children, particularly the under 5 year age group. The authors should provide some discussion around this and how TUTT could evolve (with newer tools and sample types) to address these other equally important populations. Fourthly, the use of culture as part of the investigation of deviates from current practice within the programme. This needs to be included more clearly as a limitation, however does require further discussion, particularly in relation to trace results. </p>
              <p>* Related to cost-effectiveness, was this included as part of the study? </p>
              <p>* Digital chest x-ray has shown to be effective at identifying individuals at primary healthcare level and reducing the NNT by half compared to symptom screening (Moodley et al. CID. 2022; PMID: 34313729). Some discussion and reference is needed around the utility of chest xray for identifying undiagnosed TB and whether such an intervention is more scalable for programmes compared to universal testing.</p>
              <p>* As this is a RCT, a CONSORT checklist should be included</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: A Cluster Randomized Trial of Systematic Targeted Universal Testing for Tuberculosis</p>
              <p>in Primary Care Clinics of South Africa</p>
              <p>PMEDICINE-D-22-03274R1</p>
              <p>Thank you for asking me to review this manuscript which goes some way to identifying more patients with TB compared to the current standard of care in South Africa. In this cluster randomised trial, the authors evaluate whether targeted universal testing for TB (TUTT) in high risk groups identified more patients with TB compared to the routine standard of care. The dogged determination and resilience of the study team in completing the study despite delays in approvals and clinics burning down etc needs to be applauded. Consequently, we have study results from the real world which can inform policy. </p>
              <p>I have no major comments or concerns with this well-written, detailed manuscript, only one question and a couple of minor editing issues. However, I am not a statistician so cannot comment on the statistical analysis conducted.</p>
              <p>Supplementary Figures 1a and b: In December 2019 in the control clinics the number of TB cases decreased by 5 or 6. What is the reason for the decrease in over 10 TB cases in December 2019 in the intervention clinics? </p>
              <p>Lines 223 - 224: 'We wanted to obtain a full calendar year of data from each clinic to account for seasonal changes.' This has already been stated in line 114 and could be deleted.</p>
              <p>Line 268. Spelling of additionally.</p>
              <p>Lines 341 - 342: '…..the coefficient of variation in of the number of diagnoses in the control arm was 0.4.' This sentence is confusing and needs revising.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This cluster randomized control trial tried to evaluate whether targeted universal testing for TB (TUTT) is more effective in identifying TB cases than the standard of care (i.e., systematic symptom screening for TB) in South Africa. Overall, this is a well-designed and conducted study. The topic of the study is of significant importance and the results are relevant for policy makers. Below are my specific comments.</p>
              <p>1. The authors' institute received funding from Pfizer, which may result in potential competing interest.</p>
              <p>2. The date are not fully public available which is not aligned with PLoS Medicine's policy. </p>
              <p>3. Line 149-151: Since there will be a fieldworker allocated to be present at each intervention clinic but not at control clinic, is that really possible to achieve masking for this study?</p>
              <p>4. Line 157-163: It said (line 157-160) that attendees who thought they were in a high risk group to privately contact the fieldworker. But in lines 162-163, it says that patients were referred by the healthcare workers. It is a bit confusing to me. By which way are the patients being identified?</p>
              <p>5. Line 166-168: why? What if the last time test was negative. Should the patients still be eligible?</p>
              <p>6. Line 235-238: A CV of 0.24 or 0.34? You mentioned in line 230-231 that "the observed between-facility coefficient of variance (CV) was 0.34". Where did the 0.24 come from? </p>
              <p>7. Line 253-258: I think using negative binomial model may be better than using Poisson regression due to the restrictive assumption about mean and variance (mean=variance) for Poisson regression.</p>

              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>GENERAL</p>
              <p>Thank you for your detailed and considerate responses to previous editor and reviewer requests, please see below for additional comments which we require that you address in full.</p>
              <p>** We note in your abstract that the recruitment to the study was “halted” in March 2020 (coinciding with pandemic lockdowns). Please include details, in the abstract (and the main manuscript) which clearly states why the trial was halted and whether termination of recruitment at this time point has any implications on sample size and statistical powering (you go some way to doing this in the discussion) **</p>
              <p>DATA AVAILABILITY</p>
              <p>In accordance with ICMJE requirements, PLOS Medicine requires prospective, public registration of a data sharing plan (as part of mandatory clinical trials registration) for all clinical trials that began enrolment on or after January 1, 2019. Please include details.</p>
              <p>TITLE</p>
              <p>Please revise your title according to PLOS Medicine's style. Your title must be nondeclarative and not a question. It should begin with main concept if possible. "Effect of" should be used only if causality can be inferred, i.e., for an RCT. Please place the study design ("A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.) in the subtitle (ie, after a colon).</p>
              <p>ABSTRACT</p>
              <p>Line 52: “Subjecting data extracted…” instead perhaps?</p>
              <p>Line 50: please revise to read “…attendees living with HIV…” please check and amend throughout the manuscript where relevant.</p>
              <p>Please include the primary outcome.</p>
              <p>AUTHOR SUMMARY</p>
              <p>Thank you for including an author summary. Please trim your summary to include ideally 2-3 (but no more than 4) single sentence bullet points for each of the questions (Why Was This Study Done?, What Did the Researchers Do and Find? , What Do These Findings Mean?). Bullet points should be objective, brief, succinct, specific, accurate, and avoid technical language.</p>
              <p>Reviewing existing published articles here <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/</ext-link> on our website may be helpful to you.</p>
              <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
              <p>Line 178: as above please amend to read as follows, “…in people living with HIV…”. Please check and amend throughout the manuscript where relevant.</p>
              <p>METHODS and RESULTS</p>
              <p>PLOS Medicine requires that all trials be prospectively registered in one of registries recognized by WHO. Please provide information on study registration in the Methods section.</p>
              <p>Please amend statistical reporting for consistency. For example, line 450 reads, “…1.14 (95% CI 0.94, 1.38, p=0.46)” but at line 457, “…1.19 (0.99, 1.44) (p=0.05).” Please revise throughout for consistency. We suggest adopting the former style of presentation.</p>
              <p>Line 269: Please include whether consent obtained was written or oral.</p>
              <p>PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS</p>
              <p>Thank you for including details of the clinics include in your trial.</p>
              <p>Throughout, specific individual patient characteristics are documented to be required for inclusion into the study, including “high risk” status and the reasons for the risk. Further you specifically document individual consent to participate in the study. For these reasons and to help facilitate transparency of data reporting we request that you please include the characteristics of the consenting participants.</p>
              <p>FIGURES</p>
              <p>Figure 3 – when reporting p values, please include numerical values instead of using asterisks as indicators</p>
              <p>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN</p>
              <p>In your rebuttal, you state that no statistical analysis plan was made but in the abstract, you write “pre-specified difference in-differences analyses” and in the manuscript submission form you state “the local IRB has acknowledged both the planned analysis and…” which would suggest you had a pre-specified analysis plan please clarify/amend to include the statistical analysis plan that you refer to.</p>
              <p>DISCUSSION</p>
              <p>Please remove the declarations of interest statement and the data sharing statements from the end of the discussion and include only in the manuscript submission form.</p>
              <p>REFERENCES</p>
              <p>For in-text reference callouts, please ensure a) an absence of spaces between citations and b) a space preceding the opening parenthesis. For example, line 147 “…cases (10 million) [1,2]…”. Please check and amend throughout.</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: My comments have been satisfactorily addressed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I think the authors have adequately answered/addressed my questions and questions from the other reviewers. I think the paper is acceptable in its current form. Congratulations!</p>

              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>GENERAL</p>
              <p>Thank you for your detailed responses to previous editor and reviewer comments, please see below for further comments which we require that you address prior to publication.</p>
              <p>AUTHOR SUMMARY</p>
              <p>Thank you for revising the author summary. Please see below for recommended revisions, as per our understanding, to improve accessibility and brevity. Please check carefully to ensure accuracy. Where [….] are presented please fill in the blanks</p>
              <p>Why Was This Study Done? </p>
              <p>o TB diagnosis is made by laboratory sputum testing usually prompted by the presence of at least one symptom of TB (cough, fever or night sweats, loss of weight) </p>
              <p>o The World Health Organization promotes screening of entire groups at high risk of TB irrespective of symptoms. In South Africa high risk groups include people living with HIV; those who report being a close contact of someone with TB; and those who have had a recent episode of TB.</p>
              <p>o A sparsity of data exists on the usefulness of diagnostic assays as screening tests. Our trial assessed if targeted testing of people at high risk without TB symptoms helped to identify undiagnosed TB.</p>
              <p>What did the researchers do and find?</p>
              <p>o 62 large primary care clinics in South Africa were randomised to either our intervention -TB testing of all people in high-risk groups, or our control - to continue symptom based testing for TB (the standard of care). </p>
              <p>o The total number of TB cases diagnosed each month in all clinics was recorded. Comparisons were made between intervention and control clinics. </p>
              <p>o In the intervention clinics 6777 people were diagnosed with TB, an average of 20.7 patients per clinic month versus 6750 in control clinics, an average of 18.8 patients with TB per clinic month. </p>
              <p>o After adjusting for […….] intervention clinics were observed to diagnose 14% more patients with TB than control clinics but this did not reach statistical significance. Secondary analyses, including data from the year prior to the intervention demonstrated a statistically significant increase in TB diagnoses per month, reported as a 17% relative increase.</p>
              <p>What do these findings mean?</p>
              <p>o A strategy targeting high risk groups for universal testing for TB (TUTT) may help to improve diagnostic rates of TB in areas where prevalence is high.</p>
              <p>o Less expensive TB tests could enable universal testing strategies to be implemented in low-resource settings; and could be extended to other high risk target groups.</p>
              <p>PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS</p>
              <p>We previously said the following:</p>
              <p>“Thank you for including details of the clinics include in your trial.</p>
              <p>Throughout, specific individual patient characteristics are documented to be required for inclusion into the study, including “high risk” status and the reasons for the risk. Further you specifically document individual consent to participate in the study. For these reasons and to help facilitate transparency of data reporting we request that you please include the characteristics of the consenting participants.”</p>
              <p>Author response: “We have included a brief summary but in the text refer the reader to this trial’s related manuscript recently published in CID that has a detailed description of the individual participants we consented and recruited but not the trial outcomes. The CID paper should be read in conjunction with the manuscript under review. Please see table 1 in our CID paper: <ext-link xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advancearticle/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac965/6969441?login=false.”" ext-link-type="uri">https://academic.oup.com/cid/advancearticle/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac965/6969441?login=false.”</ext-link></p>
              <p>We were unfortunately unable to access the manuscript via the link above but the editorial team agree that it would be unfair to expect the reader to refer to another paper for this information.</p>
              <p>Please include a table of baseline characteristics of your study population within either the main manuscript or as supporting information. Please ensure that in the manuscript text you direct the reader to where this can be found. This is a prerequisite for publication.</p>
              <p>FIGURE 3</p>
              <p>The formatting of this figure is inconsistent with PLOS Medicine’s formatting requirements and requires revision.</p>
              <p>Numerical values should be present as 0.943, as opposed to .943. Please revise.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the solid dividing lines of your plots do not strike through the plot titles (fig 3b). Titles/headers should be placed above the plots.</p>
              <p>Asterisks are not permitted please revise to include p values. Please report as p&lt;0.001 and where higher as p=0.002, for example. Please do not report as p&lt;.001 or as p=.002</p>
              <p>In figure 3a there are both asterisks and complete values (2nd row ‘medium’). At line 4 (‘GP’) dots and lines overlap numerical values and text – please revise.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that all abbreviations are defined (IRR, CI, GP, KZN, WC) either in an appropriate footnote or in the figure caption.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr Martinson, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Dr. Amitabh Suthar, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Evaluating systematic targeted universal testing for tuberculosis in primary care clinics of South Africa; a cluster randomized trial (The TUTT Trial)" (PMEDICINE-D-22-03274R4) in PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>medicinepress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
              <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Thank you again for submitting to PLOS Medicine. We look forward to publishing your paper. </p>
              <p>Best wishes,</p>
              <p>Pippa </p>
