Schools were randomized to either a youth development account intervention (YDA) [N = 16 schools], YDA plus a multiple family group intervention (YDA + MFG) [N = 15 schools], or bolstered standard of care (BSOC) [N = 16 schools]. We estimated the effect of each intervention (BSOC = referent) on three measures of psychosocial well-being: hopelessness (Beck’s Hopelessness Scale), self-concept (Tennessee Self-Concept Scale), and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) at 12 months following enrollment using multilevel linear mixed models for each outcome.</p>

Over the 12-month follow-up, participants assigned to the YDA + MFG group had significantly greater reductions in hopelessness and improvements in self-esteem outcomes compared to BSOC participants. Those enrolled in the YDA arm alone also had significantly greater reductions in hopelessness compared to BSOC participants.</p>

                  <p id="P4">Combination interventions, combining economic empowerment (represented here by YDA), and family-strengthening (represented by MFG) can improve the psychosocial well-being of AGYW. The long-term effects of these interventions should be further tested for potential scale-up in an effort to address the persistent mental health treatment gap in resource-constrained settings.</p>

          <body>
            <p id="P5">Mental health disorders were the second leading cause of years lived with disability globally in 2019 at nearly 15% and the leading cause of years lived with disability among youth aged 10–24 at 23% [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 50% of mental health disorders develop before the age of 18 and 65% before the mid-twenties [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As adolescents navigate the complex transition from childhood into adulthood, and caregivers lessen their involvement in adolescents’ lives, adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to bullying, social isolation, and low self-esteem, which increase the risk of poor psychosocial health and mental health disorders [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Suboptimal mental and emotional health outcomes during adolescence have lifelong implications for an individual’s overall well-being. As such, adolescence is a critical intervention period for improving health across the life course. Yet, most adolescent mental health care needs go unmet, with a pooled estimate of unmet needs exceeding 50% in adolescents globally [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
            <p id="P6">Over 90% of the world’s children live in low- and middle-income countries, where access to formal mental health care is highly limited. For adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in these settings, suboptimal psychosocial well-being, including low self-esteem, self-concept and hopelessness, often equates to increased engagement in risky sexual behavior [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], drug and alcohol use [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and experiences of sexual violence [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These outcomes can increase risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Our research suggests 16% of adolescent girls aged 14–17 years in Uganda have severe depressive symptoms and nearly one-third (30%) have moderate symptoms [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With a substantial unmet need for mental health care in this setting specifically, novel interventions are needed to bridge the mental health care gap, support and improve the psychosocial well-being of AGYW, and ultimately decrease the risk of long-term consequences attributable to poor mental health.</p>
            <p id="P7">There is abundant evidence that demonstrates poverty and adolescent psychosocial well-being are closely intertwined [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Asset theory suggests that, in addition to improving economic stability, acquisition of assets may yield important psychosocial benefits such as increased feelings of security and self-efficacy, as well as hope for the future [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In line with this theory, economic empowerment (EE) interventions have shown promise for improving a range of psychosocial outcomes among adolescents [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the promise of EE interventions in improving the well-being of children and adolescents, these interventions can take years to yield such improvements, and sustaining the benefits throughout adolescent development remains a challenge [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As such, there is a clear need for interventional supports that can help bolster the psychosocial benefits of EE interventions and sustain these benefits over time.</p>
            <p id="P8">In addition to the direct physical and emotional consequences of poverty and economic instability, these factors have been shown to adversely impact the quality of family relationships, which can exacerbate poor psychosocial outcomes for youth [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, in a cohort of 347 adolescents followed for over 20 years, lower family socioeconomic status yielded fewer parenting investments in their children, which subsequently yielded higher levels of negative adolescent personality traits [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Family strengthening interventions have been shown to directly improve psychosocial outcomes among adolescents in multiple settings [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and lengthen the benefits of improved family economic stability [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the psychosocial benefits of these interventions in combination with EE interventions have not been explored in AGYW who are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health as they navigate the complex transition into young womanhood.</p>
            <p id="P9">In line with asset theory and empirical evidence from EE and family strengthening intervention trials in other populations, we hypothesized that a combination savings plus family strengthening intervention could support rapid improvement in the psychosocial well-being of AGYW in Uganda (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure A1</xref>). In this work, we harnessed longitudinal data from a large (N = 1,260) cluster-randomized controlled trial, “Suubi4Her”, originally aimed at reducing HIV risk in the population [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], to explore this hypothesis. Specifically, we quantify the effects of a savings and combination savings plus family strengthening intervention on three distinct measures of psychosocial well-being: feelings of hopelessness, self-concept, and self-esteem [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

School locations span five geopolitical districts—Rakai, Kyotera, Masaka, Lwengo, and Kalungu—and are geographically distant, minimizing risk of contamination across individuals and schools. These districts are some of the hardest hit by the HIV epidemic in Uganda, with district-level prevalence estimates as high as 17.8% [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>

Flyers providing a brief overview of the study and enrollment steps were distributed to these individuals. Interested adolescents and their caregivers then met one-on-one with the in-country project coordinator to discuss eligibility, the voluntary nature and purpose of the study, extent of participation expectations, potential risks and benefits, and safety and confidentiality. To be eligible, participants had to be (1) female; (2) aged 14–17 years; and (3) in their first or second year of secondary school. Individuals who were living in an institution or orphanage were ineligible as one component of the intervention is family-based. Written informed consent was obtained from the caregivers of interested and eligible adolescents. Adolescents provided written informed assent separately from caregivers to avoid coercion. In total, 1,260 adolescent girls were enrolled between March 2018 and February 2019 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

We assessed the effect of each intervention (BSOC = referent) on each of the three measures of psychosocial well-being–hopelessness, self-concept, and self-esteem–at 12 months following trial enrollment using three separate multilevel, linear mixed models which accounted for the cluster-randomized trial design (where individuals are nested within schools, which were randomized, and observations are nested within individuals, with two observations per individual). In each model, we included fixed effects for a three-category study group variable (BSOC/YDA/YDA + MFG condition), a time variable (baseline/12-month follow-up), and a study group-by-time interaction term. We also estimated a school-level random intercept with an unstructured covariance matrix and accounted for repeated measures within subjects, specifying unstructured residual variances and covariances.</p>

The average household size was seven people (range 2–31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8, 7.2) and a majority of participants were cared for by a biological parent (N = 965; 77%) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 215 (17.1%) participants were orphaned (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

              <p id="P25">At baseline, mean psychosocial scale scores in the study population overall were: hopelessness = 4.1 (range: 0–16; 95% CI: 3.8, 4.4); self-concept = 80.6 (range: 44–100; 95% CI: 79.3, 82.0); self-esteem = 23.4 (range: 3.6–30; 95% CI: 22.9, 23.9).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P27">Poor psychosocial well-being is common among AGYW, particularly in resource-constrained settings, contributing to a host of adverse health outcomes across the life course. In this setting in southwestern Uganda, nearly half of AGYW report moderate to severe depressive symptoms [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite such alarming levels of poor mental health, few interventions have centered on, and been proven effective at, rapidly improving the psychosocial well-being of this population. We assessed the effects of a savings and combined savings and family strengthening intervention on three separate measures of psychosocial well-being among 1,260 Ugandan AGYW over a 12-month follow-up period. While most measures of psychosocial well-being improved in participants across study groups, our results suggest the YDA + MFG was particularly effective at reducing hopelessness and improving self-esteem in this population.</p>
              <p id="P28">We found that YDAs alone yielded a mean reduction in hopelessness scores of 0.9 points in AGYW over a 12-month follow-up period. This small absolute change is larger than that observed in a similar study among adolescents living with HIV and was significantly greater than the 0.5 point decrease observed in BSOC participants. Importantly, this change represents the potential of YDAs to have a more substantial impact on hopelessness over longer periods of follow-up. At odds with existing evidence, YDAs did not have a significantly greater effect on self-concept or self-esteem than BSOC [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is possible that it may take longer to observe these benefits of YDAs as the evidence is mixed regarding the length of time required to see improvements in psychosocial health and how long benefits may be sustained beyond an EE intervention period [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, in our prior work in a population of adolescents living with HIV in the same region in Uganda, we found that an EE intervention similar to the one tested here reduced hopelessness in the subgroup of participants who had a high level of hopelessness at baseline, but only after 24 months and not among study participants overall (mean 24-month change of 4.0 points in subgroup and 1.5 in population overall) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The subgroup effects of the intervention on hopelessness were not sustained beyond the intervention period (i.e., past the 24-month intervention period during which participant savings were being matched) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similar to the current findings, no impact was observed on self-concept potentially suggesting self-concept and self-esteem may function in a distinct manner when compared to hopelessness among youth in this setting. It is possible the YDA intervention tested here would improve both self-esteem and self-concept over a longer follow-up period (e.g., 24 months).</p>
              <p id="P29">Few studies have assessed the effect of family strengthening interventions on the psychosocial well-being of AGYW in the region, and to our knowledge, no studies have assessed the effect of a combined savings and family strengthening intervention on the psychosocial well-being of AGYW. Though the magnitudes of change were small, our results suggest that the combination YDA + MFG intervention yielded greater reductions in hopelessness and improvements in self-esteem than the BSOC over a 12-month follow-up period. AGYW in the YDA + MFG group saw a mean reduction in hopelessness scores of 1.1 points and improvement in self-esteem scores of 1.4 points, while those in the BSOC arm saw changes of 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. Given the YDA intervention only yielded a meaningful impact on feelings of hopelessness, family strengthening may be important for improving the overall well-being of AGYW. With added familial support and education about how to best combat the mental health challenges of adolescence, we hypothesize that multidimensional concepts of one’s self (i.e., self-concept) may also improve over longer periods of time, and that the observed short-term improvements in self-esteem and hopelessness outcomes can be sustained [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Specifically, we believe improvements in family dynamics that are achieved through the cultivation of open and supportive communication during the MFG can persist over time while savings behaviors that are no longer incentivized may fade after trial cessation.</p>
              <p id="P30">These results should be considered within the limitations of the trial. First, as these interventions are family-based specifically, and our sample was restricted to those in their first or second year of secondary school, results are not generalizable to all AGYW. We hypothesize that the YDA and YDA + MFG interventions would be (1) less efficacious among those living within an institution (e.g., boarding school) as these individuals may not have access to the same family support systems through which the interventions are believed to function and (2) more efficacious among those living within a family but not currently enrolled in school as these individuals may be most vulnerable to poor psychosocial health but have appropriate familial support to benefit from the interventions. Second, the self-report nature of the psychosocial well-being measures lends itself to social desirability bias despite the overall high internal reliability of the measures in this and similar contexts—this is not a limitation peculiar to our study. Overall environmental changes, or personal experiences (e.g., stressful life events) experienced over the course of the follow-up period may also contribute to within-subject or between-subject variations. However, because of the randomized nature of the trial, it is unlikely these types of events or changes would have a meaningful effect on study outcomes overall. Finally, we were only able to assess the short-term effects of the interventions explored here. Longer-term follow-up may provide important insight into the functioning of these interventions in improving the well-being of AGYW over time. The randomized, longitudinal nature of this trial is the primary strength of the study. This design allows us to draw robust conclusions about the observed short-term relationships between the intervention and psychosocial outcomes. In addition, we are able to tease apart which intervention components may be most effective at addressing specific psychosocial problems among AGYW, a critical endeavor in appropriately targeting interventions for this population.</p>
              <p id="P31">In conclusion, the findings of this work have important public health implications around improving the psychosocial health of in-school AGYW in resource-constrained settings, including those in sub-Saharan Africa broadly. We found evidence that suggests improving the economic and family situations of in-school AGYW can yield significant improvements in hopelessness and self-esteem in a relatively short period of time—12 months. Given the distinct and myriad challenges faced by this group, the long-term effects of these interventions (i.e., effects beyond the intervention delivery period) should be assessed, and the viability of the interventions for out-of-school AGYW further explored. Moreover, policy-makers and program implementers should consider scale-up of the interventions in similar settings to bridge the mental health treatment gap for AGYW and minimize the long-term implications of adverse psychosocial health during adolescence.</p>
