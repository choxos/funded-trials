              <abstract>
                <p>Stem bromelain, a cysteine protease isolated from pineapples, is a natural anti-inflammatory treatment, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. Curious as to whether bromelain might affect selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling, we studied the ability of bromelain-treated human neutrophils to tether to substrates presenting immobilized P-selectin or E-selectin under shear stress. Bromelain treatment attenuated P-selectin-mediated tethering but had no effect on neutrophil recruitment on E-selectin substrates. Flow cytometric analysis of human neutrophils, using two antibodies against distinct epitopes within the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) active site, revealed that bromelain cleaves PSGL-1 to remove one of two sites required for P-selectin binding, while leaving the region required for E-selectin binding intact. These findings suggest one molecular mechanism by which bromelain may exert its anti-inflammatory effects is via selective cleavage of PSGL-1 to reduce P-selectin-mediated neutrophil recruitment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Inflammation is a complex physiological process involving numerous receptor-ligand interactions between leukocytes and the endothelial lining of the blood vessel that ultimately lead to the trafficking of leukocyte subsets throughout the body <xref rid="pone.0078988-Hamann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Numerous diseases are associated with dysregulated inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, psoriasis, thrombotic disorders, cancer, and autoimmune disease <xref rid="pone.0078988-SchmidSchonbein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Bromelain is a mixture of several cysteine proteases isolated from pineapple extracts, and is taken as a complementary anti-inflammatory treatment <xref rid="pone.0078988-Maurer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Bromelain is known to alter multiple cell surface molecules involved in the adhesion and activation of leukocytes <xref rid="pone.0078988-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> leading to anti-inflammatory, fibrinolytic, and anti-thrombotic effects <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078988-Fitzhugh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0078988-Pirotta1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Previous reports have investigated the effects of bromelain treatment on neutrophil migration in response to chemokines <xref rid="pone.0078988-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078988-Onken1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, bromelain’s ability to alter cell surface molecules involved in the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes on the inflamed endothelium has not been investigated to date. Among the enzymes present in bromelain extract is stem bromelain, which was used in this study and will be simply referred to as bromelain herein.</p>
              <p>Endothelial-expressed P-selectin and E-selectin play central roles during the initiation of an inflammatory response. When the endothelium receives distress signals from underlying tissue, P-selectin is the first biomolecule deployed from intracellular storage pools to the luminal surface <xref rid="pone.0078988-Bonder1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078988-McEver1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The interaction between P-selectin and its primary leukocyte-expressed ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), supports neutrophil rolling along the surface of the blood vessel <xref rid="pone.0078988-Sperandio1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. E-selectin, which binds to PSGL-1 among other ligands <xref rid="pone.0078988-Zou1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> is also presented on the endothelium during the inflammatory response, but its expression is largely controlled by translation <xref rid="pone.0078988-Bevilacqua1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and its presentation temporally lags behind that of P-selectin <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078988-Bonder1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Given these temporal selectin expression dynamics, we felt it would be beneficial to independently probe bromelain’s effects on neutrophil interactions with substrates presenting each of these glycoproteins. To achieve this, we utilized a photochemical surface modification strategy <xref rid="pone.0078988-Toh1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> developed in our lab to generate substrates presenting controlled densities of P-selectin or E-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and then used these substrates to investigate the effect of bromelain treatment on the ability of human neutrophils to tether and roll in flow assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078988-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Glass slides chemically-modified to present benzophenone moieties were immersed in a solution containing the protein of interest–here P- or E-selectin. Photoimmobilization is initiated by exposure to 365 nm light, which results to covalently bound protein through a radical generation mechanism. Importantly, the density of immobilized protein can be systematically defined by carefully controlling the exposure time. Substrates, prepared in batches, were then subsequently used to quantify deposition density (via fluorescence or radioimmunoassay) or utilized to study the effects of bromelain treatment on primary human neutrophil-selectin interactions.</p>

              <p>Neutrophils are among the first responders that rapidly accumulate at sites of inflammation and thus a potential key player in the initial steps of the immune response <xref rid="pone.0078988-WitkoSarsat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Flow cytometric expression analysis of two ligands involved in leukocyte recruitment mediated by P-selectin and E-selectin, PSGL-1 and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), respectively, was performed to determine the effects of bromelain treatment on ligand expression. The results reveal a site-specific proteolysis through which bromelain treatment abolishes interactions between neutrophils and immobilized P-selectin, but not E-selectin, under conditions of physiological shear stress <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting another molecular mechanism through which bromelain may act as an anti-inflammatory agent.</p>

              <title>Results and Discussion</title>
              <p>Interestingly, we found that bromelain treatment of neutrophils nearly eliminated their ability to interact with P-selectin presented on substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, while E-selectin-mediated interactions are unaffected. The observations from neutrophil flow assays were complemented by dose-dependent effects of bromelain treatment on the expression of P-selectin and E-selectin ligands using flow cytometry. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of bromelain may be attributed in part to its ability to proteolytically process PSGL-1 and thereby reduce the number of cells interacting with P-selectin presented on the inflamed endothelium during the initial phases of an inflammatory response.</p>

For the first set of flow assays, human neutrophils were isolated (&gt;90% pure, &gt;95% viable) and flowed at a constant shear stress over substrates presenting immobilized P-selectin at high and low site densities. The number of interacting cells was significantly reduced when neutrophils were treated with 50 µg/mL bromelain, compared to a control sample (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Incubation of control cells with saturating levels of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against PSGL-1, clone KPL-1, which recognizes an epitope encompassing three sulfated tyrosines in the active site of PSGL-1, similarly resulted in a decrease in the number of interacting cells, suggesting that the decreased interactions are due to reduced PSGL-1 association with underlying P-selectin. In the case of bromelain treatment, this is caused by proteolytic cleavage of PSGL-1 so as to remove the region of the molecule required to engage P-selectin.</p>

              <p>It is well established that PSGL-1 is the predominant and most well-characterized binding partner of P-selectin. <xref rid="pone.0078988-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> However, we wanted to validate the specific targeting of PSGL-1 by bromelain as an effector of rolling and tethering on P-selectin substrates and therefore performed an additional control experiment. This experiment utilized neutrophil-like HL-60 promyelocytes, which also tether and roll on P-selectin surfaces via PSGL-1, and a monoclonal anti-PSGL-1 blocking antibody (clone KPL-1) with and without bromelain treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078988-g004">Figure 4</xref>, treatment with the blocking antibody alone led to a marked decrease in the number of tethering events on both “high” and “low” P-selectin substrates. Importantly, HL-60 cells that were treated with bromelain after being blocked with the antibody did not show a further reduction in substrate interaction, confirming the specific action of bromelain on PSGL-1 as it leads to reduced interactions with P-selectin surfaces.</p>

              <p>P-selectin is the primary molecular player that controls initial neutrophil interactions with the inflamed endothelium; however E-selectin is also known to play a key role in mediating leukocyte rolling. PSGL-1 is a ligand for both P- and E-selectin and therefore we wanted to see whether bromelain treatment similarly abolished neutrophil interactions on E-selectin. Isolated human neutrophils were flowed over substrates presenting two different site densities of immobilized E-selectin. In contrast to experiments on P-selectin-presenting substrates, bromelain treatment had no significant effect on neutrophil tethering to immobilized E-selectin. The cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) glycan moiety pendant on PSGL-1 <xref rid="pone.0078988-Fuhlbrigge1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078988-Alon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and other ligands <xref rid="pone.0078988-Borges1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, plays a role in leukocyte tethering and rolling mediated by E-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Alon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To see if neutrophil interactions with immobilized E-selectin could be altered by blocking CLA on all E-selectin ligands, we incubated neutrophils with saturating levels of HECA-452, a widely used mAb that targets CLA. Not surprisingly, this blocking antibody reduced tethering to immobilized E-selectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078988-g003">Figure 3c–d</xref>), though the effect was not as significant as that for the anti-PSGL-1 blocking on P-selectin substrates. The incomplete inhibition of tethering on E-selectin after anti-CLA blocking reflects the fact that E-selectin, unlike P-selectin, has a diverse range of potential binding partners and thus simply blocking one binding epitope does not abolish all interactions, a finding consistent with the literature <xref rid="pone.0078988-Kummitha1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Overall, neutrophil flow assays with E-selectin-presenting substrates reveal that bromelain does not proteolytically abolish all interactions between neutrophils and E-selectin. Importantly, the sulfated tyrosine residue epitope targeted by KPL-1 is not required for recognition of PSGL-1 by E-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Ramachandran1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and so the unaffected interactions with this substrate after bromelain treatment is consistent with a molecularly specific cleavage of PSGL-1, but also supports E-selectin recognition by ligands besides PSGL-1.</p>
              <p>Neutrophils flowed across simple human serum albumin-blocked substrates, without P- or E-selectin, showed no interactions which established that observed cell-substrate interactions were the result of specific receptor-ligand interactions.</p>
              <p>To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which bromelain treatment regulates the initial phases of neutrophil tethering, we performed flow cytometric analyses to determine how expression of PSGL-1, which binds to both P-selectin and E-selectin, is modulated by bromelain treatment. There are two distinct structural domains of PSGL-1 that are required for interactions with each of the selectins and our flow cytometric analysis utilized two mAbs specific for these regions. Antibody KPL-1 recognizes a region that contains the sulfated tyrosine motif required for interactions with P-selectin, but not E-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Ramachandran1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This specificity was previously demonstrated as incubation of leukocytes with the KPL-1 antibody completely blocked interactions with P-selectin without affecting leukocyte recognition of E-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Snapp1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Antibody CHO131 recognizes a sialyl-Lewis<sup>x</sup>–bearing a core 2 O-glycan that is required for interaction of neutrophils with both P-selectin and E-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Walcheck1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Flow cytometric analysis using these antibodies suggests that bromelain is able to specifically cleave PSGL-1 at a site in between the epitopes for clones KPL-1 and CHO131 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078988-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Analysis with clone KPL-1 revealed that the level of the sulfated tyrosine motif is reduced by ∼80% as the dose of bromelain exposure was increased from 0 to 100 µg/mL. However, analysis with clone CHO131 showed that the levels of this epitope were not significantly decreased at all concentrations of bromelain tested. In fact, CHO131 epitope expression moderately increased at low bromelain concentrations before showing a slight decrease at higher concentrations. While we do not completely understand the significance of this increase, it is clear that bromelain is able to directly and dramatically attenuate the sulfated tyrosine motif needed for P-selectin tethering while leaving significant expression of the sLe<sup>x</sup> glycan needed for E-selectin’s interaction with PSGL-1. Treatment of human neutrophils with deactivated bromelain had no significant effect on neutrophil expression of PSGL-1 (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078988.s001">File S1</xref>), suggesting that enzyme activity is required to induce the changes in surface expression of PSGL-1 that we observed following treatment with active bromelain. The molecularly-specific processing of PSGL-1 at a position that down-regulates interactions with P-selectin, yet upstream of the sialyl-Lewis<sup>x</sup>–bearing core 2 O-glycan structure involved in E-selectin interactions, suggests that bromelain may selectively affect the very initial phases of neutrophil recruitment.</p>

When probed with a polyclonal antibody, no statistically significant difference in intensity was observed but an overall reduction in molecular weight was apparent. When visualized by staining with anti-PSGL-1 clone KPL-1, which recognized the N-terminal portion of the protein that present the sulfated tyrosine residues, there was a significant reduction in the band intensity for bromelain treatment compared to the untreated sample (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). These results are consistent with flow cytometry analysis that showed a marked reduction in the N-terminal component of PSGL-1 using the same antibody clone. As a control, human IgG1 Fc was left untreated or treated identically with bromelain and immunoblotted alongside the PSGL-1 Fc chimera. In both blots, no bands were observed in either IgG1 Fc lanes, confirming that changes in PSGL-1 band intensity are not due to interference from the Fc chimera portion of the recombinant protein.</p>

              <p>We also determined the effects of bromelain treatment on expression levels of CLA, a carbohydrate epitope shared by sialyl-Lewis<sup>x</sup> and sialyl-Lewis<sup>a</sup> structures that has been found to be present on PSGL-1 and other E-selectin ligands <xref rid="pone.0078988-Borges1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To characterize CLA expression on neutrophils, we used clone HECA-452, and this analysis revealed that CLA expression declines in a nearly linear fashion by up to 20% as the dose of bromelain increases from 0 to 100 µg/mL (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078988.s001">File S1</xref>).

              <p>In this study we used a combination of molecular biology and controlled chemical surface modification to reveal new insight into one potential molecular mechanism by which bromelain can regulate immune response. We found that bromelain cleaves PSGL-1, P-selectin’s primary ligand that is involved in the onset of selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling during inflammation, resulting in the attenuation of neutrophil recruitment on immobilized P-selectin, but not E-selectin, <italic>in vitro</italic>. While the levels of bromelain utilized in this study are higher than that known to be achievable in serum, previous studies on the effects of bromelain treatment on leukocyte migration and inflammation established the value of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using similarly high relative bromelain concentrations. <xref rid="pone.0078988-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078988-Fitzhugh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Therefore the basic mechanistic insight gleaned from this study, as well as future efforts to understand neutrophil-selectin interactions both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, may reveal additional key insights into the molecular mechanism underlying bromelain’s anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

Briefly, cleaned glass microscope slides were functionalized with 4-(triethoxysilyl)butyl aldehyde (Gelest), incubated with 20 mM 4-benzoyl benzylamine hydrochloride (Matrix Scientific) and 200 mM NaCNBH<sub>3</sub>, followed by immersion in aldehyde-blocking buffer (200 mM ethanolamine, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7), rinsing water, methanol, and ethanol. P-selectin and E-selectin (R&amp;D Systems) were freshly diluted to 2.5 µg/mL from concentrated stocks into PBS with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Sigma). BP-modified substrates were assembled into a rectangular parallel-plate flow chamber (GlycoTech) with a silicone gasket (127 µm thickness). Protein photoimmobilization was enabled through the use of an Ar ion laser (Coherent Innova 90-4, Laser Innovations, 351.1–363.8 nm), whose Gaussian beam profile was converted to a flat-top profile using a π-Shaper (MT-Berlin), and expanded to a 1 cm<sup>2</sup> area using beam-expanding optics (ThorLabs, 14 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). At least six replicate substrates were generated presenting areas of high (650–750 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>) and low (250–400 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>) protein site density by exposing two distinct regions of each substrate for 3 or 30 seconds (for P-selectin) and for 6 or 60 seconds (for E-selectin). Substrates for flow assays were stored in 0.5% human serum albumin (HSA) in Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, HBSS/HEPES) until use, while the remaining replicate substrates were incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies and visualized with a fluorescence slide scanner (Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078988.s001">File S1</xref>, GenePix 4000B, MDS Analytical Technologies), as previously reported for P-selectin <xref rid="pone.0078988-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

One of the RPMI-treated neutrophil samples was resuspended in 30 µg/mL anti-PSGL-1 (clone KPL-1) or anti-CLA (clone HECA-452) and incubated at room temperature for 30–60 min before being diluted to 0.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL for flow assay experiments. The remaining cell pellets were immediately resuspended in HBSS/HEPES with 0.5% HSA to 0.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. All samples were used in flow assay experiments within 2–3 hours of isolation.</p>
                <p>Neutrophils were introduced into the chamber at 3 mL/min (9.3 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 1 min, then the flow rate was dropped to 400 µL/min (1.28 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>). After 1 min, 20–30 sec videos were acquired at 4–5 positions in each area of the substrate. Neutrophils from three donors were used to perform independent experiments on three replicate substrates for each protein. For each substrate, the number of new tethers formed per unit area and time was determined by counting the number of cells that interacted with the surface. Cells that were already rolling or adhered upon the surface were not included in the analysis.
