                <p>Urinary tract infections (UTI), associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), can lead to chronic kidney disease. Genetic alterations in the innate immune defenses contribute to UTI risk. We investigated a novel gene, Dachsous Cadherin-Related 1 (<italic>DCHS1</italic>), in children with UTI. We determined absolute DNA copy number (CN) of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in children with UTI. In this case-control study, we utilized multiple complementary methods to determine the genomic CN of <italic>DCHS1</italic>. Children with (<italic>n</italic> = 370) and without (<italic>n</italic> = 71) VUR from two well-phenotyped clinical trials of UTI were copy-typed and compared to 491 healthy controls with no known history of VUR or UTI. Less than 1% of controls had a single copy of <italic>DCHS1</italic>, while 31% of children with UTI and no VUR and 7% of children with UTI and VUR had a single copy of the <italic>DCHS1</italic> gene. Using immunostaining, we localized expression postnatally to the bladder and renal epithelia. Mice were also challenged with two uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains, and <italic>Dchs1</italic> mRNA was quantified. This study represents the first report of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in association with pediatric UTI. We hypothesize that its role in innate immunity is critical to lower urinary tract defense. Further investigation is required to determine the role of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in innate immunity.</p>

              <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common childhood infections and is caused by uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) in 80% of cases.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Acute pyelonephritis has variable sequelae with or without renal scars, depending on the virulence of the organism and host defense mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Children with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), are at increased risk for UTI-associated sequelae such as chronic kidney disease and renal scarring.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The innate immune system plays a critical role in protecting the urinary tract from uropathogens.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Innate immune responses are rapid and encompass a variety of components, including epithelial extracellular barriers and intracellular tight junctions, antimicrobial peptides, PRRs, inflammatory mediators, and phagocytes.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr8-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> PRRs are protein receptors on the surface of phagocytes, dendrites, and epithelial cells, which recognize microbial molecules and are capable of initialing immune responses called PAMPs.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>

                <p><italic>DCHS1</italic>’s expression and location in postnatal kidney and bladder tissue has not been previously described. Because we discovered a significant genetic variation in <italic>DCHS1</italic> in patients with UTIs, we aimed to localize DCHS1 protein expression using human tissue. In the normal human kidney and the kidney from a patient with pyelonephritis, we demonstrated DCHS1 was expressed by intercalated cells of renal-collecting duct epithelia. As many of the innate immune proteins are expressed in the kidney, DCHS1 localization in intercalated cells highlights its likely role in innate immunity. In the bladder, we demonstrated strong immunostaining in the bladder epithelia. All tissue immunostaining is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425920917193">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

              <p>This study used well-characterized pediatric cohorts from the previously published RIVUR and CUTIE studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In a genome-wide study focused on a subset of UTI patients, our research group identified a novel association of <italic>DCHS1</italic> relative gene CNV with UTI, which has not been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In this report, we determined the absolute DNA CN of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in two clinical cohorts of pediatric UTI to expand on our genome-wide screening study. We found that individuals with low <italic>DCHS1</italic> CN (one copy) were 73 times more prevalent in the CUTIE (UTI without VUR) cohort compared to controls. In the RIVUR cohort (UTI with VUR), one copy individuals were 13 times more prevalent. Even in the absence of VUR, children with UTIs can develop renal scarring, thus showing that UTI-associated genes are important for children at risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p><italic>DCHS1</italic> encodes for atypical cadherin, which belongs to the cadherin superfamily and is a calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesion molecule. The encoded protein has 27 extracellular cadherin repeat domains, transmembrane domain, and a unique cytoplasmic region.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The <italic>Dchs1</italic> gene was found to have role in kidney development in a murine transgenic model.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>
<italic>Dchs1</italic> also has been shown to have a role in cell adhesion, growth, tissue patterning, and planar cell polarity.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, the role of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in the postnatal kidney has not been investigated.</p>
              <p>This report serves as the first study to demonstrate the association of <italic>DCHS1</italic> gene loss in patients with pediatric UTIs. Our immunostaining demonstrates a potential postnatal role of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in the bladder and intercalated cells of the kidneys. Many key components of the innate immune system demonstrate a similar expression pattern. Thus, this finding supports the notion that it is critical in innate defenses.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Because <italic>Dchs1</italic> expression did not significantly increase following UPEC challenge, this gene is likely important in basal defenses and not inducible. Conversely, UPEC may subvert the epithelial response to invasion, although our experiments missed this possible role. Additional murine experiments are needed to dissect the pathways up- and downstream of <italic>DCHS1</italic>. Additionally, transgenic murine studies with bladder and renal collecting duct deletion will help to determine which tissue is key in innate defenses and if intercalated cell dysfunction exists with gene loss.</p>
              <p>We can only hypothesize the precise mechanisms of UTI susceptibility with a single copy of <italic>DCHS1</italic>, and further studies are needed. Because <italic>DCHS1</italic> is expressed on the apical surface of epithelia, <italic>DCHS1</italic> may have a role in pattern recognition and/or inflammatory cascade signaling. Our research group and others have demonstrated the role of intercalated cells in the innate defense of the kidney and urinary tract. Because cell polarity is critical in epithelial cells such as intercalated cells of the collecting duct, we postulate that <italic>DCHS1</italic> single-copy individuals may have subtle intercalated cell innate immune dysfunction leading to UTI susceptibility.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Because we observed the highest percentage of subjects in the UTI cohort without VUR (CUTIE Study cohort) with a single copy of <italic>DCHS1</italic>, we postulate that <italic>DCHS1</italic> CNV is more relevant to infection and immunity than abnormal development of the kidney and urinary tract. Additionally, because genetic variations in <italic>DCHS1</italic> were more prevalent in those with normal urinary tracts and an intact anti-reflux anatomy, the <italic>DCHS1</italic> gene is likely more relevant to bladder as opposed to kidney innate immunity. The gene product may also prevent attachment in the bladder and/or urethra. Thus, in the context of VUR, bacteria may be able to ascend the urinary tract to the kidneys quickly, and the effect of DNA CNVs is blunted if the primary site of action postnatally is the bladder. If this speculation is true, the association of DNA CNVs in patients without VUR would be more consistent with the results of this study.</p>
              <p>We do acknowledge some limitations in this study. First, our study was limited to Caucasian girls. So, results may not apply to other cohorts. Further investigations are needed on diverse cohorts to confirm these findings are consistent across study populations. Additionally, we utilized an adult cohort of women for controls. We utilized this cohort for two reasons. First, large control cohorts of children with no history of UTI are not publicly available. Second, an adult control cohort with no history of UTI should actually have a higher risk of UTI than a pediatric cohort, given the high incidence of UTI in adult women compared to children. The impact of this study may need to be tempered until we can perform additional studies to discover the role of this gene in the postnatal kidney and urinary tract.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study represents the first report of <italic>DCHS1</italic> in association with UTI. We speculate that the site of biological action may be in the lower urinary tract and “bypassed” to a certain extent in individuals with VUR. Thus, <italic>DCHS1</italic> genetic variations associate with pediatric UTI risk, but the effect of these variations is masked by VUR. <italic>DCHS1</italic> can be added to the growing body of disease-modifying genes such as <italic>DEFA1A3</italic>, in conjunction with patient characteristics such as VUR grade and bowel/bladder dysfunction to start creating UTI risk panels for patients at risk for UTI sequelae.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1753425920917193" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Further investigation is required to determine the role of <italic>DCHS1</italic> and innate immune functions of the kidney and urinary tract.</p>
