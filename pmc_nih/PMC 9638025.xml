                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are given as a two-dose schedule in children aged 9–14 years, or as three doses in older individuals. We compared antibody responses after one dose of HPV vaccine in the Dose Reduction Immunobridging and Safety Study (DoRIS), a randomised trial of different HPV vaccine schedules in Tanzania, to those from two observational HPV vaccine trials that found high efficacy of one dose up to 11 years against HPV16 and HPV18 (Costa Rica Vaccine Trial [CVT] and Institutional Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] India trial).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this immunobridging analysis of an open-label randomised controlled trial, girls were recruited from 54 government schools in Mwanza, Tanzania, into the DoRIS trial. Girls were eligible if they were aged 9–14 years, healthy, and HIV negative. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1), using permutated block sizes of 12, 18, and 24, to one, two, or three doses of the 2-valent vaccine (Cervarix, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) or the 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, France). For this immunobridging analysis, the primary objective was to compare geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at 24 months after one dose in the per-protocol population compared with in historical cohorts: the one-dose 2-valent vaccine group in DoRIS was compared with recipients of the 2-valent vaccine Cervarix from CVT and the one-dose 9-valent vaccine group in DoRIS was compared with recipients of the 4-valent vaccine Gardasil (Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) from the IARC India trial. Samples were tested together with virus-like particle ELISA for HPV16 and HPV18 IgG antibodies. Non-inferiority of GMC ratios (DoRIS trial <italic>vs</italic> historical cohort) was predefined as when the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 0·50.

                  <p>Between Feb 23, 2017, and Jan 6, 2018, we screened 1002 girls for eligibility, of whom 930 were enrolled into DoRIS and 155 each were assigned to one dose, two doses, or three doses of 2-valent vaccine, or one dose, two doses, or three doses of 9-valent vaccine. 154 (99%) participants in the one-dose 2-valent vaccine group (median age 10 years [IQR 9–12]) and 152 (98%) in the one-dose 9-valent vaccine group (median age 10 years [IQR 9–12]) were vaccinated and attended the 24 month visit, and so were included in the analysis. 115 one-dose recipients from the CVT (median age 21 years [19–23]) and 139 one-dose recipients from the IARC India trial (median age 14 years [13–16]) were included in the analysis. At 24 months after vaccination, GMCs for HPV16 IgG antibodies were 22·9 international units (IU) per mL (95% CI 19·9–26·4; n=148) for the DoRIS 2-valent vaccine group versus 17·7 IU/mL (13·9–22·5; n=97) for the CVT (GMC ratio 1·30 [95% CI 1·00–1·68]) and 13·7 IU/mL (11·9–15·8; n=145) for the DoRIS 9-valent vaccine group versus 6·7 IU/mL (5·5–8·2; n=131) for the IARC India trial (GMC ratio 2·05 [1·61–2·61]). GMCs for HPV18 IgG antibodies were 9·9 IU/mL (95% CI 8·5–11·5: n=141) for the DoRIS 2-valent vaccine group versus 8·0 IU/mL (6·4–10·0; n=97) for the CVT trial (GMC ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·95–1·60]) and 5·7 IU/mL (4·9–6·8; n=136) for the DoRIS 9-valent vaccine group versus 2·2 IU/mL (1·9–2·7; n=129) for the IARC India trial (GMC ratio 2·12 [1·59–2·83]). Non-inferiority of antibody GMCs was met for each vaccine for both HPV16 and HPV18.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para30">We identified a 2019 review of published reports of the efficacy of single dose HPV vaccination. All studies in the review were observational studies of participants in three large HPV vaccine trials who did not complete their allocated schedules. These included the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) HPV vaccine trial in India, the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT), and the PATRICIA multicentre trial conducted in 14 countries. HPV16 and HPV18 infection was rare in all vaccinated participants up to 7 years after the first dose and all studies reported comparable efficacy of one, two, and three doses of HPV vaccine against HPV16 and HPV18 infection despite differences in antibody levels between the dose groups. We updated this review by searching the Medline, EMBASE, Global Health Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for publications between Aug 1, 2018, and Dec 10, 2021, using the terms “human papillomavirus” AND “vaccines” AND (“immunogenicity” OR “efficacy/effectiveness”) AND “dosage”. We identified two additional studies that extended the CVT and IARC India studies, which found that vaccine efficacy against HPV16 and HPV18 infection endpoints was similar between participants who received one, two, or three doses, and antibody responses remained stable over 11 years for CVT and 9 years for IARC India. Additionally, we identified the first randomised controlled trial of single dose HPV vaccine efficacy, the KEN SHE trial, in girls and women aged 15–20 years in Kenya, which found 97·5% vaccine efficacy for one dose of HPV vaccine compared with a control vaccine at 18 months. However, there is still a paucity of efficacy data from girls in the target age for vaccination (9–14 years).</p>

                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">The Dose Reduction Immunobridging and Safety Study (DoRIS) trial in Tanzanian girls is the first randomised clinical trial to our knowledge to assess the safety and immune responses of a single dose of HPV vaccine compared with two and three doses in girls in the target age for vaccination (9–14 years). Here we present an immunobridging study comparing single-dose vaccine immunogenicity data from the DoRIS trial with historical immunogenicity and efficacy against persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection data derived from single-dose recipients from two previous, large HPV vaccine clinical trials (CVT and IARC India). We found that HPV16 and HPV18 antibody concentrations and seropositivity at 24 months after one dose in young girls in Tanzania were non-inferior to those in adult women (aged 18–25 years) who received one dose in the CVT or girls (aged 10–18 years) who received one dose in the IARC India trial.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para70">One dose of HPV vaccine induces antibody responses that are comparable in different geographies and contexts, and a single dose is likely to be effective against persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection and associated disease. A single dose HPV vaccine schedule could substantially reduce the costs of vaccine purchase and delivery, alleviate vaccine supply constraints, and expand access to the vaccine in the countries that need it most.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para80">The elimination of cervical cancer, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is high on the public health agenda following WHO's 2020 global call for action.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates globally, and access to screening is often restricted or absent.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Prophylactic HPV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are safe and effective in preventing cervical HPV infection and its sequelae. However, estimated global HPV vaccine coverage among girls aged 9–14 years in 2019 was only 15% for full vaccination and 7% in Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, eligible countries.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para90">Four licensed HPV vaccines are available: the two 2-valent vaccines (Cervarix [GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium] and Cecolin [Xiamen Innovax Biotech, Xiamen, China]) that target HPV16 and HPV18; the 4-valent vaccine (Gardasil [Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA]) that targets HPV 6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18; and the 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil-9 [Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, France]) that targets nine genotypes (HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV45, HPV52, and HPV58).</p>
              <p id="para100">The vaccines were originally licensed as a three-dose schedule, but a two-dose schedule was approved in girls younger than 15 years in 2016.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, the costs of setting up and sustaining a multi-dose HPV vaccine programme that targets young girls remain a barrier to HPV vaccine introduction.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> By the end of 2019, only 24% of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) had included HPV vaccination in their national immunisation schedules and complete series coverage is often low.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Therefore, new vaccination approaches are needed if the WHO goal of cervical cancer elimination is to be met. A one-dose vaccine schedule, if effective, could simplify and reduce the costs of vaccine purchase and delivery, facilitate the sustainability of national programmes, and potentially increase uptake of vaccination.</p>
              <p id="para110">Because of the challenges in accruing virological or disease endpoints for efficacy trials when HPV vaccination is given to girls before sexual debut, efficacy of the two-dose schedule of HPV vaccination in young girls has been assessed through immunobridging trials, and the schedule was approved on the basis of antibody data.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In immunobridging trials, anti-HPV antibody concentrations for specific HPV genotypes in a new population group are compared with those in a population group where efficacy has been shown, with the aim of showing that immune responses in the new population are non-inferior to those seen in the original population. If immune responses are shown to be non-inferior, then efficacy is also assumed to be comparable.</p>
              <p id="para120">Data from observational studies suggest that one dose of HPV vaccine might confer durable protection against HPV infection and cervical cancer precursors up to 11 years after vaccination.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Recently, the first randomised trial of single dose efficacy, the KEN SHE trial, in sexually active women aged 15–20 years, found 97·5% efficacy against incident persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection at 18 months compared with a control vaccine.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para130">We did a randomised trial of reduced dose schedules of two HPV vaccines in girls aged 9–14 years in Tanzania to establish whether a single dose of HPV vaccine produces immune responses that are likely to be effective in preventing cervical cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Here we report immunobridging results at 24 months after vaccination, one of the trial's primary objectives, comparing immune responses after one dose in girls aged 9–14 years in Tanzania with those in historical cohorts of girls and young women aged 10–25 years who received one dose and in whom efficacy has been reported.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>

                <p id="para140">In this open-label, randomised controlled trial (Dose Reduction Immunobridging and Safety Study [DoRIS]), we assessed the immunogenicity of two HPV vaccines, the 2-valent HPV vaccine Cervarix and 9-valent vaccine Gardasil-9, in Mwanza, in northwestern Tanzania. Trial procedures have been published previously.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Briefly, girls aged 9–14 years were recruited from 54 government schools. Girls were eligible if they were healthy (as determined by a physician on the basis of medical history and a physical examination) and HIV negative. Full eligibility criteria have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para150">The trial was approved by the Tanzanian Medical Research Coordinating Committee (NIMR/HQ/R.8A/Vol.IX/2236) and the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (11568). Written or thumbprint informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of participants, with written or thumbprint assent from participants.</p>
                <p id="para160">For our immunobridging analysis, we chose two historical cohorts that received one dose of HPV vaccine. These cohorts came from two HPV vaccine trials: the Costa Rica Vaccine trial (CVT)<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and the Institutional Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) India trial.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We chose these studies because they are the only two large-scale studies of one dose of HPV vaccine to our knowledge that have data on long-term efficacy (11 years for CVT and 9 years for the IARC India trial). Although the IARC India trial used the 4-valent vaccine Gardasil rather than the 9-valent vaccine, both vaccines have the same manufacturer (Merck), and have similar immunogenicity and efficacy against HPV16 and HPV18.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The 9-valent vaccine contains a higher dose of antigen and adjuvant than the 4-valent vaccine: 60 μg of HPV16 and 40 μg of HPV18 L1 antigens and 500 μg aluminium hydroxyl-phosphate sulfate adjuvant compared with 40 μg of HPV16 and 20 μg of HPV18 L1 antigens and 250 μg of adjuvant, respectively.</p>

The randomisation list was computer-generated by an independent statistician and trial participant identification numbers assigned sequentially in the order of treatment allocation and put into opaque sealed envelopes.

                <p id="para180">In DoRIS, girls were asked to collect a vaginal swab before vaccination, which was used to detect HPV DNA. We collected blood samples for HPV immune responses including IgG antibodies to HPV16 and HPV18 VLPs and antibody avidity at baseline, and month 1, 7, 12, 24, and 36. Girls in the one-dose and two-dose groups have been enrolled in a trial extension and samples will also be taken at month 60. Here we report data from the 24-month follow-up visit for the one-dose groups.</p>
                <p id="para190">The CVT was a community-based, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial of the 2-valent vaccine Cervarix in women aged 18–25 years in Costa Rica.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Between June 28, 2004, and Dec 21, 2005, 7466 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three doses of the 2-valent vaccine or a control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine), given at baseline, and at 1 and 6 months. Women who did not attend the study clinic within the specified vaccination window did not receive the scheduled dose; therefore, 1480 (765 in the HPV vaccine group) women received only one or two doses of vaccine, mainly because of pregnancy and referral to colposcopy.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Initial follow-up was for 4 years; blood samples for immunogenicity and cervical samples for HPV DNA testing were collected annually during that period. At the end of the trial, women in the HPV vaccine group were invited to participate in a long-term follow-up study and a new unvaccinated control group was recruited; participants were followed up twice a year until August, 2017. Vaccine efficacy against prevalent HPV16 and HPV18 infections at 11 years after HPV vaccination was 82·1% in the one-dose group (with two infections among 112 women), 83·8% in the two-dose group (with one infection among 62 women), and 80·2% in the three-dose group (with 27 infections among 1365 women) compared with the unvaccinated group (with 178 infections among 1783 women). There was no evidence of differences in vaccine efficacy or HPV infection rates across dose groups.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> HPV16 and HPV18 geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in the one-dose group reached a plateau at 6 months after vaccination and remained stable over 11 years.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p id="para200">The IARC India trial was a large, multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of two doses versus three doses of the 4-valent vaccine in girls and young women aged 10–18 years.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Overall, 17 729 individuals were recruited between Sept 1, 2009, and April 8, 2010, at which point trial enrolment and vaccination was suspended by the Indian Government for reasons unrelated to the study. Therefore, some participants received fewer than their allocated number of doses, and 4950 individuals received only one dose. After suspension, the trial was converted to a longitudinal cohort study by default and a group of age-matched and site-matched unvaccinated controls were recruited. Participants have been followed up annually with blood sample collection for immunogenicity from a sample of participants representing all ages of the vaccinated population and cervical sample collection for HPV DNA testing, starting 18 months after participants got married or 6 months after their first child. Follow-up is planned until 2026. Compared with the unvaccinated group (32 infections among 1260 women), vaccine efficacy against persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection at 10 years after vaccination was 95·4% in the one-dose group (with one infection among 2135 women) and was not significantly different from vaccine efficacy in the two-dose group (93·1%; with one infection among 1452 women) and three-dose group (93·3%; with one infection among 1460 women).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>

For the CVT and IARC India trial, we took a random sample of up to 140 participants from the one dose groups in each trial; participants were eligible for the immunobridging study if they attended the 24 month visit within the same window as in DoRIS, had efficacy data available, and had sufficient serum samples from the day 0 and month 24 visits remaining for re-testing. The one-dose 2-valent vaccine group in DoRIS was compared with one-dose group of the same 2-valent vaccine in the CVT, and the one-dose 9-valent vaccine group in DoRIS was compared with one-dose group of the 4-valent vaccine in the India trial.</p>

                <p id="para250">The primary immunobridging objective of the DoRIS trial was to determine whether HPV16 and HPV18 antibody GMCs at 24 months in girls who received one dose in DoRIS were non-inferior to those of one-dose historical cohorts in the CVT and IARC India studies. The secondary immunobridging objective was to determine whether HPV16 and HPV18 seropositivity was non-inferior at 24 months.

Secondary analyses included all participants who received one dose of HPV vaccine, irrespective of baseline antibody or HPV DNA status (ie, total vaccinated cohort).</p>
                <p id="para280">We did separate analyses to compare immune responses after one dose of the 2-valent vaccine in DoRIS with one dose of the 2-valent vaccine in the CVT, and responses after one dose of the 9-valent vaccine in DoRIS with one dose of the 4-valent vaccine in the IARC India trial. We log10-transformed HPV genotype-specific antibody concentrations for analysis. We gave antibody concentrations below the assay cutoff a value of half the cutoff before log transformation.

In the CVT, 115 (42%) of 277 one dose recipients were eligible, and all were included in the immunobridging analysis.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para400">In this immunobridging study, including the first randomised trial of a single dose of HPV vaccine in girls aged 9–14 years, we found that immune responses at 24 months in girls in Tanzania were non-inferior to those in study populations aged 18–25 years in Costa Rica and 10–18 years in India who received one dose and in whom one-dose efficacy against persistent HPV infection has been reported.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These encouraging results show that a single dose of HPV vaccine induces immune responses that are comparable in different populations and geographical contexts, and add to the evidence that a single dose is likely to be effective against persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection and associated disease.</p>
              <p id="para410">Recently, the first randomised controlled trial of single-dose efficacy (KEN SHE), in Kenyan girls and women aged 15–20 years, found that efficacy of both the 2-valent vaccine Cervarix and the 9-valent vaccine Gardasil-9 against persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection at 18 months after vaccination was 97·5% compared with the meningococcal vaccine control group.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We are planning to do an immunobridging analysis of the DoRIS results and the KEN SHE results in the future.</p>
              <p id="para420">In April, 2022, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization met to assess the evidence on the efficacy of the single-dose HPV vaccination schedule, including the results from DoRIS. The committee recommended that the HPV vaccine dose schedule be updated to allow countries to choose a one-dose or two-dose schedule for girls aged 9–14 years and for young women aged 15–20 years.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para430">Because HPV-related disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse) and virological endpoints (persistent infection) might take a long time to accrue and require costly studies, gynaecological examinations, and sampling that might be considered unacceptable in girls in some settings, WHO recommends that immunobridging trials are appropriate for licensure of new dose schedules of HPV vaccines in young adolescents.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Although there is no defined immune correlate of protection to inform licensure, non-inferiority of antibody concentrations is recommended as the main trial endpoint. This recommendation aligns with the large body of evidence that protection after HPV L1 VLP vaccination is mediated via systemic induction of neutralising antibodies, which are effective at very low concentrations.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Antibody concentrations after one dose are known to be inferior to two or three doses, despite similar efficacy. Therefore, licensure of a single dose schedule requires efficacy trials with virological endpoints, along with well-designed immunobridging studies comparing antibody concentrations after one dose in different population groups to antibody concentrations in populations in which virological efficacy of one dose has been reported. If antibody concentrations in the new population are shown to be non-inferior to those in populations in which efficacy has been found, then protection is also expected to be the same.</p>
              <p id="para440">When comparing antibody GMCs, we used a non-inferiority margin of 0·50, which was met for all comparisons. If we had used a more stringent margin of 0·67, indicating that antibody GMCs in DoRIS were not reduced by more than 33%, it would also have been met in both the per-protocol and total vaccinated cohort analyses for each trial, and the post-hoc comparison of antibody responses among girls younger than 15 years in the IARC India trial. In the total vaccinated cohort, antibody concentrations in participants in DoRIS remained non-inferior to those of the historical cohorts; although 16% of participants in CVT were HPV16 or HPV18 DNA or seropositive at enrolment and so vaccination might have acted as a booster of their response to natural infection. Interestingly, GMCs in DoRIS were not significantly higher than those in the CVT, despite the older age of participants in the CVT than in DoRIS. The higher GMCs and seroconversion rates observed in DoRIS than in the IARC India trial might in part be due to the higher dose of antigen and adjuvant in the 9-valent vaccine than in the 4-valent vaccine, particularly for HPV18, for which the antigen dose has been doubled. This finding might also be explained in part by the age difference, because participants in DoRIS were younger on average than those in the IARC India trial.</p>
              <p id="para450">Data from the CVT have shown that one dose of the 2-valent vaccine provides sustained HPV16 and HPV18 antibody levels for at least 11 years and that vaccine efficacy among women who received one dose was not significantly different from those who received three doses.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Similarly, the IARC India trial has shown sustained antibody levels after one dose of the 4-valent vaccine with no difference in protection against persistent HPV16 and HPV18 infection compared with three doses for up to 9 years.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para460">Although participants in DoRIS were on average younger than those in the CVT and IARC India trials, restricting to the same age group in the IARC India study in a post-hoc analysis made no difference to the results. Because vaccinating girls in preadolescence produces higher GMCs than when vaccinated later in life,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> the age difference is unlikely to affect results at later timepoints.</p>
              <p id="para470">Strengths of our study include the immunobridging analysis of results for two HPV vaccines in two population groups among whom long-term efficacy has been found, allowing us to investigate the reproducibility of the one-dose results across three different geographical regions and different vaccines. DoRIS was run in a region with an extremely high burden of cervical cancer and where vaccination is most needed. We tested the samples from DoRIS, CVT, and the IARC India trial in the same batch, using a well validated assay,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> to minimise potential variability and allow robust comparisons between the studies.</p>
              <p id="para480">Our study also had several limitations. One limitation of our study is that, although the vaccines used in DoRIS and the IARC India trial are similar (9-valent and 4-valent vaccines), they are not identical. However, a randomised trial of the two vaccines has shown that, despite their differences, they have similar efficacy and immunogenicity for HPV genotypes in common.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Other limitations include a follow-up period of only 24 months. Immunogenicity data will also be collected from DoRIS participants at 5 years after vaccination and immunobridging analyses to later timepoints from CVT and the IARC India trial are planned. Additionally, a trial in Tanzania of one-dose HPV vaccination in boys is underway (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04953130" id="interrefs30">NCT04953130</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="para490">In summary, our findings contribute to the evidence that one dose of HPV vaccine might provide strong protection against cervical cancer and be a promising strategy towards achieving cervical cancer elimination in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. A single dose HPV vaccine schedule could substantially reduce the costs of vaccine purchase and delivery, alleviate vaccine supply constraints, and expand access in the countries that need it most.</p>

              <p id="para520">Deidentified participant data presented in this Article can be made available after publication following written request to the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU), Tanzania. Requests must be accompanied by an analysis plan, which will be reviewed by the MITU Data Sharing Committee and lead investigators for each trial. Requesting researchers will be required to sign a Data Access Agreement if approval is given. De-identified participant data from the blinded phase of the CVT can be shared with outside collaborators for research to understand more about the performance of the HPV vaccine, immune response to the vaccine, and broader study factors associated with the natural history of HPV infection and risk factors for infection and disease. Outside collaborators can apply to access the protocols and data online; to request an application and information pack, email CVTDataSharing@westat.com.

                <p>The DoRIS trial was funded by the UK Department for International Development/UK Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Joint Global Health Trials Scheme (MR/N006135/1) and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1167526). This work has also been funded in part with Federal funds from the NCI, National Institutes of Health (under contract numbers HSN261200800001E and 75N91019D00024). We thank the staff and management of the MITU, the study site team, laboratory and data team, and administrative, project management, and other support staff at MITU and LSHTM. We thank the community engagement team and DoRIS trial participants and their parents and the participating primary and secondary schools in Mwanza. We acknowledge the advice and guidance given by the Trial Steering Committee and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board. CVT is a long-standing collaboration between investigators in Costa Rica and the NCI. The trial is sponsored and funded by the NCI (contract N01-CP-11005), with funding support from the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women's Health. For CVT, GSK Biologicals provided HPV vaccine and support for aspects of the trial associated with regulatory submission needs of the company under a Clinical Trials Agreement (FDA BB-IND 7920) during the 4-year, randomised blinded phase of the study. We thank the women of Guanacaste and Puntarenas, Costa Rica, who participated in the study. The IARC India trial is a collaboration between investigators in IARC and India. IARC is the autonomous cancer research agency of WHO. The study was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and Merck provided the vaccines through a memorandum of understanding with WHO. Establishment of the Luminex-based assays at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) was partly supported by the European Commission-Seventh Framework Programme grant HPV-AHEAD (FP7-HEALTH-2011-282562). We thank the field staff at the project sites in India and scientists and technicians at RGCB for their tremendous effort and dedication; the district administrative, civic, education, and health authorities, and medical practitioners in the districts of India where the studies are located for their cooperation, facilitation, and assistance in implementing the study; and the study participants, their parents, families, and legal guardians for their understanding, cooperation, excellent and continuing participation in the study, and follow-up procedures despite the challenges and misinformation after suspension of HPV vaccination.</p>
