                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Observational studies have linked slower and faster net ultrafiltration (UF<sub>NET</sub>) rates during kidney replacement therapy (KRT) with mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload. To inform the design of a larger randomised trial of patient-centered outcomes, we conduct a feasibility study to examine restrictive and liberal approaches to UF<sub>NET</sub> during continuous KRT (CKRT).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is an investigator-initiated, unblinded, 2-arm, comparative-effectiveness, stepped-wedged, cluster randomised trial among 112 critically ill patients with AKI treated with CKRT in 10 intensive care units (ICUs) across 2 hospital systems. In the first 6 months, all ICUs started with a liberal UF<sub>NET</sub> rate strategy. Thereafter, one ICU is randomised to the restrictive UF<sub>NET</sub> rate strategy every 2 months. In the liberal group, the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate is maintained between 2.0 and 5.0 mL/kg/hour; in the restrictive group, the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate is maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 mL/kg/hour. The three coprimary feasibility outcomes are (1) between-group separation in mean delivered UF<sub>NET</sub> rates; (2) protocol adherence; and (3) patient recruitment rate. Secondary outcomes include daily and cumulative fluid balance, KRT and mechanical ventilation duration, organ failure-free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, hospital mortality and KRT dependence at hospital discharge. Safety endpoints include haemodynamics, electrolyte imbalance, CKRT circuit issues, organ dysfunction related to fluid overload, secondary infections and thrombotic and haematological complications.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Fluid overload develops in over two-thirds of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who require kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and is independently associated with morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> International consensus guidelines recommend initiating extracorporeal fluid removal when a life-threatening fluid overload occurs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> However, there is uncertainty about the optimal net fluid removal rate, and there is a global variation in clinical practice.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref> In addition, complications such as intradialytic hypotension, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias frequently occur during fluid removal.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 10</xref>

                <p>Observational studies have found a ‘J’ shaped association between the rate of net fluid removal (ie, net ultrafiltration (UF<sub>NET</sub>) rate) and mortality among critically ill patients with AKI undergoing continuous KRT (CKRT). Patients who received UF<sub>NET</sub> rates of 1.01–1.75 mL/kg/hour had the lowest mortality and KRT dependence compared with patients who received slower rates of less than 1.01 mL/kg/hour or faster rates of greater than 1.75 mL/kg/hour.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref> In addition, UF<sub>NET</sub> rates greater than 1.75 mL/kg/hour were associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the causality between UF<sub>NET</sub> rate, a process of care variable, and mortality remains unclear, as randomised trials investigating this association have not been conducted.</p>

                <title>Need for a trial</title>
                <p>First, the net risks and benefits of slower and faster UF<sub>NET</sub> rates on clinical outcomes are unclear due to the limitations in observational studies. For instance, slower UF<sub>NET</sub> rates are tolerated haemodynamically but expose patients to prolonged fluid overload, organ oedema and increased risk of death.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> Moreover, slower UF<sub>NET</sub> rates may also reflect the underlying severity of illness with greater haemodynamic instability. Whereas faster UF<sub>NET</sub> rates are associated with earlier attainment of negative fluid balance and less fluid overload, but may also cause cardiac arrhythmias, haemodynamic instability, ischaemic organ injury and mortality.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, faster UF<sub>NET</sub> rates may also reflect more fluid overload in patients with severe illnesses or comorbidities.</p>
                <p>Second, there is significant variation in the current clinical practice of UF<sub>NET</sub>.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A clinical trial is essential to develop best practice guidelines for volume dosing in critically ill patients. Third, no clinical trial has investigated the effectiveness of UF<sub>NET</sub> rates on long-term patient-centred clinical outcomes. Although it may be unethical to randomise patients to UF<sub>NET</sub> versus no UF<sub>NET</sub>, clinical trials comparing alternative approaches to UF<sub>NET</sub> can be performed. Indeed, in surveys, more than two-thirds of clinicians had the equipoise to enrol patients in a clinical trial of protocol-based UF<sub>NET</sub>.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7 9</xref>

                <p>This ongoing clinical trial is an investigator-initiated, prospective, unblinded, parallel-group, 2-arm, comparative-effectiveness, stepped-wedged cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT) including 112 critically ill patients with AKI treated with CKRT conducted in 10 intensive care units (ICUs) across 2 hospital systems (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) in the USA. The trial initially planned to enrol 144 patients in 6 ICUs. Enrolment was slower than expected, so the sample size was decreased to 112 patients, and the number of ICUs was increased to 10. Participants are enrolled from 5 ICUs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and 5 ICUs at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The study commenced enrolment on 5 July 2022 and is anticipated to end on 12 January 2025. The University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protections Office (HRPO) approved the protocol (No. 21080010), and the trial has been prospectively registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05306964).

The data management team uses a computer-generated randomisation scheme to determine how each ICU would cross from the liberal to the restrictive group.

Blinding is not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. To precisely determine and dose the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate, we use a web-based UF<sub>NET</sub> rate calculator (ie, a web app). This web app calculates the hourly UF<sub>NET</sub> rate range to be set on the CKRT machine based on the allocation to the intervention group, the rate of intravenous fluids infused in the current hour, and the patient predicted body weight (PBW). We accounted for the rate of intravenous infusions because the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate dosing represents the net intravascular volume removed beyond the volume infused in the current hour. We chose predicted PBW,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> as it is free of confounding by fluid overload and catabolism due to critical illness and measurement errors. In both groups, the initial UF<sub>NET</sub> rate is set at 0.5 mL/kg/hour and then increased by 0.5 mL/kg/hour, as tolerated (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).</p>

                  <p>The UF<sub>NET</sub> rate is titrated and maintained between 2.0 and 5.0 mL/kg/hour throughout the study. For instance, in a patient with PBW 70 kg, the UF<sub>NET</sub> is initiated at 35 mL/hour (ie, 70×0.5) and increased by 35 mL/hour to a maximum of 350 mL/hour (ie, 70×5.0) as tolerated. The UF<sub>NET</sub> rate is then titrated between 140 and 350 mL/hour. If the patient also receives an infusion of 100 mL/hour in fluids, the initial UF<sub>NET</sub> rate will be set at 135 mL/hour. The UF<sub>NET</sub> rate is then increased and maintained between 240 and 450 mL/hour for the duration the patient receives 100 mL/hour volume infusion. If the additional 100 mL/hour fluid is discontinued in the patient, the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate will be maintained between 140 and 350 mL/hour.</p>

Using the sample size calculation for SW-CRT design, we estimated that 111 patients would have 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis that the average UF<sub>NET</sub> rate was at least 0.53–0.57 mL/kg/hour different between the two groups, using intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, at a Standard Deviation of 0.75 and assuming mean UF<sub>NET</sub> rate of 1.0 mL/kg/hour.

We will perform exploratory analysis to examine between-group differences in peak (ie, maximum) delivered UF<sub>NET</sub> rates and compare the longitudinal UF<sub>NET</sub> rate trajectories between the two groups. Subgroup analysis will be conducted among those with and without&gt;10% fluid overload at enrolment; eGFR≥ and &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; duration of UF<sub>NET</sub> before enrolment≥6 and &lt;6 hours; age≥65 and &lt;65 years; with and without sepsis; and baseline cardiovascular SOFA Score≥3 and &lt;3.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We wrestled with a few study design challenges. We made decisions based on previous research, surveys of existing practice and an iterative consensus model when data were less rigorous. We detail these challenges and decisions subsequently here.</p>
              <p>First, our overall objective is to conduct a larger randomised trial to assess the influence of protocol-based UF<sub>NET</sub> strategy on patient-centred outcomes. Thus, we sought to develop a pilot protocol that is feasible to deploy. Based on observational studies, we hypothesised that a restrictive UF<sub>NET</sub> rate strategy embracing a ‘<italic toggle="yes">slow and steady</italic>’ approach to fluid removal is feasible and is associated with fewer complications than a more liberal ‘<italic toggle="yes">sprint and pause</italic>’ strategy. We chose a UF<sub>NET</sub> rate of 0.5–1.5 mL/kg/hour in the restrictive arm because these UF<sub>NET</sub> rates are inclusive of the rates studied in the middle UF<sub>NET</sub> rate group in observational studies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 13</xref> We chose 2.0–5.0 mL/kg/hour in the liberal arm because these UF<sub>NET</sub> rates are also within the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate ranges studied in observational studies<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 13</xref> and surveys.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>
</p>
              <p>Second, we debated including a usual care arm in our trial. However, there are few published protocols for UF<sub>NET</sub>, and surveys show considerable variation in clinical practice.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref> This makes it difficult to define what represents usual care for UF<sub>NET</sub>. A usual care arm was also not feasible due to budgetary constraints. Additionally, the scientific validity of a usual care arm is questionable, given the likelihood of drift in treatment practice over time due to the Hawthorne effect. To ensure the separation of delivered UF<sub>NET</sub> rates between study groups and to assess clinical outcomes, we decided to protocolise the UF<sub>NET</sub>. Our study design is similar to previous trials of protocol-driven solute dosing strategies for AKI,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> acute respiratory distress syndrome<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 35</xref> and sepsis.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> These trials did not include a usual care arm because there was no consensus regarding best practices or precise knowledge of prevailing practice patterns before trial implementation.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref>
</p>
              <p>Third, we ensured the treatment arms paralleled current clinical practice in implementing the two intervention strategies. As a preparatory to the trial, a survey of attending intensivists and nephrologists at the two study sites suggested that most clinicians had the equipoise to enrol their patients in this trial. Fourth, we recognised that the protocol might be challenging based on haemodynamic factors, clinician preference, staffing burden and safety. Thus, we assessed attending physician equipoise to the UF<sub>NET</sub> rate before enrolment; developed protocols for managing haemodynamic instability; recommended conservative fluid management and rescue UF<sub>NET</sub> procedures; and allowed clinicians to stop or personalise UF<sub>NET</sub> based on patient needs. Finally, we collect granular safety outcomes data to assess risks to the patients monitored by the DSMB and the University of Pittsburgh HRPO.</p>
              <p>The design of this feasibility trial has limitations. First, caregivers cannot be blinded due to the nature of the intervention; however, awareness of treatment assignment is unlikely to compromise the study’s validity due to the protocolisation of intervention and the objective outcomes. Second, it is possible that attending physicians will have firm beliefs about the rates of UF<sub>NET</sub>, and awareness of treatment assignment may bias physicians to allow or not allow enrolment of their patients; for this reason, we assessed equipoise every 12–24 hours and are capturing reasons for non-enrolment that will be examined across the two groups. Third, we did not assess circulating intravascular volume to guide UF<sub>NET</sub>, as no technology has been validated for fluid removal.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
              <p>Extracorporeal net fluid removal is labor-intensive, expensive and associated with complications. The lack of high-quality data makes it challenging for clinicians to determine the optimal approach to UF<sub>NET</sub>. The Restrictive versus Liberal rate of Extracorporeal Volume removal Evaluation in Acute Kidney Injury study is the first randomised trial to evaluate the feasibility of alternative UF<sub>NET</sub> approaches and will inform the study design of a larger clinical trial to assess patient-centred outcomes.</p>
