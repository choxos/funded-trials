                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>As critical care practice evolves, the sepsis survivor population continues to expand, often with lingering inflammation in many organs, including the liver. Given the concurrently increasing population of patients with NAFLD, in this study, we aimed to understand the long-term effect of sepsis on pre-existing NAFLD and hyperglycemia.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Male mice were randomized to a high-fat diet or a control diet (CD). After 24 weeks on diet, mice were inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic>). Serial glucose tolerance tests, and insulin and pyruvate challenge tests were performed 1 week before infection and at 2 and 6 weeks after infection. Whole tissue RNA sequencing and histological evaluation of the liver were performed. To test whether persistent inflammation could be reproduced in other abnormal liver environments, mice were also challenged with <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> after exposure to a methionine-choline–deficient high-fat diet. Finally, a retrospective cohort of 65,139 patients was analyzed to evaluate whether obesity was associated with liver injury after sepsis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>After <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> inoculation, high-fat diet mice had normalized fasting blood glucose without a change in insulin sensitivity but with a notable decrease in pyruvate utilization. Liver examination revealed focal macrophage collections and a unique inflammatory gene signature on RNA analysis. In the clinical cohort, preobesity, and class 1 and class 2 obesity were associated with increased odds of elevated aminotransferase levels 1–2 years after sepsis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>The combination of diet-induced obesity and pneumosepsis survival in a murine model resulted in unique changes in gluconeogenesis and liver inflammation, consistent with the progression of benign steatosis to steatohepatitis. In a cohort study, obese patients had an increased risk of elevated aminotransferase levels 1–2 years following sepsis.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Obesity is a disease characterized by the expansion of adipose tissue with both adipose-specific and systemic inflammatory consequences.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Obesity not only predisposes to medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart failure, and coronary artery disease, but also contributes to an increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit. Clinical management of critically ill obese patients is complex due to multiple factors, including altered drug metabolism and complicated airway management.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Despite these complexities, some studies note obesity is associated with improved survival in patients hospitalized for sepsis.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Importantly, these observations are limited by their reliance on elevated body mass index (BMI), which does not necessarily correlate with adiposity.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Though these studies implicate a protective effect of obesity on survival, the longer term interactions of prior sepsis and obesity on metabolism, inflammation, and obesity-associated diseases (eg, fatty liver disease or insulin resistance) have not been well explored.</p>
              <p>Sepsis survival is associated with increased long-term risk of new cardiovascular, lung, kidney, and brain dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Persistently altered systemic and tissue-specific inflammatory responses are hypothesized to contribute to these complications.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The pathogenesis of sepsis is in part related to metabolic-associated molecular patterns.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Type II diabetes, a metabolic condition, when paired with sepsis, is thought to result in immune dysregulation.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Not only this, obesity itself can also result in organ inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Acutely, data show that obesity alters the effects of sepsis on the immune system, metabolism, and subsequent risk for organ injury. For example, after acute sepsis obese mice show improved mortality but worse kidney injury and altered glucose metabolism in surviving animals compared with lean mice.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Obesity and polymicrobial sepsis result in worsened cardiac function.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Acute sepsis through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in obese mice is also associated with increased neutrophilic inflammation in the liver.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, as prior murine work has focused on acute time points after sepsis, the interaction of obesity and sepsis survival on obesity-related organ dysfunction remains understudied. In addition, 24% of patients hospitalized with sepsis are obese; thus, examining the relationship of obesity with long-term organ injuries in sepsis survivors is also clinically relevant.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>NAFLD is a common complication of obesity. NAFLD is a growing health concern. Steatosis has a prevalence of 65% in patients with class I and class II obesity and 85% in those with a BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> NASH, the progression of NAFLD, can predispose to hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, and result in a need for liver transplantation. It has been widely hypothesized that “second-hit” inflammatory stimulus or multiple parallel pathogenic insults are required for NAFLD to progress to NASH.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Prior studies have postulated that inflammatory stimuli that progress NAFLD to steatohepatitis include oxidative stress and bacterial endotoxins.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The long-term posthospital management of sepsis survivors is an increasingly important health concern, and the intersection of sepsis survival, obesity, and NAFLD has not been explored.</p>
              <p>Motivated by this literature, we sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes of NAFLD in obese pneumosepsis survivors. To model murine sepsis, we used an established antibiotic-treated model of <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic>) pneumosepsis survival, which we combined with diet-induced obesity.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this model, we hypothesize that the metabolic syndrome (fatty liver disease, obesity, and hyperglycemia) followed by septic insult results in persistent metabolic dysfunction and long-term liver inflammation. We found a decrease in blood glucose after pneumosepsis in obese mice. However, rather than representing an improvement of insulin sensitivity, this lowered blood glucose reflected persistent liver dysfunction, with notable changes in pyruvate metabolism and associated liver inflammation and macrophage burden. Although inflammation was seen in high-fat diet (HFD)–fed <italic toggle="yes">Kpa-</italic>infected mice, there was no evidence of collagen upregulation or fibrosis on picrosirius red evaluation. Therefore, we used a nutrient-deficient HFD with 0.1% methionine and no added choline (methionine-choline–deficient high-fat diet [MCD-HFD]). We found that MCD-HFD mice infected with <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> had upregulation of liver <italic toggle="yes">Col3a1</italic> expression. Finally, using a large cohort of human sepsis survivors, we hypothesized that patients with obesity have a higher risk of developing long-term liver injury. We found that 1–2 years after admission for sepsis, there was an increased risk of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in patients with class I and class II obesity. These findings are important as they highlight the effects of sepsis on the progression of underlying medical conditions.</p>

                <p>To evaluate whether obesity modified liver injury after sepsis, we evaluated a national cohort of patients hospitalized with severe sepsis or septic shock in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system from 2015 to 2018. This retrospective chart review was deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board. Sepsis hospitalizations were identified by evidence of infection and acute organ dysfunction in the electronic health record consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s sepsis surveillance definition, as described.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Liver injury was defined as a change in ALT. Patients with baseline liver function measured within 180 days prior to sepsis hospitalization were included. Patients with total bilirubin &gt;4.5 in the 180 before hospitalization were excluded. To minimize incorrectly charted data, patients with weight &lt;75 pounds, weight &gt;500 pounds, height &gt;84 inches, or height &gt;50 inches were excluded (Supplemental Table S2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A414" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A414</ext-link>). Baseline BMI was calculated using the lowest weight in the 30 days before hospitalization and the tallest height in the 2 years before hospitalization. BMI was stratified using World Health Organization categories with underweight (&lt;18.5), normal (18.5 to &lt;25), preobesity (25 to &lt;30), obesity class 1 (30 to &lt;35), obesity class 2 (35 to &lt;40), and obesity class 3 (≥40).</p>
                <p>Acute liver injury was defined as the highest ALT measured from the day of emergency department (ED) presentation +30 days being &gt;40 and greater than a 50% increase from baseline ALT. Subacute liver injury was defined as the lowest ALT measured from day + 31 to + 180 following ED presentation being &gt;40 and a &gt;50% increase from baseline ALT. One-year liver injury was defined as the lowest ALT measured from day + 181 to +365 following ED presentation being &gt;40 and greater than a 50% increase from baseline ALT. Two-year liver injury was defined as the lowest ALT measured from day + 366 to + 730 following ED presentation being &gt;40 and greater than a 50% increase from baseline ALT. Mortality was also evaluated.</p>
                <p>This portion of the study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Ann Arbor VA Institutional Review Board.

                <p>Mice were started on CD or HFD, which was continued for at least 24 weeks, at which time metabolic testing was performed before infection. Mice were then anesthetized and then intranasally inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> or saline. All mice were then given 5 days of ceftriaxone, regardless of infection (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Antibiotic treatment resulted in effective clearance of infection, with no detectable bacterial dissemination to the liver at 14 days after inoculation (Supplemental Figure S1, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A487" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A487</ext-link>). Before infection, HFD mice had elevated fasting blood glucose compared with their CD counterparts, as expected. By repeated measures ANOVA, there was a significant difference between CD and HFD (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) with principal differences at <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 0, 15, 30 minutes (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Two weeks after pneumosepsis, after antibiotic therapy, HFD mice had similar blood glucose to the CD cohort (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). In addition, when analyzing the AUC of glucose levels over time for individual mice, there was a significant decrease in blood glucose in response to glucose in HFD mice after infection compared with before infection (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Weight-based glucose dosing was completed using lean mass as determined by MRI findings. Of note, on MRI evaluation, there was no significant change in lean mass between groups 2 weeks after <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> pneumosepsis (Supplemental Figure S2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A417" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A417</ext-link>).</p>

                <p>Given the notable change in blood glucose and AUC glucose tolerance testing, serial fasting blood glucose measurements were completed at 2 and 6 weeks after pneumosepsis. Two weeks after pneumosepsis, there was a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose in <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> HFD mice compared with saline HFD mice (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). This observation was not seen in mice-fed CD. Reduced fasting blood glucose persisted for 1.5 months after infection (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Both CD-fed and HFD-fed <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> mice had decreased food intake up to 5 days after pneumosepsis. However, by the time of evaluation of fasting blood glucose, food intake had normalized between all groups for at least 7 days (Supplemental Figure S3, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A488" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A488</ext-link>). Taking data at both 2 weeks and 1.5 months after infection, specifically in <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> HFD mice, the change in weight on the day of fasting blood glucose did not correlate with the magnitude of change in fasting blood glucose (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). In addition, the <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> HFD mice had regained 100% of baseline weight at 1.5 months after pneumosepsis (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). To evaluate whether the change in glucose homeostasis was a simple result of increased insulin sensitivity specifically in HFD mice after infection, an insulin tolerance test was completed.

                <p>Given the evidence of ongoing steatohepatitis and associated macrophage activation in the livers of <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> HFD mice, we sought to evaluate whether this was associated with differences in hepatic fibrosis using liver <italic toggle="yes">Col13a1</italic> expression and picrosirius red staining for evidence of type III collagen deposition. In our <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic>-treated HFD mice, there was no significant difference in <italic toggle="yes">Col3a1</italic> expression (Supplemental Figure S4, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A489" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A489</ext-link>). Furthermore, picrosirius red staining as evaluated by polarized light was negative in all 4 groups, indicating no development of fibrosis (data not shown). In murine models, HFD alone without nutrient deficiencies requires prolonged exposure to result in liver fibrosis. Therefore, to determine whether hepatic fibrosis could be observed more generally after pneumosepsis survival in a disordered liver microenvironment, we used another model that more closely mimics NASH by subjecting young (6–8 wk) mice to a 2-week pulse of MCD-HFD.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Mice were first challenged with MCD-HFD before infection (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). We found that, after infection, <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic>-infected mice showed an increase in <italic toggle="yes">Chil3</italic> gene expression (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). On hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, there was an increase in aggregates in the parenchyma, which were found to be YM1 positive (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, D). Notably, there was upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">Col3a1</italic> expression (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E), and picrosirius red by polarized light staining showed increased staining in <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic>-infected mice indicating the development of fibrosis (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F). These findings indicate generalizability to our results in HFD mice that prior pneumosepsis can augment liver-associated inflammation and contribute to fibrosis.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Obesity, NAFLD, and sepsis survival are conditions with increasing worldwide prevalence. There is epidemiological data regarding the intersection of these conditions and, however, complicated by confounders in the care of patients with obesity. Sepsis and obesity have been specifically studied in murine models, usually in models of lethal sepsis.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> However, there is a paucity of murine data regarding sepsis survivorship, a clinical entity with known long-term multiorgan dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>In this study, we aimed to understand the long-term effect of pneumosepsis survivorship on underlying obesity when associated with fatty liver disease. Surprisingly, pneumosepsis resulted in decreased fasting blood glucose in mice with underlying diet-induced fatty liver disease and hyperglycemia. Lowered fasting blood glucose can certainly be due to weight loss and a concurrent improvement in insulin sensitivity, as is seen in bariatric surgery.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> However, we found no difference in insulin sensitivity in obese-uninfected mice and obese pneumosepsis survivor mice.</p>
              <p>Given the lack of difference in insulin sensitivity, we aimed to evaluate gluconeogenesis, as hepatic glucose production is a significant driver of glucose homeostasis in rodents.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Specifically, pyruvate is key <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> substrate of gluconeogenesis.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Pyruvate is important to glucose metabolism and can be used in liver anabolic and catabolic processes.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Therefore, we proceeded with a pyruvate tolerance test and notably found a significant change in pyruvate utilization in obese pneumosepsis survivor mice. This unique finding drew our attention to the histological and transcriptomic evaluation of the liver as potentially hepatic dysfunction explained improvement in blood glucose in obese <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic>-infected mice. Notably, the liver revealed increased inflammation, persistent to 1.5 months after infection.</p>
              <p>Macrophages are a cardinal force in the development of fibrosis and inflammation. In obese states, macrophages can exhibit plasticity and cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In a prior murine model, fatty liver disease followed by sepsis through CLP time to mortality was attenuated by the deletion of TREM2 macrophages.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In fibrotic murine livers, there is upregulation of both M1 and M2 macrophages. However, data show that, in livers undergoing resolution of fibrosis, there was a notable dearth of M2 macrophages, implying that the M1 macrophages were largely responsible for fibrosis resolution.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> The alternative macrophage pathway is also postulated to be a prevailing force in fibrogenesis.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> YM1, an M2 macrophage marker, has been used as a marker for differential upregulation in a murine NASH model.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> YM1 has also been used in evaluating lung fibrosis and is thought to potentially be a marker of oxidative stress.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Given this signature of liver inflammation on pre-existing fatty liver disease after <italic toggle="yes">Kpa</italic> pneumosepsis, we postulated that pneumosepsis is the “second hit” that results in the development of steatohepatitis and potentially fibrosis. Sepsis stimulates free fatty acid production resulting in worsened metabolic disorders, and the free fatty acids can then cause inflammation and lipotoxic effects on the liver.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Potentially oxidative stress and the release of free fatty acids in sepsis could impact the progression of NAFLD to NASH. In fact, a prior study showed the use of C75, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, lowered free fatty acid accumulation in the liver, and increased survival after CLP.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> However, it is well known that murine models of steatohepatitis and fibrosis are difficult to elucidate on HFD alone without prolonged exposure, toxins, or provocative nutrient deficiencies, such as a methionine-choline–deficient diet. We aimed to intensify our infectious model with a highly inflammatory MCD-HFD to accelerate fibrosis. Therefore, we infected a group of mice after a 2-week exposure. In this cohort, we found upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">Col3a1</italic> and increased picrosirius red staining by polarized light indicating collagen deposition and fibrosis, in addition to the accumulation of YM1 expressing macrophages and increased <italic toggle="yes">Chil3</italic> expression.</p>
              <p>This study focuses on sepsis survivorship, rather than acute infection. In this survival model of pneumosepsis, all animals regardless of infection receive antibiotics with the intention of clearing disseminated infection, rather than producing a state of low-level “chronic” sepsis.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this model, when mice are euthanized before antibiotic therapy, bacteria are cultured from the liver; however, after antibiotic therapy, bacteria are absent. This indicates that persistent inflammation is self-sustaining, rather than a response to chronic infection. Interestingly, although there is a concern in humans for “obese sarcopenia” or loss of lean mass during sepsis, in our model, we found that, by 2 weeks, obese sepsis mice had regained lean mass but not fat mass. The preservation of lean mass in our study contradicts prior sepsis work in a CLP model.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> However, the route of infection—intra-abdominal surgery to cause peritoneal sepsis versus intranasal inoculation to cause pneumosepsis—may account for this difference.</p>
              <p>Early detection and treatment of sepsis have improved outcomes, therefore leading to an increased sepsis survivor population.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Long-term outcomes are complicated by postintensive care syndrome and difficulty in returning to work exacerbated by socioeconomic inequalities.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> There are limited data on long-term liver outcomes after septic insult. Given this signature of liver inflammation after pneumosepsis in mice with pre-existing fatty liver disease, we looked to see if we saw a similar phenotype clinically. Abnormal transaminase levels (eg, ALT) are often the first clinically recognized marker of liver dysfunction in the outpatient setting and frequently trigger an evaluation for NASH in obese patients. As such, we sought to evaluate whether obese patients who survive sepsis are at increased risk of developing new abnormalities in liver transaminases. In our retrospective patient cohort, we showed, as in prior studies, that obesity is associated with improved survival in sepsis—consistent with the “obesity paradox.”<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Despite this survival advantage, obesity was associated with an increased risk of elevated ALT 1–2 years after hospitalization, raising the question of whether survival is marked by the progression of chronic liver disease in this population. Our human sepsis data were retrospective and lacked a confirmation of underlying fatty liver disease or other concomitant liver diseases. Nevertheless, this signal is intriguing, and we aimed to minimize these cofounders using within-person controls.</p>
              <p>Our animal study certainly does have limitations. Although we performed multiple metabolic tests, the challenge and tolerance tests do not simultaneously measure variables in murine models as would be seen in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Our data are largely observational and do not use macrophage-specific knockouts to determine whether there is a reversal of persistent inflammation. Although our study is a survival model, and therefore required the use of antibiotics, the potential for changes to the microbiome and side effects of antibiotics exists. We mitigated this weakness by giving the same antibiotics to both infected and sham animals. Finally, we used a provocative MCD-HFD diet to determine whether there was evidence of a fibrotic signature. However, this diet could have differential metabolic effects given deficiencies in methionine and choline that are not fully understood.</p>
              <p>Future studies on sepsis survivorship, NAFLD, and obesity should address potential therapeutic targets. As our population of patients with obesity increases, it is appropriate that our care and understanding increase. We should be able to offer precision medicine to patients across obesity classes. Not only does our system-wide support need to expand but we also need to understand how obesity modulates admissions for critical illness to provide patients with obesity exceptional clinical care.</p>
