                <p id="Par1">In areas where malaria remains entrenched, novel transmission-reducing interventions are essential for malaria elimination. We report the impact screening-and-treatment of asymptomatic Malawian schoolchildren (n = 364 in the rainy season and 341 in the dry season) had on gametocyte—the parasite stage responsible for human-to-mosquito transmission—carriage. We used concomitant household-based surveys to predict the potential reduction in transmission in the surrounding community. Among 253 students with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections at screening, 179 (71%) had infections containing gametocytes detected by <italic>Pfs</italic>25 qRT-PCR. 84% of gametocyte-containing infections were detected by malaria rapid diagnostic test. While the gametocyte prevalence remained constant in untreated children, treatment with artemether-lumefantrine reduced the gametocyte prevalence (p &lt; 0.0001) from 51.8 to 9.7% and geometric mean gametocyte density (p = 0.008) from 0.52 to 0.05 gametocytes/microliter. In community surveys, 46% of all gametocyte-containing infections were in school-age children, who comprised only 35% of the population. Based on these estimates six weeks after the intervention, the gametocyte burden in the community could be reduced by 25–55% depending on the season and the measure used to characterize gametocyte carriage. Thus, school-based interventions to treat asymptomatic infections may be a high-yield approach to not only improve the health of schoolchildren, but also decrease malaria transmission.</p>

Recently, however, progress has stalled and malaria remains entrenched in some highly endemic areas like Malawi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In these areas, standard interventions (e.g., vector control, universal access to effective testing and treatment, and preventive treatment of high risk populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) may not adequately interrupt human-to-mosquito <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transmission, which is required to move from malaria control toward malaria elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Asymptomatic infections in individuals at lower risk of disease often remain untreated, creating a silent reservoir that perpetuates transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To achieve malaria elimination, interventions must not only prevent and/or treat disease, they must also decrease parasite transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Primary school-age children (6-to-15 year olds) bear an under-appreciated burden of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and they may be an important human infectious reservoir for malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. School-age children frequently have higher prevalence of infection than younger children and adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and their infections more often contain gametocytes, the parasite stage required for human-to-mosquito transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. When bitten, infected school-age children and young children are similarly infectious to mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, school-age children have larger body surface area and less bed net use compared to younger children, increasing the odds of being bitten by mosquitos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Together these factors suggest school-age children are significant sources of human-to-mosquito <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, expanding community-based seasonal malaria chemoprevention from only young children to include school-age children was associated with a 20% decrease in clinical malaria in older community members who did not receive the intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">With rising school enrollments across the malaria-endemic world, existing school infrastructure, such as multi-sectoral programs for school feeding and deworming programs, could be leveraged to deliver malaria interventions to school-age children. Approaches to deliver preventive treatment include “intermittent preventive treatment” where all students regularly receive antimalarial drugs for parasite clearance and transient prophylaxis, and “screening-and-treatment” where all students are screened and only those testing positive receive treatment. Preventive treatment directly decreases infection and gametocyte prevalence, clinical disease, and anemia among students<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but potential indirect effects on the surrounding community have not been fully assessed. While dynamic modeling data suggests the utility of this intervention, only one study has reported the impact of school-based preventive treatment on community-level infection, finding a small but significant decrease in community infection prevalence surrounding intervention schools despite low intervention coverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To evaluate the potential impact of school-based malaria interventions on community transmission, we conducted a school-based screen-and-treat cohort study in the southern region of Malawi concurrent with household-based cross-sectional surveys. Primary school students in four schools were screened for infection using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). If positive, students were treated with artemether-lumefantrine. Subsequent gametocyte carriage in treated and untreated students was assessed by qRT-PCR after one, two, and six weeks. Using the age distribution of gametocyte carriers in the communities surrounding the school, we estimated the potential reduction in prevalence of gametocyte-containing infections and gametocyte density in the community following screening-and-treatment of schoolchildren. If school-based preventive treatment substantially reduces gametocyte prevalence and density in the community, this intervention could both improve the health of schoolchildren and contribute more broadly to malaria elimination.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="Par6">We enrolled 786 students in school-based cohorts: 405 in the rainy season and 381 in the dry season. Complete follow-up data were obtained for 616 students (78% of enrolled students) (Supplemental Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Among the 705 students who attended the baseline visits and underwent screening (n = 364 in the rainy season and 341 in the dry season), the mean age was 10.4 years, 51% were female, and 47% reported sleeping under a net the previous night. The weighted prevalence of RDT-positivity among students at baseline was 42%. An additional 8% of students had infection detected by only PCR (all parasite stages). The distribution of infection prevalence varied by school and season (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Baseline weighted proportion of students with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection detected by PCR (×) and the weighted proportion of students with gametocyte-containing infections detected (black bar) and not detected (grey bar) by rapid diagnostic test in school-based cohorts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_86450_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Determinants of gametocyte burden in school-based cohorts at baseline</title>
                <p id="Par7">Overall, at baseline, 28% (unweighted 179/701, 4 missing baseline gametocyte results) of students had gametocyte-containing infections (8–50% across schools and seasons; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To disentangle predictors of having an infection containing gametocytes from those of simply having any <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection, we evaluated predictors among only students with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. Among the 253 students with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection by PCR at baseline, 70% contained gametocytes detected by Pfs25 qRT-PCR. Infections were more likely to contain gametocytes in the rainy season and in younger students, although the age association was not statistically significant (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par10">As hypothesized, treatment decreased gametocyte prevalence and density among students during follow-up. Comparing gametocyte prevalence among all students from baseline to six weeks after the intervention there was a reduction from 31.1% (95% CI: 27.6, 34.5) to 12.8% (95%: 9.5, 16.1) in the rainy season and from 25.7 (95% CI: 20.9, 30.4) to 8.8% (95%: 5.4, 12.2) in the dry season.

                <title>Predicted reduction in the community gametocyte population following treatment in schools</title>
                <p id="Par14">The screen-and-treat intervention reduced gametocytemia in our school-based cohorts. Furthermore, school-age children contributed substantially to the population of gametocyte-carriers in the surrounding communities; 46% of all gametocyte-containing infections (229/494) and infections containing ≥ 10 gametocytes/µl (47/103) were in school-age children, who comprised only 35% of the population (Supplemental Text S4 and Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). If the screen-and-treat intervention were extended to all school attendees, we estimate it could result in at least six weeks of reductions in the community prevalence of gametocyte-containing infections as large as 26% in the rainy and 34% in the dry season (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b). The total gametocyte burden (sum of gametocyte densities) in the community would be reduced by 33% in the rainy season and 25% in the dry season (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d). The number of infections containing ≥ 10 gametocytes/µl would be reduced by 44% and 55% in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e and f). Reductions occurred in both high and low transmission settings, though the reductions were larger in the high transmission settings (Supplemental Information Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Predicted impact of school-based treatment of RDT positive students on the population of gametocytes in the surrounding community.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par15">In countries like Malawi where current malaria control measures have not yielded substantial reduction in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission, in addition to optimizing current measures, new approaches are needed to target transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Our results support the use of school-based screening-and-treatment as an additional intervention that may not only improve the health of schoolchildren, but also decrease malaria transmission in the community. Almost half of high-density gametocyte-containing infections in the community were in school-age children; school-based treatment nearly eliminated this group’s contribution to transmission for up to six weeks. We also showed that RDTs detected most gametocyte-containing infections that are likely to be transmitted, and that treatment of asymptomatic infections based on RDT results reduced gametocyte prevalence and density. Treating only children with positive RDTs could reduce the community-level gametocyte burden by a third. This reduction in potentially infectious reservoirs could help interrupt persistent malaria transmission.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The high prevalence of gametocyte-containing infections in school-age children in this study is consistent with prior work by our group and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously determine gametocyte burden in schools and surrounding communities to estimate the potential impact of school-based treatment on transmission. In Uganda, school-based intermittent preventive treatment was associated with reduced parasite prevalence in the surrounding community in a large cluster randomized trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although the community-level effect was statistically significant, the magnitude was limited by low intervention coverage. Because the study in Uganda was conducted as a clinical trial, parents had to come to the school to consent for each student, creating logistical barriers. Thus, further estimates of the full potential of this intervention are needed.</p>
              <p id="Par17">While our results lend further support the potential contribution of school-based preventive treatment to transmission reduction, there are limitations to our analyses. We did not use RDTs to detect infections in the communities surrounding schools and had to extrapolate from the relationships of PCR- and RDT-detected infections in the school-based cohort to estimate the number of RDT-positive children who would attend school from the community. However, the distribution of gametocyte prevalence in the school-based and community-based surveys was comparable, supporting the estimate. Furthermore, we used sensitive molecular methods to detect and quantify gametocytes but did not directly measure infectiousness using feeding assays. However, our data still likely represent the relative contribution of different age groups to transmission because we evaluated not only the prevalence of gametocytes but the density and further evaluate high-density gametocyte containing infections, which are the most likely to lead to mosquito infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, prior studies have shown that school-age children and younger children are more infectious to mosquitos than adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and school-age children are more likely than younger children to be bitten by competent vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Lastly, our estimates of the impact of the intervention in the community assume universal coverage in students. In Malawi, school-based deworming programs routinely report coverage of &gt; 90% of school-age children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus high levels of coverage are possible.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Our results likely underestimate the overall effect of school-based treatment for three reasons. First, the impact of clearing gametocyte-containing infections in school-age children is expected to be amplified because competent vectors probably feed more often on school-age children and adults who have larger body surface than younger children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and use bed nets less frequently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Second, in our community-level predictions, we conservatively assumed that gametocyte-containing infections in non-treated age groups would remain constant. However, the decreased pool of infectious school-age children should also lead to fewer new infections and fewer gametocyte-containing infections in younger children and adults. Third, our results are based on a single treatment intervention; the impact of repeated school-based treatment is likely to be even larger. In clinical trials evaluating the impact of school-based malaria preventive treatment on health outcomes, the most successful interventions were repeated either monthly during the high transmission season or quarterly throughout the year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Reinfection rates, seasonal variation in transmission, and duration of the prophylactic effect of the treatment drugs should be used to guide the frequency of intervention required.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Currently, schools are platforms for successful deworming campaigns and feeding programs, and a growing number of interventions target this age group, including vitamin supplementation and adolescent vaccinations. The vast majority of children in sub-Saharan Africa attend school, making schools a logistically feasible platform for targeted interventions. In our setting, 91% (range 82–99% depending on community and season) of school-age children in the community attended school. Schools are particularly important to reaching this age group, since children rarely have routine contact with the health care system after completing childhood immunizations. Adding malaria preventive treatment to other school-based interventions in an integrated school health package should improve the cost:benefit ratio, promote sustainability, and improve health care access to this underserved population.</p>
              <p id="Par20">One concern is that risk of infection and disease could increase once students leave school or if the intervention ceased. A prior study of chemoprophylaxis in younger children demonstrated a transient increase in clinical infection when the intervention was discontinued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, this “rebound effect” was not observed in all chemoprophylaxis trials, nor has it been found after intermittent preventive treatment of infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In highly endemic settings where school-based treatment interventions are most needed, schoolchildren have acquired partial immunity and often have sub-clinical or asymptomatic infections. Because the intervention does not provide continuous chemoprophylaxis, some continued exposure should maintain naturally acquired immunity. Another concern about the widespread use of preventive treatment is the potential for drug resistance. While this concern is important, it should be weighed against the direct student health and potential indirect community benefits when evaluating the approach. Interventions should be designed to limit the potential for drug resistance by choosing drugs for prevention that differ from treatment drugs and proactively monitoring for drug resistance.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Our results join previous studies in supporting the need for implementation studies to measure the indirect impact of school-based treatment on community-level malaria transmission. Although RDTs will fail to detect some low-density infections, such as those observed in the dry season and in our lowest prevalence school, a screen-and-treat approach may substantially reduce the population of gametocytes in the community. Alternatively, providing preventive treatment to all students as intermittent preventive treatment, may have even greater impact. While higher density gametocyte-containing infections are more likely infectious, low density infections contribute to population-level transmission dynamics because they are common and, in our study population, less likely to be detected by RDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Future studies could also consider adding drugs targeting transmission, such as single-low dose primaquine, to enhance impact.</p>
              <p id="Par22">In summary, these results demonstrate the potential for school-based malaria treatment to substantially decrease <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocyte carriage and thus transmission in the surrounding community. In combination with disease- and vector-control interventions, this transmission-focused strategy may be critical to reduce the burden of malaria in areas where this disease has remained entrenched despite current control measures.</p>

                <p id="Par32">To assess the contribution of school-age children to the overall community population of gametocytes, we compared the distribution of all gametocyte-containing infections, infections containing ≥ 10 gametocytes/µl, and geometric mean gametocyte density through chi-squared tests and linear regression: (i) across age-groups, and (ii) between students in the school-cohort and school-age children in the community. This analysis was unweighted because sampling of community surveys was not stratified.</p>

                <p id="Par33">To evaluate the potential indirect impact of school-based preventive treatment on the community, we estimated the expected reduction in the number of gametocyte-containing infections, gametocyte burden, and the number of infections containing ≥ 10 gametocytes/µl in the communities surrounding schools if the screen-and-treat intervention had included all students. Briefly, we first calculated the number of children from the community likely to be in school from the age- and gender-weighted proportion of school-age children that reported attending school in the past four weeks. To estimate the expected reduction in the numbers of gametocyte-containing infections and high-density gametocyte-containing infections in the communities surrounding schools, we used mixture of distributions and conditional probabilities. To estimate the impact of the intervention on the overall gametocyte burden, we first fit overdispersed Poisson models to the school-based cohort with gametocyte density and RDT positivity results at baseline, then predicted the overall gametocyte density changes following the intervention for the hypothetical population of school-going children from the community who would have had a malaria infection and been treated in the screen-and-treat intervention (RDT-positive at baseline) at each follow-up time point. We assumed the population prevalence of gametocyte-containing infections in adults and younger children would remain constant during the intervention period because they would not receive the intervention.</p>
