                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and is refractory to surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) may be harvested from bone marrow (BMSC) and adipose (AMSC) tissue. These cells are a promising avenue of investigation for the delivery of adjuvant therapies. Despite extensive research into putative mechanisms for the tumor tropism of MSCs, there remains no direct comparison of the efficacy and specificity of AMSC and BMSC tropism towards glioma.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Under an IRB-approved protocol, intraoperative human Adipose MSCs (hAMSCs) were established and characterized for cell surface markers of mesenchymal stem cell origin in conjunction with the potential for tri-lineage differentiation (adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic). Validated experimental hAMSCs were compared to commercially derived hBMSCs (Lonza) and hAMSCs (Invitrogen) for growth responsiveness and glioma tropism in response to glioma conditioned media obtained from primary glioma neurosphere cultures.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Commercial and primary culture AMSCs and commercial BMSCs demonstrated no statistically significant difference in their migration towards glioma conditioned media <italic>in vitro</italic>. There was statistically significant difference in the proliferation rate of both commercial AMSCs and BMSCs as compared to primary culture AMSCs, suggesting primary cultures have a slower growth rate than commercially available cell lines.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Adipose- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have similar <italic>in vitro</italic> glioma tropism. Given the well-documented ability to harvest larger numbers of AMSCs under local anesthesia, adipose tissue may provide a more efficient source of MSCs for research and clinical applications, while minimizing patient morbidity during cell harvesting.</p>

                <p>Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and is refractory to surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0058198-McGirt1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This is likely due to the presence of micrometastatic nests of glioma cells at sites distant from the main tumor mass as well as stem cell-like subpopulations, referred to as brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) which are known to be refractory to clinically relevant doses of chemo- and radiation therapy <xref rid="pone.0058198-Bernstein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058198-Sakariassen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The poor prognosis has served as the impetus for developing new therapeutic modalities targeting the micrometastatic nature of this disease.</p>

<xref rid="pone.0058198-Lamfers1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) exhibit selective tropism similar to hNSCs <xref rid="pone.0058198-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058198-Kosztowski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, migrating significant distances to target gliomas <xref rid="pone.0058198-Nakamizo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058198-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. hMSCs can be readily harvested from a broad range of sources, including adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0058198-Zuk1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058198-Zuk2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, bone marrow <xref rid="pone.0058198-Bruder1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, umbilical cord <xref rid="pone.0058198-Covas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058198-Erices1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and dental pulp <xref rid="pone.0058198-Kerkis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058198-RodriguezLozano1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

                <p>Adipose tissue is less invasive and less expensive than bone marrow to obtain <xref rid="pone.0058198-Locke1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058198-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additionally, unmodified hAMSCs remain free of oncogenic transformation for at least eight months, when injected into immunocompromised mice, demonstrating more oncogenic resistance than BM-MSCs <xref rid="pone.0058198-Vilalta1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The possibility of malignant transformation of transplanted MSCs remains a serious, albeit controversial, topic among researchers <xref rid="pone.0058198-Momin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Recent literature indicates that reports of malignant or oncogenic transformation of MSCs may reflect the role of cell culture cross-contamination rather than true transformation <xref rid="pone.0058198-Torsvik1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>

                <p>MSCs from the two sources (derived from bone marrow and adipose) have been compared in models of ischemia <xref rid="pone.0058198-Ikegame1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Notably, cell proliferation rates were used to conclude that AMSC would be more efficacious in clinical application than BMSC, as MSC from adipose tissue had a significantly shorter doubling time <xref rid="pone.0058198-Ikegame1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The use of MSCs for the treatment of gliomas requires a population of cells with a doubling time and proliferation rate rapid enough to allow timely expansion of autologous cells for clinical applications. Harvest efficiency for AMSCs and BMSCs partially depends on donor age <xref rid="pone.0058198-Strem1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>; the BMSC population has been shown to decrease substantially with age, casting further doubt on the use of autologous BMSCs as a therapeutic delivery vehicle in the patient population most often afflicted with gliomas <xref rid="pone.0058198-Kern1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
                <p>No literature exists comparing the efficacy and specificity of AMSC and BMSC glioma tropism. This study presents the first direct comparison of <italic>in vitro</italic> glioma tropism for MSCs from two distinct tissue sources as well as presenting data for the establishment of hAMSCs from intraoperative tissue and the tropism of these early passaged stem cells towards gliomas. The results demonstrate that both AMSC and BMSC have similar glioma tropism, while AMSC may be harvested more easily in greater numbers from patients; this new information may help direct the course of future research into MSCs as a therapeutic delivery vehicle for the treatment of glioblastoma.</p>

                <p>Commercially available hAMSCs were purchased from Invitrogen. Invitrogen harvested each lot of AMSC from a single donor using lipoaspirate, and the cells were expanded for one passage prior to cryopreservation and shipment. Primary hAMSC cultures were established under an approved IRB protocol using excess tissue that would otherwise have been discarded from adipose explants obtained from patients expected to require a graft for repair of cerebrospinal fluid leak during intracranial operations after informed consent was provided. Once obtained, adipose tissue was stored on ice; under sterile cell culture conditions the adipose tissue was separated using manual dissociation and enzymatic digestion with collagenase. The dissociated tissue was centrifuged for 5 minutes, 500 G; the supernatant was decanted, and the vascular-stromal fraction resuspended and plated in six well plates at a density of 5 grams of starting tissue per well</p>
                <p>Both commercial and primary AMSC lines were cultured in MesenproRS media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1× GlutaMax (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and maintained in an incubator at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Briefly, under sterile conditions, surgical glioma explants were separated by manual dissociation and centrifuged after which cell pellets were resuspended in growth medium comprised of DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 growth supplement (Gibco), antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco), FGF (20 µg/ml; Peprotech) and EGF (20 µg/ml; Peprotech) and subsequently plated onto laminin-coated tissue culture flasks at a initial density of 2500 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. The media was changed every three days, and cells were split at 80–90% confluence. The cells were used at early passage (&lt;12 passages) for all experiments. For experiments requiring media without additional growth factors, all cell lines were treated with DMEM: F12 with antibiotics without additional growth factors.</p>

Cells were seeded at densities of 2.1×10<sup>4</sup> (adipocyte), 4.2×10<sup>3</sup> (osteocyte) cells/cm<sup>2</sup>; for chondrocyte differetiation, cells were seeded at 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells in a 15 mL conical tube (Falcon). The differentiation was conducted for a three-week period, in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. Media was changed every 3 days. For adipocyte differentiation, Oil Red O stain was prepared with isopropanol and water, then filtered; differentiated cells were fixed in 4% PFA, rinsed with isopropanol, and stained with Oil Red O for 15 minutes; cells were rinsed with isopropanol, then counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 minutes. For osteocyte differentiation, 2% Alizarin Red S stain was prepared with water, then filtered; differentiated cells were fixed in 4% PFA, rinsed with PBS, then stained with Alizarin Red S for 5 minutes. For chondrocyte differentiation, immunohistochemistry for Collagen II staining was performed using paraffin embedded differentiated cells, a Rabbit polyclonal Collagen II primary antibody (AbCam), and a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Lab).

The matrigel was rehydrated with 500 µL complete media and incubated at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 hours. The media was aspirated, and cells seeded in their respective complete media at a density of 15,000 cells per insert and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following this the complete media was aspirated, and 500 uL of serum free media (DMEM: F12 with antibiotics) was placed in the chambers; the cells were allowed to serum starve for 4 hours. After serum starvation, the following experimental conditions were established in the bottom wells (n = 9): serum free media, 10% FBS, and conditioned media produced using two separate glioma cell lines, as described above Plates were incubated in these conditions at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 hours after which the upper chambers were removed, and the inserts stained with the DiffQuick staining kit and mounted onto glass slides.</p>

These differences were most notable between the commercial BMSC and primary culture AMSC lines, suggesting that primary cultures may not grow as robustly as their commercially obtained counterparts. Further research comparing primary culture BMSCs to primary culture AMSCs may be required prior to clinical usage of MSCs. Our observational data has indicated that while BMSCs and AMSCs proliferate at similar rates in the 24-well growth assay, BMSC demonstrate slower growth characteristics when grown in larger culture flasks and at lower seeding densities (not shown); this finding has been documented elsewhere in the literature <xref rid="pone.0058198-Ikegame1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

                <p>These experiments provide data supporting similar tumor tropism between MSC sources, but there are limitations to the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. Although the matrigel migration assay and coated Boyden chamber invasion assay allow for the assessment of MSC migration and invasion through a synthetic extracellular matrix, it does not recapitulate the full range of substrates MSC must migrate through to travel from the peripheral circulation, traversing the blood brain barrier and brain parenchyma to home to glioma tumor bulk and microsatellite lesions. While the experiments in the present study suggest that AMSC and BMSC demonstrate similar glioma tropism <italic>in vitro</italic>, further studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> models are necessary to begin extrapolating these findings for clinical applications.</p>
                <p>Given the inter-patient variability demonstrated in the primary AMSC lines, further investigation using additional primary AMSC lines and primary BMSC lines would provide information to guide the choice of the most efficient cell source for future clinical applications.</p>

                <title>Implication for future directions</title>
                <p>A significant body of literature exists regarding the potential use of AMSC and BMSC as therapeutic delivery vehicles for patients with glioblastoma <xref rid="pone.0058198-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>

<xref rid="pone.0058198-Menon1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0058198-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The ongoing research into potential therapeutic uses for MSC from a variety of tissue sources is predicated upon an assumption that AMSC and BMSC, given their similar cell surface marker expression profile and differentiation capacity, are equally efficacious at homing to glioma. While limited studies demonstrate similar homing efficacy between these two sources of MSCs in models of intracranial ischemia there have been no previous publications documenting similar glioma tropism <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
                <p>The present study is the first to demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> tumor tropism is similar between AMSC and BMSC. These results support the ongoing research on both AMSC and BMSC as therapeutic delivery vehicles for intracranial glioma. However, as AMSCs may be harvested in greater numbers with less discomfort and morbidity, without differences in proliferation or glioma tropism, we recommend that adipose be considered the primary tissue source for MSCs in continued clinical research.</p>
                <p>It must be noted that the mechanisms underlying this tropism may vary between different MSC sources. Further investigation is necessary to better define these mechanisms, so MSCs from different tissue sources may be effectively manipulated to deliver therapeutic molecules.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Adipose- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells appear to have similar tumor tropism <italic>in vitro</italic>. Given the well-documented ability to harvest larger numbers of AMSCs from adipose tissue obtained under local anesthesia, adipose tissue may prove to be a more efficient source of MSC for research and clinical applications, while minimizing patient morbidity during cell harvesting.</p>
